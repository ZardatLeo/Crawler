SEOUL - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) test-fired a new-type tactical ballistic missile and an improved strategic cruise missile on Wednesday, as the country's top leader called for bolstering up the military capability for self-defence when he guided the event, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Thursday.The test-fire of the new-type tactical ballistic missile, called Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5, was aimed at verifying the hitting accuracy at medium range of 320 km and explosive power of its payload of a 4.5 tonnage super-large conventional warhead, the KCNA said.The DPRK also test-fired a strategic cruise missile whose performance has been highly upgraded for its combat use, according to the report.Kim Jong-un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the DPRK, said the security situation makes it an imperative for the country to bolster up the military capability for self-defence, the KCNA said.The DPRK leader stressed the need to continue to bolster up the nuclear force and have the strongest military technical capability and overwhelming offensive capability in the field of conventional weapons, it added. BEIJING -- At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Malaysia's King Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar will pay a state visit to China from Sept 19 to 22, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced Wednesday.China and Malaysia have a long-standing traditional friendship and are good neighbors and partners in mutual assistance and win-win cooperation, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at Wednesday's press briefing.Lin noted that in March last year, President Xi reached an important consensus with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on building a China-Malaysia community with a shared future, which has provided direction for the development of China-Malaysia relations in the new era.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Malaysia and the Year of China-Malaysia Friendship, and Chinese Premier Li Qiang's successful official visit to Malaysia in June injected new impetus into the development of China-Malaysia relations, he added.Lin said the visit by King Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar is his first visit to a non-ASEAN country since assuming office as the head of state. President Xi will hold a welcome ceremony and a banquet for him. The two heads of state will hold talks and Premier Li will meet with King Sultan Ibrahim.Lin said China is willing to work with Malaysia to take this visit as an opportunity to continue the traditional friendship, deepen strategic alignment, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, further enrich the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Malaysia, and achieve new results in building a China-Malaysia community with a shared future.At an anti-nuclear power rally in Tokyo on Monday, Japanese citizens renewed their calls for an immediate halt to the ocean discharge of contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.The event drew 5,000 participants from across Japan, with the organizer, a local citizens' group, expressing its goal to expand the movement nationwide.Chiyo Oda, co-director of the Citizens' Conference to Condemn Further Pollution of the Ocean, a nonprofit organization based in Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, criticized the ongoing discharge.She noted that, despite widespread opposition and broken promises to the fisheries community, the ocean release continues, with numerous contradictions and injustices remaining unaddressed.Oda added that previous claims, such as the lack of space for additional storage tanks or the lower cost of releasing contaminated water into the sea, have lost credibility. The justification of needing storage for debris removal is also becoming less convincing given the current state of the cleanup efforts."We are repeatedly told that decommissioning is essential for recovery, and for that, the removal of debris is necessary. However, is it really possible to safely remove such dangerous debris? And what will they do after removing it? The ultimate form of the decommissioning process has not been discussed, and it seems like they are proceeding blindly," said Oda.Furthermore, not only tritium but also other radioactive substances, such as strontium and carbon-14, remain in the water after being released. Even the dangers of tritium itself have not been adequately explained, she added.Thirteen and a half years have passed since the triple meltdown at the Fukushima plant, which was triggered by the 9.0-magnitude Great East Japan earthquake and the subsequent tsunami in March 2011. Despite the severe damage, local fishermen still wish to continue their work and persist in opposing the ocean discharge of contaminated water.However, the local fishing industry in Fukushima seems to be overwhelmed by a deep sense of exhaustion. The number of fish markets in the region has dwindled and supermarkets are now selling fish caught in other prefectures.Insufficient explanationOn Aug 24, which marked a year after the ocean discharge began, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visited Iwaki, where he praised the local sashimi as "delicious" and assured the head of the fisheries cooperative that he would take full responsibility for the discharge until the end."I can't help but wonder what he's talking about, imposing a life on the residents where they can't honestly say the fish are good like they could before the accident," said Oda.Following the nuclear disaster, Tokyo Electric Power Company, or TEPCO, the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, and the Japanese government are now deliberately releasing radiation from the incident into the global environment, she added. This process began without sufficient explanation or the public's consent, making it completely unacceptable, Oda said."Our concern is the long-term impact of radiation, and we refuse to allow further contamination of the Earth's environment," she said.At the rally, participants voiced their concerns about the determination of the Japanese government and power companies to restart nuclear reactors, despite operating with aging and deteriorating facilities, and regardless of the potential for large earthquakes.Satoshi Kamata, a writer, said: "When you look at the promises being made in the current Liberal Democratic Party leadership race, they're focused on restarting nuclear power plants … They are completely disregarding the lives of the people, yet these candidates are leading the race."A new Foreign Direct Investment law in the Maldives is expected to enhance investors' confidence and boost the South Asian nation's economy, according to Maldivian officials and experts.It prioritizes transparency and investor protection, local media quoted Maldives' Minister of Economic Development and Trade Mohamed Saeed as saying.Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has ratified the FDI Act, which will bring new benefits to the country, said the ministry's news release on Sept 3. The new law will come into effect three months from the date of ratification and will apply to all foreign companies and individuals intending to undertake business on a long-term basis in the Maldives, according to the government.It noted, "The primary objective of the new law is to promote FDI in the Maldives by creating a more transparent and secure environment for foreign investments."The purpose of the new act is to establish guidelines on which sectors foreign investors can invest in within the Maldives, outline the regulations for granting investment permissions, and ensure protections for investors, said the release.The previous law, enacted in 1979, had been in effect for 45 years and is no longer aligned with the present-day global investment environment and economic situations.The news was encouraging to investors around the world, including in China, with observers saying the new law can provide impetus for infrastructure projects and related investments in the nation.Enhancing confidence"I am convinced that the passage of the new law will enhance the confidence of investors from all over the world to invest and do business in the Maldives, and promote the strong support of relevant financial institutions," Fang Qiuchen, chairman of the China International Contractors Association, told China Daily during the 9th Belt and Road Summit held in Hong Kong from Sept 11-12.According to Fang, more member companies of the China International Contractors Association would like to invest in the Maldives and participate in the infrastructure investment and construction of the nation that has joined the Belt and Road Initiative.Late last month, Maldives leader Muizzu extended his congratulations on the sixth anniversary of the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge.The bridge, inaugurated on Aug 30, 2018, has become a symbol of the close relationship between the two nations, he said in a post on X.Muizzu said the impressive engineering achievement not only connects the Maldivian islands but also represents the enduring partnership and mutual trust between China and the Maldives.Wang Lixin, China's ambassador to the Maldives, noted in a social media post that over the past six years, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge has greatly promoted the social and economic development of the Maldives and brought transformative changes in the lives of its people.The project has vividly shown how the Belt and Road Initiative and friendly cooperation with China benefit the local people. The ambassador added that she looks forward to a more fruitful collaboration in the future.China and the Maldives signed an agreement on the expansion and upgrading of the Velana International Airport, the gateway connecting the Maldives with the world, in 2014. In the past 10 years, the airport has renovated and expanded an apron area of approximately 250,000 square meters.Xinhua contributed to this story.More Asian nations are welcome to join hands with China in preserving regional cultural heritage to promote the inheritance and prosperity of the entire Asian civilization, China's envoy to Malaysia said."China has always been committed to fostering mutual understanding, respect, and trust among nations. It supports the communication between different civilizations," Ambassador Ouyang Yujing said in an interview with China Daily.China and Malaysia have a long history of cultural exchanges and deep-rooted ties, which have resulted in fruitful cooperation in cultural heritage, said Ouyang.For example, the Wangchuan ceremony, jointly nominated by China and Malaysia, was inscribed to the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list in 2020.According to the UNESCO lists, the Wangchuan ceremony and related practices are rooted in folk customs of worshipping. Developed in China's Minnan region between the 15th and 17th centuries, the element is now centered in the coastal areas of Xiamen Bay and Quanzhou Bay, as well as in the Chinese communities in Melaka, Malaysia."This is a successful practice and a typical example of transnational inscription by Asian countries," said Ouyang, adding that China and Malaysia have been maintaining close communication in establishing follow-up protection mechanisms to better protect and promote the cultural heritage.In addition, the two countries agreed to jointly nominate the lion dance, a well-known ancient art form, for UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list after a visit by Chinese Premier Li Qiang to Malaysia in June.As China and Malaysia celebrates the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations, China Daily and newspaper alliance Asia News Network held on Sept 5 a "Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation" in Malaysia. Think tank KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific co-organized the event.Ouyang said he hopes such a platform can encourage deeper exchanges in cultural heritage preservation and inheritance among various countries for shared heritage and shared future."The cultural heritage of the Chinese diaspora in Malaysia has become a bridge of China-Malaysia friendship, playing an indispensable role in cultural exchange and cultural heritage cooperation," said Ouyang, noting that it is also a vivid example of the spread and integration of the Chinese culture along the Maritime Silk Road route."I believe that in the future, the Chinese cultural heritage will continue to play a crucial role in the amicable exchanges and cooperation between China and Malaysia, further enhancing the bilateral relationship," the envoy said.This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The ambassador said China is looking forward to cooperating with different countries on multilateral platforms to jointly promote the preserving of cultural heritage.In a reception held on Sept 13 by the Chinese embassy in Malaysia to celebrate the founding anniversary, Ouyang said China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace, promotes the building of a community of a shared future for mankind, and proposed frameworks such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the global initiatives in development, security and civilization.The Global Civilization Initiative, put forward by Chinese President Xi Jinping in March 2023, advocates mutual respect and mutual learning among different cultures, drawing positive response from the international community.Later in the same year, the Alliance for Cultural Heritage in Asia, an organization initiated by China and joined by over 20 Asian countries, was officially established, marking the only intergovernmental organization for implementing Asian cultural heritage activities.Malaysia has expressed its willingness to become a member, according to Ouyang,"We hope to see more Asian nations engage in the preservation of cultural heritage, fostering deeper people-to-people exchange and jointly promoting the inheritance and prosperity of Asian civilizations," said Ouyang.With its long history, China has 43 elements inscribed on the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list, ranking first in the world.Noting that cultural heritage protection and inheritance requires a systematic approach, Ouyang said China has been continuously making efforts to improve relevant work, including enhancing archaeological research, improving museum access, fostering innovation, strengthening legislation, cultivating professional talent, and engaging the public.A Thai minister called for a positive perception of its trade with China, emphasizing benefits from the two partners' collaboration while urging relative sectors to strengthen laws to guarantee fair competition and safeguard consumers.In a government policy statement on Friday, Commerce Minister Pichai Naripthaphan noted that the new administration should make the best interests of the trade with the major markets — China and the United States in particular.He reaffirmed Thailand's neutral attitude and expectation of drawing more investment and opportunities. "Thailand should take advantage of the changing world and seek its own development," he said.In response to an increasing concern among Thai industry groups over the Chinese goods influx, Pichai expressed his confidence in the revival of the country's economy and called for a rational and positive view on imports from China.Last year, trade volume between China and Thailand reached $126.3 billion, according to the statistics from the Chinese embassy in Thailand. At least 40 percent of agricultural products in Thailand were exported to China annually.For the tourism sector, Thailand had welcomed more than 22 million foreign tourists by Aug 18 this year, bringing an income of nearly 1.06 trillion bahts ($31.8 billion).Sompop Manarungsan, president of the Panyapiwat Institute of Management, said the new government should address the perception that Chinese goods and investments are seen as negative by Thais before it escalates, Bangkok Post reported.He suggested that collaboration between China and Thailand could build a win-win trade model. "If the perception and attitude toward Chinese trade and investment are not addressed promptly, the result would significantly impact Thailand's export and tourism sectors," he said.After taking the role last month, Thailand's new Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra confirmed the plan to deepen the close bond with China on social media platform X, saying that the friendship with China is based on "mutual trust and respect, a common vision toward prosperity and progress, as well as familial ties between our two countries' peoples."Narongsak Putthapornmongkol, president of the Thai-Chinese Chamber of Commerce suggested that Thais should look at its trade with China objectively. "China always opens its door to products from Thailand and welcomes the trade with mutual benefits," he added.Narongsak said China always supports the export of Thai products to the Chinese market through multiple channels and has invited Thai partners to participate in its major trade fairs for years. The Chinese government even provided free booths for Thai enterprises for 20 consecutive years for the China-ASEAN Expo.Chinese enterprises in Thailand also help with employment in the country, he said, adding that the Thai-Chinese Rayong Industrial Zone helped boost Thai exports of $3 billion last year and provided jobs for more than 55,000 Thai people.yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cn An important need of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is how to regain public trust as a record nine candidates debate their prospects for the party's leadership, analysts said.During a public debate at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo on Saturday, the nine candidates shared their views on party reforms, addressing political funding controversies, economic policy and social security, among other topics.At the start of the debate, the candidates held up boards showing the key message they wanted to convey. Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi displayed "Economic Growth," former Economic Security Minister Takayuki Kobayashi showed "A Nation Leading the World," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi wrote "Economic Revival You Can Feel," former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi presented "Political Reform," Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa emphasized "A New Japan Where No One is Left Behind", former Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato displayed "Doubling National Income," Digital Minister Taro Kono emphasized "Achievements in Reform: Passion and Speed," former LDP Secretary-General Shigeru Ishiba presented "Safety and Security for Everyone," and current LDP Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi displayed "Promoting a 'Zero Tax Increase' Policy."During the two-hour debate, candidates first chose opponents to engage in discussion, followed by a Q&A session hosted by the Japan National Press Club.The LDP leadership election was officially announced on Thursday. With a 15-day campaign period, the longest since the current party presidential election rules were adopted in 1995, the goal is to create more opportunities for debate and help the party recover from the recent political funding scandal. Voting and ballot counting will be held on Sept 27, when the new party leader will be selected.Kazuyuki Hamada, a scholar of international political economy and former parliamentary vice-minister for foreign affairs of Japan, noted the candidates are once again rehashing policies that have been discussed for the past 30 years: income doubling, controlling inflation, labor market reform, reducing inequality, supporting strategic industries, regional revitalization, deregulation and peace diplomacy."Japan's outstanding government debt has now surpassed 1,000 trillion yen ($7.1 trillion), signaling a potential fiscal collapse. Without confronting the difficult reforms that involve painful budget cuts, this party leadership election — filled with empty promises — risks accelerating Japan's decline," he said.At the beginning of the debate, Koizumi expressed his commitment to political reform, stressing that the LDP leadership election is fundamentally about whether the party can truly change and who can lead that transformation."We will eliminate the policy activity expenses set for disclosure in 10 years, as they lack transparency.… Without these reforms, the LDP cannot advance politics or regain public trust," he said.Challenging taskRestoring public trust in politics appears to be an extremely challenging task. "On the surface, they pledge to 'reinvent the LDP' or 'put an end to money politics' with slogans that sound appealing, but if they were truly concerned or motivated, why haven't they done anything about it until now?" Hamada asked.The candidates must also clearly outline their vision for Japan's future, particularly in addressing domestic issues, said Noriyuki Kawamura, emeritus professor at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies. The public has two primary expectations: improving the social welfare system and tackling income inequality, Kawamura said.In the past year or two, inflation has become a pressing issue. With more than one-third of Japan's population reliant on pensions, many are struggling to cope with rising prices, Kawamura explained.Additionally, Japan's adherence to neoliberal policies over the past 20 years has created a stark divide between regular and non-regular employees. There are now nearly 20 million non-regular workers in Japan, whose income is less than half that of regular employees and who are treated much less favorably in various ways, he said.jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cn China has successfully safeguarded its territorial sovereignty with the Philippines withdrawing its unlawfully anchored vessel from Xianbin Reef in the South China Sea on Saturday afternoon after five-month illegal halt, and China will take countermeasures if Philippines continues its political provocations, said military experts.The Philippine Coast Guard vessel No 9701 was illegally anchored near the Xianbin Reef since April 17, during which time, China took several necessary measures to warn and control the vessel in accordance with the law, deterring several Philippine attempts to carry supplies to the vessel.Liu Dejun, spokesman of the China Coast Guard, said on Sunday the Philippines' move to illegally strand the vessel severely infringed on China's sovereignty and is a breach of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which was signed by China and the members of ASEAN in 2002, and damaged regional peace and stability.He said the Philippines should stop hyping the issue and infringing on China's sovereignty, and move in the same direction with China to protect the validity of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.He stressed that China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, including Xianbin Reef, and the adjacent waters. The China Coast Guard will take necessary measures to firmly safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.Zhang Junshe, a former researcher at the Naval Research Academy, said that Philippines' attempts to transport supplies to its vessel during its illegal halt at Xianbin Reef under the garb of "humanitarian aid" was a lame excuse."It is the Philippines' largest and modern vessel on active service, which has been put into use in recent years, so 'humanitarian aid' is purely an excuse for its scheme of unlawfully anchoring near the reef and jostling with China for the reef," he said.He added that Philippines tried to test China's resolve in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty by keeping the vehicle stranded for such a long time. It was also hoping for a favorable response from the United States. "But China's mighty deterrence and the slim chance of getting support from the US finally made Philippines leave in dismay."He said the vessel's withdrawal proved that China's policies and measures for coping with South China Sea issues are appropriate. The nation always insists on handling disputes through peaceful means such as negotiations and talks, it respects historical facts and behaves in accordance with international laws.The military expert added that the possibility of Philippines continuing its political provocations in the future by sending another vessel to the South China Sea cannot be ruled out as it has played unreasonable and shameless tricks in the region in recent years."China will definitely take countermeasures to defend national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests," he said.VIENNA - Giant pandas Yang Yang and Yuan Yuan left Austria on Friday and arrived in Chengdu in Southwest China's Sichuan province on Saturday, according to Vienna's Schoenbrunn Zoo.A cargo plane carrying the two pandas, who were among the most popular animal stars at the Schoenbrunn Zoo, departed the Vienna Airport on Friday night. The pandas' favorite snacks, including bamboo, sweet potatoes and carrots, were also on board.When visiting the pandas at the Schoenbrunn Zoo on Wednesday, Chinese Ambassador to Austria Qi Mei thanked the zoo and the Austrian side for taking care of the pandas. She said that the Austrian people will have more opportunities to see the beloved pandas with a new panda conservation agreement between the two countries.In June, Schoenbrunn Zoo and the China Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA) signed an agreement to strengthen their cooperation on giant panda protection and related research. Under the agreement, a new pair of pandas will be sent to the zoo under a 10-year project after Yang Yang and Yuan Yuan's return to China.Stephan Hering-Hagenbeck, director of Schoenbrunn Zoo, said in a statement that visitors to the zoo will not wait too long for the giant pandas as "a young pair of pandas will be moving in the near future."He added that the zoo will renovate its facilities to welcome the new panda pair.SEOUL -- Kim Jong-un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), met with visiting Secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council Sergei Shoigu on Friday, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Saturday.During the talks, they had a wide exchange of views on the issues of steadily deepening the strategic dialogue between the two countries and strengthening cooperation to defend the mutual security interests and on the regional and international situation, and reached a consensus on the issues discussed, the KCNA said.Kim expressed his appreciation for the development of bilateral ties in all fields including politics, economy and culture, and said that the DPRK government would further expand cooperation and collaboration with Russia in the spirit of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the future, it added.The DPRK leader and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the treaty in Pyongyang in June of this year.The Philippine government's dependence on United States' military aid is further straining Philippines' ties with China, keeping relations between the two Asian countries in crisis, a forum in Manila heard Friday.In addition, expanded US access to Philippine military bases has undermined the cause of peace in the South China Sea and continues to threaten Philippine sovereignty, observers said at a hybrid event organized by the Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute, or ACPh, a Manila-based think tank."It seems almost forgotten now that the Philippine Constitution mandates an independent foreign policy for the country. The Constitution states that foreign military bases, troops, or facilities shall not be allowed in the Philippines," Herman Tiu Laurel, ACPh's president said.Laurel said that under the administration of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the US military bases in the Philippines have even "installed banned intermediate missile launchers within the country, which has put the country in the crosshairs of America's enemies".Laurel was alluding to the US' deployment of the Mid-Range Capability missile system at Luzon. The northern Philippine island faces China's Taiwan region — a flashpoint of tense Sino-US relations.Sass Rogando Sasot, a political blogger and scholar of international relations, said the US wants to ensure that Filipinos "will always see China as a threat" and to use the military bases in the Philippines "to prevent the unification of Taiwan with the Chinese mainland"."The United States has to make sure that Philippine and China relations will remain in permanent crisis. It is never on the US agenda for China and the Philippines to pursue a compromise solution," Sasot said.Sasot said the Philippines needs to recalibrate its foreign policy to avoid being a battleground."Just ask yourselves, how many times has the United States initiated any diplomatic talks between the Philippines and China? None," Sasot said.She said the US will never go against Vietnam or Malaysia — both of which have competing claims over the strategic waterway — for the sake of the Philippines."The US will keep on encouraging Filipinos to pursue absolutely unrealistic goals," Sasot said.She said "the only realistic goal" for the Philippines is to pursue joint development with China over the South China Sea."This transforms the relationship of China and the Philippines from (a) relationship in perpetual crisis into a collaborative relationship," Sasot said.Daniel Hugo Santos, ACPh's youth representative, said the South China Sea is "just one part of the relationship" between the Philippines and China, and called for more cultural and trade exchanges between China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.prime@chinadailyapac.com  Implementing political reform and restoring trust of the public in politics are among the most important themes in Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, leadership election, but none of the current candidates have clearly presented policies on these matters, experts said.A record nine candidates launched a 15-day election campaign on Thursday to vie for leadership of the LDP, aiming to succeed Fumio Kishida as the country's next prime minister.Kishida announced on Aug 14 that he will not seek reelection as leader of the ruling party. His cabinet has continued to struggle with low approval ratings.Noriyuki Kawamura, an emeritus professor at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies, said: "Most of the candidates are focusing on creating a superficial sense of renewal, or so-called changing the atmosphere. In other words, they believe that by changing the face of the top leader, the atmosphere will change. But that alone is highly insufficient."He emphasized that whoever becomes the leader of the LDP will also become the prime minister of Japan, and the person must carry out fundamental political reform. Only by doing so can the public's trust in politics be restored."The Kishida cabinet has not conducted any thorough investigation into the issue of politics and money, and the Political Funds Control Act has not undergone any fundamental revision but rather only minor surface-level adjustments," said Kawamura.Despite receiving large sums of taxpayer money through party subsidies, LDP politicians repeatedly held political fundraising events and failed to report the funds they received, said Kazuyuki Hamada, an international political economy scholar and former parliamentary vice-minister for foreign affairs of Japan.The LDP's ability to reform itself and its vision for national reconstruction are being called into question. The people have lost faith in the current political system and nearly half of them do not even bother to vote in elections, said Hamada."This race seems like something orchestrated by the LDP to divert attention from the issue of politics and money … However, the candidates are not addressing the critical issues facing Japan's politics, economy, or defense," said Hamada.Satoshi Tomisaka, professor at the Institute of World Studies at Takushoku University, said that voters can experience a certain sense of renewal by observing a somewhat transparent process of power transfer, but that effect will not last long.Both the renewal of a change in leadership within the LDP and the renewal of a change in the governing party have the same temporary effect of raising expectations. However, this does not stop the overall systemic fatigue, said Tomisaka.In addition to the need to tackle the issue of politics and money, a significant shift in Japan's foreign policy is also required. Stabilizing relations with China will be a key challenge for the country's next leader, according to Kawamura of Nagoya University of Foreign Studies.In recent years, Japan's foreign policy has increasingly aligned with the United States, particularly in its adherence to US efforts to contain China. This approach has contributed to growing instability and tensions in Japan's relationship with China, Kawamura said."To safeguard Japan's national interests and determine its future direction, it is essential to balance its relationships with both China and the US," he said.China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations remain interconnected and interdependent not only in economic and trade ties, but also in regional security, according to ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn.Attending an event in Jakarta marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Friday, Kao mentioned the urgency of maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, saying that ASEAN and Beijing should ensure the area remains a sea of peace, stability, friendship and cooperation."In essence, our security is profoundly interlinked and interconnected and its growing interdependence underscores the importance of ASEAN and China security cooperation," Kao said.ASEAN highly values China's support for ASEAN centrality and unity, which together with interconnected security is a testament to the two sides' shared dedication to fostering a peaceful, stable and secure Asia Pacific, he said."Beyond our extensive economic ties, the cultural ties, and the people exchange between ASEAN and China, the deep historical roots spanning centuries remain a cornerstone of our relations," Kao.Kao noted that the ASEAN-China relationship had evolved significantly from its humble beginnings in 1991 to establishing a comprehensive economic partnership in 2021."The important evolution spans a wide range of sectors," Kao said, noting geopolitical security, trade and investment, cultural exchange and collaboration, technology, education and health, sustainable development and environment, agriculture, and energy.China's Ambassador to ASEAN Hou Yanqi stressed China's path of socialism with Chinese characteristics suits China's national conditions and has made China the world's second-largest economy.Sound relations"China has maintained sound relations and built partnerships with almost all countries in the world. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence proposed by China 70 years ago has become widely recognized principles of international society and continues to play its role in the era," Hou said.She said that China's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind points the way for human society and will lead to peace, security and common development.She noted the two sides are working closely to implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and upgrade the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement.The Permanent Representative of Malaysia to ASEAN Sarah Nava Rani Al Bakri Devadason said her country appreciates China's unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and ASEAN community-building efforts."As the current country coordinator for ASEAN-China relations, Malaysia looks toward working closely with other ASEAN member states and China to further advance the ASEAN-China Comprehensive strategic partnership," Devadason said.Noting this year is the ASEAN-China year of people-to-people exchanges, she said they play "an irreplaceable role in enhancing mutual understanding, friendship and trust, consolidating social foundation and public support, promoting economic and social development, and maintaining regional peace and stability".In addition to China retaining its position as ASEAN's largest trading partner since 2009, Devadason lauded the sociocultural pillars established as foundations for cooperation in other fields.Devadason noted the progress made by both sides on public health, science and technology, education, culture, environment, media, youth, social development, poverty reduction and disaster management.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.In the face of multiple economic challenges, Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra announced the new government's intent to focus on revitalizing the economy and improving people's welfare in her policy statement.In her statement on Sept 12, Paetongtarn stressed that the new government will prioritize economic stimulation and continue the policies of the former government led by former leader Srettha Thavisin, including his "digital wallet" cash handout program.Initiated during last year's general election campaign, the program gave 10,000 baht ($300) to 50 million people aged 16 and older. The policy is now expected to reach vulnerable low-income groups in the coming weeks, while others who are eligible may be paid later this year."It will take some time to build the digital wallet system but people cannot wait, so we need to make adjustments to ensure the plan works first," Paetongtarn said. "Along with other stimulant measures, payment in tranches will help boost the country."Paetongtarn, leader of the Pheu Thai Party, was elected as Thailand's new prime minister in August following the court-ordered removal of Srettha for ethical violations. Under the Thai constitution, the new government is required to announce its policy to parliament before commencing work.Starting on Sept 12, the policy statement was expected two last days but Paetongtarn arranged an urgent trip to the northernmost Chiang Rai Province on Sept 13 due to severe flood damage.As Thailand faces several economic challenges, Paetongtarn said her government will conduct comprehensive debt restructuring targeting home and car loans. Household liability in Thailand is estimated at over 90 percent of its GDP.Amid household debt in Thailand exceeding 16 trillion baht and rising non-performing loans, Paetongtarn said the initiative seeks to assist borrowers both within the formal financial system and outside of it.Also, Paetongtarn noted that the government will maintain measures to widen opportunities for people to access funds for developing communities and jobs.To relieve the concerns of small and medium-sized companies over international trade, Paetongtarn confirmed that the new government will safeguard those enterprises, especially in online platforms.She also noted that her administration will introduce measures to reduce energy prices and public utility fees by revising energy price structures and exploring new energy sources. Paetongtarn said this will also boost tourism and bring new technologies to the agricultural sector.Paetongtarn's Sept 12 statement did not reveal any changes in Thailand's foreign policy. However, just days after taking office the prime minister wrote on social media platform X that she would deepen the close bond between China and Thailand.Paetongtarn wrote that Thailand's friendship with China is based on "mutual trust and respect, a common vision towards prosperity and progress, as well as familial ties between our two countries' peoples".The new prime minister is the youngest daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, one of Thailand's most influential political figures for over two decades and prime minister from 2001 to 2006.At 37, Paetongtarn is the youngest leader in the country's history and its second female prime minister after Yingluck Shinawatra, who was Thai prime minister between 2011 and 2014.Tributes are pouring in for Sitaram Yechury, a veteran leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), who passed away on Sept 12 at the age of 72 after battling a prolonged illness.The veteran Communist leader was in a critical condition and had been receiving respiratory support at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. According to CPI(M) leaders, Yechury was being treated in the hospital's intensive care unit for acute respiratory tract infection. Over the past few days, he had been under treatment by a multidisciplinary team of doctors.Born on Aug 12, 1952, Yechury was serving as the general secretary of the CPI(M) since 2015. He was a member of the Politburo of the CPI(M) since 1992. Earlier, he was a member of India's parliament from 2005 to 2017.China's Ambassador to India Xu Feihong expressed sorrow at Yechury's passing, remembering him as "a staunch Marxist and an old friend of the Chinese"."Deeply saddened by the passing of Comrade Sitaram Yechury, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). My deepest condolences to his family and comrades of CPI(M) during this difficult time. He is a staunch Marxist and an old friend of the Chinese people. His contribution to China-India relations and friendship will be remembered forever," Xu said in a post on the social media platform X.The Polit Bureau of the CPI(M) also paid a heartfelt tribute to their comrade, saying in a statement that he was an outstanding leader of the Left movement and a well-known Marxist ideologue.Yechury's passing marks the end of an era for the CPI(M), where he was known for his unwavering commitment to Marxist principles and his ability to engage in thoughtful dialogue with political adversaries."The untimely demise of Sitaram Yechury at this crucial juncture in our national politics is a big blow for the CPI(M) and a grievous loss for the Left, democratic and secular forces. The Polit Bureau pays respectful homage to our beloved colleague and dips the red banner in his memory. The Polit Bureau calls upon all Party ranks to unite and work harder to advance the struggle for an exploitation-free society," it said."He was a brilliant student who secured a first class in both his undergraduate and post-graduate degrees in economics. He joined the student movement in Jawaharlal Nehru University in 1974 and became a leader of the Students Federation of India. He was the All India President of the Students Federation of India from 1984 to 1986 and played an important role in developing the student organization as an all-India force," the CPI(M) Polit Bureau said in the statement.Indian President Droupadi Murmu, in her condolence message, praised Yechury's "distinct and influential voice". "Though a committed ideologue, he won friends cutting across the party lines. My heartfelt condolences to his family and colleagues," she said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also offered his condolences, noting that Yechury was a "leading light of the Left" and "known for his ability to connect across the political spectrum.""He also made a mark as an effective Parliamentarian. My thoughts are with his family and admirers in this sad hour. Om Shanti," the PM said in a post on X.Political leaders cutting across party lines mourned the passing of the veteran Marxist leader.Sitaram Yechury "was a friend and a protector of the Idea of India, possessing a deep understanding of our country. I will miss the long discussions we used to have. My sincere condolences to his family, friends, and followers in this hour of grief," Indian National Congress, or INC, leader Rahul Gandhi posted on X."I am deeply aggrieved by the demise of Comrade Sitaram Yechury. Sitaram was one of the most outstanding leaders of the Left & Communist movement in contemporary times," Communist Party of India General Secretary D Raja said in a post on X.Yechury started his political career as a student leader with the left-wing Student Federation of India. He was arrested during the Emergency in 1975, when the Congress government led by former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi enforced a widespread restriction on civil freedom.He played an important role during the peak years of federal government's coalition politics when keeping together divergent agendas and ideologies essential to the stability of India's federal government. In 1996, he was a key figure in the formation of a 13-party coalition that ruled India for almost two years.In 2004, Yechury's party won a historic 44 seats in the parliamentary election.The Left parties, which include the CPI(M), subsequently provided "outside" support to help form an INC-led government. "Outside support" was a proposal was put forth by Yechury at that time for endorsing the administration without joining the government or taking up any ministerial positions.Yechury is survived by his wife Seema Chishti, son Danish and daughter Akhila.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.SUVA -- A report released by Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) saying "Chinese state-backed hackers attack Pacific Islands Forum (PIF)" is "purely a made-up story and has no basis at all," the Chinese embassy in Fiji said in a statement on Thursday.China firmly opposes the practice of politicizing cybersecurity issues, accusing other countries without evidence, and wantonly associating cyberattacks with the government of any country, said the statement."We have been resolute in combating all kinds of malign cyber activities in accordance with law, and never encourage, support or condone cyberattacks," said the statement, noting that China is a major victim of cyberattacks.Cybersecurity is a common challenge for all countries and the shared responsibility of all, it said.Committed to the peaceful use of cyberspace, the Chinese government pursues constructive cooperation with the international community in protecting peace and security in cyberspace on the basis of equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit, said the statement."We urge the relevant media outlet to respect facts and abide by principles such as objectivity, impartiality and professionalism, avoid making a presumption of China's guilt without verifying the facts, and stop spreading disinformation that misleads public opinion and smears China," it added.Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning also commented on this report on Thursday, saying that the PIF Secretariat did not associate this cyberattack with China."We have seen similar disinformation many times already, which is politically motivated and aimed at sowing discord between China and countries in the region," Mao said.She stressed that the South Pacific is no one's backyard, adding "We hope parties concerned will fully respect the right of South-Pacific countries to a balanced approach when developing relations with various parties."Chinese-style modernization not only concerns the country's own development but also brings new opportunities for global cooperation, Chinese and Japanese politicians and experts said at a seminar in Osaka, Japan, on Wednesday.Xue Jian, Chinese consul general in Osaka, said China's modernization is deeply interconnected with other countries.As China continues to develop, its path forward will become broader, creating new opportunities for global development and contributing positively to world peace, he said.Xue expressed his hope that Japan will join China on the journey toward modernization, encouraging Tokyo to approach Beijing's progress in the spirit of seeking common ground while respecting differences.Gao Anming, editor-in-chief of China Foreign Languages Publishing Administration, emphasized the importance of fostering a greater understanding of Chinese-style modernization across various sectors in Japan.Last month, the Academy of Contemporary China and World Studies conducted an online survey of the Japanese public to understand their views on "Chinese-style modernization". A total of 1,005 responses were collected.Among those polled, more than 60 percent agreed "developing Chinese-style modernization requires inheriting traditional Chinese culture and values, achieving an organic integration of cultural traditions with modern civilization", said Fan Daqi, vice-president of the academy.In a statement, former Japanese prime minister Yukio Hatoyama said China's current situation differs from Japan's after the collapse of the latter's bubble economy and the former Soviet Union during the Cold War."I firmly believe that Japan and the United States should avoid falling into the trap of value-based diplomacy and should not abandon their policy of engagement with China. At the same time, Japan should take on a strategic role as a bridge between China and the US," Hatoyama said.Hidetoshi Tashiro, chief economist at Japan's Infinity LLC, said the digital sector is the driving force behind China's economy. The rise of this vast digital ecosystem, unlike anything the world has seen before, is now propelling China's economic growth. This growth is fueled by semiconductor design and the development of applications, Tashiro said.China already commands a large share of the global market in many sectors. In industries such as electric vehicles and solar panels, as digitalization continues to expand globally, the demand for products and services that enable this transformation will increase, Tashiro said, adding that China's economy will enter a new phase of growth.Yangchoon Kwak, a professor of the College of Economics at Rikkyo University in Japan, said the primary driver of China's future economic growth will be green industries.China's development goals go beyond mere quantitative growth, aiming to foster industries that contribute to global peace and prosperity, he said."As a leading country, China can reap even greater benefits by concentrating on green industries, tourism, culture and arts. By further enhancing these sectors, I believe China is well-positioned to lead the global economy in the 21st century."Regarding claims that China is going to experience an economic slowdown, Kwak said there is an opportunity to avoid prolonged stagnation that Japan faced by focusing on emerging industries.This, he suggested, could allow China to navigate what is perceived as global recession.Noriyuki Kawamura, an emeritus professor at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies, highlighted two essential factors for China achieving high-quality development.The first is the pursuit of innovation, particularly through advancing cutting-edge technologies. This includes further progress in areas such as artificial intelligence and information technology.The second crucial factor is the continued expansion of economic and trade openness.TOKYO - Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Thursday officially began its leadership race as the two-week campaign started, with a record nine candidates competing to become the new party chief and the country's next prime minister.The contest for the position of LDP president, which carries a three-year term until 2027, kicked off amid declining trust for the party in the wake of its slush fund scandal, with party reform being a key issue in the upcoming election.The candidacies were filed at LDP headquarters on Thursday morning, with the official start of the election announced by party lawmaker Ichiro Aisawa in his capacity as chairman of the LDP's election administration committee.As both houses of parliament are controlled by the LDP and its coalition partner, the Komeito party, the winner is certain to become prime minister early next month when the Diet, Japan's parliament, reconvenes.Upon current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's decision last month to not seek reelection as the LDP president, the election has become the most crowded race in the party's history and one of the most unpredictable, according to local media reports.As the 15-day campaign began on Thursday, the nine presidential candidates would set out on a nationwide campaign, engaging in debates, delivering stump speeches, and lobbying local LDP chapters.Voting and ballot counting are slated to take place on Sept 27, when the candidates will compete for a total of 734 votes, of which 367 are cast by LDP lawmakers and 367 by general party members.A winner must obtain more than half of the votes in order to be elected as the new party chief, however, if no one wins a majority in the first round, a run-off vote between the top two candidates will be held on the same day, when the 47 prefectural chapters get one vote each and the 367 lawmakers vote a second time.Among the veteran candidates and public favorites is former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba, 67, making his fifth and final bid to become LDP chief over his 38-year political career.Another hopeful vying for the LDP presidency is 43-year-old Shinjiro Koizumi, a former environment minister and son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.Two female contenders are Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, 63, and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, 71.Other candidates include former Economic Security Minister Takayuki Kobayashi, 49; Digital Minister Taro Kono, 61; Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, 63; LDP Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi, 68; and former Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, 68.According to an opinion poll conducted by the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun in late August, Koizumi has emerged as the most popular candidate with 23 percent support. Ishiba was second at 18 percent and Takaichi third with 11 percent.Chinese entrepreneurs play an important role in supporting the economy of Malaysia and that of the wider world, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim told a forum in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.In a world marked by complexities and fraught with increasing instability, uncertainties and unpredictability, Chinese entrepreneurs globally can assume a bigger role in safeguarding regional economic cooperation, ensuring the security of crucial supply chains and promoting the global socio-economic development agenda, Anwar said at the 17th World Chinese Entrepreneurs Convention."From Southeast Asia to East Asia, the United States, Canada, Europe and Africa, Chinese entrepreneurs have collaborated closely with others and have laid the foundations for forging deeper and stronger business and economic links across national borders," he said.Held from Monday to Wednesday, the convention focuses on green economy, the semiconductor industry and investment opportunities in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations under the theme "Reimagineering the Future". More than 4,000 corporate leaders, experts and researchers from all over the world joined the event.Noting that China has been Malaysia's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years and a major source of foreign direct investment, Anwar said Malaysia's comprehensive strategic partnership with China will help not only his country but also the region.Wang Huning, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, sent a congratulatory letter to the convention.China will consistently adhere to the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, steadily expand its institutional openness, shorten the negative list for foreign investment, further open its modern service sector, and strive to create a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, rules-based and internationalized, said Wang, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.This will provide a brighter prospect and more cooperation opportunities for global investors including Chinese entrepreneurs, he said.Low Kian Chuan, president of The Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia, the event's organizer, said legendary acumen and the adaptability to innovate in a fast-paced and competitive environment have helped Chinese entrepreneurs thrive and navigate current and future global challenges.Keith Li, president of the China Entrepreneurs Association in Malaysia, said that Chinese companies investing in Malaysia have made a big contribution to the local economy.The two countries' cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative has also generated tangible results, Li added.Thailand's Chulalongkorn University signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Chinese Academy of Sciences Innovation Cooperation Center Bangkok (CASICCB) on Tuesday, aiming to boost deeper collaboration on science and technological innovation between China and Thailand.The MOU covers a wide range of fields, including personnel exchanges, joint research programs on environmental protection, and also application of artificial intelligence.As the oldest and one of the most prestigious universities in Thailand, Chulalongkorn University, founded in 1917, its main mission is to be the center for academic learning and professional excellence.Officials from the university discussed possible internship programs with the center's affiliated companies, giving students from the university opportunities to further develop their knowledge and skills on areas such as green solutions and environmental protection.Moreover, the two partners set out plans to encourage exchanges among scholars and researchers, aiming to enhance both countries' technological influences in the region via joint programs, seminars and research sharing. Scholarships may also be established to attract talents.SEOUL -- The top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) called for greater efforts for economic development and strengthening national defense on the occasion of the country's 76th founding anniversary, state media reported on Tuesday.Kim Jong-un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and president of the State Affairs of the DPRK, made the remarks during a National Day speech on Monday at the headquarters building of the WPK Central Committee in Pyongyang. He outlined a detailed state work plan based on a review of the country's development so far this year, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.The DPRK's top leader said economic growth has trended up this year as the national economic sectors met their production targets "without fail." The country's light industry and urban management are also poised for further improvements, the KCNA said.According to the report, during his speech, Kim also listed favorable agricultural production rates and expected "fairly good harvests" for the rest of the year. He added that the DPRK's military strength was due to critical national defense research and production achievements.In his National Day address, the DPRK's top leader also emphasized the need to boost national productivity by guiding key industries to meet their production targets. He also stressed the importance of the construction sector achieving this year's plan, emphasizing "thoroughly" ensuring construction quality, and reminded the agricultural sector to meet this year's farming goals while preparing for the next, according to KCNA.It said Kim expressed heightened urgency to strengthen national defense capabilities given current security developments on the Korean Peninsula.Noting the U.S.-led military alliances in the region have turned into "a nuclear-based military bloc," posing a grave threat to the military security environment around the DPRK, Kim vowed the country would "take more important measures and make constant efforts to maintain and further boost its military supremacy," the KCNA reported.Strong power means "a genuine peace and an absolute guarantee for the development of our state," Kim was quoted by the KCNA as saying.Saudi Arabia is targeting more Chinese participation in its maritime tourism ambitions, a visiting industry insider said as Riyadh reiterated its goal to become a global tourism powerhouse."Come in and capitalize on those opportunities", Tareq Alshaghrood, general manager of investment planning and attraction at the Saudi Ministry of Tourism, told Chinese investors, developers, and operators.Alshaghrood, in an interview with China Daily on the sidelines of the International Hospitality Investment Forum Asia in Hong Kong from Sept 9 to 11, said one of their aims is to broaden the potential of the Saudi yacht market and attract more traffic to the Red Sea through water activities like snorkeling, cruises, beach outing and diving.On Sept 5, the Saudi Red Sea Authority (SRSA) issued the country's first-ever regulations for Saudi yachts.According to the Saudi Press Agency, these include regulating their activities, outlining requirements and conditions, and overseeing the issuance of tourism and leisure licenses and permits.Alshaghrood said the aim is to ensure environmental protection, sustainability, and adherence to all safety requirements as part of the SRSA's key role in developing a sustainable coastal tourism sector."The Saudi Red Sea Authority is one of the initiatives we launched following the release of our strategy because the water activities, in general … there were obstacles and issues," said Alshaghrood.One hurdle, he said, was the yacht maritime regulation having multiple steps just to bring the yacht to the Red Sea. This is solved by the SRSA handling all of the regulations and acting as a single interface for users."It will make things easier for people that decide to bring their yachts to the kingdom and enjoy the beautiful Red Sea. And it extends beyond that," said Alshaghrood.BISHKEK - A center dedicated to blindness prevention cooperation with China has officially opened in a hospital in southern Kyrgyzstan.According to a report from the Chinese embassy on Monday, the China-Kyrgyzstan Cooperation Center of Blindness Prevention is designed to enhance ophthalmological collaboration between China and Kyrgyzstan. It will foster mutual visits, training, and academic exchanges among eye care professionals, and its establishment is expected to benefit Kyrgyz patients suffering from eye diseases. The center is located inside the Interstate United Clinical Hospital in Osh."This project is a new beginning of our cooperation in the field of health," Kyrgyz Health Minister Alymkadyr Beishenaliev said during the center's opening ceremony. The minister hoped that the friendly relations between Kyrgyzstan and China would continue.As part of this collaboration, the "Brightness Journey of LifeLine Express" project was also launched in Osh on Sept 2. Under this initiative, doctors from the People's Hospital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are performing free cataract removal surgeries. Chinese doctors will provide these life-changing operations to 200 patients while also conducting training sessions for local medical professionals.Chinese Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, Du Dewen, highlighted the center's significance, calling it another major milestone in the two countries' healthcare collaboration. She expressed her hope that the center would fulfill its purpose and contribute further to building a community with a shared future between China and Kyrgyzstan.One of the patients, Laimzhan Kaderkulov, who had been struggling with deteriorating vision in his left eye, successfully underwent surgery on Sept 6. "I can see clearly now. I am deeply grateful to the Chinese doctors," Kaderkulov said.This initiative aligns with China's commitment -- announced at the 22nd meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in September 2022 -- to provide 2,000 free cataract surgeries to patients in SCO countries over the next three years.TOKYO - Natsuo Yamaguchi, leader of Japan's ruling coalition party Komeito, said on Tuesday that he would step down and not run in the party's upcoming leadership election.Stressing a smooth generational shift within the party, Yamaguchi made the announcement at a press conference during the day, marking the first leadership change for Komeito in 15 years.The 72-year-old politician will step down upon the expiration of his eighth term on Sept 28 following his decision not to run for the leadership election scheduled on Sept 18.Yamaguchi, who has led Komeito since 2009, has played a significant role in the coalition government with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, notably contributing to the party's successes in national elections.With Yamaguchi's departure, Secretary-General Keiichi Ishii, 66, is expected to run unopposed and likely to be formally approved as the new leader at the party's convention on Sept 28.HANOI -- Super typhoon Yagi and its subsequent floods and landslides in Vietnam's northern region have claimed at least 82 lives as of Tuesday early afternoon while 64 others remain missing, said the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.The mountainous province of Cao Bang has suffered the most with 19 deaths and 36 missing.Fatalities also include 19 from Lao Cai province, 22 from Yen Bai province, nine from Quang Ninh province.Other deaths were from capital Hanoi, Hai Phong city, Hoa Binh, Hai Duong, Lang Son, Tuyen Quang, Ha Giang and Lai Chau provinces.According to the ministry's Department of Dyke Management and Disaster Prevention and Control, typhoon Yagi with powerful winds damaged 48,337 houses, mostly in the coastal province of Quang Ninh and Hai Phong city.The northern region is expected to see rising water levels on Tuesday and Wednesday, with several rivers reaching the highest alert level, said the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. CANBERRA -- Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a plan to ban children from using social media.The prime minister stated on Tuesday that the government will introduce legislation in 2024 to enforce a minimum age for access to social media and other relevant digital platforms."We know social media is causing social harm, and it is taking kids away from real friends and real experiences," he said in a statement.He said that the legislation would be informed by engagement with the states and territories, but his preference is to set the minimum age at 16 years.According to a poll conducted by state broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in August, 61 percent of Australians supported restricting social media access to those younger than 17.At the same time, Peter Malinauskas, the premier of South Australia, commissioned former federal judge Robert French to explore legal pathways to ban children younger than 14 from social media.The prime minister said that the federal government would consider Robert French's review when drafting the legislation.With the Mid-Autumn Festival drawing near, the mooncake market is bustling in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Belonging to the Mekong River system, Tonle Sap is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia.The women masters of the tourist boats, usually middle-aged, hail from the three villages of the Kampong Phluk commune in Siem Reap's Prasat Bakong district, a popular natural tourism area on the Tonle Sap Lake.Each morning during the rainy season, they gather under the shade of large trees, waiting to paddle tourists in their small wooden boats, which are equipped with mats, life vests, umbrellas and cushions.These women, who are not just oarsmen, but skilled tour guides, are pleased to share their depth of knowledge about the local environment and the traditions of their communities, all maintaining a warm and friendly demeanor, according to the district administration.Sang Kong, head of the Kampong Phluk Natural Tourism Community, explained that the group was established in 2013 and currently includes 1,058 boats.Every family in the three villages — Tnaot Kambot, Dey Krahom, and Kork Kdol — owns a boat."We established this group to empower women by giving them occupations similar to men. We want to enhance the dignity of women, who were traditionally seen as confined to household tasks."Now, we have women who can take charge in the same way as their husbands and brothers," Kong said.To ensure fairness, the boats are assigned to tourists on a rotational basis according to the number of daily visitors, meaning that not every craft is deployed every day.Five boats belonging to the village's most elderly women are prioritized however, allowing their children or grandchildren to earn them an income without needing to follow the rotational system.This occupation is only seasonal, lasting from August until late November or early December.Tourists can enjoy experiences such as observing the local way of life — including stilt houses, fish and prahoc production — or rowing through the flooded forest to admire the scenery, do some bird watching or watch the sun set over the lake.Khut Vanda, a member of the Meanchey Kampong Phluk Tourist Transportation Community, explained that the service costs $6, with each boat typically carrying two passengers on a 30-minute ride.Each day, around 70 of the boats are in operation.Additionally, around 800 larger boats crewed by men are available, at a cost of $20 for a two-and-a-half-hour trip."While men generally go fishing or operate larger boats, women have free time at home, so the community organized the option of paddling tourist boats, helping them to generate additional income to support their families," said Vanda."Most of the women are middle-aged or elderly. They have free time and grew up on the lake, so they are confident at handling their small vessels."Many tourists are particularly interested in the women skippers, after seeing posts on social media," he added.According to Department of Information of Siem Reap Province, over 220,000 tourists visited Kampong Phluk in the first seven months of 2024.THE PHNOM PENH POST, CAMBODIAEditor's note: In this weekly feature China Daily gives voice to Asia and its people. The stories presented come mainly from the Asia News Network (ANN), of which China Daily is among its 20 leading titles.Kuala Lumpur should establish a comprehensive underground mapping system for city infrastructure and utilities, if it does not already have one, said Malaysian experts and politicians.President of the Institution of Engineers Malaysia, or IEM, Jeffrey Chiang Choong Luin, said the recent sinkhole that swallowed 48-year-old Indian tourist Vijaya Lakshmi in Jalan Masjid India, or "Little India", in the city center of Kuala Lumpur, highlighted urgent need for action.Heavy rain that deluged Kuala Lumpur in the past weeks meant there was a lot of fast-moving water in the sinkhole and sewer, complicating the search efforts.The Malaysian authorities said a portion of a large concrete sewer at the bottom of the sinkhole was broken, and the victim might have fallen in and been swept away.A second sinkhole appeared in Jalan Masjid India on Aug 28, about 50 meters from the first one on Aug 23, causing further alarm."This is an opportunity to leverage technology and map out the city's intricate underground infrastructure. With the right resources and determination, future disasters can be prevented," Chiang told The Star."Furthermore, IEM is willing to assist in this crucial endeavor, should the DBKL (Kuala Lumpur City Hall) be open to collaboration," he added.IEM, which has over 50,000 members, had earlier issued a statement regarding the Jalan Masjid India sinkhole incident, urging DBKL to conduct a thorough investigation and offering its expertise to support the effort.The organization called for more stringent safety checks by qualified professional engineers in the design, construction and supervision of critical infrastructure to prevent a recurrence.In 2020, The Star reported that then Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan had ordered an interagency study with utility companies to map out the extensive network of underground cables and pipes in the capital city, prompted by the increasing number of sinkholes.Nor Hisham said that while Kuala Lumpur had developed a basic framework for addressing such issues, significant challenges remained due to aging infrastructure, some of which were over 50 years old.In a recent interview, Nor Hisham stressed the need for comprehensive underground mapping for Kuala Lumpur as well as good collaboration between agencies.During his tenure, Nor Hisham said he had difficulties obtaining accurate underground mapping due to lack of cooperation from utility companies."One of the significant challenges we faced was getting utility companies on board with the mapping process.China and Singapore have reiterated their commitment to enhancing ties in a volatile world, agreeing to plan for the next phase of key high-level exchanges, as Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan wrapped up a two-day visit to Beijing on Monday.It was Balakrishnan's first visit to China under Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's administration. Wong was sworn in as prime minister of the Southeast Asian country in May.Cai Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met separately with Balakrishnan on Monday.In a bilateral meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Wang called on the two countries to fully utilize dialogue mechanisms at various levels and in multiple areas, tap the potential of the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, and reach new heights of cooperation in the digital economy, green development and marine energy.Faced with a turbulent international situation, China and Singapore, as two forces for stability, need to strengthen strategic coordination and communication, Wang said.Singapore was one of the first countries to participate in and deeply integrate with China's reform and opening-up process, and the two countries have fostered close cooperation and mutual learning, he said, adding that this has contributed to the modernization and development of both countries.China is willing to enhance its alignment with Singapore's development strategies, and seeks to implement the newly established partnership envisioned by both leaders, he said.China and Singapore upgraded bilateral ties to an all-around, high-quality, future-oriented partnership in April 2023.Singapore is China's fifth-largest trading partner among member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and China has been Singapore's largest trading partner for 11 consecutive years.In 2023, bilateral trade reached $108.39 billion, according to the Foreign Ministry.Noting that China and Singapore enjoy mutual visa exemption, Wang urged the two countries to expand people-to-people exchanges, strengthen cooperation on training programs and communication between think tanks, media and youth organizations, and promote local-level exchanges.Balakrishnan said the upgrading of the relationship last year reflected "the unique, the longstanding and the very close ties between our two countries".He expressed the hope that the 35th anniversary of diplomatic relations next year will be taken as an opportunity to prepare for more high-level visits and expand cooperation.Singapore firmly supports China and ASEAN expanding two-way investment, and is ready to work with China to uphold the multilateral trade system centered on the World Trade Organization and to ensure the smooth functioning of global industrial and supply chains.Both sides agreed to strengthen coordination to ensure positive outcomes at the upcoming Leaders' Meetings on East Asia Cooperation.Voices for new tourism trends and a bright future ahead are echoing at the International Hospitality Investment Forum (IHIF) Asia, held on Monday through Sept 11, gathering top players in family offices, global hotel brands and leading developers.Speakers from across the world are analyzing empowering tourism destinations, exploring plans for growth potential, investment, innovating and even future leadership of sustainability on the opening day.Rizki Handayani, deputy minister of Industry and Investment of the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy of Indonesia, said meetings, incentives, conferencing, and exhibitions, or MICE, were getting "bigger and bigger" in the ten-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN."As a government, we produced some regulations inviting investors to come. We have special economic zones," Handayani told a session, noting that Indonesia is keen on more MICE event investment in Indonesia for infrastructure and attracting international organizers.Indonesia has started developing maritime tourism, which has prompted them to collaborate with other sectors such as fisheries, while open to sustainable tourism solutions. "When we talk about investments not only in the hotel industry but now it's also related to smart tourism, digital tourism, and also to focus on creative industries like the film industry," said Handayani.Sultan Al-Shehri, chief of investment at Aseer Development Authority in Saudi Arabia said giga projects — such as the country's NEOM project, Diriyah, and the Aseer region — were helping reshape the Saudi tourism sector. "All these are opening doors. It will create more momentum (for) businesses to look into Saudi".He said the Saudi government has moved to make doing business easier, noting that the pandemic had also forced Saudis to explore the country more. This benefited the country after it welcomed more than 100 million tourists in 2023.Al-Shehri said they have a dedicated fund for SMEs and have incubators and accelerators to help entrepreneurs in the sector.Taimur Baig, managing director and chief economist of group research at DBS Bank Limited, said they were bullish about Southeast Asia, with China being a major player in the global landscape.Despite "all the pushback on tech", the world is "seeing Chinese brands innovate" and that the Chinese entrepreneurs were bearing fruit amid global challenges, he said, noting that US domestic politics is "forcing the Chinese to become self-sufficient".Given the way the world is shaping up, Asia is the region that stands to substantially benefit from "all this globalization, policy, tech restrictions", Baig said. "It's happening as we speak."Liz Ortiguera, managing director of Asia Pacific and senior advisor to the CEO at the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), said the region's governments had underestimated the reach of travel and tourism."We really are a mega sector ... if you include our colleagues in West Asia, we're even larger," she said during the "Catalysts of Tourism and Hospitality Investment: Infrastructure, Regulation, Policy, and Mega Projects" panel."Today, we encompass 10 percent of the jobs in the Asia Pacific and that's going to grow in the next years to 12.5 percent. Not only is travel and tourism going to create 100 million jobs in the next 10 years, 64 million of them are in this region," she added.Ortiguera said a high concentration of those jobs will be in ASEAN with several trends proving this prospect.Post-pandemic tourism has seen a growing interest in food, heritage, spiritual, and wellness travel, sectors catalyzed by COVID-19, she said, and the last two years were about "switching everything back on" and getting everyone back to work."Even though there's slow recovery in this region, we're going to be the engine for growth in the future," Ortiguera said.She added that governments have focused on sustainability and communities and urged investors to consider communities in their investments.HANOI -- As of Monday noon, Typhoon Yagi and consequent landslides and floods have left 59 people dead and missing in Vietnam's northern region, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said.The natural disasters also injured 247 people, including 157 in Quang Ninh province and 40 in Hai Phong City; sank 25 unmanned vessels, mostly fishing boats; damaged over 113,000 hectares of rice and more than 22,000 hectares of other crops; damaged or swept away 1,500 aquaculture cages; killed 190,000 fowls; and uprooted or damaged nearly 121,700 trees, the ministry said.A steel bridge in Vietnam's northern Phu Tho province collapsed on Monday morning, causing 10 automobiles and two motorbikes to fall into the Red River and leaving 13 people missing, Vietnam News Agency reported.It also reported that 21 people in Cao Bang province were killed and missing by landslides, and 15 people in Lao Cai province faced the same fate.Typhoon Yagi was the strongest storm to hit Vietnam's northern region in the past 30 years, according to the ministry.The two-day China Festival 2024, which concluded in Tokyo on Sunday, garnered widespread attention and participation from people from all walks of life in both China and Japan.The festival has been held at Yoyogi Park for many years. It has become an important platform for Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and cooperation, said Wu Jianghao, Chinese ambassador to Japan.The goal of the festival is to showcase the rich, traditional Chinese culture and the country's achievements, allowing more people to experience and understand contemporary China up close."We are willing to work with various sectors in both countries to use the China Festival as a bridge, encouraging more people — especially the younger generation — to participate in friendly exchanges between China and Japan," Wu said at the opening ceremony of the festival in Tokyo on Saturday."We hope that through the two-day China Festival, more Japanese friends will get to know and understand China, and have the opportunity to visit and experience the real and vibrant China," he added.This year's China Festival marks the largest in its history, featuring a record-breaking nearly 150 booths. In addition, the organizers successfully brought in a greater number of artists from China for stage performances than ever before, according to Yoichiro Aoyagi, a member of Japan's House of Representatives and secretary-general of the festival's executive committee.Japan and China, as neighbors, have now become leading nations in Asia and globally, particularly in the economic sphere, said Aoyagi."Although there are indeed many challenges between Japan and China, I believe it is crucial to maintain dialogue and exchanges between the people of both countries. We play a key role in ensuring these connections continue," he said.Former Japanese prime minister Yasuo Fukuda emphasized that mutual exchanges are crucial for sustaining good relationships between the two countries. It's not only about government-level interactions but also about fostering people-to-people exchanges.He further highlighted that the festival aims to showcase the very best of China, with the hope of encouraging more people from Japan to visit and experience the country firsthand.The China Festival plays a key role in promoting such exchanges. Since its launch in 2017, it has consistently attracted large crowds. Masahiro Komura, the parliamentary vice-minister for foreign affairs, said the event offers the Japanese people a valuable chance to experience Chinese culture, including tourism, the economy, regional interactions, and authentic Chinese cuisine.Voicing hope"I strongly hope that the exchange between the people of both countries will deepen and that mutual interest and understanding will grow even further," he said.At this year's China Festival, 147 Chinese companies participated, nearly three times the number from last year, according to Wang Jiaxun, president of China Enterprises Association in Japan. "Currently, relations between China and Japan are not particularly ideal. Many Japanese citizens hold certain prejudices against China and Chinese people, while Chinese citizens also have some misunderstandings about Japan. These issues arise in part due to distorted media coverage. Events like the China Festival help foster mutual trust and understanding, promoting friendly exchanges between the two countries," said Wang.People from Chinese provinces such as Shandong and Hunan also attended the China Festival 2024 to highlight regional interactions.During the opening ceremony of the Shandong cultural exhibition at the festival, Cheng Shoutian, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee, noted that Shandong and Japan are separated by just a sea and have strong cooperation across various fields.He expressed his hope that the event would provide an opportunity for more people to discover Shandong, establish a closer platform for cultural exchange, and enhance cultural interaction and collaboration between China and Japan.Many people showed up at the festival. Hiroko Wada, a 38-year-old Tokyo resident, stopped by a booth offering panda-related souvenirs."I'm here for a panda-themed event because I'm such a big fan of pandas," said Wada, who also loves Chinese cuisine.Nene, a 22-year-old woman who preferred not to share her last name, gave the festival's game of playing ping-pong with a slipper a try."I'm really interested in Chinese culture. I studied Chinese at university, but speaking it is quite challenging," she said."I'm also excited to enjoy some authentic Chinese flavors. There are so many delicious-looking foods here, and I can't wait to stroll around, eating and drinking along the way," she added.Younger people are gradually taking over Japan-China relations, said Toshiyasu Ogawa, a participant of the Japan-China Friendship Association."Five years ago, people in their 70s and 80s were mostly the ones running the festival. But now, it's people in their 30s and 40s, and I feel hopeful that they are passing Japan-China relations on to the next generation," Ogawa said.As sustainable development is facing headwinds, officials from home and abroad said China-proposed Global Development Initiative has injected new energies to the common progress and high-quality development.They made the comments on Saturday at a dialogue meeting on the GDI held in Xiamen, southeast China's Fujian province, attended by nearly 150 representatives from over 30 countries and international organizations.Stephen Kargbo, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization representative to China, said the role of the GDI in promoting global development has become increasingly important as it emphasizes innovation, inclusiveness and sustainable development.The GDI has helped mobilize resources, establish cooperation mechanisms and advance practical cooperation, he said, adding that great progress made in fields including poverty reduction, food security and health demonstrated China's determination and ability to contribute to global well-being and common prosperity.At the just-concluded 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, China announced it would work with Africa to take 10 partnership actions, and would implement 1,000 "small and beautiful" livelihood projects, which were lauded by Kargbo to be positive and help set a model of GDI cooperation."China has always been the UNIDO's key cooperative partner," Kargbo said, adding that the organization would continue to actively respond to the dialogue mechanisms of GDI.Wilmot Reeves, deputy minister of Ministry of Commerce and Industry in Liberia, hailed the GDI for "providing a powerful framework for countries to achieve the goals of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development" and "contributing to creating a more equitable and prosperous world for all."As a raft of elements such as the pandemic and geopolitical tensions challenged the accomplishment of the sustainable development goals, Reeves highlighted countries needed to strengthen collaboration and establish global partnership."Under the framework of the GDI, we can make efforts to utilize our collective resources and expertise to drive structural and economic transformation, and to achieve more inclusive development," he said.He also called for greater investments in key areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure to promote the GDI to achieve substantial progress."The GDI is a great initiative and charts a new blueprint for global development. It not only attaches importance to development, but also emphasizes balanced and harmonious development among all countries," said Cameroon Minister of Commerce Magloire Mbarga Atangana, calling on more countries to join in the GDI to facilitate the achievement of SDGs."Many countries have joined in the GDI, which fully shows its value," said Serbia's Minister of Economy Adrijana Mesarovic.She hailed cooperation between the two countries based on mutual benefit and respect."Today, Serbia is the main window for promoting Chinese expertise and knowledge in Europe. At the same time, my country is also a main platform for Chinese companies to make inroads into markets such as Europe."Zhao Fengtao, vice-chairman of China International Development Cooperation Agency, called on upgrading development cooperation by accelerating development of new quality productive forces.China last year established a global project pool and raised a special development fund to support the GDI. According to Zhao, to date, the pool includes over 1,000 projects, with projects in progress account for over ＄4 billion.All parties need better cooperation and coordination to combat global climate change in a concrete way, and in this regard, China could help, given its technological advancement and innovative experiences, according to Indonesia International Sustainability Forum.Indonesian President Joko Widodo, senior officials from Indonesia and neighboring countries as well as top executives and philanthropists admitted that achieving net-zero emission not only require collaboration between developed and developing countries, but also between societal groups within a country.Opening the two-day forum on Sep 5, Widodo specially called on developed nations to make investment in developing countries, open widely to them their research and technology, and provide them with quick funding.The IISF was jointly held by the Coordinating Ministry for Investment and Maritime Affairs and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Themed "Towards Sustainable and Inclusive Growth" and meant for the public to learn more about sustainability agendas, the gathering was attended by about 8,000 people from more than 50 countries in Asia and beyond. This number was three times bigger than that in the first IIAS last year. Divided into 10 sessions, around 50 keynote speakers and panelists, including three from China, spoke at the Jakarta Convention Center.Widodo stressed in his speech that issues of climate change can never be fully settled if countries use economic approaches only and do calculations merely for their own interests."Settling those issues needs collaborative approaches and human approach," the president said.Also attending the forum were Luhut B. Pandjaitan, Indonesia's coordinating minister for investment and maritime affairs; Retno L.P. Marsudi, foreign minister; Dato Sri Haji Fadillah bin Haji Yusof, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and minister of energy transition and water transformation; Tan See Leng, Singapore's minister for manpower and second minister for trade and industry; Teo Chee Hean, Singapore's senior minister and coordinating minister for national security; and Peter Thomson, UN secretary-general's special envoy for the ocean.Keynote speakers and panelists elaborated particularly crucial things relevant to carbon emission reduction such as alternative energy resources, technologies and innovation, funding, human capital and public education, and electrical vehicle enterprising.Pandjaitan said each nation has a different starting point as they have different capacity and capabilities. "Therefore, this forum reminds us that collaboration, let me repeat, collaboration is essential to our sustainability agenda," the minister said in his keynote speech.Tan said Indonesia-Singapore provides a good example of cooperation, saying that Indonesia's revenue from its low-carbon electricity that would be exported to the island city-state could also be used to catalyze more renewable energy projects in Southeast Asia's largest economy, thus helping accelerate its decarbonization journey.Singapore had earlier announced that it would work toward imports of four gigawatts of low-carbon electricity from its neighbors by 2030, and now the country is seeking to increase that amount to around six gigawatts by 2035.Tan said that over the past five years five companies, namely Pacific Medco Solar Energy, Adaro Solar International, EDP Renewables APAC, Vanda RE, and Keppel Energy had been conducting marine surveys and feasibility studies so as to determine the commercial and technical conditions and subsequently make their projects a success. Indonesia's solar power exports to Singapore was expected to start by 2028, Indonesian officials said.Dato Sri Haji Fadillah bin Haji Yusof reminded forum participants that every action by respective country in Southeast Asia can significantly impact their neighbors. As such, regional collaboration and cooperation in the area of energy transition is crucial, he said. He pointed to ASEAN plan of action for energy cooperation.ASEAN countries signed ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation 2016-25, which is one of the series of policy documents first signed in 2019 and which aims to promote multilateral energy cooperation and integration to attain the goals of the ASEAN Economic Community.Dato said that solar energy is a cornerstone of Malaysia's renewable energy strategy that would drive the adoption of solar technology for large-scale solar farms to rooftop installations. Hydro power remains a pivotal component of Malaysia's renewable energy scheme, he said.Ma Jun, an environmentalist and director of the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs in Beijing, explained about China's ambitious development of human capital for pollution monitoring in the country."Ten years ago China tapped into the online monitoring technology to become the first in the world to require major air polluters to report to the public of their automatic monitoring every hour and tap into the data," Ma told forum participants.Speaking on the sidelines of the forum discussions, Ma explained how solar power and wind power are now being developed in a very rapid speed in China and that they are put into different use such as desalination of sea water on coastal regions, particularly in the northern part of China."So China is no longer just a manufacturer, it's also an innovator," Ma said.Under China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, ASEAN countries, including archipelagic Indonesia, could make use of China's technologies for producing potable water, Ma said.Han Han, founder and president at China Blue Sustainability Institute, shared in the forum panel discussion about what China can learn from neighboring countries like Indonesia, namely the very local community-based management network for the solution of local problems.Jamal Karsli, a German politician from the Green Party, said women could give critical support to carbon emission reduction efforts as women are found everywhere, at home and in various other places where energy is used for cooking and washing and for doing other kinds of work."In Germany people talk a lot about environment, the Green Party also talks a lot about it. But, the industries do other things," he told this correspondent on the sidelines of the sustainability forum.Shinta Widjaja Kamdani, vice-chairwoman of KADIN, said that green financing remains a global challenge as developing countries, except China, need to invest around $2.4 trillion annually, combined, for climate action up to 2030.Of the $2.4 trillion, 40 percent is designated to come from external parties, and so far very small portion of the external sources has been received by developing countries, Kamdani told this correspondent.She said the IISF can help strengthen Indonesia's strategic positioning as a global hub for collaboration that aims to accelerate sustainability growth.The two-day gathering saw the signing of 14 Memoranda of Understanding on critical areas such as cross-border electricity interconnection, carbon capture, acceleration of energy transition, and green transition in transportation.The third IISF is scheduled to be held in Bali next year.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.The two-day China Festival 2024 has drawn attention at Yoyogi Park in Tokyo on Sept 7-8, garnering widespread participation from people of all walks of life in both China and Japan.Video by Jiang Xueqing in Tokyo / China DailyState Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co sent two engineers to Malaysia to support the construction of a seawater desalination plant in late August. The facility, expected to be operational by mid-September, will produce up to 500 tons of fresh water daily, which can meet the demand of around 3,000 residents.The project comes in response to Malaysia's increasing demand for freshwater, driven by rapid urbanization and industrial growth. Coastal regions have been particularly impacted, facing significant water shortages.State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co's desalination system uses energy-efficient technology to convert seawater into fresh water. The method is highly effective in filtering out impurities while significantly reducing energy consumption compared to traditional techniques."Our project team spent over 20 days customizing the desalination plan for this project. The equipment offers high resource conversion efficiency and low operating costs," Zhu Jiaqi, project engineer and director of the seawater desalination division at Jiangsu Fenghai New Energy Seawater Desalination Development Co Ltd said.The technology has already been successfully applied in similar projects in Brazil and Oman.Moving forward, State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co plans to deepen its cooperation with Malaysian companies, focusing on renewable energy and water management initiatives aimed at fostering sustainable development.Zhu Sidi contributed to this story.BEIJING -- Minister for Foreign Affairs of Singapore Vivian Balakrishnan will visit China from September 8 to 9, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning announced on Saturday.Balakrishnan's visit is at the invitation of Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and foreign minister, Mao added.Asian culture experts called for regional cooperation to protect cultural heritage and uncover the contemporary values of ancient civilizations at a panel discussion on "Transnational Cooperation for the Conservation of Shared Cultural Landscapes in Asia", highlighting shared cultural connections across the region.The discussions were held on the sidelines of the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Selangor, Malaysia, on Thursday.Speaking about the rich connotations of cultural heritage and its multifaceted value, Chin Yew Sin, president of the Oriental Culture Research Centre, said that "comprehending our cultural heritage can give us a sense of personal identity", while economically, a rich cultural heritage can drive development, such as through the promotion of cultural tourism.Given the benefits and seeing cultural heritage as a shared asset of Asian nations, he said countries should work together to promote conservation. He suggested regular meetings to share experience, and called on more advanced countries to support less developed nations in the region with financial and technical aid.Ivan Henares, chairperson of the Southeast Asian Cultural Heritage Alliance, agreed, saying there should be a "comparative analysis of heritage laws and policies in Southeast Asia". Such an initiative can help facilitate information sharing and promote best practices in the region.He highlighted the region's untapped potential for shared cultural heritage, noting that 10 of the 11 nations in Southeast Asia have coastlines, offering an opportunity to explore their common maritime heritage.Laurence Loh, director of Think City — a Malaysia-based organization known for its urban regeneration programs — broadened the discussion of the cultural connections of the significant Chinese diaspora between the port city of Quanzhou in China's Fujian province, which was the starting point of the ancient Maritime Silk Road, and Malaysia's Melaka and George Town, Penang — two historical places along the Strait of Malacca.Loh, also a former president of Badan Warisan Malaysia (The Heritage of Malaysia Trust), cited the restoration of the Clan Jetties in Malaysia as an example of transnational heritage protection.Su Junjie, director of the Yunnan Provincial Research Base of Intangible Cultural Heritage, delved into cultural landscapes within the scope of cultural heritage which, in his view, demonstrate the interaction between nature and people.Su said the Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site last year, is an example of this harmonious coexistence.Daisy Wang Yiyou, deputy director of Hong Kong Palace Museum, shared the insights from her field, emphasizing the importance of training the next generation of experts in response to the current talent gap. Noting that transnational collaboration is "imperative", she called for closer collaboration among various sectors. "Only when we can work together, we can really make real and impactful changes."Zhang Zhenguang, managing director of China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd — a subsidiary of the China State Construction Engineering Corporation — emphasized that preserving cultural heritage is also a shared responsibility of the corporate sector, especially for a Fortune Global 500 company like the CSCEC, which has offices in more than 130 countries and regions.Editor's note: On Thursday, China Daily and newspaper alliance Asia News Network held the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Selangor, Malaysia. Co-organized by think tank KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific, nearly 200 government officials, senior executives, cultural leaders, researchers and media representatives from across Asia attended the forum, which was themed "Shared Heritage, Shared Future", to discuss ways to jointly preserve cultural heritage and drive sustainable development in the region. Here are highlights of the forum.Asian media 'an important force' in promoting civilizationChina Daily's publisher and editor-in-chief said Asian media members are an important force for promoting the progress of civilization in the region, and serve as a crucial bridge in cultural exchanges.Qu Yingpu made the remarks at the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Malaysia on Thursday.Qu called on the industry to take responsibility for protecting cultural heritage and to collaborate in bringing down barriers for better collective progress."We should encourage more people to become involved in the protection of our cultural heritage. We should make our own contribution to the brilliance of Asian civilization in a new era," Qu said.In his welcoming speech to the forum, Qu highlighted the importance of appreciating and preserving cultural and natural treasures in Asia, a cradle of human civilization that is home to three ancient civilizations — Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and China — and has been the birthplace of numerous vital achievements in human history.He called for the revitalization and transformation of Asian civilization to infuse it with new vitality and radiance, saying the only way to preserve culture is to "bring it to life", enabling it to enter daily lives.The media leader suggested using new technology such as virtual reality, the metaverse, and artificial intelligence, to transcend the barriers of time and space, allowing people to "experience cultural heritage up close without the risk of harming it". Qu also proposed promoting research and interpretation of the traditional cultures of Asian countries."As Asian media, we should work together to break down cultural barriers, and promote the common progress of Asian civilizations through exchange and mutual learning," he said.In 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the Global Civilization Initiative, guiding cultural exchanges, mutual learning, and the prosperous development of Asian civilizations. Citing Xi's key remarks, Qu emphasized that the best way to protect a civilization is to "create a modern civilization", and called on the media industry to continue expanding international cultural and humanitarian exchange and cooperation, to provide new support to regional progress.This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Asia News Network. As the leader of China Daily, a member of the media alliance, Qu urged his fellow colleagues to strive for a more equitable international communication order and to become "supervisors of Asia's heritage protection"."We should help establish a new Asian model for the development of cultural heritage and for international cooperation. In this way, we can jointly contribute to fostering a community with a shared future for both Asia and all humanity," Qu said."Let's harness the fundamental, profound, and enduring cultural forces of Asia for the development of the region and the building of an Asian community with a shared future," he added.The Tourism Authority of Thailand and the Association of Thai Travel Agents led 60 local tourism enterprises to promote what the country has to offer at a road show in Beijing on Tuesday.The event showcased new products and services from Thai travel agencies, scenic spots and transport providers to boost bilateral tourism. More than 500 people, including Chinese travel players, joined the event.Experts from the United States, China, Japan, and South Korea mostly agreed that a new Cold War in Northeast Asia can be avoided, though there is still a risk, as they discussed peace-building at a conference in Tokyo.The Asia Peace Conference 2024, which closed in Tokyo on Wednesday, aimed to explore what kind of efforts are needed to ensure peace in Northeast Asia, said Yasushi Kudo, president of the Genron NPO, the host organization of the conference.Daniel Russel, former US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said people should be careful about labeling the current situation as a "Cold War" because it "creates a mindset that could drive policies and would actually escalate risk."There is a substantial difference nowadays from the Soviet-era Cold War situation, given the economic interdependence and the lack of Cold War-style proxy wars. In addition, international and regional frameworks have been established, and technology has really changed the game, Russel noted."Projecting the Cold War framework onto today's geopolitical landscape clouds our vision and can create self-fulfilling prophecies. So I think it's a mistake to think in Cold War terms but at the same time, there's a lot we can learn from the Cold War," he said."Adaptation of Cold War policies, not replication of Cold War policies, can be helpful in preventing a new Cold War and promoting a more secure and cooperative region," he said.Ouyang Wei, deputy director of the Academic Committee at Grandview Institution, said: "Following the old way of thinking is not good for the current situation. We should avoid using the definition to shape the new Cold War. It's very dangerous to shape two blocs (that) confront (each other) in Northeast Asia."Ouyang warned that maybe someone wants to use this concept to shape the two blocs, which is not good for the world.A new Cold War would make most countries suffer, said Fan Gaoyue, retired senior colonel and former chief specialist at the PLA Academy of Military Science.Globalization stressedHe emphasized that globalization has made all countries dependent on each other economically to a certain extent. Their economic interests are mutually interconnected, which makes it difficult for them to pick sides."A new Cold War in Northeast Asia can be avoided, though there is such a risk," said Fan, who is now a guest professor at Sichuan University.To avert a new Cold War, Northeast Asian countries should try what they can to defuse hostilities through dialogue and military exchanges, deepen mutual understanding and trust-building through people-to-people exchanges, and prevent crises and friction from escalating into conflicts and confrontation, through communication channels, he said.Jia Qingguo, a professor and former dean of the School of International Studies at Peking University, said that the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union had three characteristics — ideological competition, military confrontation on a global basis, and economic separation."Judging by those three criteria, we are not quite at a Cold War yet," said Jia.However, he noted that people on both sides are thinking in terms of a worst-case scenario approach. Each side plans for the worst possible situations and takes measures in that direction, and that prompts the other side to do the same."We need to change this worst-case scenario approach. We need to give the benefit of the doubt to the other side," said Jia.Besides, other countries also have a role in shaping the relationship. Probably, they need to make sure that they do not take sides to fuel the conflict, he said.Christopher Johnstone, senior adviser and Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the reality of economic interdependence is such that the US is not going to decouple from China, and the US has no ability to ask its close allies to decouple, either."We are not in a new Cold War. It's not a bipolar system," said Johnstone."Where we are really heading for is a world of competing coalitions and shifting coalitions of countries that align on issues and move apart on other issues," said Johnstone.Asian countries should make full use of the power of culture and civilization to support regional unity, openness and progress for a shared future, a forum in Malaysia heard on Thursday."We should help establish a new Asian model for the development of cultural heritage and for international cooperation," said Qu Yingpu, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily, at the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Selangor, Malaysia."In this way, regional countries can jointly contribute to fostering a community with a shared future for both Asia and all humanity," Qu said.Themed "Shared Heritage, Shared Future", the forum was jointly organized by China Daily, newspaper alliance Asia News Network and the KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific, a think tank."We have to work together to promote the exchange and mutual learning of Asian cultural heritage," said Christina Yeo Ken Yin, undersecretary of the International Relations Division in Culture at Malaysia's Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture.In addition to cooperation programs in cultural heritage with countries such as China, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore and Indonesia, Yeo said Malaysia is preparing to join the Alliance for Cultural Heritage in Asia — an intergovernmental platform initiated by China to promote regional cooperation in preserving regional cultural heritage."Civilization exchanges and mutual learning form an important drive for human progress and global peace and development," said Chang Shan, counselor of the cultural affairs department of the Chinese embassy in Malaysia.With Asia being an important cradle of human civilization, China and countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are linked by mountains and rivers and share historical bonds, which have led to close people-to-people exchanges, said Chang.Noting that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Malaysia, Chang said the two countries' cooperation in cultural heritage protection will continue to play an important role in bilateral exchanges.Mahfuz Anam, chairman of Asia News Network and editor and publisher of Bangladesh's The Daily Star, said cultures speak louder than languages and act as effective communicators among different people.He urged people, particularly journalists, to devote more energy to learning and comprehending different cultural heritages to reduce misunderstandings in a world with more conflicts and uncertainties.Ronald Gan, president of Persatuan Peranakan Baba Nyonya Malaysia, said the Baba and Nyonya community is a typical example of cultural exchanges between China and Malaysia, with blended elements in cuisine, attire and architecture."We are, after all, the descendants of the wise Chinese who migrated to Nanyang with the values of inclusiveness and mutual benefit," said Gan, who has been organizing a Wangchuan ceremony in Melaka.The ceremony, jointly nominated by China and Malaysia, was added to the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list in 2020.As climate change can affect cultural heritage sites, Michael Yeoh, president of KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific, said countries in the region should enhance public, private and people partnerships to protect the environment.Upholding the 5Ps — planet, people, prosperity, partnership and peace — will ensure a more sustainable future, said Yeoh.A panel discussion on "Transnational Cooperation for the Conservation of Shared Cultural Landscapes in Asia" was also held during the forum, with experts from across the region exchanging views on future strategies for preserving cultural heritage and landscapes.VLADIVOSTOK -- Malaysia is seeking to join BRICS for strengthening cooperation with its member countries and promoting fair global trade, said Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Thursday.Joining BRICS will boost Malaysia's trade relations and help prevent financial monopolies worldwide, Anwar said at the 9th Eastern Economic Forum, held in Russia's Far East city of Vladivostok from Tuesday to Friday.BRICS, an acronym for an emerging-market cooperative mechanism, originally included Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. In January, BRICS expanded its membership with the inclusion of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Ethiopia.Indonesia's drive to diversify export markets is reaching a new path with participants in this week's second Indonesia-Africa Forum seeking closer economic partnerships between Southeast Asia's largest economy and the world's second-most populous continent. Energy, food and healthcare sectors were the main sectors discussed in the three-day forum from Sep 2-4. Leading officials from Indonesia and 54 African countries as well as from Timor Leste convened in the archipelago's most popular tourist island of Bali to discuss ways of strengthening economic diplomacy between Indonesia and African countries and boosting trade and investment.Among them were Liberia President Joseph Nyuma Boakai, Rwanda President Paul Kagame, Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo, and Zimbabwe Vice-President Kembo Dugish Campbell Muleya Mohadi. Joining them was Timor Leste Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao, along with ministers, entrepreneurs and scholars. The meeting went together with High Level Forum on Multi Stakeholders Partnership. Indonesian President Joko Widodo opened the forum on Monday in the presence of president-elect Prabowo Subianto, who will be sworn in next month.Widodo said that the Indonesia-Africa Forum and the High Level Forum on Multi Stakeholders Partnership were held to materialize the commitment made by participating countries in the 1955 Asia-Africa Conference in Bandung, Indonesia. Indonesia-Africa partnership had so far seen a rapid increase in trade volumes between the two sides. The amount is six times bigger than that reached in 2018, the first Indonesia-Africa Forum, also held in Bali, the president said. "Even, Indonesia-Africa Forum this year has recorded businesses agreements that reached a total of $3.5 billion," Widodo said. The amount is six times bigger than that reached in 2018, when the first Indonesia-Africa Forum was held, also in Bali. Along with Eastern Europe, Central Asia, South Asia and Latin America, Africa has so far been a "non-traditional" market of resource-rich Indonesia, whose export products have mainly gone to ASEAN, China and the United States. Indonesia exports to Africa palm oil, paper, noddle, biscuit, pharmaceutical products, beauty items. Tire, coffee and furniture are among the country's potential products for the African market. Africa exports to Indonesia cows, soybean, crude oil and iron, and potential products for the Indonesian market include critical minerals such as cobalt, lithium, and steel. In the Bali forum, Indonesia's state oil and gas firm PT Pertamina, which has had operations in the upstream sector in Algeria, Gabon, Nigeria, Angola, Namibia and Tanzania over the past decade, reached new agreements for its operation expansion in Africa. Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, executive director of Next Policy and an international economics lecturer at the University of Indonesia, said Africa is a potential market for Indonesian products, though presently, Africa is not as big as the Asian market.Historically, Indonesia and Africa have been close to each other, which could support Indonesia opening manufacturing operations in the continent so as to reduce logistic costs, Hastiadi told this correspondent. He said Indonesia could also follow the routes taken by China, which has had an even stronger presence in Africa. "We just go where China goes. This is because the countries where China does business are the places that have larger economic potentials," Hastiadi said. Richard Mshomba, a Tanzania-born economics professor at La Salle University in Philadelphia in the United States, said via email that the Indonesia-Africa Forum in Bali can create diplomatic space for increased economic cooperation. He said in general Indonesia is an insignificant trade partner for Africa, although that varies by country. For the 2018-22 period, Sub-Saharan African exports to Indonesia were only 1.2 percent of its total exports. Its imports from Indonesia were even less, only 09 percent of its total imports.Yet, "Indonesia should not approach African countries as if it was trying to compete with China," said Mshomba, who provided a systematic study of Africa in relation to the World Trade Organization.Indonesia can try to find opportunities to invest in mining and energy as it has done in Kenya and Tanzania, and can also take advantage of African countries having easier access to the EU and the US markets, Mshomba said. Muhammad Habib Abiyan Dzakwan, a researcher at the department of international relations of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, said Indonesia should not ostensibly believe that meetings like the Indonesia-Africa Forum can achieve two goals on one strike: generating concrete economic benefits and excercising leadership on the global stage. "Adequate resources and public awareness are crucial. Unfortunately, African countries are yet to enjoy these privileges from Indonesia. Not only did the country spend less than 1 percent of its gross domestic product on foreign policy, but limited amount is also concentrated on management support and presence at various multilateral platforms," Dzakwan said in an op-ed article in the Sept 4, 2024, issue of The Jakarta Post. Building more footprints in Africa matters as long as rational economic calculation and analyses precede and complement the decision, not merely diplomatic interests, Dzakwan told this correspondent.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily. The King of Thailand has endorsed new cabinet lead by the Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. There are 12 new faces in her collation government, according to the Royal Gazette announcement on Wednesday.The 35-member list includes: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Phumtham Wechayachai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport Suriya Juengrungruangkit, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Anutin Charnvirakul.Pichai Naripthaphan, former energy minister and also adviser of Paetongtarn's Pheu Thai Party, is now the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. The party remains dominant force in the new cabinet, retaining Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa.The ruling Pheu Thai Party leader Paetongtarn was elected as the 31st Prime Minister of Thailand last month.

More than 500 participants from over 90 official delegations have confirmed their attendance at the 11th Beijing Xiangshan Forum scheduled for Sept 12-14 as of Tuesday, according to the organizer of the forum.Wu Jiangang, a member of the preparatory work committee for the forum, said during a press briefing on Wednesday that more than 30 defense ministers and chiefs of defense force are among the participants.More than 200 experts from home and abroad will also participate in the event, Wu noted.Themed "Promoting Peace for a Shared Future," this year's forum consists of four plenary sessions, eight special sessions, as well as other feature activities.While continuing to provide an equal dialogue and collective voice platform for developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, the forum further expands the participation of developed countries such as European countries and the United States, as well as major emerging countries, Wu said, noting that this concerted effort will facilitate both South-South cooperation and North-South cooperation.Initiated in 2006, the Beijing Xiangshan Forum is a high-level security and defense forum in Asia-Pacific with significant international influence.BANGKOK --Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has endorsed members of a new cabinet under the leadership of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, a royal command said on Wednesday.According to the official Royal Gazette, the king appointed 35 cabinet ministers as selected by Paetongtarn, including six deputy prime ministers and other ministers, after her endorsement as the new prime minister of the Southeast Asian country last month.The ruling Pheu Thai Party holds the largest share of 17 seats in the cabinet, with most of the appointees being existing ministers and deputy ministers who served under the previous Srettha Thavisin administration.Pichai Chunhavajira retains his post as finance minister and Maris Sangiampongsa as foreign minister, while Phumtham Wechayachai is named defense minister and has been replaced as commerce minister by Pichai Naripthaphan.Core partners in the Pheu Thai-led coalition, including the Bhumjaithai Party and Ruam Thai Sang Chart Party, command the remaining 19 portfolios.The new cabinet is scheduled to take an oath of allegiance before the king on Friday, paving the way for its policy statement address to the parliament before officially assuming office.Paetongtarn said earlier that the new cabinet should continue the unfinished initiatives from Srettha's administration, including her party's flagship policy, the digital wallet cash handout scheme, which will move forward with some adjustments.The 38-year-old Pheu Thai Party leader and the daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was elected Thailand's youngest and second female premier after winning a parliamentary vote in August.Her appointment came after the sudden dismissal of Srettha by the constitutional court for breaching ethical standards under the country's constitution when appointing a cabinet minister earlier this year.Japanese citizens are voicing strong objections to the government's attempts to amend the nation's pacifist Constitution and rapidly expand the military.Naohiko Hasegawa, a Tokyo-based lawyer, said he is absolutely against the revision of Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan, which renounces war.However, recently, due to the significant influence of the media, there are many who intentionally use the situation with China or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a basis to advocate for constitutional revision, he said.Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, agreed on Monday it will seek to specifically mention the name of the Self-Defense Forces in a revised Constitution. This decision outlines key proposed changes as the party prepares for an upcoming election to select its new leader. The LDP plans to retain the wording of the war-renouncing Article 9 while adding a new section to explain the Self-Defense Forces, Kyodo News reported.The LDP's panel on constitutional reform made this decision, which will have a bearing on whoever wins the party leadership election on Sept 27. In this race, candidates are expected to clearly state their positions on revising the Constitution, which has been in force since 1947, according to the Japanese news agency.Government officials claim that changes in the security environment necessitate military expansions, but what they are proposing, including acquiring the capability to strike enemy bases, is extremely dangerous from the perspective of neighboring countries, said Kohei Aoyama, 33, a member of the Democratic Youth League of Japan.Currently, many conservative members of the LDP, particularly those in the faction formerly led by late prime minister Shinzo Abe, support such an amendment, and winning their support is crucial for any candidate aspiring for the LDP presidency. As a result, candidates tend to emphasize the importance of amending Article 9 to gain the support of these members.However, the public is not particularly keen on this issue, instead urging the government to focus on economic measures, said Shigeaki Koga, a policy analyst and a former official of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.Low approvalOpinion polls conducted by Japanese public broadcaster NHK and major newspapers show that the percentage of Japanese citizens who favor revision of the Constitution is low."The public is more concerned about improving their livelihoods and social security than about constitutional revision. Yet, the LDP is pushing for this because of its inherently conservative nature, which is a big problem," said Takakage Fujita, president of the Alliance to Stop the Impermissible Acts of Slush Fund and Tax Evasion by the LDP.Igarashi Hajime, a 66-year-old resident of Tokyo, is firmly against revising the Constitution."Thanks to Article 9, Japan has managed to stay out of wars alongside the United States, even when pressured by the US," Hajime said during a rally in Tokyo last week to oppose the proposed constitutional changes.Toshihiro Inoue, a special committee member of the Japan Congress against A- and H-Bombs, believes that Japan cannot truly protect its people by strengthening its military power. Instead, he argues that Japan should focus on fostering friendship and goodwill with its neighboring countries, guided by the principles of the Constitution.Keisuke Okamoto, a 49-year-old resident of Yokohama, stressed that war could lead to the extinction of humanity. Speaking on behalf of many who oppose Japan's massive military buildup, he said, "The Constitution was founded on the principle of peace, shaped by reflections on the postwar era, and we are committed to protecting it."jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cn The International Atomic Energy Agency's senior communication official hailed the "significant progress" China has made in nuclear development and said the IAEA looks forward to deepening the collaboration with the country, as this year marks the 40th anniversary of China's accession to the international organization.Sophie Boutaud de la Combe, director of the Office of Public Information and Communication of IAEA, made the remarks during an international media tour organized by the China Atomic Energy Authority's news office, themed Atoms for Better Home.She said the IAEA highly values its partnership with CAEA and looks forward to deepening its collaboration and exploring future directions together."Through its extraordinary economic growth and advance in knowledge, technology and expertise, China has become a key supporter of the agency financially, politically and through our collaborations," said the official.China's decades of experience is a solid foundation to build on for the agency and for its other member states, she said, while expressing thanks for Chinese experts who share their knowledge to other countries through IAEA capacity-building programs.The multifaceted cooperation between the IAEA and China covers areas such as nuclear energy, nuclear safety and security, nuclear technology applications and nonproliferation, said the official, adding that many important projects promoted by CAEA and IAEA have achieved remarkable results."These achievements are not only crucial for China's development, but also have far-reaching impact on the peaceful use of nuclear energy globally," the IAEA official added."Therefore, I look forward to learning more about China's progress in those areas and exploring how to leverage and promote those successful experiences through the partnership with CAEA news center," she said.During her visit, the IAEA official also toured the mainland's first nuclear power site at Qinshan in East China, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in South China and two IAEA collaboration centers at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Sun Yat-sen University respectively, to learn about China's innovations in the nuclear sector.Sophie Boutaud de la Combe said China's nuclear development is avoiding "tons of carbon emissions and air pollution" and is creating a conducive environmental- and biodiversity-friendly source of energy for the people of China and also for industrial development.In addition, she praised China's efforts to help other countries build their own nuclear industry safely and achieve their own energy goals."This is showing the world that it's possible to build nuclear power plants quickly and with integrated cost," said the official.CANBERRA -- Australians have been told to prepare for possible cyclones, storms, fires and flooding during the upcoming high-risk weather season.Minister for Emergency Management Jenny McAllister on Tuesday said the federal government is preparing for the worst-case disaster scenarios as the nation heads into warmer months of the year.She said Australian people need to be thinking about a range of perils in the high-risk weather season, which traditionally runs from October through April."Fire is one of them. But we are, of course, thinking about the cyclone season and we're thinking about the risk of severe storms like some of the rain and flooding that we've seen in recent days," McAllister told Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio."All of the information in front of us tells us we can expect severe weather to become more frequent and more intense in the coming years as a consequence of a changing climate. And so we do need to start preparing ourselves for that reality as a community."Over 100,000 properties lost electricity as destructive winds and heavy rainfall hit Australia's southeast in late August and early September.Two people were killed by falling trees, one each in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, and towns were evacuated in the island state of Tasmania due to major flooding.McAllister said on Tuesday that staff members from the National Situation Room -- the government's crisis management and coordination facility -- are currently engaged in briefings with authorities from states and territories in advance of the high-risk season.The federal government will convene the second annual National Preparedness Summit in Canberra on Sept 18 to 19 where government, industry and non-government organizations will be brought together to better prepare for disaster scenarios.NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday embarked on a three-day official visit to Brunei Darussalam and Singapore.Modi's Brunei visit will be the first-ever bilateral visit by an Indian premier. The visit also assumed significance as this year marked the 40 years of diplomatic ties between the two nations.In the second leg of his visit, Modi will travel to Singapore which is scheduled for Sept 4 to 5.In his departure statement, Modi said the focus of his twin visits would be on further deepening India's ties with the two countries."India-Brunei Darussalam diplomatic ties complete 40 glorious years. I look forward to meeting His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah," he stated in a written statement."In Singapore, I will hold talks with President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong. We are eager to further cement ties in key sectors," he further added.The constructive collaboration among major powers to end World War II serves as a valuable example for building a stable and secure world in the future, a Russian scholar said on Sept 2."Despite significant political and ideological differences, the allied powers managed to cooperate effectively in the face of a global threat," said Alexander Lukin, professor of international relations at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow. The allied powers refer primarily to the United States, the United Kingdom, China and the Soviet Union.Lukin was speaking at a roundtable discussion "The End of World War II in the Pacific: Its Consequences and Legacy" held by the Russian Consulate General in Hong Kong.Noting this is the first time that the consulate held a discussion on the topic of WWII, Russia's Consul-General in Hong Kong, Anatoly Kargapolov, said with the growing influence of Asia, the interest in the history of the Far East, including WWII, has received more attention in Russia."This year marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Russia and China," said Kargapolov. "Many experts in Russia continue to research the topic of the Soviet Manchurian Strategic Offensive operation which resulted in the liberation of Northeast China from the Japanese."Kargapolov said the consulate also specifically chose the topic after seeing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region paying greater attention to this period in history, with the Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence to be opened on Sept 4."It is found that Russian emigrants and Soviet sailors had been killed or injured during an attack on (Hong Kong) by the Japanese military in 1941," said Kargapolov.After reviewing the Soviet Union's involvement in China, Japan and the Korean Peninsula during WWII, Lukin, the Russian scholar, said the Soviet Union played a pivotal role in ending WWII in the Pacific and shaping the postwar landscape of the region.Michael Share, visiting professor at the Department of History at the Hong Kong Baptist University, said that compared to the discussions on WWII in Europe, its study in Asia has been neglected.Share pointed out that WWII caused huge damage and destruction across Asia with millions dead and infrastructure destroyed.Hung Wing Lok, lecturer of social science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, said WWII affected Hong Kong in different dimensions, ranging from its population and housing to industries and human capital."The population in Hong Kong was about 1.6 million at that time and about 600,000 were coming from the Chinese mainland during the war," said Hung.In December 1941, Japan attacked Hong Kong and conquered the city, then a British colony, after just 18 days, to usher in "three years and eight months of darkness" under Japanese occupation.Edmund Sheng Li, distinguished professor of Shandong University's Qingdao campus, said the Soviet Union played a decisive role both in the war theaters in Europe and in the Far East during WWII, while also contributing to the founding of the Communist Party of China, the formation of the anti-Japanese National United Front in China and the founding of the People's Republic of China.Noting the Soviet Union was the first to recognize the PRC and establish diplomatic relations in 1949, Sheng said it provided China with considerable support.Sheng noted the contributions of the Soviet Union to China and the world during and after WWII embody the spirit of concerted efforts, unity and mutual assistance."Today, we pledge to uphold the hard-won victory (in WW II), and deepen the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Russia for our mutual benefit," said Sheng.A photo exhibition dedicated to the liberation of northern and eastern China in WW II was also held alongside the roundtable discussion with photos and documents provided by the embassy of Russia in Beijing.Officials and experts from China and Indonesia called on further shoring up media cooperation to promote mutual trust and understanding and counter misinformation and disinformation, on Monday.They made the remarks at the second China-Indonesia Media Forum held in Beijing, highlighting the media's positive role in building a community with a shared future for China and Indonesia.Djauhari Oratmangun, Indonesian ambassador to China, expressed hope for the media to covey accurate and informative reports to promote relations between the two countries to scale new heights.Indonesia and China enjoy close and strong ties ranging from politics, economy, trade, culture and people-to-people exchanges, the ambassador said.He said the two nations need to keep seeking new breakthroughs to grow their ties, while hoping media will continue to advance China-Indonesia relations to develop along an upward trajectory.Irfan Junaidi, editor-in-chief of Indonesian National News Agency Antara, said media diplomacy helps to bridge cultural and political gaps by providing audiences with insights into each other's socio-economic and cultural contexts.Also, media in both countries contributes to shaping public perception and helps counteract stereotypes and misinformation that may arise from less comprehensive sources, he said.China and Indonesia can enhance media cooperation through joint projects and partnerships, such as co-produced documentaries, joint news reporting ventures, and journalist exchanges, he added.Fan Daqi, vice-president of Academy of Contemporary China and World Studies, said the deepening cooperation between Chinese and Indonesian media in recent years has drawn the hearts of the people in both countries closer.It's imperative for media outlets in the region to join hands to present real and objective information to peoples especially when certain countries attempted to concoct false narratives to hinder cooperation between China and other countries in the region, Fan added.SYDNEY - A major flood warning was issued on Monday in the Australian island state of Tasmania, with people living near major rivers told to evacuate immediately.Residents near the Derwent and Styx rivers in Tasmania's southeast were on Monday morning advised to leave immediately.TasAlert, the state's emergency warning system, said that the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has issued a major flood warning for the Derwent River, with properties expected to be isolated or inundated by floodwaters by Monday afternoon."Floodwaters are a threat to safety," the TasAlert warning said. "Property, livestock, equipment, and crops are likely to be threatened by floodwaters."It comes 24 hours after residents were told to prepare to evacuate amid severe weather conditions that have left much of the state without power.Mick Lowe, executive director of the State Emergency Service (SES), told Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television that approximately half of the residents in the flood zone had evacuated within two hours of the alert being issued."We continue to encourage people to leave the area. Houses will become inundated and there are going to be a lot of houses in those rural communities that are going to become isolated over the next 24 to 40 hours," he said.He said that the SES received over 300 calls for help in the 24 hours to Monday morning as strong winds caused widespread damage.Winds exceeding 150 km per hour were recorded in the island state on Sunday night.As of Monday morning, more than 10,000 properties were affected by power outages across the state.The airport in Launceston, Tasmania's second-biggest city, was relying on generators for electricity on Monday morning but was still operating flights despite the strong winds.Conditions in Tasmania are forecast to ease by Tuesday but the SES has urged people to remain cautious.JAKARTA - The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, locally known as Whoosh, has served 4.2 million passengers within the 10 months from its inauguration in October 2023 to July 2024, according to PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC) President Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi on Sunday.The company also noted an increase in the average daily passenger count from 9,000 to 18,000 on weekdays, and between 22,000 to 24,000 on weekends."At the beginning of its operation, Whoosh had only 14 trips per day, which has now increased to 48 trips since May 2024," said Dwiyana, adding that the company aims to reach 62 trips per day by 2025.In addition to being a modern and eco-friendly mass transit solution, Whoosh, with its average speed of 350 km/h, has cut down the travel time between Jakarta and Bandung from over three hours to around 40 minutes.A memorial service was held in Tokyo on Sunday, marking the 101st anniversary of Chinese victims who were killed following the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan.During that tragic event over 100 years ago, more than 700 Chinese people in Japan survived the earthquake, only to meet their deaths in a bloody massacre perpetrated by the Japanese military, police and militaristic thugs. Some extremists, influenced by militaristic ideology and strong xenophobic sentiments, deliberately fabricated excuses to carry out a massacre of innocent Chinese people.Over the past 11 years, family members of the victims have been working tirelessly between China and Japan to seek justice. They have organized and participated in more than 40 meetings and attended more than 20 memorial services at the massacre sites in Japan. They have repeatedly submitted petitions and demands to the Japanese government to express their strong determination and deep dissatisfaction."We, the families, persist because we have yet to receive a clear apology, and this matter remains unresolved," said Zhou Songquan, a representative of the families of Chinese victims.On behalf of the victims' families, Zhou extended their gratitude to the conscientious Japanese people from all walks of life, who have spent years dedicating tremendous efforts to comfort the souls of the victims and are committed to uncovering the truth and pursuing justice."By holding such memorial events, we hope to revisit that period of history and help more people understand and recognize the truth of the tragedy. Our purpose is not to perpetuate hatred, but to prevent the recurrence of such tragedies and to better create the future," said Zhou."We hope that the Japanese government can truly take up its political and moral responsibilities, seriously address and properly handle the relevant historical issues, and demonstrate its commitment to reflecting on history through concrete actions," he said.Liu Sipan, counselor of the political division at the Chinese embassy in Japan, noted that the immediate cause of the massacre was the malicious spread of rumors and the incitement of social panic, but the root cause lay in Japan's path towards militarism at the time, where extreme nationalism, xenophobia and anti-foreign sentiments prevailed.This also set the stage for Japan's subsequent aggressive wars of invasion, which inflicted immense suffering on China and other Asian countries, she added."It is regrettable that, more than 100 years later, this tragic memory is fading in Japanese society. The Japanese government's stance on historical issues has regressed, and there are negative trends in Japan where the denial, distortion, and beautification of its history of aggression occasionally occur," said Liu.BAKU -- Azerbaijan's ruling New Azerbaijan Party won the most seats in the country's parliament in a snap election on Sunday, Mazahir Panakhov, the Central Election Commission head said early on Monday after counting the results from about 5,895 polling stations.Preliminary results suggest that candidates from the ruling New Azerbaijan Party won about 68 of 125 seats in the single-chamber parliament, based on 91 percent of the vote count.A host of small parties and independents took almost all the rest.The voter turnout was 37.27 percent.The education authorities and specialists were astonished as 27 young voices from Asia-Pacific shared their perspectives on the coexistence of civilizations in a regional English-speaking contest in Bangkok on Saturday.Now in its second year, the MicUp! English Speaking Competition cum Belt and Road Youth English-Speaking Competition (Thailand) reached new heights, bringing together 600 young orators from local secondary schools and universities since the competition's kickoffs in Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines and Nepal earlier this year, and rounded off with a rousing regional final held at Chulalongkorn University.Thanh Theerapasiri, a Thai student from Regents International School Pattaya, and Myat Noe Phyu of MCTA: RVi Academy Mandalay in Myanmar were crowned champions in the junior and youth categories, respectively. The winners will move on to the next leg of their journey — the Global Final — to be held in Wuxi, China's Jiangsu province, next month.This year's speech topic, Civilizations: Clash and Coexistence, was applauded for being a vital stimulus for young talent to reflect upon varied global trends and for allowing them to advocate closer bonds of friendship and multilateral cooperation.Grabbing the audience's attention with an elaborate aqua ensemble consisting of a top inspired by the traditional Chinese qipao and a dress made from Thai silk, Roongpraew Wiwatkamolwat, a 16-year-old student of Ekamai International School in Bangkok, said it was her genuine affection for her Chinese roots and belief in cultural inclusiveness that motivated her to get into this competition and strive to excel."My costume echoes today's topic — civilization, which is an ongoing process of exchanges and fusion," she said, adding that her great-grandparents were from Beijing and her grandparents lived in China's Guangdong province."I'm a generation of such culture fusion, a mixture of Thailand and China. The culture, common values and many other connections, such as cuisine, are bridging the two nations closer than ever before," she said.Nan Suriya Khattiya, the first runner-up in the junior category, also expressed great appreciation for the rare opportunity to engage in close and direct dialogue with many of her peers from other Asian countries.The event coincided with the Silk Road spirit, which was "highlighted in many of today's speeches as an embodiment of coexistence and mutual learning among civilizations", Nan said. "The Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China links countries from the past to the future. It's not only the exchange of goods but also people-to-people interaction."This upbeat note, shared among contestants, also struck a chord with their Chinese counterparts. During a session with the finalists, Luo Ying, the national second runner-up in the 2022 21st Century Cup National English Speaking Competition, and a postgraduate student at Peking University, appealed for a step-up in international communication among youths."The Belt and Road Initiative is about connecting the dots between people, cultures and nations," she said. "The experience we share and the relationships we build are the lines that connect the dots, forming a path toward a more inclusive and understanding world."The competition, initiated last year by VDO English, the educational arm of China Daily Hong Kong, and the RVIPS, the publishing arm of the RVi Group, a social enterprise dedicated to international education based in Singapore, aims to hold forth an annual regional celebration of linguistic prowess, take the pulse of the younger generation, and push for integration of fresh voices into cross-cultural dialogues."Since its launch in 2019 as one of our major undertakings capitalizing on the BRI, the competition has been aligning itself with the initiative's goals and missions, committed to promoting cultural diversity and exchanges," said Tan Yan, deputy general manager of China Daily Asia-Pacific and director of VDO English.Argus Ang, CEO of RVi Group, said: "Applause should be given to all participants who have spoken at the stage with their public speaking power. I also want to give my wishes to them all. The future is yours. Please remember to be the best version of yourself, not just in the digital world but also the physical universe. Don't let anyone think less of you because you are young."A crowd of education authorities and specialists was revved up as 27 young voices from Asia-Pacific shared their perspectives on the coexistence of civilizations in a regional English-speaking competition in Bangkok, Thailand, on Saturday.Now in its second year, the MicUp!

The winners from each participant country will move on to the next leg of their competition journey – the Global Final to be held in Wuxi, China, in October.With multiple global challenges hitting a tipping point – from extreme weather in full swing to geopolitical conflicts on the edge – this year's speech topic Civilizations: Clash and Coexistence was applauded for being a vital stimulus for young talents to reflect on varied global trends, and for allowing them full rein to advocate closer bonds of friendship and multilateral cooperations.Grabbing the room's attention with an elaborate aqua ensemble consisting of a top inspired by traditional Chinese qipao and a dress piece made of Thai silk, Roongpraew Wiwatkamolwat, a 16-year-old student of Ekamai International School in Bangkok, noted that it was her genuine affection for her Chinese roots and belief in cultural inclusiveness that motivated her to get into this competition and strive to excel."My costume echoes today's topic — civilization, which is an ongoing process of exchanges and fusion," she said, adding that her great-grandparents were from Beijing and her grandparents lived in South China's Guangdong province."I'm a generation of such culture fusion, a mixture of Thailand and China.

No coral diseases were found," said Wei Zheng, a senior engineer at the South China Sea Development Research Institute.The scientific expedition team conducted material analysis of coral debris from the six cays of Xianbin Reef and found no terrestrial material input, proving that the cays are naturally formed.The report also shows that the cays at Xianbin Reef have sufficient materials supporting their development and formation, and their locations and geomorphology comply with natural laws."This indicates that the claims made by the Philippines about China artificially depositing coral debris in Xianbin Reef, leading to mass coral bleaching and death in the area, are completely unfounded," Wei said.However, the frequent human activities by the Philippines in recent months have started causing a certain degree of environmental damage to the reef, said Xiong Xiaofei, chief scientist from the South China Sea Ecological Center.During a field investigation in May, Xiong and his team observed the presence of the Philippine Coast Guard vessel MRRV-9701, which had been anchored in the lagoon of Xianbin Reef since April."We also observed some Philippine fishing boats, and witnessed littering and discarded fishing nets," he said, noting that the expedition team also observed Filipinos throwing cigarette butts into the sea.Chen Xiangmiao, deputy director of the Marine Science Research Institute at the National Institute for South China Studies, said: "We speculate that the actions of the Philippines are an attempt to repeat their past tactics, as they did with Ren'ai Reef and Huangyan Island, trying various means to establish a long-term presence at Xianbin Reef through fishing vessels and coast guard ships, then asserting their claims over the reef and attempting to occupy it.""They have also been spreading rumors in the international community, claiming that China intends to construct 'artificial islands' at Xianbin Reef, which we have never done at all. The facts prove that all these claims are fabricated lies.""The international community should also clearly see the shameless face of the Philippines," he added.Wei, from the South China Sea Development Research Institute, said further efforts should be made in the future to strengthen the investigation, assessment, monitoring, early warning and protection of Xianbin Reef and its surrounding waters, to reduce the adverse impacts brought by human activities.VIENTIANE - The member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) pledged to toughen their stance against transnational crime during the 18th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime and related meetings here, according to a Lao National Radio report on Thursday.The ASEAN ministerial meeting and its related meetings are scheduled to be held in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, from Tuesday to Thursday.The ASEAN ministerial meeting on transnational crime is intensifying its efforts to shape ASEAN's collective agenda to combat current and emerging transnational crimes. It needs to take a more proactive role in leading the implementation of future strategic action plans, according to the media report.It was agreed during the meeting that the evolving nature of transnational crime in the digital age underscores the importance of effectively adapting strategies to address new threats. Today's landscape of transnational crime is increasingly complex, driven by the rapid evolution of cyberspace and its interconnected nature with various forms of crime.Addressing these challenges requires a continuous adaptation of strategies and a multifaceted approach, including enhanced international cooperation, the development of robust legal frameworks, capacity building, and leveraging technological innovations to stay ahead of evolving threats.China-Japan relations "are now at a critical stage" and are "in need of progress to avoid backpedaling", senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said on Wednesday.Wang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the comment as he met with a delegation led by Toshihiro Nikai, chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union, in Beijing.It is hoped that "the Japanese side will set up an objective and correct perception of China", pursue a positive and rational policy toward China, and put into practice its position of comprehensively promoting the strategic and mutually beneficial relations, Wang said.China is willing to work with the Japanese side to learn from history; open up the future; remember the original aspiration; guard the right and break new grounds; and jointly promote the sustained, healthy and stable development of China-Japan relations along the right track, he added.The Japanese guests said they will continue to work to stabilize and improve Japan-China relations, promote people-to-people contacts and exchanges between legislative bodies, and enhance mutual understanding and friendship among generations.The aim is to promote the common development and progress of the two countries, they said.Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, appreciated Nikai for his active long-term involvement in the cause of China-Japan friendship.China and Japan are neighbors, and staying true to the general direction of peaceful coexistence, generational friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation "serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is the only correct choice", Wang said.In the past two years, the two sides jointly commemorated the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral diplomatic relations and the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship.Leaders of the two countries reaffirmed their commitment to comprehensively promote the strategic and mutually beneficial relations, and they agreed to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era, providing strategic guidance for the development of bilateral relations, Wang noted.Typhoon Shanshan struck Japan’s southwestern main island of Kyushu on Thursday morning, bringing heavy rain and powerful winds, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.The agency issued a rare special typhoon warning for most parts of Kagoshima Prefecture, leading to widespread cancellations of trains and flights by public transport operators. These special warnings are reserved for particularly severe storm systems.JR Kyushu announced that all high-speed and other train services on the island would be suspended by Thursday afternoon. Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways also canceled numerous flights to and from airports in the affected area.JR West added that some bullet trains between Hakata in northern Kyushu and Hiroshima in western Japan would also be canceled Thursday evening.As of 5 am Thursday, the typhoon was advancing northward at 15 kilometers per hour and was situated approximately 30 kilometers southwest of Satsumasendai, a city in Kagoshima Prefecture, with maximum winds reaching 252 kilometers per hour. The storm’s central atmospheric pressure was recorded at 935 hectopascals, Kyodo News reported.Residents in these areas have been urged to prepare for strong winds, high tides and waves, with the weather agency advising people to be prepared for evacuation before conditions deteriorate further. The forecast predicts up to 600 millimeters of rain in parts of Kyushu over a 24-hour period.China has much to offer Samoa and other small island countries in the transition to clean energy and infrastructure, said Samoa's ambassador to China."China's leadership in clean energy development and potential partnerships with Samoa and other small island states could significantly address the climate crisis and contribute to saving our planet," Luamanuvae Albert Mariner told China Daily.The international community has shown great admiration for China's environmental and sustainability initiatives, he said. China is leading in green technology and clean energy, and has a real opportunity to be a global leader in the renewable energy sector.China boasts about 80 percent of the world's solar manufacturing capacity. The vast output has lowered solar panel prices worldwide, reducing cost barriers for developing countries to access clean energy technology and expertise.On tackling climate change, he said, "Now more than ever, the world needs political (partnerships)... to resolve the crisis that we face." Large economies must find a way, because at the end of the day, politics is at the heart of climate change negotiations, he said.China recognizes the context of small island countries' developmental aspirations, because "these are countries that have nothing to do with climate change, and yet they're right at the forefront facing constant challenges and the impacts of climate change", he said.Speaking about China's Belt and Road Initiative projects, the ambassador said the program is critical as every country needs infrastructure development. The focus now is on sustainability built into the infrastructure, which holds the key to any country's development, he said."What China has offered is critical for development," he said, citing the example of Samoa, which is said to have one of the best international airports among small Pacific Island countries, after the facility was built with help from China.Mariner said a country involved in the BRI is always certain that China is providing what their country truly needs. "The BRI is a process and opportunity that allows ongoing conversations between China and the recipient countries," he said.Samoa and China enjoy a comprehensive strategic partnership and will celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations next year.Mariner said Chinese migration to Samoa began in the late 1800s, and China is a large, multicultural country with a fascinating and unique history."The more I read about China's history, the greater I understand and appreciate China's complexity," he said."China's … success in eliminating extreme poverty is a remarkable achievement."The Pacific region, where Samoa was the first small island country to gain independence, is often at the heart of geopolitics in some ways, Mariner said. In today's world, apart from geopolitical tensions, there is also a battle of narratives.One narrative comes from the Western media, which is very anti-China and biased. Another perspective, of people like him who come to China, reveals that this mainstream Western narrative is "so unfortunate and wrong", he said, adding that China seeks to be understood and respected.China places peace and stability as important prerequisites to its national economic development programs, he added."It continues to pursue, where possible, peace mediation efforts in some of the most difficult global conflicts in the world and remains one of the biggest contributors to the UN peacekeeping fund."Japanese citizens are urging that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal become the central issue of the upcoming Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) presidential election, as a means to eliminate corrupt, money-driven politics.On Tuesday, Takakage Fujita, president of the Alliance to Stop the Impermissible Acts of Slush Fund and Tax Evasion by the LDP, filed for a prosecutorial review with the Tokyo No 1 Committee for the Inquest of Prosecution.He did this with his legal representatives to challenge the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office's decision to return their criminal complaints. These complaints were against senior politicians in the LDP faction led by former prime minister Shinzo Abe and then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, concerning a slush fund scandal and the misuse of the Cabinet's secret funds.Earlier this year, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office returned their complaints, claiming that the facts of the crime were not specified.In these cases, the special investigation squad of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has already conducted forced searches and seized numerous accounting records, so the facts of the crime should be well-known to the prosecutors. Therefore, this response from the prosecutors office shows either a lack of understanding or a willful disregard for the overwhelming anger of the public over the LDP slush fund and tax evasion scandal, Fujita said at a news conference on Tuesday."Ordinary people are forced to pay higher taxes down to the last yen with the introduction of the invoice system. Meanwhile, LDP politicians can obtain millions of yen under the guise of political funds through fundraising party ticket sales, use this money for personal extravagances, and engage in all sorts of unacceptable behavior that defies common sense. This is the essence of the scandal that has angered not just LDP supporters, but many citizens," said Fujita.He emphasized that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal has not been properly resolved, and the political funding reform law that the LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito forced through in the last ordinary session of Japan's parliament is "an empty, meaningless sham of reform".The LDP will hold its upcoming leadership election on Sept 27, with the official campaign period for the race scheduled to start on Sept 12. As the Japanese media will focus on the LDP candidates for the next month, Fujita is worried that the scandal might be laundered through the hype surrounding the election."If the LDP presidential election is going to dominate the media, we strongly hope that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal will be made the main theme of the election," he said.The prosecution has repeatedly stated that it will not pursue this case, citing reasons such as unspecified facts. However, ordinary citizens lack the authority or resources to conduct investigations and can only file complaints based on the evidence they possess. The prosecution should be investigating and bringing charges based on these complaints, said Akihiko Ohaguchi, a lawyer representing the complainants."The way the prosecution and police are protecting the government's interests is evident … As citizens, we must strongly criticize such actions by the prosecution," said Ohaguchi.Naohiko Hasegawa, another member of Fujita's legal team, said they filed two criminal complaints regarding this matter, but both were quickly returned on the grounds that the facts were not specified.An accusation is a request for investigative authorities to look into suspected facts. Therefore, even if the specifics are not clear, it is unacceptable to reject it outright just for that reason. On the contrary, there should be some level of investigation before a final decision is made, said Hasegawa."It appears that from the beginning, there was no intention to address the slush fund issue seriously. The matter seems to be handled with minimal effort, with only lower-level figures being targeted while key influential members of the LDP remain untouched," said Hasegawa.He noted that there is significant anger over the political funding issue and genuine frustration over the lack of a serious response. "What the people truly need is thorough and meaningful action, including expulsions and strong recommendations for resignation or tax payment," he added.Shigeaki Koga, a policy analyst and a former official of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, said: "The people want to know the facts about the scandal — when did these wrongdoings start, who initiated them, who spent how much money, and for what purpose? After clarifying these facts, they want those who committed these wrongdoings to be appropriately punished, possibly even criminally prosecuted."In addition, they also want the rules governing political funds to be fundamentally reformed to ensure transparency and fairness so that such incidents never happen again, said Koga.From the perspective of the LDP, Fumio Kishida's resignation as Japan's Prime Minister is viewed as a way to take responsibility, with the hope that this will put the issue to rest. They also believe that introducing a new candidate might create the impression of change and help regain the trust of the public, he said."However, from the public's viewpoint, Kishida's resignation is not so much appreciated as it is considered too late. Moreover, even if a new leader is introduced, the public still cannot see any substantial change at this stage, and it is unlikely that they will, so the LDP might fail to regain the trust of the public," said Koga.Global experts and leaders called for higher utilization rates under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, and making collective efforts to unleash the full potential of the framework for economic prosperity for all."ASEAN members have rather low utilization rates of RCEP, which constrains the realization of the agreement's benefits," said Ong Tee Keat, president of the Belt and Road Initiative Caucus for Asia Pacific in Malaysia.Speaking at a panel discussion during the Boao Forum for Asia held in Bangkok Tuesday, he said so far there's no official data on all the member countries' utilization rates under the framework. A mechanism should be created to facilitate better functioning of the framework, he added.As the world's largest trading bloc, the RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries, 10 member states of the ASEAN, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.Since the agreement came into effect on Jan 1, 2022, it has been driving and reshaping the landscape for economic globalization with a framework that aims to lower trade barriers and secure improved market access for goods and services for businesses in the region.According to data from the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Vietnam's total exports to the RCEP region in 2022 amounted to $146.502 billion, with RCEP preferential exports reaching $980 million. It accounts for an RCEP export utilization rate of less than 1 percent.Studies indicated the utilization rates for China's exports and imports were 4.21 percent and 1.46 percent, respectively, last year.The minimum tariff differential with other trade agreements is among the factors leading to a low policy utilization rate, said Yose Rizal Damuri, executive director of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Indonesia."A smart system should be adopted to assist in the implementation and make the whole process simpler," he added.Beacon of stabilityAmid economic uncertainties and persistent downward pressure, the RCEP stands as a beacon of stability, said Jittima Nakamano, director of the Bureau of ASEAN Economic Community under the Department of Trade Negotiations, Thai Ministry of Commerce.As Thailand's biggest trading partner for nine consecutive years, China's proactive high-level opening-up to ASEAN will have a significant leverage effect, enhancing RCEP's vitality, she said."Together with the Belt and Road Initiative that has largely improved logistics links between China and Thailand, the implementation of RCEP will bring more diversified trade and transportation modes and significantly boost China-Thailand trade ties," she said.In 2022, the China Institute for Reform and Development initiated the RCEP Think Tank Network, with 18 think tanks from 13 countries being involved so far. It aims to gather suggestions from experts in the region for better implementation of the agreement."RCEP holds enormous potential for economic growth in Asia," said Chi Fulin, president of the institute. "We will keep focusing on the policy practices and conduct assessments regularly," he said.He said the institute will continue to serve as an open platform to promote policy exchanges, coordination, and communication among member countries, and provide intellectual support for mutual policy learning and macroeconomic policy coordination.Chi also said the institute plans to establish an RCEP Implementation Capacity Building Academy to provide institutionalized RCEP implementation capacity training.The United Nations and Pakistan have strongly condemned a series of terrorist attacks that claimed more than 50 lives in the country's southwestern Balochistan Province on Monday."The secretary-general stresses that attacks against civilians are unacceptable," said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN chief Antonio Guterres, at a daily briefing on the same day.Guterres extended his deepest condolences to the families of the victims and called on the Pakistani government to conduct an investigation and ensure that those responsible are held accountable, he added.At least 53 people, including 10 security forces soldiers and four law enforcement personnel, were killed by militants in Pakistan's largest province by land on Monday, according to Pakistan military authorities.President Asif Ali Zardari said the "brutal killing of innocent people was the killing of the entire humanity" and demanded that the culprits be brought to justice, Radio Pakistan reported.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also strongly condemned the attacks, demanding an immediate probe to bring the perpetrators to justice. "The nation stood by the security forces in the war against terrorism … Terrorists' nefarious designs to spoil the country's peace would never succeed," Sharif said.China voiced strong condemnation of terrorist attacks in Pakistan and expressed deep condolences to the victims on Tuesday.Maintaining unityForeign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a daily briefing that China firmly opposes all forms of terrorism and will continue to firmly support Pakistan in advancing counterterrorism operations, maintaining social unity and stability and protecting people's safety.Attacks on police stations, other law enforcement buildings and innocent civilians were launched shortly before midnight on Monday, continuing into the morning with gunfire, grenades, suicide bombings and bomb attacks.Terrorists launched attacks in various areas of Balochistan, including Musa Khel, Kalat and Las Bela districts, according to a statement from the Inter Services Public Relations Pakistan, or ISPR, the media arm of the Pakistani military.The largest attack in Musa Khel saw 23 people killed at close range after their vehicles were stopped, the district's Assistant Commissioner Najeeb Kakar said.Terrorists blocked the highway connecting Balochistan with the eastern Punjab Province in Musa Khel, stopping buses and trucks and checking the identities of passengers before shooting them. Most of the victims were from southern Punjab.The banned Balochistan Liberation Army, or BLA, reportedly claimed responsibility for the offensive in a statement emailed to some local journalists.The ISPR reported that 21 terrorists were killed in tense fighting during a clearance operation conducted by security forces after the attacks.Clearance operations are ongoing and the perpetrators and facilitators of heinous acts targeting innocent civilians will be brought to justice, the ISPR added."These attacks are a well thought-out plan to create anarchy in Pakistan," Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement on Monday.The ISPR noted that the terrorists attempted to engage in numerous attacks in Balochistan aimed at disrupting the peaceful environment and development of the province by targeting mainly innocent civilians.The Pakistani military said security forces and law enforcement agencies remained determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress in Balochistan.Xinhua contributed to this story.Almaty will host Asia's largest Finance and Post-Trade Event, DKnews.kz reports.The 26th Annual General Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Central Securities Depository Group (ACG) will take place in Almaty from September 9 to 12.

Unlike traditional coal and gas power plants, nuclear facilities do not emit carbon dioxide during electricity generation, making them indispensable for achieving global greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. For developing countries, nuclear energy provides a unique opportunity to strengthen their energy independence and ensure reliable energy supplies. This is particularly important for countries where the population and industry require stable energy sources to sustain economic growth.How can international cooperation influence the development of the nuclear industry within a country?International cooperation plays a vital role in developing nuclear energy at the national level. It allows countries to exchange knowledge, advanced technologies, and best practices. Such partnerships can help developing countries access modern nuclear technologies and improve their safety standards. An example of such cooperation is the work of Women in Nuclear Global, which provides a platform for experience exchange among women experts in nuclear energy from around the world. This not only contributes to the professional growth of participants but also strengthens ties between countries, which is crucial for the sustainable development of the nuclear industry.What are the main barriers to achieving gender equality in the nuclear industry, and how does Women in Nuclear address these issues?One of the main barriers to achieving gender equality in the nuclear industry is the stereotypical perception of this field as "male-dominated." Many women face bias and a lack of support early in their careers. Women in Nuclear actively tackles these issues through mentorship programs, educational initiatives, and awareness campaigns. We aim to inspire young women by showcasing examples of successful professionals in the nuclear industry and providing opportunities for training and career development. Our efforts are focused on creating an inclusive environment where women can fully realize their potential.What specific programs and initiatives make the nuclear industry attractive to young female professionals?Within WiN Global, we implement several programs aimed at attracting young women to the nuclear sector. For instance, we organize international conferences where young professionals can meet industry leaders and receive career-building advice. We also support educational programs that give women the opportunity to gain the necessary skills and knowledge in nuclear energy. At the national level, we collaborate with universities and research centers to offer students internships and research projects. This helps create a positive image of the nuclear industry as an innovative and promising field for women.How does the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) support new nuclear countries, such as Kazakhstan, in building and maintaining their nuclear facilities?The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays a key role in supporting new nuclear countries. The Agency offers technical assistance, training programs, and advisory services to help countries build and manage safe nuclear facilities. For Kazakhstan and other newcomers to nuclear energy, this means access to international safety standards, best management practices, and support in developing regulatory and legislative frameworks. WiN Global works closely with the IAEA, providing professional training and support to women working in the nuclear industry. This collaboration helps create a highly skilled and gender-inclusive workforce necessary for the successful development of nuclear energy in countries just starting their journey in this field.The development of nuclear energy in Kazakhstan could become an important step towards ensuring the country's stable and environmentally friendly energy supply. In the context of the global fight against climate change, nuclear energy offers unique opportunities for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and strengthening energy independence. Cooperation with international organizations such as Women in Nuclear and the IAEA can help Kazakhstan implement advanced technologies and establish a safe and sustainable nuclear industry.DKnews.kzAsian countries should work closely to unleash their full potential of comparative advantages for the common benefit of all, making collective efforts and converging to shape a brighter future for the Asia-Pacific region, global and regional leaders say.Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia Roundtable in Bangkok on Monday, Dennis Francis, president of the 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, called for Asia-Pacific countries to embrace open regionalism, handle regional affairs with mutual respect and equal rights, accelerate regional economic integration, and ensure the stability and resilience of global supply chains."The Asia-Pacific region is shaping the future of international cooperation, innovation and progress," he said. "By amplifying the diverse voices, perspectives and actions across Asia, the roundtable's esteemed gathering undoubtedly plays a vital role in fostering peace and prosperity on a regional and global scale."Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi sent a congratulatory letter to the opening of the roundtable, which is themed "Future of the World: from the Perspective of Asia"."We should continue to promote deeper integration and better connectivity, pursue innovation-driven development, strengthen cooperation in such areas as new industrialization and artificial intelligence, and accelerate the development of new quality productive forces to create a future full of opportunities for all countries in Asia," said Wang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.Focusing on AsiaAs the host country, China will continue to support the forum in focusing on Asia, keeping a global perspective, promoting cooperation and leading the way for the future, making greater contributions to the common development of countries in Asia and the world, he said.Secretary-General of the forum Zhang Jun, in his welcome remarks, said that at this historic juncture for the world, Asia is duty-bound to take up its responsibility, strengthen strategic coordination, come up with Asian solutions and play a greater constructive role in shaping the shared future.Chairman of the forum Ban Ki-moon urged the region to seize opportunities in seeking shared future of sustained peace and sustainable development."We are expected to bring Asian perspectives and solutions to those global challenges. No country can manage the challenges on its own. The only way out is the strong and sustained international cooperation," he said.As one of the 29 initiating countries of the forum, Thailand called for all Asian countries to unite together, turn the tide in the global economy and unlock the untapped economic potential in new markets and industries of the future."We firmly believe that the multilateral system, with the UN at its core, remains critical in overcoming these challenges," said Eksiri Pintaruchi, Thailand's permanent secretary for foreign affairs. "The UN is undeniably the most inclusive platform, where the Global South can speak loudest and best heard."The China Coast Guard has confirmed that it implemented control measures against two Philippine coast guard vessels illegally intruding into waters near China's Xianbin Reef in the South China Sea on Monday.The Philippine vessels "kept trying in a dangerous way to approach the China Coast Guard vessels, which were sailing normally there", and Manila rolled out media hype about what happened, the China Coast Guard said in a social media post.Chinese law enforcement officers took controlling measures on Sunday to tackle intrusion into waters near Xianbin Reef by the Philippine vessel No 3002.Manila has frequently sent coast guard vessels and government ships to intrude into the waters around Xianbin Reef.Lin Jian, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, warned on Monday that Manila is "attempting to provide supplies to the Philippine coast guard vessel that has anchored for a long period of time in the lagoon of Xianbin Reef, seeking to achieve a long-term presence"."This move by the Philippine side seriously infringes on China's sovereignty, gravely violates the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and damages peace and stability in the South China Sea," Lin said at a regular news conference in Beijing."China urges the Philippines to immediately stop provocations and infringement of (China's) rights, and immediately withdraw the vessel concerned," he said.The spokesman emphasized that Xianbin Reef is part of China's Nansha Islands.Speaking of Sunday's intrusion by the Philippine government vessels that ignored China's resolute opposition and repeated warnings, Lin said, "The responsibility for causing the collision between the vessels of the two sides rests entirely with the Philippine side".The China Coast Guard took necessary measures to tackle the Philippine vessels in accordance with domestic and international laws, and "the on-site operation was professional, coolheaded and disciplined", he said.China will continue to take resolute and strong measures in accordance with the law to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and uphold the sanctity of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, Lin added.zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com.cnThe world will have to endure a very long struggle in achieving zero-net emissions and China could become an example of how to proceed in that journey, an environment forum heard on Aug 24."We need milestones in our very long and complex struggle" against climate change, Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in her speech at the Indonesia Net-Zero Summit in Jakarta.About 3,000 people attended the day-long forum, including senior government officials, foreign diplomats, academics, business people, NGO activists and university students. The majority of the participants were young people from Jakarta and other provinces.The forum focused on opportunities and challenges faced by Indonesia and the global community in achieving the 1.5 degree Celsius global warming target to be met around mid-century as stipulated in the Paris Agreement. The legally binding treaty was signed by Indonesia, China and 194 other countries and world organizations at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in Dec 2015 and entered into force in November 2016.The most critical issue discussed in the Indonesia-Zero Summit was whether economic growth can go hand in hand with emission reduction.Li Zhenmin, a special envoy for climate change of the People's Republic of China, was a keynote speaker along with Indrawati; Tomas Anker Christensen, Climate Ambassador of Denmark; Dominic Jermey, British Ambassador to Indonesia and Timor Leste; and Pahala Nugraha Mansury, Indonesia's vice foreign minister.In addition, 55 other panelists also presented their views in different sessions and rooms at the Jakarta Theater Building.Speaking in the early session that saw her receiving the "Climate Hero Award" from the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia (FPCI), which held the dialog forum, Indrawati said that compromising the ongoing trade-off between welfare enhancement and environmental sustainability was a challenge to the global community, which not only required people's resolution but also a shift in their mindset and lifestyle.Minister Indrawati said there needs to be formulas adequate for compromising the tradeoff and she called on young people in the audience to get involved in developing new technologies for solving carbon emissions.She said that the war against climate change requires proper technologies in the fields of renewable energy, transportation, forestry, agriculture, and waste management.Indrawati specially mentioned the urgency of establishing a strong foundation for carbon market trading and the creation of inter-state rules and regulations for such a market.Indonesia officially opened carbon trading in Sept 2023 after the establishment in the previous year of the Indonesian Carbon Exchange (IDX Carbon) in the previous year.The minister, who initiated serious budgeting for environmental preservation, encouraged young people to solve ecological problems.Li Zhenmin noted that the current air pollution in Jakarta is about the same as seven years ago, the last time he came to the capital city. In July of this year, the Indonesian capital, with a population of about 12 million people, ranked fifth as the most polluted city in the world."How do you improve it? I think it's good for the Indonesian government, for the municipality government, to use this opportunity of electric transition," Li said.Li suggested that the Indonesian government encourage people to use more electric cars. China saw its air quality improve after more and more people use EVs, following the implementation of the country's new emission vehicle mandate, the Chinese official said."So please combine controlling the pollution and reducing the emission together in the cities," the Chinese official said.China is committed to pushing forward to achieve its carbon emission reduction goals by actively developing a circular economy, Li said. In China, circular economic development contributes more than 25 percent of total carbon emission reduction."China also vigorously leverages market mechanisms to regulate carbon emission trade. We have established carbon markets covering the largest greenhouse gas emissions in the world," Li said.China is also actively developing renewable energy through continuous innovation. At the end of 2023, the stored capacity of renewable energy in China reached nearly 52 percent, surpassing fossil fuel energy capacity for the first time. Since the beginning of this year, renewable energy in China has continued to maintain strong growth momentum, accounting for 92 percent of the newly stored power capacity in this year's first quarter."China's new energy products such as new energy vehicles, diesel batteries, and photovoltaic products have made important contributions to the world," Li said.China's efforts notably over the past decade have enabled the country to reduce the proportion of its coal consumption to a staggering 56 percent, Li said.Li said climate change is a global issue that requires concerted cooperation among countries around the world as "energy transition is a process that cannot be accomplished overnight."Christensen explained Denmark's aim of becoming a leading nation in international climate efforts, saying that his country has both a historical and a moral responsibility to take the lead.Denmark, by passing the 2020 Climate Act into law, has a long-term target for becoming a climate neutrality society by 2050.Dino Patti Djalal, founder and chairman of FPCI's board of trustees, said cooperation for fighting global climate change remained unstable due to an unstable geopolitical situation."The majority of world economies have not yet fully gone online with the zero-net target … Public opinion remains indifferent," Djalal said.Esther N.S. Tamara, director of the climate unit of FPCI, said funds for emission reduction work should be jointly made available by the government and private sector parties, but the question is whether Indonesia is serious enough to turn away from dirty energy."It should no longer be business as usual," she said.Fabby Tumiwa, executive director of the Institute for Essential Services Reform, said Indonesia needs to learn from China in reducing carbon emissions.But, he said China's environmental policies might not be that easily emulated by Indonesia."We are talking about political leadership, fiscal capacity, and industrial capability," Tumiwa told this correspondent in an interview.Widely known for his views on the car industry, Tumiwa said Indonesia could learn much from China's efforts to develop its electric car industry.One thing Indonesia needs to emulate from China is the latter's outstanding R&D in building the ecosystem of its EV industry, Tumiwa said. Indonesia needs large-scale EV ecosystem that comprises EV battery technology, EV manufacturing and EV charging stations, Tumiwa said.Indonesia holds 24 percent, or the highest percentage of the world's nickel reserves globally, and nickel is used for making EV batteries.Currently, EVs in Indonesia account for about 7 percent of the country's total number of cars, which is higher than last year's 4 percent, Tumiwa said. They include Chinese-made EVs.He said the percentage could rise to 10 percent in 2025. The government has set a target to see two million EVs plying roads in Indonesia by 2030.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.BANGKOK - Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Thailand's new prime minister, stated on Monday that Thailand and China share a "close friendship" and she is committed to further strengthening bilateral ties.Paetongtarn wrote on social media platform X that Thailand's friendship with China is based on "mutual trust and respect, a common vision towards prosperity and progress, as well as familial ties between our two countries' peoples."The prime minister added that she is committed to further strengthening the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between Thailand and China and looks forward to jointly celebrating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 2025.Paetongtarn, the 38-year-old Pheu Thai Party leader, was elected Thailand's new prime minister on Aug 16 after winning a parliamentary vote. She has received a formal appointment by Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn to become the second female prime minister and youngest leader in the country's history.ISLAMABAD - Militants in Pakistan's southwest Balochistan province killed 23 passengers after blocking a highway for several hours, officials said.The incident happened in Musa Khel district of the province where the terrorists offloaded the passengers from the vehicles after checking their identities, the sources told Xinhua."The terrorists entered the vehicles and checked the identity cards of the passengers, following which they offloaded those coming from east Punjab province and shot them dead," the sources added.The road connecting Punjab to Balochistan was blocked between 12:00 am (GMT 1900 Sunday) to 3:00 am local time (GMT 2200 Sunday), the source said.The terrorists also torched several vehicles during the roadblock.No group has claimed responsibility for the incident. However, in a message on social media, the proscribed organization Balochistan Liberation Army claimed to have blocked several roads across the province.SEOUL -- The top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) oversaw on Saturday a drone performance test organized by the Drone Institute of the Academy of Defence Sciences, the DPRK's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Monday.Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the DPRK, got first-hand information on the drones currently being developed, which are intended to strike enemy forces on the ground and at sea, the report said.During the test, drones of various types accurately identified and destroyed the designated targets after following different preset flight routes, it added.Noting that developing different types of drones and enhancing their combat capabilities play an important role in war preparations, the DPRK leader stressed the need to ramp up drone development and production, urging more intensive testing of their combat applications and the swift equipping of military units with them, the report said.A year after Japan began releasing nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean, many Japanese citizens are still urgently calling for an immediate halt to the discharge, which has failed to reassure both neighboring countries and the Japanese public."Our opposition to the ocean discharge of Fukushima's nuclear-tainted water remains unchanged. We want it to stop immediately," said Ruiko Mutoh, a representative of the Complainants for Criminal Prosecution of the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster.None of the concerns regarding safety, stakeholder agreement, or justification have been addressed, and the citizens of the Pacific Island countries are even more outraged, Mutoh added. "I am very sorry that Japan is contaminating the world's oceans instead of trying to contain the nuclear pollution in its own country."On Saturday, Japanese citizens gathered for a rally in Shinjuku, a bustling district of Tokyo, marking one year since the ocean discharge of nuclear-contaminated water on Aug 24, 2023.Participants called for an end to the release of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, expressing concern that the discharge is causing anxiety about the safety of food from Fukushima.The Citizens' Conference to Condemn Further Pollution of the Ocean, a nonprofit organization in Iwaki, a coastal city in Fukushima Prefecture, called for global action on Saturday. The organization invited people worldwide to join in by standing up and holding homemade placards to express their opposition to the discharge.Chiyo Oda, co-director of the organization, also known as KOREUMI, said the process of deciding to release the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean was done in a way that ignored the opposition from the public."When I eat fresh and delicious fish and shellfish, or when children and young people play by the sea, I feel anxious that the effects of radiation may appear one day. I feel that we are losing our natural way of life, which is to eat delicious products and play freely in the sea around us," said Oda, a resident of Iwaki.On Sunday, Japan completed its eighth release of around 7,800 metric tons of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea. This was the eighth release overall.Tokyo Electric Power Company, or TEPCO, the operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant, has already released over 60,000 tons of contaminated water. The discharge is expected to continue for several decades.Three Japanese civic groups, namely the Fukushima Prefecture Peace Forum, the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center, and the Japan Congress Against A- and H-Bombs, submitted a second round of signatures to government officials in Tokyo on Wednesday, requesting an immediate halt to the ocean discharge.Earlier this year, they submitted a petition, accompanied by the first batch of 184,712 signatures collected nationwide. On Wednesday, the second batch of 22,744 signatures was handed over to officials of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, bringing the total number of signatures to 207,456.TEPCO has used the Advanced Liquid Processing System, or ALPS, to remove multiple radioactive substances from the contaminated water before discharging it into the sea.However, this has not alleviated the safety concerns of the Japanese public and residents of other countries."Even though ALPS can reduce radioactive particles in the water, it cannot eliminate them entirely. Moreover, the water release is expected to continue for 30 to 40 years, resulting in a tremendous amount of water containing radioactive substances being discharged," said Hajime Matsukubo, secretary-general and researcher at the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center.Masashi Tsunoda, co-representative of the Fukushima Prefecture Peace Forum, expressed skepticism over whether the discharged water truly meets safety standards.No assessment"The government speaks of implementing a long-term monitoring system, yet no comprehensive long-term assessment is being conducted. Therefore, I find it hard to simply accept the safety claims based solely on official statements," said Tsunoda.Masayo Ikeda, secretary-general of the Women's Conference, a nonprofit organization, criticized the Japanese government and TEPCO for claiming the released water is safe without thorough verification."The presence of tritium and various radioactive substances means there is no guarantee that it won't have any environmental impact," Ikeda said. She stressed the importance of Japan continuously verifying the safety of the facilities and the water being released.Toshihiro Inoue, a special committee member of the Japan Congress against A- and H-Bombs, criticized the government and TEPCO for using the term "ALPS-treated water," which gives the impression that the water is not contaminated."This kind of image manipulation has made it increasingly difficult for us to call it 'contaminated water.' But the reality is that the water remains contaminated with radiation. Even if radioactive materials are reduced, they are still present," said Inoue.He expressed serious concerns over the long-term environmental impact of releasing this water over an extended period, especially regarding its potential effects on marine products that enter the food supply.On Thursday, TEPCO suspended experimental work to extract nuclear fuel debris from one of the reactors at the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi plant after discovering an error in the installation of a debris removal device.The government has set a goal to decommission the plant by 2051.However, the recent setback in debris removal underscores the uncertainties surrounding the entire decommissioning process, raising concerns that the timeline may be extended even further. If the timeline is indeed prolonged, it would mean the release of contaminated water could continue, said Inoue."What's really needed now is an acknowledgment that the plans are delayed and that achieving the original goals might be impossible. However, instead of admitting this and communicating openly with local residents and those in surrounding areas, the authorities continue to insist that everything is fine. This approach is alarming because it puts undue pressure on the workers, which could lead to mistakes and further complications," he said.Before the Fumio Kishida administration, Japan's nuclear policy was to "reduce nuclear power as much as possible", but under Kishida, it has changed to "make maximum use of it", said Motoo Tomizuka, a member of No Nukes Plaza Tokyo."With earthquakes becoming more frequent each year, continuing to operate aging nuclear power plants only heightens the risk of another severe accident. It's a reckless decision," said Tomizuka.Masahide Kimura, a member of the Japanese anti-nuclear campaign group, said that in TEPCO's monitoring results, the term "Not Detected "is used to indicate that radioactive material levels are below the detection limit. However, TEPCO treats these levels as if they are zero."Given the large volume of water being released, if you multiply this by the detection limit, it becomes evident that a significant amount of radioactivity is being discharged. They're releasing numerous radioactive substances, including plutonium and strontium, not just tritium," Kimura said during a protest in front of Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority on Wednesday.Approach slammedMany others have expressed concern over the Japanese government's approach of proceeding with the ocean discharge without properly securing international understanding.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday that China strongly opposes Japan's unilateral discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean."Let me stress that the more transparent and open Japan is on the issue, the easier it will be for Japan to alleviate international concerns," said Mao.China once again calls on Japan to seriously address both international and domestic concerns, and fully cooperate in establishing an independent international monitoring arrangement that remains effective in the long haul and includes substantive participation from Japan's neighboring countries and other stakeholders, she said.Kimura supports China's proposal. "Ideally, Japan should engage in international dialogue and address these issues with other countries before concerns are raised. The discharge is expected to continue for 30 to 40 years, possibly even longer. It is essential to reassess the situation and initiate discussions now, even though a year has already passed," he said.Ikeda, representing the Women's Conference, shares a similar perspective. "I believe that an international monitoring system is absolutely necessary, and I think it should be established," she said.The reforms initiated by China's late leader Deng Xiaoping and currently being amplified by President Xi Jinping have set China on the road to modernization and peaceful development as well as making greater contributions to the world by building a community with a shared future for mankind, global experts say.Xi hailed Deng's significant contributions and called for the advancement of socialism with Chinese characteristics as the country commemorated Deng's 120th birth anniversary on Thursday.Karori Singh, former director and emeritus fellow of the South Asia Studies Centre at the University of Rajasthan in India, said China has made remarkable progress in the past 75 years.Chinese leaders have continuously made their contributions in leading China to modernization, Singh said. "Chairman Mao Zedong consolidated unity while Deng set the road to economic growth and progress. President Xi further advances and synergizes Marxist ideology, Mao's thoughts and Deng's theory in socialism with Chinese characteristics and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."Xi has enunciated the Chinese worldview and global vision through the initiatives of Global Development, Global Security and Global Civilization, by advancing its flagship Belt and Road Initiative for realizing the Chinese ideal of world order inspired by Deng Xiaoping Theory, Singh said.Tom Harper, a lecturer and researcher specializing in China's international relations at the University of East London, said Xi's remarks are "symbolic in several key aspects".They confirm that "China is still following the path that Deng had set China on", and in this sense, the policies adopted thereafter have been the logical step in following this path, Harper said, adding it is worth noting how the Chinese leadership adapted to the context they find themselves in to achieve modernization in the economic and technological spheres.Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former prime minister of Pakistan, said the reform and opening-up policy initiated by Deng "has led to prosperity and progress for China, and greatly impacted China's relationship with its neighbors and trading partners".In Pakistan, Deng is revered as a leader who helped "foster and expand the relations with Pakistan during the 1980s", he said. "This relationship has continued to grow over the last four decades with collaboration in trade, investment, infrastructure, etc."Under the leadership of President Xi, the China-Pakistan relationship, termed as "Iron Brothers", has grown exponentially under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as part of the BRI, he said. "The people of Pakistan look forward to strengthening the special relationship between China and Pakistan."Dennis Munene, executive director of the China-Africa Center at the Africa Policy Institute, said: "The African Renaissance dream is being realized as China remains Africa's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years."Greater contributionsThe reforms initiated by Deng and currently being amplified under the leadership of President Xi, who is committed to making greater contributions to the world by building a community with a shared future for mankind, continue to empower Africa to seek its independent path to modernization, Munene said.Booker Ngesa Omole, organizing secretary of the Communist Party of Kenya, said there is hardly any literature on China's economic advancement without referring to Deng."A towering figure in Chinese history, Deng formed part of Chinese politics from the day the People's Republic of China was proclaimed," Omole said.He said poverty affects different segments of Africa's population in comparative terms and that Africa's economic policies should address this reality, adding China's policies are tailored to its own reality.Wang Mingjie in London and Otiato Opali in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed to this story.SEOUL -- Three Chinese nationals were among the five people killed in a traffic accident in South Korea, the Chinese embassy in South Korea confirmed on Saturday.Early morning on Saturday, a van carrying day laborers collided with a bus at an intersection in Ansan, about 30 km south of the capital Seoul, at around 5:45 am local time (2045 GMT Friday), killing five people and injuring nine others, local media reported citing the fire authorities.Affected by the collision, the van bounced off and hit a passenger car waiting in the opposite lane before coming to a stop. Five laborers in the van were sent to a nearby hospital and confirmed dead.Seven others in the van, including a driver, were injured, while two in the passenger car were wounded. One of the injured was in critical condition.The police suspected that the van violated a traffic signal at the intersection, planning to investigate the exact cause of the accident.The deputy prime minister of Thailand's caretaker government urged on Friday for an investigation into a passenger plane crash to be done as soon as possible, as he visited the site of the crash in Chachoengsao Province.The plane carrying nine people crashed into a mangrove forest in Bang Pakong district in Chachoengsao Province, en route from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Trat Airport. The accident occurred just 10 minutes after it departed at 2:46 pm on Thursday.All on board, including four Thais and five Chinese tourists, were found dead, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand. Of the five Chinese victims, there were two teenagers aged 12 and 13. Hong Kong immigration authorities said the victims were not residents of the special administrative region.Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, also deputy prime minister of the caretaker government, said the cause of the accident should be determined as soon as possible."Although 40 percent of plane parts have been found, we need to wait for further analysis to identify the wreckage. Everyone is trying their best to help, including the rescue team and even villages nearby that came to assist. I expressed my appreciation to all of them," Anutin said.Investigation neededHe also said none of the plane parts being found is complete, which is very sad. He added that the plane's vertical fall was abnormal, which should be investigated by experts.When asked whether the accident happened because the plane was used for a long time, Anutin said all aircraft follow strict standards and will be in service up to the end of its service life. He also expressed confidence in the pilot's professional skills.Thai media reported that the nine victims have been identified. However, the black box has yet to be located and is believed to be submerged underwater beneath the wreckage.Rescue teams, including forensic experts from the Royal Thai Police, are running against time on the crash site, facing challenging terrain and weather conditions.The aircraft, a Cessna Caravan C208B, was operated by the Thai Flying Service. Flight TFT209 was carrying five passengers, two flight attendants and two pilots, the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand said.One witness reported hearing a loud explosion before the plane crashed into the forest, with debris hitting a nearby house, The Nation reported.After receiving the crash report at 3:30 pm, local rescue teams arrived at the scene and found the wreckage of the small plane scattered and submerged in mud, with a skid mark about 100 meters long.The plane had plunged nose-first, embedding itself more than 10 meters deep into the muddy ground. The search for missing victims continues.yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cnChina and Indonesia agreed on Friday to shore up bilateral and multilateral cooperation in various fields as Foreign Minister Wang Yi co-chaired the 5th Meeting of the Joint Commission on Bilateral Cooperation between the two countries with Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi in Beijing.Both sides will ensure the high-level and secure operation of the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, and accelerate the development of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and "Two Countries, Twin Parks", the flagship projects of the Belt and Road Initiative, according to a news release issued by the foreign ministry.They will also tap the potential for cooperation in new energy vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaics, and the digital economy, as well as expand two-way investment, agricultural and food product cooperation and cultural exchanges.Both sides pledged to work together to improve global governance, enhance the representation and voice of developing countries, uphold the common interests of countries in the Global South, and explore third-party cooperation with Africa.During the meeting, Wang noted China has always viewed and developed friendly relations with Indonesia from a strategic and long-term perspective, and is willing to continuously elevate the building of a community of shared future between the two countries to new heights.China is speeding up high-quality development and expanding high-level opening-up, which Wang said will bring new opportunities for its cooperation with Indonesia and regional development.He called on the two countries to keep deepening high-level exchanges, strengthening strategic communication, consolidating strategic mutual trust and firmly supporting each other in safeguarding core interests.China and Indonesia should continuously expand mutually beneficial cooperation, deepen alignment of strategic development, he said, while highlighting a leading role of joint building of the Belt and Road cooperation in upgrading pragmatic cooperation between the two sides.Wang also urged Beijing and Jakarta to encourage exchanges among youth, think tanks and media and improve personnel facilitation to enhance mutual understanding and amity.Calling China one of the Southeast Asian country's most important strategic partners, Marsudi said Indonesia is committed to developing stronger ties with China.Indonesia is willing to work closely with China in multilateral collaboration, uphold multilateralism, and strengthen South-South cooperation, she added.KATHMANDU - Twenty people were killed and 16 others injured after an Indian passenger bus with 43 aboard skidded off the road in central Nepal on Friday, a Nepali official said.Twelve of the injured have been airlifted to the capital Kathmandu for treatment and four others shall be sent as well in a while, said Janardan Gautam, chief district officer of Tanahun district where the accident happened.The remaining seven have also been found, but their conditions are yet to be confirmed, he told Xinhua."All the 43 passengers have been retrieved, among them 20 have been killed," he said.The bus fell into the bank of the Marsyangdi river at Tanahun's Aanbookhaireni as a huge stone stopped it from falling further, said Deepak Kumar Raya, spokesperson for the district police.He told Xinhua that the accident occurred when the bus was heading to Kathmandu from Pokhara, a popular tourist attraction in Nepal.Driving becomes more difficult and dangerous in mountainous Nepal during the monsoon season.BEIJING - A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Friday urged Japan to cooperate fully in creating an independent, effective and long-term international monitoring scheme with substantive participation of its neighbors and other stakeholders over the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the ocean.Spokesperson Mao Ning made the remarks in response to a question regarding the progress of negotiations between the two sides since the Japanese government began discharging wastewater into the sea a year ago, and Japan's requests for China to lift its ban on aquatic products from Japan.Without full consultation with neighboring countries, Japan unilaterally started the discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the sea, shifting risks to the world, Mao told a press briefing, adding this practice is extremely irresponsible, and is neither in line with international law nor the way to get along with neighboring countries.China firmly opposes it and has repeatedly voiced grave concerns to the Japanese side, the spokesperson said.Mao said it was entirely legitimate, reasonable and necessary for China and other countries to take precautionary measures to protect food safety and people's health in response to the discharge.Noting China and Japan have maintained consultations on the issue of discharge, Mao stressed that the more transparent and open Japan is, the more it will help ease the concerns of the international community.China once again urges the Japanese side to seriously respond to domestic and international concerns and earnestly fulfill its responsibilities and obligations, she said. All nine people on board a small passenger plane are confirmed dead in a crash in Thailand on Thursday evening, the Thai civil aviation authority announced.Victims include four Thai nationalities and five Chinese, according to the authorities. Local news portals said five Chinese passengers, including two teens aged 12 and 13 respectively, are tourists.The plane crashed into a mangrove forest in Chachoengsao nearby Bangkok while en route from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Trat Airport. It crashed just 10 minutes after it departed at 2:46 pm on Thursday.The plane’s black box which is crucial to determine the cause of the crash is not yet found and is believed to be submerged underwater beneath the wreckage.The aircraft, flight TFT209, a Cessna Caravan C208 with registration HSSKR, operated by Thai Flying Service Co, was carrying five passengers, two flight attendants, and two pilots, according to the Department of Civil Aviation.One witness reported hearing a loud explosion before the plane crashed into the forest, with debris hitting a nearby house, according to the Nation.After receiving the crash report at 3:30 pm, local rescue teams arrived at the scene and found the wreckage of the small plane scattered and submerged in mud, with a skid mark about 100 meters long.The team did not find any bodies of the passengers initially, because the plane had plunged nose-first, embedding itself more than 10 meters deep into the muddy ground.The rescue team later found a suitcase that belonged to a foreign woman and some baby items. At 7:40 pm, the backhoe unearthed human remains at the crash site, along with various belongings, including suitcases, airplane seats, and passengers’ documents.The search for the missing victims continued. The Governor of Chachoengsao Province visited the site on Thursday, overseeing the operation to recover the wreckage and deployed backhoes to dig and clear the waterway at the crash site.Concerns and opposition persist as Saturday marks one year of Japan beginning to release contaminated water from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean.The date serves as a grim reminder of the environmental and economic impacts of a "deeply irresponsible" move, experts said. Despite assurances from Japanese authorities, skepticism remains as fears of long-term contamination and its consequences continue to grow.Despite fierce opposition both at home and abroad, Japan began discharging so-called "treated" water from the nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean, with the latest and eighth round carried out on Aug 7.The Chinese embassy in Japan expressed its firm opposition to the irresponsible move, noting that it concerns the health of all mankind, the global marine environment and international public interests, which meant it was not a private matter of Japan.The move to dump nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean "severely violates the international law" and is "highly irresponsible and selfish", drawing widespread condemnation from the international community, particularly neighboring countries that bear the brunt of the impact, Meng Xiaoxu, a researcher at the Institute of Japan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told China Daily."Under international law, states have a duty to prevent harm and must minimize trans-boundary damage," Meng said, citing the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, adopted by the International Maritime Organization in 1972, to which Japan is a signatory. The convention aims to control and prevent marine pollution by prohibiting the dumping of hazardous materials.Japan has violated other international laws such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, adopted in 1982, Meng said.South Korean environment activists staged a rally near a building that houses the Japanese embassy in Seoul on Wednesday to demand Japan stop the discharge. The country's opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung denounced Japan's action as an "act of terror".In April, Japanese civic groups submitted more than 180,000 signatures to the government, demanding an immediate stop to the release."The Japanese government has not effectively addressed the concerns of its citizens, or neighboring countries, and the international community," Wang Zhen, a research professor of international politics at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of International Relations, told China Daily. The behavior is entirely "self-serving and harmful to others, driven by narrow selfishness at the expense of others", he said.A significant leak of 25 tons of radioactive water detected this month at Fukushima, once again highlights the "management chaos "at Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the plant, Wang said.A massive earthquake and ensuing tsunami on March 11, 2011, severely damaged the nuclear reactors at the Fukushima plant, resulting in a level-7 nuclear accident, the highest on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale.In 2015, the government and TEPCO promised local fishermen and fishing federations that they would not dump nuclear-contaminated water into the sea "without the understanding of those concerned".However, in 2021, the Japanese government unilaterally decided to discharge millions of tons of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea in 2023 after "treatment and dilution", a process that can continue for decades.According to Wang, Japan initially adopted a cautious attitude. He added that the shift in 2021 was driven by the fact that TEPCO's storage tanks were projected to become full by autumn 2022.Mitsuhisa Furuichi, a parliamentarian from the Fukushima Prefecture, said the Japanese government and TEPCO opted for what they call the "cheapest" way of getting rid of the nuclear-contaminated water.The Japanese government set up a committee to determine what to do with the water, Furuichi told CGTN in April. "The committee decided that the cheapest way was to discharge the water into the sea. And since it could be done at a cost of 3 billion yen ($20 million) or so, they chose to do that … Also, about 80 billion yen was spent on 'reputation damage' control.""The primary consideration for discharge is cost-saving, rather than the environmental safety of its citizens and the international community," Wang said. "TEPCO's spending on public relations, rather than investing in nuclear security and proper treatment, further highlights the 'narrow self-interest and opportunism' of both the Japanese government and TEPCO."The "cheapest" solution turned out to be the "most costly" for the international community in terms of the nuclear risks borne by the whole of humanity, Meng said.Without sufficient scientific evidence and transparency, the irresponsible discharge will inevitably result in serious consequences, Meng added.The US State Department said in a statement in August last year the United States "is satisfied with Japan's safe, transparent, and science-based process"."There is a clear tendency among Western countries to politicize the environmental issues surrounding Japan's move," Meng said. "From a strategic perspective, the US supports its ally Japan and sees potential benefits in deteriorating Sino-Japanese relations."Some US politicians not only refrain from condemning Japan's discharge but criticize other countries' legitimate concerns and moves including the suspension of seafood imports from Fukushima, Wang said."Would the US and its Western allies remain as calm and 'satisfied'if other non-Western countries adopted similarly irresponsible practices as Japan?" Wang asked.Voting in Australia is compulsory, and while this may be considered a good thing, confusion sets in when voters cast their ballots, especially for immigrants voting for the first time.A recent survey of first-generation Chinese and South Asian migrants found more than half the Chinese said the voting system can be daunting and confusing, while just under half the South Asian respondents said the same thing.Australia's voting system is by proportional representation, where a candidate who gets 40 percent of the vote could still lose to one with 35 percent once preferences from other parties are distributed.In some elections, ballot papers have had up to 100 candidates which need to be numbered in order of preference. For example, if a Labor candidate is number 20 on the ballot paper, the voter needs to put 1 in the candidate's box and fill the rest in order of preference. A missing number or a repeated number means the ballot is spoiled and not counted.Fan Yang, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne's law school and one of those involved in the research, told China Daily the system can be confusing for migrants at first.For several years, Fan, along with colleague Sukhmani Khorana from the University of New South Wales, has been looking into Australia's voting system and how it impacts migrants.Their latest survey was conducted on first-generation Chinese and South Asian migrants. About half of those polled said they lacked political literacy and were thus unable to make an informed choice."This gap in understanding among newer migrant communities has allowed for the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation," Khorana, an expert on migrant and refugee communities, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Aug 6.Sri Lanka's tourism recovery is expected to gain further momentum on the back of a planned new promotional campaign and the nation's diverse attractions, with the sector's rebound aiding the nation's broader economic revival, experts said.Sri Lanka expects to attract 2.3 million foreign tourists this year, and 3 million in 2025, its tourism authorities said.According to the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, a new promotional campaign covering key source markets will be launched in the second week of September. The first phase of the campaign will target five countries — China, Britain, France, Germany and India.Sri Lanka's cabinet approved issuing free tourist visas to visitors from 35 countries including China, India and Russia, said cabinet spokesman and Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana on Thursday.Tourists will be given 30-day visas under a six-month pilot program that will start from Oct 1, Gunawardana told reporters at a weekly cabinet briefing.Natalia Bayona, executive director of UN Tourism, said Sri Lanka's tourism sector is distinguished by its diverse attractions, which include beaches, wildlife sanctuaries, rainforest areas, tea plantations, ancient heritage and Buddhist cultural sites."This variety appeals to a wide range of tourists like those interested in adventure and culture," she said.According to UN Tourism's World Tourism Barometer, Sri Lanka's tourism sector has shown a steady and encouraging post-pandemic recovery. While challenges remain, consistent growth in tourist arrivals demonstrates that Sri Lanka is successfully regaining its position as a popular travel destination, signaling a positive outlook for the continued recovery and expansion of its tourism sector, the UN agency said.Priantha Fernando, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, said that whatever a tourist may look for within one island, they can find it in Sri Lanka, which enjoys different climatic conditions in its various regions."For certain, China is one of our key markets," he added.Niraj de Mel, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board, said Sri Lankan tourism has different levels, offering suitable options based on travelers' budgets and preferences. For instance, the country draws in a lot of people who are attracted to beaches, as well as those who like to visit the tea estates known for cultivating the world-class Ceylon tea, he noted.Rising revenueTourism has become one of Sri Lanka's top foreign revenue generators. Statistics from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka show that the nation's earnings from tourism rose to over $1.88 billion in the first seven months of this year, a 73.3 percent increase compared to the same period last year.The industry will continue to play an indispensable role in the South Asian nation's economic recovery, analysts said.Bayona from UN Tourism said Sri Lanka offers significant opportunities for investment and trade in the tourism industry."The government's initiative to provide beach land and islets for development encourages investments in new resorts, eco-friendly accommodations, and tourism infrastructure," she said."This creates a favorable environment for economic growth, job creation, and the sustainable expansion of the tourism sector."Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story.In a significant move to bolster Thailand's creative economy, authorities are focusing on developing coastal city Pattaya into a film industry hub as part of the country's soft power strategy."Pattaya is not only well known as a tourism city, but also holds strong potential to become Thailand's 'City of Film', taking the center stage in the film and creative industries," said Arunya Keatkeaw, deputy director-general of The Government Public Relations Department.At the Pattaya Film Festival, which began on Wednesday, she highlighted Pattaya's growing role in the national economy and its contribution in promoting Thai films internationally, aiming to boost the country's global soft power and creative industries.Earlier this year, the Thai government introduced the "Ignite Thailand" development plan, which prioritizes soft power across 11 sectors, including sports, tourism and film. Soft power is seen as a way to enhance the country's economy and tourism through culture.As a crucial part in film industry, Pattaya is set to be developed into a "City of Film" and a location for film shooting. The Pattaya Film Festival aims to bring films of diverse sensibilities to audiences for free and includes a film competition, workshops and seminars.Siwat Bunkerd, deputy permanent secretary of Pattaya, said on Thursday the city aims to become a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the field of film."Under the plan, the city will be a one-stop service center for film and creative industries. In addition, a theme park covering 640,000 square meters will be built to accommodate film industry," he said, adding that some educational institutes will also provide relevant curricula and training.Thailand, recognized as one of the world's investment hubs for filmmaking, earned more than 6.6 billion baht ($192 million) from foreign filmmaking last year, the Thailand Film Office said.To enhance films that promote Thailand's soft power, the Ministry of Culture has allocated a 30 million baht ($870,000) subsidy for each film or animation film project."We believe that the development of Thailand as a center for filmmaking will also help promote other related industries, generate more employment and income and distribute wealth across regional areas," said Panidapa Suankaew, chief of the film business promotion section of Thailand Film Office.Major target marketNuanvan Daraswasdi, an expert in policy and strategy from the Ministry of Culture, said: "China is our major target market. We realized the fact when we participated in a major film festival in China years ago and surprisingly found that Chinese audiences are very interested in Thai films and TV dramas."Chalermchatri Yukol, president of the Film and Series Subcommittee of the National Soft Power Strategy Committee, highlighted the strong connections between Thailand and China, including blood ties, friendship and fruitful collaboration in the film industry.Apart from film production and investment, many education institutes offering film courses have Chinese sponsorship, he said. "Almost all the high-quality and affordable film equipment is made in China, which contributes a lot to a better future of our domestic film industry."Shared blood ties foster the same empathy between audiences in both countries, he said. "We are also discussing with Chinese authorities, hoping to introduce more Thai films to Chinese audiences."BANGKOK - Five Chinese nationals were confirmed dead in a small plane crash in Thailand's eastern province of Chachoengsao on Thursday, the Chinese embassy in Thailand told Xinhua, citing Thai authorities.A search and rescue operation is underway after the charter flight carrying two pilots and seven passengers on board crashed into a mangrove forest at around 3:10 pm local time while traveling to the eastern coastal province of Trat, said Chachoengsao Governor Chonlatee Yangtrong.According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand, the Cessna Caravan C208B aircraft flight TFT 209 operated by Thai Flying Service lost contact with air traffic control center and disappeared from radar after departing from Suvarnabhumi Airport in the capital Bangkok.SEOUL -- Six people were killed and 11 others injured as a fire broke out at a South Korean hotel, multiple local media said Thursday citing the fire authorities and the police.The fire broke out at a nine-story hotel in Bucheon, some 20 km southwest of the capital Seoul, at about 7:39 pm local time (1039 GMT).Six guests were killed, and three were seriously wounded. Eight others suffered minor injuries. The number of casualties may increase as recuse operations were underway.The fire, which started from a room on the eighth floor, did not spread throughout the hotel, but the entire building was filled with black smoke, causing casualties.Up to 46 fire vehicles and about 150 firefighters were sent to the scene for rescue operations.The China-Uzbekistan Global Allium Garden (Kunming Center) has attracted tens of thousands of visitors since its establishment. It has become a prime example of how the Belt and Road Initiative can support global biodiversity conservation. Allium is a type of flowering plant with hundreds of species, including chives and onions.The China-Uzbekistan Global Allium Garden (GAG) has two centers. The Kunming Center is part of the Kunming Botanical Garden of the Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Tashkent Center is at the Institute of Botany of the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences. The Kunming Center began construction in November 2017 and opened in April 2018. The Tashkent center started construction in May 2018.In April 2019, the construction of the China-Uzbekistan GAG was highlighted as an important demonstration platform for technological support in the Belt and Road Initiative at a State Council Information Office news conference."Central Asia and Southwestern China have a rich diversity of Allium species. Establishing the Global Allium Garden in China and Uzbekistan leverages our unique geographical advantages," said Niu Yang, deputy director of the Kunming Botanical Garden at the Kunming Institute of Botany."Our collaboration with Uzbekistan has mainly focused on two areas: collection exchange and scientific cooperation, including personnel exchanges and hosting joint academic conferences. We have also jointly trained many graduate students," Niu added.According to data from the Kunming Institute of Botany, the two Global Allium Garden centers have collected and conserved over 200 Allium species, representing one-third of the world's total. The garden is a crucial base for the conservation and research of allium species.The number of species at the two centers is expected to reach 500, according to Niu."The commonly known scallions and onions are just a small part of the Allium genus. There are nearly 1,000 species of Allium worldwide, some of which are highly ornamental and produce large flowers. Additionally, we can extract valuable compounds from these plants," Niu explained.TOKYO - Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) on Thursday decided to halt preparatory work for the test retrieval of nuclear fuel debris from one of the crippled reactors at the disaster-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.The TEPCO was set to attempt to remove a small amount of melted fuel from the No 2 unit at the plant in Fukushima Prefecture on Thursday, but setup errors were discovered during preparations in the debris retrieval device, according to the utility.The company has not said when it will try again, noting that the preparations would not resume within the day.It is the first such attempt to take out fuel debris in the 13 and a half years since the Fukushima nuclear plant was devastated by a massive earthquake and tsunami.According to the plan, the TEPCO aims to retrieve up to 3 grams of debris using a telescopic device equipped with a gripper tool. The device can extend up to 22 meters and access the debris through a penetration point in the primary containment vessel.On March 11, 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami that hit Japan's northeast led to core meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear plant operated by TEPCO, resulting in a level-7 nuclear accident, the highest on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale.Among the three reactors, No 1, 2 and 3 reactors, which suffered core meltdowns in the accident, the TEPCO chose the No 2 reactor as the first to start the fuel debris retrieval work as its reactor building was the only one not to suffer a hydrogen explosion.An estimated 880 tons of fuel debris remain in the three reactors. The experimental removal of the deadly debris was initially planned for 2021 but was postponed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic and technical difficulties.NEW DELHI -- The death toll in Wednesday's explosion at a pharmaceutical manufacturing unit in India's southern state of Andhra Pradesh rose to 17, confirmed a police officer on Thursday.More than 35 injured people were admitted to a local hospital, he added. However, some media reports stated that nearly 50 people were injured in the mishap, which was said to be the biggest in the past decade in the state.A major fire was triggered by the blast near the reactor site inside the factory in Atchutapuram Special Economic Zone of Anakapalle district, about 30 km west of Vishakhapatnam, one of the main cities of Andhra Pradesh.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences at the deaths and announced a monetary compensation from the PM National Relief Fund for the deceased's families, and those injured.BANGKOK -- Thailand reported its first suspected case of a more infectious variant of mpox in a European man who previously traveled to Africa before entering the Southeast Asian country last week, health officials said on Wednesday.According to the Department of Disease Control (DDC), the 66-year-old has been diagnosed with mpox and quarantined in a hospital, while further tests are underway to confirm if the patient contracted the Clade 1b strain of the viral disease, as initial examinations showed it was not the less severe Clade 2 strain found earlier in the country.The infected person arrived in Thailand on Aug 14 on a connecting flight from the Middle East, said DDC Director-General Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, adding that officials have dispatched a team to trace and monitor 43 individuals who had close contact with him.Authorities are stepping up preventative measures amid rising cases across Africa as health screening has been put in place at international entry points, including temperature checks and observation for skin rashes, Thongchai told a news conference.He noted that Thailand detected its first case of mpox in 2022. Over 800 cases of Clade 2 mpox have been reported so far, with about 140 cases occurring this year.The World Health Organization last week declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern amid an increasing number of cases of a deadlier new variant reported across and outside Africa.Japanese citizen groups submitted a second round of signatures requesting the immediate suspension of the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean to the Japanese government in Tokyo on Wednesday.The petition, accompanied by the first batch of 184,712 signatures collected nationwide, was submitted to the government on April 24. On Wednesday, the second batch of 22,744 signatures was handed over to officials from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, bringing the total number of signatures from the first and second rounds to 207,456.Those who signed the petition urged the Japanese government and the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, to immediately stop the ocean release of the so-called “ALPS treated water.”It has been nearly a year since Japan began releasing nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea on Aug 24, 2023.This water, processed by the Advanced Liquid Processing System, also known as ALPS, after coming into contact with fuel debris at the Fukushima plant, is being forcibly discharged into the ocean. Despite treatment, the water still contains radioactive substances which cannot be entirely removed.The Fukushima plant suffered a triple meltdown following a major earthquake and subsequent tsunami on March 11, 2011.“We hope for a world where all people connected by the sea can live safely, free from the threat of radioactive materials released by the nuclear accident,” said the petitioners.“The ocean is not just for humans; it is the source of life for all marine creatures. We desire a sustainable life where the natural environment is not further damaged, where humans and nature can coexist, where fishermen can fish without worry, where people around the world can eat seafood and enjoy the ocean without fear, and where everyone can raise their children with peace of mind and smiles on their faces,” they said.The petition, signature collection, and government negotiations were organized collaboratively by the Fukushima Peace Forum, the Citizens’ Nuclear Information Center, and the Japan Congress Against A- and H-Bombs, also known as Gensuikin.The unilateral imposition of further radioactive contamination under the pretext that “ocean release is unavoidable for decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant” is absolutely unacceptable, said Masashi Tani, secretary-general of Gensuikin.Instead of hastily releasing the water into the ocean, it is necessary to advance the development of technologies for removing radioactive substances. In the meantime, other methods such as solidifying the radioactive substances with mortar or storing them on land should be thoroughly considered and verified, said Tani.Malaysia is emerging as a champion of a multipolar global order, opting to remain nonaligned as it contends with the changing geopolitical situation, analysts said.While the United States remains one of Malaysia's biggest investors, Southeast Asia's third-biggest economy also "understands the limits and dangers of relying too heavily on the West".Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has been in power for nearly two years, has criticized the US and its allies over the prolonged conflict in the Gaza Strip, denounced "China-phobia", and rejected external interference in settling the disputes over the South China Sea. In July, Anwar sent an application to Russia, the current chair of BRICS, to join the group of emerging economies.Awang Azman Awang Pawi, associate professor at the Academy of Malay Studies in the University of Malaya, said the government seeks to position Malaysia as a neutral and nonaligned state, to help it navigate the tensions between the US and China. He said this approach also supports Malaysia's economic interests, as the country can be marketed as a politically stable and neutral location to potential investors.Malaysia has long been a proponent of nonalignment, having been a member of the Non-Aligned Movement since 1970. It established diplomatic relations with China in 1974 at the height of the Cold War.Awang Azman said Anwar's stance is a continuation of Malaysia's nonaligned foreign policy but this time with "stronger leanings toward China, reflecting a shift from previous governments that maintained closer ties with Western powers".Julia Roknifard, assistant professor at the School of Politics, History and International Relations, University of Nottingham Malaysia, said Malaysia sees the rise of a multipolar world as an opportunity, not a threat.She said Malaysia's interest in joining BRICS signifies the country's refusal to be dragged into the "negative geopolitical adventurism of the West that tilts increasingly belligerent against countries such as Russia and China".Roknifard said Malaysia also understands where its economic interests lie, as China has been its biggest trading partner for the last 15 years."Malaysia understands the limits and dangers of relying too heavily on the West."Roknifard said the US pressure against Malaysia's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict and its refusal to adhere to US sanctions against Iran and Russia is further pushing Malaysia to diversify its foreign policy. On the other hand, Malaysia has a positive view of China's mediation efforts in the Middle East, she noted.Anwar's foreign policy also resonates with the local populace. According to The State of Southeast Asia survey published in April by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, more than 80 percent of Malaysians polled ranked the Israel-Palestine conflict as their top geopolitical concern and nearly 60 percent of the respondents supported their government's stance.More than 66 percent of Malaysian respondents perceived China as the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia and over 75 percent considered China as the preferred alignment choice.BAKU - Azerbaijan has formally applied to join the BRICS group, the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday.The bid follows Azerbaijan's expression of interest at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Astana in early July this year. During the summit, a Joint Declaration on Strategic Partnership was signed between Azerbaijan and China, with one of its provisions outlining Azerbaijan's intention to join the BRICS. China has endorsed Azerbaijan's application and pledged to support its entry into the group.BRICS currently includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, with Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates also part of the bloc. BRICS has evolved into a key international forum, organizing annual summits and coordinating on various multilateral issues.Defense Minister Dong Jun met with his Vietnamese counterpart Phan Van Giang in Beijing on Tuesday.According to the Ministry of National Defense, Dong said that the meeting between the top leaders of both countries provides a new opportunity for the development of bilateral military relations.He said that China and Vietnam are a community with a shared future of strategic significance, noting that the two militaries should seize the momentum, strengthen their commitment to cooperation, and enhance the cooperation quality and efficiency across various fields.The two militaries should maintain the momentum of cooperation in areas such as political work, personnel training, joint exercises and training, and international collaboration, continuously expanding into new areas, and jointly consolidating and developing their relationship, pushing for more practical results in military cooperation, the defense chief said.Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang noted that both Vietnam and China are socialist countries led by communist parties, and the top leaders of the two parties have pointed the way for further deepening the Vietnam-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Cooperation.He said that Vietnam is willing to continue strengthening cooperation with China in areas such as mutual visits of delegations and friendly exchanges along the border, aiming to elevate the relationship between the two militaries to new heights.TOKYO - Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) decided Tuesday to hold its presidential election on Sept 27 to select a successor to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, local media reported.The upcoming election, the first since 2021 when Kishida was elected party's leader, is expected to see about a dozen lawmakers vie for the post to succeed Kishida, with the winner to be anointed prime minister given the ruling coalition controls both houses of parliament, Kyodo News reported.Kishida, whose three-year term as LDP president expires at the end of September, made a surprise announcement last week that he will step down without seeking re-election, leading a wide field of LDP figures to consider running, the report said.Former economic security minister Takayuki Kobayashi, 49, on Monday became the first to throw his hat into the ring for the LDP presidency.The LDP decided to start on Sept 12 a 15-day campaigning period for the race, a few days longer than the more common 12 days, in an apparent bid to improve transparency in hopes of restoring public trust in the party following a slush funds scandal, Kyodo News said.More than 10 candidates have emerged in the Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race, after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida decided not to seek reelection for the presidency.The LDP is considering holding its leadership election on Sept 27, Jiji Press reported on Monday.Kishida faced mounting pressure from LDP lawmakers who fear the party would face significant losses in upcoming elections under his leadership.On Monday, Takayuki Kobayashi, former minister of economic security, officially announced his candidacy. That same day, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa told reporters at Tokyo's Haneda Airport before her trip to India that she is preparing for her candidacy.Unlike previous LDP leadership races, which typically featured a 12-day campaign period, this election will have an extended timeline to allow for more local debates, The Nikkei newspaper reported."Today's LDP lacks the kind of heavyweight politicians it once had," Takakage Fujita, secretary-general of the Association for Inheriting and Propagating the Murayama Statement, a Japanese civic group, told China Daily."As a result, while more than 10 politicians have expressed their intention to run in the race, none of them have presented a grand vision or a comprehensive plan for Japan's future."The Asahi Shimbun commented that Kishida's government has gone awry after losing public trust and failing to present concrete measures to regain it.Satoshi Tomisaka, a professor at the Institute of World Studies at Takushoku University, said dissatisfaction has erupted among younger members of the LDP, who believe they cannot win the next general election.Kishida failed to gain the support of LDP Vice-President Taro Aso, a key figure he had relied on, Tomisaka told China Daily."The most important factor leading to Kishida's decision seems to be the significant decline in his approval ratings. The LDP remains in power not because of its superiority, but as a result of elimination, with voters concluding that it is still better than the opposition," he said.Public support for Kishida's cabinet was 19.4 percent this month, below 20 percent for the ninth straight month, according to a recent opinion poll published by Jiji Press.Public dissatisfaction with the Kishida administration and Japan's political scene is mostly directed at economic issues, Tomisaka said.The LDP covering up problems associated with the issues of politics and money has also led to public disappointment, experts said.Fujita said changing leaders is a tactic that the LDP has repeatedly used. "When facing a crisis, the LDP changes its party leader, who is also the prime minister, to instill a sense of renewal among the public, thereby making them forget about past money politics and corruption."The LDP could potentially secure victory in the next general election, allowing the ruling coalition with the Komeito party to continue, he added.Fujita urged the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition party, to avoid this outcome by fielding a capable candidate, energizing their leadership race and preventing the LDP from dominating Japan's television and newspapers for the next month.The China Coast Guard took control measures on Monday against Philippine Coast Guard vessels, which successively intruded into the waters near Xianbin Reef and Ren'ai Reef, as the Chinese side accused the Philippines of "attempting to seek a long-term presence" at Xianbin Reef.One of the Philippine vessels "deliberately rammed" a Chinese law enforcement ship "in a dangerous manner" at Xianbin Reef, causing a collision, Chinese authorities said on Monday, noting that the China Coast Guard's response was "professional, standardized, reasonable and lawful".On Monday, the CCG issued five consecutive statements, detailing the provocative actions of the two Philippine Coast Guard vessels and releasing video footage of one Philippine vessel deliberately ramming a Chinese ship twice at Xianbin Reef.Gan Yu, a spokesman for the CCG, said in a statement that two Philippine Coast Guard vessels illegally intruded into the adjacent waters of Xianbin Reef in China's Nansha Islands without the Chinese government's permission, prompting the CCG to take control measures in accordance with the law.At 3:24 am, one of the Philippine vessels ignored multiple stern warnings from the Chinese side and deliberately rammed a Chinese law enforcement vessel in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, causing a collision, he said, noting that the responsibility for this lies entirely with the Philippine side.However, the Philippine Coast Guard's provocations did not stop at Xianbin Reef.At around 6 am on Monday, the Philippine vessel that deliberately rammed the Chinese ship ignored repeated warnings and navigation controls from the Chinese side, and illegally intruded into the waters near Ren'ai Reef following its provocation at Xianbin Reef, according to the CCG.Gan said in a separate statement that the CCG also took control measures against the offending Philippine vessel in accordance with the law and regulations.The Philippine side's repeated provocations have violated the temporary arrangement between China and the Philippines on the supply of living materials to a Philippine warship, which has been illegally grounded at Ren'ai Reef for 25 years, seriously infringing on China's sovereignty and severely undermining regional peace and stability, Gan said. "We sternly warn the Philippine side to immediately cease its infringing provocations. Otherwise, it will bear all the consequences arising from such actions," he added.In another statement, Gan said that the CCG monitored and controlled the Philippine vessels effectively during the whole process in accordance with laws and regulations."China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, including Xianbin and Ren'ai reefs, and their adjacent waters," he said. "The China Coast Guard will continue to carry out law enforcement activities in the waters under China's jurisdiction in accordance with the law, resolutely thwart any infringements and provocations, and safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests."Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday that the Philippines' action at Xianbin Reef was "attempting to resupply a Philippine Coast Guard vessel anchored in the reef's lagoon, seeking to achieve a long-term presence".She emphasized that Xianbin Reef, which is part of China's Nansha Islands, is both China's inherent territory and an uninhabited reef."This action by the Philippines has seriously infringed upon China's sovereignty, gravely violated the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and severely jeopardized peace and stability in the South China Sea," Mao said."China firmly opposes such actions and will continue to take resolute and strong measures in accordance with the law to safeguard its territorial and maritime rights and interests, and to uphold the DOC."According to media reports, a Philippine Coast Guard vessel entered the lagoon of the reef without China's permission in April and has been there since then.Liu Lin, a professor of international strategy at the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that with the recent provocations by the Philippines, the scope of the China-Philippines dispute in the South China Sea has now expanded to Xianbin Reef, in addition to Huangyan Island and Ren'ai Reef."The Philippines is attempting to establish a permanent presence on the uninhabited Xianbin Reef by keeping a vessel anchored there," she said. "Meanwhile, it also intends to divert China's attention through this move, although it's fully aware of China's vigilant stance regarding its intentions."However, China is resolutely determined to ensure that the Philippines' objectives will not be achieved, Liu emphasized.Additionally, China's statements serve as a clear warning and deterrent, the expert noted."Should the Philippine side continue to escalate its provocations, China's countermeasures will inevitably escalate accordingly," she said.jiangchenglong@chinadaily.com.cn China rolled out the red carpet on Monday for Vietnam's top leader To Lam, and the two socialist countries vowed to further enhance their comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and advance the building of a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance.During their talks at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Chinese president, welcomed Lam's state visit to China, which is the Vietnamese leader's first overseas trip since he became general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee on Aug 3.Xi said the visit reflects the great importance Lam attaches to the relations between the two parties and the two countries, and also embodies the high level and strategic importance of China-Vietnam ties.Lam succeeded Nguyen Phu Trong, who passed away last month, and has been serving as the Vietnamese president since May.The first stop of Lam's three-day state visit to China, which started on Sunday, took him to Guangzhou, Guangdong province, where former leader of Vietnam Ho Chi Minh spent time promoting revolutionary activities around a century ago.Saying that the traditional friendship between the two parties and the two countries is as good as "comrades and brothers", Xi called for consistent efforts to build the China-Vietnam community with a shared future, a consensus reached between the two sides during his visit to Vietnam in December.China regards Vietnam as a priority in its neighborhood diplomacy, Xi said.Noting that both countries are at a critical stage of national development and revitalization, he underlined the need for them to solidify a pattern for the development of bilateral relations featuring higher political mutual trust, more substantial security cooperation, deeper pragmatic collaboration, stronger public support, closer multilateral coordination and better management of differences.China is willing to maintain close strategic communication and high-level exchanges with Vietnam, and actively explore ways to expand the synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative and Vietnam's Two Corridors and One Economic Circle strategy, he said.Xi also emphasized the need for both sides to step up the connectivity of railway, highway and port infrastructure, enhance connectivity of smart customs, and work together to build secure and stable industrial and supply chains.Lam highlighted the importance of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries, emphasizing that China is a strategic choice and top priority in Vietnam's foreign policy.The CPV and the Vietnamese government will inherit Trong's legacy, uphold the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist path, and steadfastly advance on the path jointly set by the older generations of leaders of both countries, especially Trong and Xi, he said.Lam told Xi that Vietnam adheres to independence and autonomy, firmly upholds the one-China policy and considers Taiwan an inseparable part of Chinese territory. He added that his country resolutely opposes any form of "Taiwan independence" separatist activities and firmly supports China in achieving reunification.Lam also expressed Vietnam's willingness to work with China to properly manage maritime disputes, in order to jointly maintain regional peace and stability.Vietnam is ready to have closer coordination with China on international affairs, and uphold multilateralism as well as international fairness and justice to contribute to world peace and development, he said.After their talks, both leaders witnessed the signing of multiple bilateral cooperation agreements in various fields such as Party schools, mutual connectivity, industry, finance, customs inspection and health.Observers said that Lam's visit marks a milestone in China-Vietnam relations, which will be an example of a new pattern of cooperation between two socialist countries facing challenges and tasks of modernization based on a similar historical trajectory and common international environment.Hannan Hussain, co-founder and senior expert at Initiate Futures, a policy think tank based in Islamabad, Pakistan, said the visit is an occasion for both countries to take stock of their cooperation achievements, promote a common vision for aligning markets, and increase favorable exposure for their industries and manufacturers.China has been Vietnam's top trading partner for many years. Vietnam is China's top trading partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China's fourth-largest trading partner globally. Trade between China and Vietnam reached $229.8 billion in 2023, according to the Foreign Ministry.Hussain said Lam's visit is expected to play a crucial role in expanding future investments, fast-tracking development projects and promoting new directions for trade and industrial cooperation.caodesheng@chinadaily.com.cn Bangladesh's interim government said it plans to hold national elections soon after introducing vital reforms, adding that its top priority is to bring the law and order situation under control.At the same time, the administration said it will undertake robust and far-reaching economic reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and sustain growth."We will hold a free, fair participatory election as soon as we can complete our mandate to carry out vital reforms in our election commission, judiciary, civil administration, security forces and media," said Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser to the interim government. The interim government was formed after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and left the country on Aug 5 after weeks of student-led protests that even stormed her official residence in Dhaka.Yunus was speaking during a meeting with diplomats in Dhaka on Aug 18. "We will be close to normalcy within a short period of time, with the unwavering support of our people and patriotic armed forces. The police force has also resumed their operations," he noted.The government has instructed all the educational institutions across the country to resume academic activities from Aug 18 after about one month of closure. All the educational institutions at secondary and higher secondary levels, as well as polytechnic institutes were declared closed for an indefinite period from July 17 amid tensions over students' demonstrations.In addition, a circular from the Bangladesh Central Bank on Aug 17, said that commercial banks are now required to raise cash withdrawal limits to 300,000 taka ($2,542) per account daily, up from the previous limit of 200,000 taka. On Aug 8, the interim government limited cheque withdrawals to 100,000 taka.Meanwhile, the Financial Times newspaper reported on Aug 18 that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accused Bangladesh's interim government of failing to protect the Hindu minority and creating tensions in the country.But Yunus told the diplomats at the meeting on Aug 18 that the government will ensure the safety and security of all religious and ethnic groups.He added that the government will nurture friendly relations with all countries in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding and shared interests.Bangladesh's Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said last week that the interim government is keen to work closely with China. His remarks came after Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen paid a courtesy call on him."Hon'ble Foreign Adviser stated the importance of the historic relations between Bangladesh and China and said that the interim government is keen to work closely with China," Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a post on Facebook."I also said that the people of Bangladesh view China positively," Hossain told media, adding that "regardless of government changes, relations will always be good".UN officials said that a team will visit Bangladesh this week to set up a probe into the hundreds of deaths that occurred during the student-led protests.An independent inquiry commission will be funded and led by the UN, according to Gwyn Lewis, the UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh, who met in Dhaka with Hossai.Xinhua contributed to the story.vivienxu@chinadailyapac.comAn updated AUKUS agreement tabled in the Australian parliament on Aug 12 has done nothing to dispel concerns about the controversial A$368 billion ($245 million) nuclear submarine deal.The AUKUS pact, comprising Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, allows the UK or the US to withdraw with one year's notice.The deal calls on the US and the UK to "not unreasonably" withhold information, material or equipment, but it can be canceled if it undermines the military capabilities or naval nuclear programs of the partner countries.The revelation has sparked a renewed political storm over Australia's sovereignty and forced Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government on the defensive.Former prime minister Paul Keating has weighed in on the debate with a stinging attack on the government and its relationship with the US.In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Aug 8, Keating said the submarine deal will turn Australia into the "51st state of the United States".He described the current Labor government as a "sellout"."In defense and foreign policy, this is not a Labor government. This is a party which has adopted the defense and foreign policies of the Morrison Liberal government," he said.Scott Morrison, who was prime minister from 2018 to 2022, was the prime mover of the AUKUS deal.Keating, who has been a critic of the AUKUS deal from its inception, called it the "worst deal in history"."This government has sold out to the United States," he said.Alison Broinowski, former diplomat and past president of Australians for War Powers Reform, told China Daily the agreement is "full of holes".Under the AUKUS nuclear submarine agreement, announced in San Diego, California, last year, Australia will buy at least three Virginia-class submarines from the US in the 2030s while nuclear-powered submarines are built. The nuclear submarines are dependent on US naval shipyards and the US Navy's submarine program.The out clause "appears to mean the US or UK", Broinowski said."It also appears to leave Australia responsible for all the costs from the start of the program until that date (of termination)," she said.'No clarity'Defense Minister Richard Marles has said no nuclear waste will be stored in Australia, she said. "But there is no clarity about how or where that waste is generated. It could involve waste from US operations in Fremantle (Western Australia) or Darwin or elsewhere."The agreement matches the ANZUS security treaty "in obliterating Australia's independence and security", she added. "Australians are being underinformed or deceived by the government they elected."Marty Branagan, a senior lecturer in peace studies at the University of New England in the Australian state of New South Wales, said Keating described the AUKUS deal as the largest defense project since World War II and the worst foreign policy mistake since a failed bid to introduce conscription during WW I."The agreement came about with no public consultation, supported by a 'Red Alert' series of fearmongering front-page articles in Australia's Nine newspapers in consultation with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which has close ties to arms dealers, and which argued for greater defense capabilities to resist a supposedly imminent war with China," he told China Daily."Yet China and Australia have a mutually beneficial trade relationship which this deal will harm."It will contribute to a regional arms race which could have disastrous consequences. It is already shifting valuable resources away from the more pressing threat of global warming facing both countries."Australian Greens party's defense spokesman David Shoebridge said the agreement was riddled with "multiple escape hatches" for the US.The new AUKUS agreement says that if at any point the US thinks supplying material under the AUKUS agreement to Australia prejudices their defense, they can effectively terminate the agreement and pull out, Shoebridge said.He called on the government to be "honest about the size of the gamble"."The growing national movement wants an end to AUKUS, claiming that its cost and the open-ended commitment to foreign military priorities are to the detriment of priorities for a resilient, safe and peaceful Australian society," he said.Indonesian President Joko Widodo led the celebration of the country's 79th Independence Day in the planned new capital Nusantara on Saturday, a symbolic move that showcases balanced development.Officially known as Ibu Kota Nusantara, the future capital is carved from the lush rainforest of East Kalimantan Province on Borneo Island, about 1,260 kilometers north of the current capital Jakarta.While analysts said the relocation can help distribute development outside Java island and promote a green city, concerns remain about construction delays and funding gaps in establishing Nusantara.The celebration featured a flag ceremony at the State Palace compound and was attended by 1,300 people, including first lady Iriana, president-elect Prabowo Subianto and foreign diplomats.The State Palace is only one of the few infrastructures that have been built, with Nusantara expected to be fully developed by 2045."Indonesia is a very large country; equality in all regions is needed," Widodo said after the ceremony, state news agency Antara reported. "Eastern, central and western regions must get the same cake."Apart from the grand ceremony in Nusantara, celebrations were also held at Merdeka Palace in Jakarta, with various competitions and celebrations taking place in recent days.Sawidji Widoatmodjo, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Business at Tarumanagara University in Jakarta, said there is nothing wrong with relocating the capital — an idea first floated by president Sukarno in 1957. "But the problem (we) faced then ... is the same as now. It is funding," he said.Rezha Bayu Oktavian Arief, co-founder and CEO of Obviously Sustainable, a social enterprise and advisory firm in Jakarta, lauded the government's commitment to the project but highlighted the "significant challenges" in attracting foreign investors."From what we have gathered, the primary obstacles revolve around policies and regulations, particularly concerning land management rights in (Nusantara), which continue to be a contentious issue," Arief said.Relocating the capital is estimated to cost more than $30 billion. On Aug 12, Widodo announced at his first cabinet meeting in Nusantara that 56.2 trillion rupiah ($3.58 billion) has already been invested in the future capital.Jakarta's challengesApart from distributing wealth in other regions, Widodo said earlier that relocating the capital would also relieve Jakarta's huge environmental challenges. The city, home to 10 million people, suffers from regular flooding and is one of the fastest-sinking cities because of the excessive extraction of groundwater.The new capital is being envisioned as a smart city, featuring accessible public transport and social services, a diverse community, low-carbon energy sources and more than 75 percent green governmental zones.Bernadia Irawati Tjandradewi, secretary-general of United Cities and Local Governments Asia-Pacific in Jakarta, said the government's thrust on developing Nusantara as a smart city "will not only improve the quality of people's life through technology and innovation, but it will also push equal distribution of development across Indonesia".Josua Pardede, chief economist at PermataBank in Jakarta, lauded the government for being selective of investors because this will ensure that investments are aligned with its vision for Nusantara's development."The government will get high-quality investment and will not merely strive for the quantity," he said.But he said it might be difficult for Prabowo's administration to realize the public-private partnership framework adopted by his predecessor. The framework needs to be developed into a more detailed program to make it easier for investors to calculate their return on investment, he added.Leonardus Jegho is a freelance journalist for China Daily.The China Coast Guard said on Monday that the Philippine Coast Guard vessels illegally intruded into the adjacent waters of Xianbin Reef and Ren'ai Reef in the South China Sea early Monday morning without China's government permission, with one vessel "deliberately ramming" a Chinese law enforcement ship "in a dangerous manner".The coast guard took control measures in accordance with the law at both reefs and accused the Philippines of violating the temporary arrangement between China and the Philippines on the supply of living materials to the Philippine warship, which has stayed illegally grounded at Ren'ai Reef for 25 years, seriously infringing on China's sovereignty and severely undermining regional peace and stability.On Monday morning, the China Coast Guard issued four consecutive statements, detailing the provocative actions of the two Philippine Coast Guard vessels and releasing video footage of the Philippine vessel deliberately ramming Chinese ship twice at Xianbin Reef.Gan Yu, a spokesman for the coast guard, said in a statement that on Monday the two Philippine Coast Guard vessels illegally intruded into the adjacent waters of Xianbin Reef in China's Nansha Islands without China's permission, prompting the coast guard to take control measures in accordance with the law.At around 3:24 am, one of the Philippine vessels ignored multiple stern warnings from the Chinese side and deliberately rammed a Chinese law enforcement vessel in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, causing a collision, he said, noting that the responsibility lies entirely with the Philippine side."We sternly warn the Philippine side to immediately cease its infringing provocations. Otherwise, it will bear all the consequences arising from such actions," Gan said.China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, including Xianbin Reef, and their adjacent waters, he said."The China Coast Guard will continue to carry out rights protection and law enforcement activities in the waters under China's jurisdiction in accordance with the law, resolutely safeguarding national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights," said the spokesman.However, at around 6 am on Monday, the Philippine vessel that deliberately rammed the Chinese ship in Xianbin Reef ignored repeated warnings and navigation controls from the Chinese side, and illegally intruded into the waters near Ren'ai Reef following its provocation in Xianbin Reef, according to the coast guard.Gan said in a separate statement that the coast guard also took control measures against the offending Philippine vessel in accordance with the law and regulations."The Philippine side's repeated provocations have violated the temporary arrangement between China and the Philippines on the supply of living materials to the illegally grounded Philippine vessel at Ren'ai Reef, seriously infringing on China's sovereignty and severely undermining regional peace and stability," he said.The spokesman warned again of all the consequences arising from such infringing provocations of the Philippine side.China and Fiji signed multiple agreements on Sunday on bilateral cooperation in fields including trade and infrastructure construction as part of a wide-ranging partnership between China and Pacific island countries.Premier Li Qiang and visiting Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka witnessed the signing of the documents following their talks at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Rabuka is on a 10-day official visit to China that started on Aug 12.Highlighting that Fiji was the first Pacific island nation to establish diplomatic relations with China, Li told Rabuka that China has always regarded Fiji as one of its most important partners in the South Pacific region.He said that China consistently supports the Fijian people in choosing their own development path, and is willing to take next year's 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries as an opportunity to strengthen bilateral relations and continue being true friends who trust and support each other.Li called for enhancing high-level exchanges and interactions at various levels between China and Fiji to promote the healthy and stable development of their comprehensive strategic partnership.The premier underlined the need for both countries to further leverage their advantages in economic complementarity to deepen partnership in infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries, light industry, education, tourism, poverty reduction and other areas within the framework of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, in order to promote shared development.China is willing to import more high-quality products from Fiji and support Chinese enterprises in investing and establishing businesses in the Pacific island country, Li said.Noting that both China and Fiji are members of the Global South, Li expressed China's willingness to enhance communication and coordination with Fiji and other Pacific island countries, actively implement initiatives proposed by President Xi Jinping, including the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and jointly advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world as well as inclusive and universally beneficial economic globalization.Rabuka expressed his admiration for China's achievements and growing influence under the leadership of Xi, emphasizing that Fiji always regards China as its reliable partner.He said that Fiji firmly adheres to the one-China principle and supports China-proposed initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.Fiji is ready to deepen cooperation with China in areas such as trade and infrastructure construction, and promote cooperation between Pacific island countries and China, he added.In July last year, Xi, while expounding on China's policy toward Pacific island countries during a meeting with Manasseh Sogavare, prime minister of the Solomon Islands, made it clear that China fully respects the sovereignty and independence of Pacific island countries, fully respects their will, fully respects their cultural traditions, and fully respects their unity and self-reliance.Rabuka met with Xi for the first time in November in San Francisco in the United States on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders' Meeting. He is set to meet with Xi again during his stay in Beijing.caodesheng@chinadaily.com.cnISLAMABAD - Torrential rains and flash floods starting in July have killed 187 people and injured 333 others in different parts of Pakistan, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has reported.Ninety-six children and 30 women were among the dead, the NDMA said in a report on Saturday.The eastern Punjab province was the worst affected area with 68 deaths, followed by the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the southern Sindh provinces with 65 and 32 deaths, respectively, said the report.It added that 13 people were killed in the southwestern Balochistan province, five were killed in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and four died in the northern Gilgit-Baltistan region.The NDMA also noted that 352 livestock animals have perished while 2,293 houses and 30 bridges were damaged during the cited period.SEOUL - Lee Jae-myung, South Korea's former liberal presidential candidate, on Sunday won his second two-year term as leader of the main opposition Democratic Party with the highest-ever vote in the party's history.Lee was re-elected as the party chief by garnering 85.4 percent of the votes, including ballots cast by party members and opinion polls from the general public.It topped the previous high of 77.7 percent, which Lee obtained in the party's previous national convention in 2022.BEIJING - General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and Vietnamese President To Lam arrived in Beijing on Sunday. BANGKOK - Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has appointed Paetongtarn Shinawatra as the country's prime minister, Secretary-General of the House of Representatives Arpath Sukhanunth announced on Sunday.In a ceremony held on Sunday morning at the Pheu Thai Party headquarters, Arpath delivered the royal command stating that Paetongtarn has been appointed premier as she received majority support in the parliamentary vote on Aug. 16.The royal endorsement paves the way for a cabinet formation as the 37-year-old officially assumes office as the youngest and second female prime minister in the Southeast Asian nation.In her first official speech as prime minister, Paetongtarn said she will collaborate with the legislative branch during the remaining three years of the parliamentary term and create space to listen to every opinion with the goal of propelling Thailand forward with unwavering determination."My hope is to harmonize the strengths of all generations, uniting individuals from all corners of Thailand, whether they serve in the government, belong to political parties, work in the private sector, or are fellow citizens," Paetongtarn said in the nationally televised ceremony."I accept this responsibility with the utmost dedication and will make Thailand a land of opportunity and happiness, where every citizen stands on equal ground."Paetongtarn, the youngest daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, entered politics in 2021 as Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Participation and Innovation of the Pheu Thai Party. She was a leading prime ministerial candidate of the Pheu Thai Party in last year's general election and later became the party's leader.GUANGZHOU - General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and Vietnamese President To Lam arrived in Guangzhou on Sunday and started his state visit to China. BANGKOK - Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been included in a royal pardon to end his jail term earlier than scheduled, his lawyer Winyat Chatmontree said on Saturday.Winyat made the confirmation following an earlier issued Royal Gazette, which announced that three categories of prisoners will be pardoned on the occasion of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's 72nd birthday anniversary.The royal pardon will take effect on Sunday, allowing Thaksin, who is currently on parole, to be free two weeks earlier than the scheduled date.Winyat added that the former prime minister will receive a certificate from the prison assuring his freedom.The 74-year-old former prime minister returned to Thailand from self-exile last year and was previously convicted of multiple charges. He was released on parole in February from a police hospital in Bangkok, where he spent six months serving a one-year prison sentence.Thaksin served as the Southeast Asian country's prime minister from 2001 to 2006 and had been in self-exile abroad since 2008.COLOMBO -- Sri Lankan tourism authorities are expecting 3 million foreign tourists in 2025, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau Managing Director Nalin Perera has said.From the second week of September, Sri Lankan tourism authorities will launch a promotional campaign covering key source markets, Perera said on Friday.Perera said the first phase of the campaign will target China, Britain, France, Germany, and India, while the second phase of the campaign will target Russia, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Poland, Italy, as well as Scandinavia, the Middle East and the Benelux countries. These campaigns are expected to increase tourist arrivals by 700,000 next year.Perera said over 1.2 million tourists have arrived in Sri Lanka by Aug 12 and another 1.1 million are expected to arrive during the coming months, particularly from October to December. Sri Lanka expects to attract 2.3 million tourists in 2024.Tourism is one of Sri Lanka's top foreign revenue generators. Sri Lanka's earnings from tourism rose to over $1.88 billion in the first seven months of 2024, a 73.3-percent increase year on year, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka said in its latest weekly report.NEW DELHI -- Twenty-two coaches of a passenger train derailed Saturday in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, officials said.The accident took place after the train's engine hit a boulder near Govindpuri station in Kanpur, about 96 km southwest of Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh.However, no loss of life or injury was reported.India's Federal Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the accident was caused after the train's engine hit an "object placed on the track."Local media reported that the passengers heard a loud noise before the train started shaking and eventually stopped.Reports quoting officials said the track was damaged for up to 50 meters and even the clip that holds the track in place had come off. The cattle guard (front of the engine) was badly damaged in the accident.Railway authorities have ordered an investigation into the accident.Last month, two people were killed and 20 others injured after 18 coaches of a passenger train derailed in Jharkhand.In June, at least 15 people were killed and 60 others injured when a goods train crashed into the rear of a stationary passenger train in West Bengal.KOLKATA — Holding candles, hundreds of thousands of women marched through the night in cities across India to protest the brutal rape and murder of a young female doctor in a hospital that has fueled anger over a lack of safety for women despite tough new laws.A 31-year-old trainee doctor was raped and murdered inside the medical college in Kolkata where she worked last Friday, triggering nationwide protests among doctors and drawing parallels to the notorious gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012."We have come here to demand justice because even I have a daughter. I am scared to send her anywhere ... I am scared to send my daughter to study," said Rinky Ghosh, who took part in a protest in Kolkata. "So I am here today because something ... must be done, this injustice must stop."The doctor had retired to sleep on a piece of carpet in a seminar room in the R. G. Kar Medical College after a marathon 36-hour shift, given the lack of any dorms or resting rooms for doctors on the premises, her colleagues told Reuters.She was found dead on Friday. Police said she had been raped and murdered and a police volunteer was subsequently arrested in connection with the crime.Many government hospitals in cities across India suspended all services except emergency departments earlier this week, as junior doctors sat outside in protest, demanding justice.The victim was found bleeding from her eyes and mouth, with injuries to her legs, stomach, ankles, right hand and finger, a doctor's inquest report on Aug 9 that was accessed by Reuters said.In protests called "Reclaim the Night", women marched across several Indian cities from midnight on Wednesday, on the eve of the country's 78th Independence Day, to protest against the lack of safety for women in India."As a society, we have to think about the atrocities being committed against our mothers, daughters and sisters. There is outrage against this in the country. I can feel this outrage," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an Independence Day address to the nation on Thursday.The 2012 Delhi rape case was seen as a turning point in attitudes toward women's safety in Indian society. It triggered huge protests and was the catalyst for rapid change in laws tackling crimes against women.These included fast-track courts for swifter convictions in such cases.Crimes against women in India rose 4 percent in 2022 from the previous year, data released late last year from the National Crime Records Bureau showed.Agencies via XinhuaIndonesian President Joko Widodo presented the 2025 budget proposal to the parliament on Friday, with Southeast Asia's biggest economy expected to expand by 5.2 percent next year.Widodo, whose second and final term as president will end in October, said Indonesia "is one of the few countries that had been able to recover sooner" in the post-pandemic era, with average GDP growth topping 5 percent in the past few years. The Indonesian government is targeting 5.2 percent growth this year.Education, healthcare, connectivity and the development of the new capital city Nusantara are among the priorities outlined in the proposed budget. Members of parliament have been deliberating the 2025 budget plan since May and will discuss the budget plan with incoming president Prabowo Subianto.Widodo said inflation this year is kept under control at 2 to 3 percent. He said the inflation target in 2025 is set at around 2.5 percent.He also expects the rupiah to trade at 16,100 against the US dollar with the 10-year government bond yield at 7.1 percent. Indonesian crude oil prices are estimated at $82 per barrel.The proposed budget has allocated state spending at 3,613.1 trillion rupiah ($230.2 million), which includes 2,693.2 trillion rupiah for central government spending and 919.9 trillion rupiah for transfer to the regions. The 2025 budget deficit is planned at 2.53 percent of GDP, equivalent to 616.2 trillion rupiah.Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at Solaris Strategies Singapore, said by outlining the economic gains of his administration, Widodo is telling both the domestic and international audience that the Indonesia he passes on to Prabowo is "on the rapid ascendancy because of the collective efforts of his administration"."Widodo has left an indelible mark on the political history of Indonesia and he will be seen favorably in generations to come," he said.Josua Pardede, the chief economist at the Jakarta-based Permata-Bank, said the proposed 2025 budget would help Indonesia escape the middle-income trap by leveraging the country's demographic bonus, continuing economic transformation, enhancing investment attractiveness and creating more job opportunities.Pardede said that given the relatively stagnant global economy, domestic demand will be the key driver of Indonesia's economic growth. He said inflation control, job creation and support for social welfare programs and subsidies can support household spending.Widodo also said in his speech that Indonesia has taken great leaps in boosting productivity and has focused on exporting processed products instead of raw materials.Although many other countries lodged complaints against Indonesia, and even tried to abort the country's efforts, "we, as a sovereign state, as a great nation, will not falter, and even we will leap forward", Widodo said, alluding to his administration's downstream policy.The leader of the ruling Pheu Thai Party, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was elected as the 31st prime minister of Thailand and is also the country's second woman in the post, the House of Representatives announced on Friday.As Thailand's youngest prime minister, the 37-year-old Paetongtarn gained 319 votes in the election. There are 493 elected House representatives and a total of 489 MPs were present in the chamber on Friday.Her success came two days after the Constitutional Court removed Srettha Thavisin from the prime minister's post, after finding him guilty of violating ethical standards due to the appointment of a former lawyer who was once jailed to his cabinet.Both Paetongtarn and Srettha are from the Pheu Thai Party, which came in second at the 2023 election but formed a ruling coalition.Paetongtarn is the youngest daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose younger sister Yingluck Shinawatra was also prime minister from 2011 to 2014.Sorawong Thienthong, Pheu Thai's secretary-general, nominated Paetongtarn as the sole prime ministerial candidate on Friday morning when Parliament President Wan Muhamad Noor Matha began the House meeting at 10 am.Anutin Charnvirakul, leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, the coalition's second-largest group, said that to ensure continuity in governance, coalition parties are prepared to collaborate with and support Paetongtarn in her bid for the premiership.Paetongtarn said she would continue with the government's policies. "The country has to move ahead. We are determined, together and we will push the country forward," Paetongtarn told The Nation after winning Pheu Thai's nomination."She will be under scrutiny. Also, she will be under a lot of pressure and have to rely on her father," Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University, said in an interview with The Nation.Paetongtarn spent her childhood steeped in the country's tumultuous politics. Educated at elite schools in Thailand and then going to university in the United Kingdom, she spent some years working at the Shinawatra family's Rende hotel group, where her husband serves as deputy chief investment officer.Last October, after Pheu Thai navigated a circuitous route to form government, Paetongtarn was anointed the party's leader. She reaffirmed that Pheu Thai will continue with its important mission in improving people's livelihoods.Despite being relatively new to politics, a person from the young generation like Paetongtarn will be a strength instead of a hindrance, Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries, said.He believes that she will be a bridge between the new and old generations. "Most policies put forward by the government will continue as planned," he said.China congratulates Paetongtarn on her election as Thai prime minister, and believes that the Thai people will make greater achievements on the development path in line with their own national conditions, China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday.The statement added that China is willing to further work with Thailand to build a China-Thailand community with a shared future.yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cnChina will deepen cooperation with ASEAN countries in all dimensions, utilizing nuclear technology and further boosting the region's sustainable development, officials from the China Atomic Energy Authority, or CAEA, said on Friday."We will establish a regular dialogue mechanism among government sectors, research institutes and enterprises to further expand civil use of nuclear technology, benefiting local people and the green development," Huang Ping, secretary-general of the authority, said.Speaking at the China-ASEAN Forum on Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Technology held in Bangkok, Huang said the implementation of nuclear technology in the region will cover a wide range of areas, including security checks, crop seed breeding, sewage treatment and medication."We will make joint efforts to boost professional exchanges and expand training programs, aiming to further help the region to cultivate domestic talent and achieve their own development," he said.To promote exchanges and cooperation between China and ASEAN countries and further advance the civil uses of nuclear energy, the forum was held during the Thailand National Science and Technology Fair, attracting experts from several countries, including Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Indonesia."The forum serves as an important platform for exchanges and to promote cooperation. As we all have realized the need of ASEAN countries in developing their energy solutions and related technical support," Permsuk Sutchaphiwat, the permanent secretary of the Thai Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, said.To achieve the carbon dioxide emissions peak by 2045 and net-zero emissions by 2060, collaboration is needed in building the first nuclear power plant in Indonesia, said Agus Puji Prasetyono, a member of the Indonesia National Energy Council."Under the support of China's technology and experiences, it will be less difficult for us to achieve our development goal despite the current challenges," he said.As a major country in the application of nuclear technology, China has accumulated decades of technological expertise and industrial experience.China National Nuclear Corporation, as a leading nuclear corporation in China, has implemented various projects with ASEAN countries, and has made substantial contributions.As comprehensive strategic partners, China and ASEAN countries have established successful cooperation in various fields of nuclear technology application.So far, the CAEA has helped Thailand to establish its first electron beam irradiation disinfection and sterilization project. In Malaysia, a gamma irradiation facility for latex glove sterilization and the first electron accelerator for material modification were also completed."We will continue to serve the growing demand for industrial upgrades and improvement of living standards in the region, contributing wisdom and strength to a better life for people throughout the region," Liu Jing, vice-chairman of the CAEA, said.yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cn In the process of Cambodia's green and low-carbon development, the active participation and contributions of Chinese enterprises are crucial, according to a Cambodian official.Chuop Paris, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Environment in Cambodia, said that by the end of 2023, the installed capacity of operational power projects held by Chinese enterprises in Cambodia accounted for about 60 percent of the whole installed capacity in Cambodia, reflecting Chinese enterprises' prominent contributions to Cambodian energy transition and green low-carbon development.In the meantime, the projects constructed by Chinese companies in Cambodia, which continuously supply electricity to hundreds of thousands of households in the Southeast Asian country, also bring warmth and light to people there, he added.Chuop Paris made these remarks at an international symposium in Beijing on Thursday.Themed as "Environment, Development and Human Rights: Green and Low-carbon Development in the Process of Modernization", the symposium, hosted by the China Foundation for Human Rights Development and China Datang Corp, gathered about 70 international participants from countries including the US, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, Cambodia and Thailand.Wang Gang, deputy minister of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, who also attended the symposium, said that green and low-carbon growth is key to modernization and meeting people's desires for a better life."With unprecedented efforts, China has achieved historic improvements in ecological protection, boasting bluer skies, greener landscapes, and cleaner waters," he said.TOKYO - While the world observes the anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender in World War II (WWII) on Aug 15 every year, some Japanese politicians would openly visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, a symbol of Japanese militarism and its wartime aggression.This year, Japan's incumbent defense minister was found among the senior officials visiting the notorious shrine, and Japanese scholars warned that amid the government's efforts to enhance military capabilities, the Yasukuni Shrine is contributing to the revival of Japan's militaristic past.In January, Hiroki Kobayashi, deputy chief of staff of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (SDF), led dozens of SDF members in a collective visit to the shrine riding in an official vehicle. In April, retired Maritime SDF Admiral Umio Otsuka was announced as the 14th chief priest of Yasukuni Shrine, the highest religious position at the shrine.The bond between the SDF and Yasukuni Shrine is strengthening with activities such as group visits by Maritime SDF trainees to the shrine's war-memorial Yushukan museum.On Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida sent ritual offerings to the shrine in his capacity as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.Atsushi Koketsu, an emeritus professor at Yamaguchi University of Japan, noting that Yasukuni Shrine, which played a key role in supporting Japanese militarism, is central to Japan's state Shinto, pointed out that visits by SDF members clearly violated the constitutional principle of the separation of religion and state."This is an attempt to revive the pre-war militarism that used State Shinto, and such moves should be strongly criticized," the scholar stated.Why is the SDF leadership so obsessed with Yasukuni Shrine? In a recent public lecture in Tokyo, Tetsuya Takahashi, an emeritus professor at the University of Tokyo, explained that many of the SDF predecessors, such as members of the National Police Reserve and the Maritime Guard, had participated in Japan's aggressive wars."To put it simply, the SDF has not severed ties with the old Japanese military, nor does it wish to," Takahashi remarked.The scholar said that the SDF is now openly teaching students at the National Defense Academy of Japan about how officers of the former Japanese military commanded their subordinates, by inviting right-wing politicians to promote the so-called "military spirit" of the old Japanese forces.According to Takahashi, the SDF also uses Yasukuni Shrine as an "educational base," where young people who lack a proper understanding of Japan's history of aggression are taken to visit. There, they are indoctrinated with the idea that dying for the country allows one to enter the shrine and be enshrined as a deity, a concept Takahashi described as an "emotional alchemy."Sayuri Saito, a constitutional law professor at Keisen University in Japan, argued that Yasukuni Shrine "has not erased the militaristic, colonialist, and imperialist values of the old Constitution, or the so-called 'Meiji Constitution,' but affirms instead a historical perspective that could revive these values."In her view, the controversial shrine "does not recognize the value of the current pacifist Constitution, with its beliefs incompatible with the basic principles of peace enshrined in the Constitution," which explains why forces that support the "Yasukuni historical perspective" are eager to revise Japan's Constitution.Saito pointed out that although Yasukuni Shrine lists words like "safety" and "peace" on its website, its very concept is entirely different from the peace envisioned by the Japanese Constitution.The Yasukuni Shrine, located in central Tokyo, honors 14 convicted Class-A Japanese war criminals from World War II, including Hideki Tojo. In-person visits of Japanese politicians to the shrine have long been strongly condemned by peace advocates within Japan and the international community.Koketsu warned that the SDF's frequent involvement with Yasukuni Shrine would only heighten concerns in Asia, particularly in China and South Korea, and increase distrust and vigilance toward the Japanese government."The growing power of the SDF and the revival of the 'Yasukuni ideology' will be seen as a resurgence of Japanese militarism...True peace will not come from an elite SDF, but from efforts to cultivate peace and build mutual trust," the scholar noted.Former prime minister of Thailand Thaksin Shinawatra's 37-year-old daughter and party leader of Pheu Thai Paetongtarn Shinawatra was selected on Friday as the new prime minister.In her first statement since resigning and leaving Bangladesh on Aug 5, Bangladesh's former prime minister Sheikh Hasina called for an investigation into the violence during weeks of student-led protests in the country."I demand that those involved in these killings and vandalism be properly investigated and the culprits be identified and punished accordingly," she said in a statement, which was posted on social media platform X by her son Sajeeb Wazed.It came hours after a court in Dhaka ordered police to launch a murder investigation into Hasina and six top figures from her administration over the death of a grocery shop owner on July 19 during protests that took hundreds of lives in Bangladesh.It is estimated that more than 300 people died and about 10,000 were arrested during the demonstrations. Initially, students protested against quotas in government jobs, but that soon transformed into an unprecedented challenge against Hasina and her ruling party.Earlier, India's The Economic Times reported that Hasina blamed the United States for her ousting, as she did not want Washington to control Bangladesh's Saint Martin's Island.It said Hasina had delivered the message to those close to her. However, Wazed posted on X denying she had ever made such a statement.Saint Martin's, a small island in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, is known for its strategic importance and geopolitical influence in the region. Hasina in the interview with The Economic Times alleged that she could have remained in power had she surrendered the sovereignty over Saint Martin Island in the Bay of Bengal to the United States.When asked about reported claims of the US role in Bangladesh's change of government, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told a news briefing on Monday: "We have had no involvement at all."Wazed, who is based in the US, said Hasina had not "resigned" as prime minister before leaving Bangladesh."My mother never officially resigned. She didn't get the time," he told Reuters.Wazed also said his mother "absolutely" did not order anyone to commit violence against the protesters. "The police were trying to stop the violence, but some police officers used excessive force," he said.Following Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus' swearing-in as head of the interim government last week, the government has made efforts to restore order.Primary schools across Bangladesh reopened on Wednesday after one month of closure, the United News of Bangladesh reported.Traffic police resumed duties on major roads and highways in Dhaka on Monday, after a weeklong strike since the fall of Hasina's administration.Xinhua contributed to the story.General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and Vietnamese President To Lam will kick off a three-day state visit to China on Sunday, the first overseas trip since the 67-year-old was elected as the top leader of the Southeast Asian nation in early August."China is the first country that General Secretary To Lam will visit after assuming office. This says a lot about the great importance that he attaches to the relations between the two parties and countries," a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement released on Thursday.During President Xi Jinping's state visit to Vietnam at the end of last year, the two countries agreed to build a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance.The two countries are working intensively to implement the outcomes achieved from the visit, the statement quoted the spokesperson as saying.China hopes to carry forward the traditional friendship and work with Vietnam to achieve success in respective socialist paths toward modernization with distinctive characteristics to jointly advance the global socialist cause, according to the statement.Du Lan, deputy director and associate fellow at the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies of the China Institute of International Studies, said, "Vietnam has always taken developing relations with China as a top priority and strategic choice. The visit is sending a signal to the outside world that its China policy will be consistent."It shows that To Lam will inherit and uphold the revolutionary achievements made by late General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and previous generations of leaders, she said, adding that his visit will further confirm the two neighbors' determination and confidence to continue the sound development momentum of bilateral ties.President Xi sent a message to To Lam, congratulating him on his election as general secretary on Aug 3, following the passing of Trong two weeks earlier.Du said, "Through high-level exchanges, the two countries can further implement consensuses and outcomes reached during President Xi's state visit to Vietnam in December, and deepen strategic mutual trust and practical cooperation in multiple areas."Vietnam is China's largest trading partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and also China's fourth-largest trading partner in the world. The trade volume between the two countries has exceeded $200 billion for two consecutive years, data from the Ministry of Commerce showed.zhaojia@chinadaily.com.cn Japan's opposition party and civic group leaders urged the Japanese government to seriously reflect on the past, seek peaceful diplomacy centering on civil exchanges, and never go to war again at a memorial in Tokyo on Thursday.Masashi Tani, secretary-general of the Tokyo-based Forum for Peace, Human Rights and Environment, said after the memorial mourning the war dead at Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery, "The purpose of today's rally is to offer our condolences to all those who lost their lives in the war, and also to use the occasion to say that we will never repeat war again."Tani emphasized that peace cannot be achieved through armed confrontation."The most important thing for the Japanese government in its relations with foreign countries is peaceful diplomacy centering on civil exchanges, rather than a foreign policy that incites tension," said Tani."We believe that reflection on the past and an apology are essential for envisioning the future. If we do not start from that point, we will be left with the idea of justifying what we have done in the past. Therefore, a peaceful society can only come from a future in which we properly acknowledge the mistakes we have made in the past and apologize for them," he said on the day when Japan marked the 79th anniversary of its surrender in World War II.Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, said at the memorial: "The lesson we can learn from the damage caused by war is that we must never go to war again. But Japanese politics is clearly against this."The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, promoted legislation that was passed in September 2015 to allow the country's military to participate in foreign conflicts, overturning its previous policy of fighting only in self-defense. In December 2022, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's Cabinet approved revision of three key national security documents."I have walked the sites in the southwestern islands of Okinawa since 2016…Every island is being turned into a military fortress, and preparations for war are underway. If we attack enemy bases in the exercise of the right of collective self-defense, it could be considered a preemptive attack by the other country, and Japan could be covered under the sun," said Fukushima.Last year, the National Diet, Japan's national legislature, passed the Act on Enhancing Defense Production and Technology Bases to revitalize the country's defense industrial base.Fukushima emphasized that Japan must never go to war in Asia because of its aggression against the region during World War II, and anywhere in the southwestern islands of Okinawa and all of Japan must not become a battlefield.At a meeting of the LDP's Headquarters for the Realization of Revision of the Constitution on Aug 7, Kishida expressed his intention to prioritize adding a contingency clause to the Constitution to deal with such matters as armed attacks and large-scale disasters.The contingency clause is martial law, which centralizes power in the Cabinet and stops the Diet as the sole legislature, said Fukushima."The Constitution of Japan was obtained by us with many sacrifices, and no war is Japan's promise to the Japanese people and the world. It is not the preparation for war that is necessary now, but the construction of peace diplomacy. We need a political shift," she said.Kenta Izumi, the leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, did not attend the memorial, but his speech was read by the moderator."In the midst of the turbulent international community, Japan made a mistake in its national policy during World War II, and proceeded on the path of territorial expansion and war. As a result, more than 3 million people lost their lives, and the people of other countries, especially those in Asia, suffered tremendous damage and pain," said Izumi."Today, on this day of discussion and the end of the war, we renew our resolve for peace and stability in the world," he said, conveying the idea that all conflicts should be resolved peacefully and diplomatically, not through the use of force.Japan has been marching headlong down the path of becoming a military superpower, doing as it is told by the United States, especially since the second Abe Cabinet under the leadership of Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe, said Masatoshi Uchida, secretary-general of the Committee of 1,000 to Prevent War.Hiroyuki Some, co-representative of the Forum for Peace, Human Rights and Environment, also believes that Japan's steps today go against the principles of the Constitution and are about to return to discipline in the prewar and wartime state.He noted that after the war, Japan was supposed to have made a resolution never to become a military superpower that threatens other countries by adopting a policy denying the exercise of the right of collective self-defense and banning the export of arms."Japan is now running after an arms buildup. I cannot help but fear that Japan today poses a threat to neighboring countries in Asia and is amplifying mutual distrust," said Some.Reflecting on World War II, he said: "We must not merely understand that epic matchup as a historical fact, but that it must never be repeated. It is our responsibility today to pass the story on from generation to generation, and to ensure that a peaceful society is passed on to the future."Chinese tech giant Huawei Cloud announced on Thursday its commitment to joint efforts with the Thai government and build the kingdom a regional cloud hub with its digital technologies.Huawei Cloud is set to boost its efforts in Thailand over the next five years, focusing on local digital infrastructure to ensure data security and processing efficiency, according to Shi Jilin, president of Global Marketing and Sales Service of Huawei Cloud.Speaking at Huawei Cloud Summit Thailand on Thursday, Shi noted that the substantial investment will bolster Thailand's position as a digital leader in Southeast Asia.She said Huawei has increased its investment in the cloud infrastructure in Thailand and that the suite of technologies and tools available to Thailand from its cloud platform has kept growing over the years."We are committed to boosting our efforts with our partners in Thailand by bringing more advanced technologies and tools and growing the digital services here. We shall not only bring real benefits that are tangible in our daily life, but also leverage the role of the cloud infrastructure to drive the wider digital transformation," she said.Since 2018, Huawei has invested 5.5 billion baht ($156.83 million) to build its cloud infrastructure. Huawei Cloud has partnered with the Thai Ministry of Digital Economy and Society to launch the e-Government cloud for enhancing digital collaboration and public service quality. It has also supported Thailand's first smart city in the Eastern Economic Corridor, improving public services and infrastructure.The company also helped to train local talents to meet the digital trends. The ASEAN Academy Thailand, which was set up in 2020, has trained over 96,200 individuals, including ICT practitioners, cloud AI developers, green engineers, and rural students."Our partnership with Huawei Cloud underscores our dedication to building a robust, secure, and reliable digital ecosystem. Its investment in local infrastructure and advanced technologies will play a crucial role in supporting our Cloud First vision," said Prasert Chanthararuangthong, minister of Digital Economy and Society.During the summit, Prasert said that joint efforts between the ministry and Huawei Cloud aims at showcasing the benefits of the government "Cloud First" policy for the Thai people."Cloud First" policy that was unveiled last year is more than just a technological initiative, he noted. "It's a comprehensive strategy to drive Thailand's digital transformation, enhance public service efficiency, and foster innovation across all sectors."He added that the policy will not only enhance the efficiency and security of the country's digital infrastructure but also provide the foundation for Thailand to become a hub of technological innovation and economic growth."We are confident that this policy will accelerate our digital transformation, create new opportunities for economic development, and position Thailand at the forefront of the digital revolution in Southeast Asia," Prasert said.yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cnSEOUL - South Korea on Thursday expressed regret over Japanese leaders' offering and visit to the notorious war-linked Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of the militaristic and colonial past of Japan.The Seoul foreign ministry said in a statement that the government expresses deep disappointment and regret over the fact that responsible leaders of Japan once again sent offering to and paid respect at the Yasukuni Shrine, which glorifies Japan's war of aggression and enshrines war criminals.The ministry urged Japanese leaders to squarely face history and demonstrate through action their humble reflection and sincere remorse for Japan's past affairs, adding that it will become an important foundation for the development of future-oriented South Korea-Japan relations.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida sent a ritual offering to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine on Thursday, as the country marked the 79th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.While Kishida has not visited the notorious shrine in person, several lawmakers from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, including Shinjiro Koizumi, a former environment minister and son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, on Thursday visited the shrine to pay homage.The Yasukuni Shrine, located in central Tokyo, honors 14 convicted Class-A Japanese war criminals from World War II. It has long been a source of diplomatic friction for Japan and its neighbors.Visits and ritual offerings made by Japanese officials to the controversial shrine have consistently sparked criticism and hurt the feelings of the people of China, South Korea and other countries brutalized by Japan during the war.To Lam, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and Vietnam's president, will pay a state visit to China from August 18 to 20, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying announced on Thursday.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who is also the president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, announced on Wednesday he does not intend to run in the party's leadership election next month.As public distrust of the LDP is rising because of a political fundraising scandal involving the party's factions, Kishida, 67, decided that he could no longer ignore the growing calls within the party for a change in leadership. He said he would step down at the end of his three-year term as LDP president next month.At a news conference, Kishida said it is important to demonstrate to the public that the LDP will change, indicating that his decision would serve as a clear signal of the party's intent to reform itself.His term as LDP president lasts until Sept 30, and the party's rules stipulate that the leadership election to choose his successor will take place between Sept 20 and Sept 29.With the House of Representatives' term set to expire by Oct 30 next year, the LDP election will also serve as a way to select the "face of the party" for the next general election, The Yomiuri Shimbun reported.The reason for Kishida's decision to step down is simply because of a lack of public support, said Ukeru Magosaki, co-representative of the Association for Inheriting and Propagating the Murayama Statement, a civic group dedicated to upholding the 1995 statement that admits Japan's wartime mistakes.Public support for Kishida's cabinet was 19.4 percent this month — below 20 percent for the ninth straight month, though the figure rebounded slightly from last month. The latest cabinet disapproval rating was 53.6 percent, according to an opinion poll published by Jiji Press last week."The starting point for the loss of support was the political funding scandal involving factions within the LDP," said Magosaki, who is also a former senior official with Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs."There was no prospect of the approval rating improving, and if things continue as they are, there is even a possibility that the LDP could lose in the House of Representatives election."Kazuyuki Hamada, an international political economist and former member of the House of Councillors, attributed Kishida's decision to step down to his lack of leadership."As symbolized by the issues of politics and money, the LDP's response of covering up problems has led to public disappointment. With the Kishida administration's approval rating falling below 20 percent, there is little chance of winning the upcoming House of Councillors and House of Representatives elections under the current conditions. The administration could not withstand the calls for resignation from both inside and outside the party," Hamada said.Kumiko Haba, a professor of international politics at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo, said, "Like (United States President) Joe Biden passing the baton to (Vice-President) Kamala Harris ... Kishida may have thought that stepping down himself could present a new image of the LDP."Leadership raceKishida's announcement is likely to intensify the LDP leadership race, experts said.Among current party executives and cabinet ministers who support Kishida, LDP Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi, Minister for Digital Transformation Taro Kono and Minister in charge of Economic Security Sanae Takaichi have expressed interest in running for the post, as has Shigeru Ishiba, a former LDP secretary-general.Other potential candidates include former minister for internal affairs and communications Seiko Noda, former environment minister Shinjiro Koizumi, former minister in charge of economic security Takayuki Kobayashi and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, experts said."The possibility of generational change and the emergence of a female party leader or prime minister is now a real consideration," Hamada said. "The issue will be whether the candidates can address public dissatisfaction and mistrust with innovative and creative policies that offer hope for the future."The LDP seems to be not fully prepared for Kishida's decision, Haba said, so there may be some initial turmoil within the party. However, if his decision leads to a smooth transition in leadership and policy changes, Kishida might have thought that it could help quell public criticism of the LDP and lay the groundwork for the party's continued governance, Haba said.TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida sent a ritual offering to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine on Thursday, as the country marked the 79th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.Kishida dedicated the Tamakushi fees to the shrine, a symbol of Japan's past brutal militarism, in his capacity as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).It came a day after Kishida took the public by surprise by announcing that he would not run in the ruling party's presidential race next month, ready to step down as prime minister after three years in power.While Kishida has not visited the notorious shrine in person, several LDP lawmakers, including Shinjiro Koizumi, a former environment minister and son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, on Thursday visited the shrine to pay homage.The Yasukuni Shrine, located in central Tokyo, honors 14 convicted Class-A Japanese war criminals from World War II. It has long been a source of diplomatic friction for Japan and its neighbors.Visits and ritual offerings made by Japanese officials to the controversial shrine have consistently sparked criticism and hurt the feelings of the people of China, South Korea and other countries brutalized by Japan during the war.Pakistan offering online visas for Chinese citizens signals closer economic cooperation and mutual exchanges between the South Asian nation and China, analysts said, adding that it can help enhance Pakistan's economy.Starting from Wednesday, visas for Chinese citizens will be available online, making it much easier for Chinese businesspeople to come to Pakistan, Pakistan's Ministry for Information and Broadcasting said on its website.Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said this earlier this month during a meeting with a representative delegation of the Chinese business community led by Chinese Consul General in Lahore Zhao Shiren.There will be ample facilities provided to Chinese citizens for business, and the Pakistani government attaches top priority to the protection of Chinese citizens living in Pakistan.Zafar Uddin Mahmood, president of the Understanding China Forum and former special envoy for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, said the streamlined online visa process for Chinese nationals is good for the facilitation of bilateral exchanges.Imran Khalid, an international affairs commentator based in Karachi, Pakistan, said the ease in visa applications will undoubtedly facilitate the frequent movement of Chinese individuals and companies, thereby strengthening economic interdependence.Pakistan is expected to receive more Chinese tourists, as the summer travel season will be followed by the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays, according to sources from Chinese travel agencies.The Pakistan side has been keen to attract Chinese outbound tourists to scenic and historic sites of the country by adopting various plans.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of Chinese tourists to Pakistan increased beyond 225,000 a year. Last year saw Chinese tourists returning, as the two countries marked the Pakistan-China Year of Tourism Exchanges.In January, Caretaker Minister of State for Tourism Wasi Shah announced that Pakistan witnessed an increase of 115 percent in foreign tourism last year, leading to $1.3 billion in foreign exchange revenue. The South Asian nation achieved a remarkable 92 percent recovery to pre-pandemic levels last year, according to the United Nations' World Tourism Organization.Khalid said: "The implications of this streamlined online visa process may extend beyond tourism and business for China. It can pave the way for increased collaboration in various fields, including academia and technology, better fostering innovation and shared growth between the two countries."Businesspeople, technical staff members and professionals can now travel to Pakistan with more ease, enabling them to be more involved in joint venture projects, particularly CPEC-related projects, Khalid said.Kaswar Klasra in Islamabad contributed to this story.Thailand's Constitutional Court on Wednesday removed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from his position after less than a year in office for breaching ethics rules by appointing a lawyer who had served a jail term to his cabinet.The case against Srettha centers around the appointment of Pichit Chuenban as a minister of the Prime Minister's Office. In 2008, Pichit was sentenced to six months' imprisonment on charges of attempting to bribe a court official.Although Pichit resigned from the cabinet in May, a decision seen as a bid to spare Srettha from legal trouble, the court pressed ahead with the case initiated by a complaint from a group of 40 senators.The Constitutional Court judges began their deliberations at 9:30 am on Wednesday. The nine-judge bench voted 5:4 to dismiss Srettha from office. Srettha did not attend the hearing due to prior work commitments but sent his secretary-general Prommin Lertsuridej.The cabinet must also resign but will stay on in a caretaker capacity with Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Phumtham Wechayachai taking over as caretaker prime minister, according to Wissanu Krea-ngam, the PM's adviser and a legal expert.The parliament will convene on Friday for a special meeting to choose a new prime minister, the legislature announced on its website, following the court's decision.According to parliamentary rules, a candidate nominated for prime minister must win the support of more than half of the lower house, which currently has 493 members.There are several potential candidates, including Pheu Thai party leader Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, Energy Minister Pirapan Salirathavibhaga and Prawit Wongsuwan, an influential former army chief who was involved in the last two coups.Local media reported that Srettha visited a Buddhist temple on Wednesday morning, where his mother's cremation ceremony was held last week. He told reporters he had slept well and would carry on with his normal schedule for the day, saying he was not unduly worried about the court case.Srettha said after the ruling that he respected the court verdict. "I performed duties to the best of my ability and adhered to ethical principles throughout my nearly one-year tenure in office."As Pheu Thai's prime ministerial candidate, Srettha received majority approval in parliament on Aug 22 last year.In the past two decades, Thailand has witnessed several prime ministers being ousted by legal decisions and coups.Some political experts believe that it is likely that Pheu Thai would still have the clout to lead the next administration."The coalition remains united," said Olarn Thinbangtieo, deputy dean of Burapha University's Faculty of Political Science and Law. In an interview with Reuters, he said there may be some impact on confidence, but that would be in the short term.Xinhua and agencies contributed to this story.As China continues to promote high-quality development and expand high-level opening-up, its cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will see broader opportunities and further boost stability and prosperity in the region as well as across the world, according to a senior official.Shi Zhongjun, secretary-general of the ASEAN-China Center, said that China and the ASEAN countries, which are all key members of the Global South and at a critical stage of pursuing national revitalization, represent development opportunities for each other."I have visited the 10 ASEAN member states since taking office in 2022. What impressed me the most is that all of them, regardless of their distinct national conditions and different cooperation priorities, have the same strong desire to collaborate with China," he told China Daily in a written interview.On the journey to modernization, China and ASEAN have always been good friends and partners who can trust each other, support each other, and move forward side by side, Shi said.Since the establishment of dialogue relations in 1991, China and ASEAN have become a fertile ground for cooperation, showcasing the most fruitful, profound and substantive partnership in the Asia-Pacific region, and are leading in regional economic growth, he said.Noting that the economy and trade serve as the ballast and the propeller of China-ASEAN relations, Shi said the two sides have been each other's largest trading partners for four consecutive years as well as each other's significant sources of investment.Data from the General Administration of Customs showed that in the first seven months of 2024, the trade volume of goods between China and ASEAN increased 10.5 percent year-on-year. It also showed that China's investment in ASEAN countries surged 44.6 percent last year, while the cumulative two-way investment exceeded $380 billion.Shi said that while strengthening practical cooperation in traditional areas such as the economy, trade, investment and infrastructure, the two sides should also tap the cooperation potential in emerging fields such as the digital economy, green energy, artificial intelligence and the blue economy.He said that by doing so, China and ASEAN could foster new growth drivers and better play the roles of important economic growth engines in the region and the world.Seven rounds of negotiations have been held on the 3.0 version of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area since November 2022."I believe that the in-depth advancement of negotiations will help build an inclusive, modern, comprehensive and mutually beneficial China-ASEAN market, and boost the China-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership," Shi said.Highlighting people-to-people exchanges as the third pillar of China-ASEAN relations, after political and economic cooperation, he said that China and ASEAN countries are working together to promote mutual understanding and friendship among more than 2 billion people."People-to-people exchanges are not just vital spiritual bonds that are continually rejuvenating between China and ASEAN countries, but also form the solid foundation for the growth of bilateral ties and the creation of an even better future for all," Shi said, noting that exchanges and cooperation in areas including culture, tourism, education and the media have yielded fruitful outcomes.He said that China and the ASEAN member states have taken coordinated actions to encourage the orderly and free flow of tourists in the region.China signed visa-exemption agreements with Thailand and Singapore in January, and announced the extension of its visa-exemption policy for residents of Malaysia in June.In the first half of the year, the number of direct flights between China and ASEAN countries reached more than 2,300 per week, and China regained its position as the largest source of tourists for Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, Shi added.In Kazakhstan, amidst global trends towards the transition to clean energy sources, the topic of constructing a nuclear power plant (NPP) is becoming increasingly relevant. With the growing demand for reliable and stable energy capacities, the government is considering the possibility of creating its own NPP, which would not only strengthen Kazakhstan's energy security but also position the country as a leader in the nuclear industry in Central Asia. The construction of an NPP opens new horizons for attracting advanced technologies, international cooperation, and investments, which will ultimately contribute to the sustainable economic development of the country.However, along with the prospects, this project raises many questions regarding safety, ecology, and public support. These aspects are discussed in an interview with Edgar Siberger, a business development expert in the nuclear industry from the international company Assystem, France. In a conversation with DKnews.kz Executive Editor Arman Korzhumbayev, Siberger shares his views on the challenges and opportunities awaiting Kazakhstan on the path to building its first nuclear power plant.How do you think Kazakhstan's strategic position in Central Asia influences decision-making in the field of nuclear energy, especially in relation to neighboring countries?Kazakhstan, as the largest country in Central Asia, plays a key role in the region, especially in terms of energy. Its strategic location and vast resources, including the largest uranium reserves in the world, make Kazakhstan an important player in nuclear energy. Decision-making in this area is largely dependent on neighboring countries and international partners. Kazakhstan actively cooperates with Russia, China, and other countries in the field of nuclear energy, which opens up opportunities for creating effective regional energy systems. Such cooperation also helps Kazakhstan strengthen its energy independence and ensure stability in the region.What mechanisms do you consider effective in managing international cooperation on nuclear and energy projects, and how can they be applied to Kazakhstan's NPP construction plans?On the international stage, the key mechanisms for successful cooperation are transparency, trust, and clear legal frameworks. It is important to establish sustainable and long-term relationships with partners, based on mutual interests. For Kazakhstan, this means active participation in international organizations such as the IAEA and the development of bilateral agreements with leading nuclear powers. Applying these mechanisms to NPP construction projects in Kazakhstan will not only attract advanced technologies but also ensure compliance with high safety standards, which is crucial for the successful implementation of such projects.From your perspective, what new opportunities in the nuclear industry could Kazakhstan capitalize on as it moves forward with its NPP plans?Kazakhstan has unique opportunities not only as a uranium supplier but also as a producer of nuclear energy. With the growing interest in clean energy sources, Kazakhstan can become a leader in the development of small modular reactors (SMRs), which offer more flexible and economically advantageous solutions for energy supply. Additionally, Kazakhstan should consider participating in international projects for the development and implementation of nuclear waste recycling technologies, which could significantly increase the added value in the country's nuclear industry.Based on your professional experience, what measures could the Kazakh government implement to attract foreign investments and expertise and ensure the success of the project?To attract foreign investments and expertise, Kazakhstan needs to focus on creating favorable conditions for investors. This includes developing and implementing clear and predictable legal frameworks, ensuring long-term stability in the investment environment, and guaranteeing transparency in the contracting process. Additionally, it is important to establish partnerships with leading global companies in the nuclear industry, which can bring in the necessary knowledge and technologies. Kazakhstan should also consider providing tax incentives and other financial stimuli to attract strategic investors.How important is public support for the success of nuclear projects? What mechanisms does the French nuclear regulator usually use to ensure support for its energy strategy and effective communication with the general public?Public support plays a crucial role in the success of any nuclear project. In France, where nuclear energy is the main source of electricity, regulators place great emphasis on communication with the public. The main mechanisms include transparent information about safety, environmental aspects, and the benefits of nuclear energy. Public hearings, meetings with local communities, and educational programs are regularly held. It is important to ensure that people have the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers, which builds trust and reduces concerns. Kazakhstan should pay attention to these practices and adapt them to its conditions to ensure broad support for its nuclear initiatives.Thank you very much, Edgar, for an interesting conversation and valuable insights!Thank you for the opportunity to discuss such important issues! I am confident that Kazakhstan has all the chances to become a leader in the nuclear industry in Central Asia.DKnews.kzMANILA - The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on Wednesday said that Philippine divers have started siphoning industrial fuel oil (IFO) from an oil tanker that sank off Bataan province, west of Manila, on July 25.The tanker, MTKR Terranova, carrying 1.4 million liters of IFO, sank before dawn on July 25 in the waters off Limay town in Bataan. One of its 17 crew died in the accident.Bataan Coast Guard Station Chief Lieutenant Commander Michael John Encina said that divers started siphoning one of the eight tanks on Wednesday. Each tank contains 175,000 liters of IFO.Encina said sealing the seven tanks is ongoing to prepare for underwater siphoning. He did not say when divers will empty all tanks of oil.Aside from MTKR Terranova, the PCG said divers also began siphoning 5,500 liters of oil from another sunken tanker, MTKR Bradley, which sank off Bataan province around the same time MTKR Terranova sank.The PCG is also cleaning up the oil from another boat, MV Mirola 1, that ran aground on July 31 off Bataan province due to bad weather.TOKYO - About 25 tons of radioactive water have leaked within the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the plant's operator has reported, a week after the latest round of ocean discharge started.The nuclear-contaminated water, which leaked from a surge tank connected to the Unit 2 reactor building, was meant to be contained in a tank receiving overflow from the spent nuclear fuel pool, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).Accumulating on the first basement level of the reactor building, the leaked water led to a rise in the level of contaminated water already present in the area, TEPCO introduced on Tuesday, confirming that the contaminated water had not escaped outside the reactor building.The leak was first identified last Friday, when a decrease in the water level of the surge tank was detected, according to TEPCO, which upon further investigation discovered water flowing into a drain in a room on the third floor of the reactor building.The company plans to use a remotely operated robot to measure radiation levels in the room by Friday and further pinpoint the exact location and cause of the leak. The cooling pump for the pool has been temporarily shut down as part of the investigation.Hit by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and an ensuing tsunami on March 11, 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant suffered core meltdowns that released radiation, resulting in a level-7 nuclear accident, the highest on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale.The plant has been generating a massive amount of water tainted with radioactive substances from cooling down nuclear fuel in reactor buildings. The contaminated water is now being stored in tanks at the nuclear plant.Despite furious opposition both at home and abroad, the ocean discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water began in August 2023, and the eighth round of ocean discharge started last week.In fiscal 2024, TEPCO plans to discharge a total of 54,600 tons of the contaminated water in seven rounds, which contains approximately 14 trillion becquerels of tritium.Amid raging credibility and safety concerns among the Japanese public following a series of accidents at the crippled plant, TEPCO and the Japanese government have been frequently challenged for mishandling the contaminated water.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who is also the president of the Liberal Democratic Party, informed party executives on Wednesday that he does not intend to run in the party's leadership election scheduled for late September. Having plans to step down in line with the end of his three-year term as party president.As public distrust in the Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, is rising due to a political funding scandal involving the party's factions, 67-year-old Kishida decided that he could no longer ignore the growing calls within the party for a change in leadership.Kishida's term as LDP president lasts until Sept 30, and the party's rules stipulate that the leadership election to choose his successor will take place between Sept 20 and 29. With the House of Representatives term set to expire by Oct 30 next year, the election will also serve as a way to select the "face of the party" for the upcoming general election, according to The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest national newspaper.As of now, no candidate has officially announced their candidacy for the leadership election, but Kishida's announcement not to run is likely to accelerate the race. Among the current party executives and cabinet ministers who support Kishida, LDP Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi, Minister for Digital Transformation Taro Kono, and Minister in charge of Economic Security Sanae Takaichi have expressed interest in running.The mid-career and younger members of the LDP have been increasingly vocal about the need for generational change and party reform ahead of the leadership election. The emphasis on reform is largely driven by the strong headwinds caused by the political funding scandal involving party factions. Disciplining the involved members and amending the Political Funds Control Act have not been sufficient to restore public trust.The mid-career and younger members of the LDP believe that without demonstrating a commitment to change, the party is likely to struggle in the next House of Representatives election. Some candidates eyeing the "post-Kishida" era are responding to these calls, making party renewal one of the key issues in the upcoming leadership race, The Yomiuri Shimbun reported.Indonesian President Joko Widodo's first cabinet meeting in the new capital city Nusantara, or IKN, is a "strong symbolic gesture" that shows his determination to pursue its development despite construction delays and funding concerns, analysts said.Widodo presided over the Monday meeting at Garuda Palace, a majestic bird-shaped palace modeled after the mythical Garuda, Indonesia's national emblem. Vice-President Ma'ruf Amin and 38 ministers attended the meeting, along with incoming President Prabowo Subianto and his running mate Gibran Rakabuming Raka, Widodo's eldest son.Widodo will be stepping down from office in October, but Prabowo said his government will continue with the development of IKN, or Ibu Kota Nusantara.Dedi Dinarto, lead Indonesia analyst at public policy advisory firm Global Counsel, said Widodo is "clearly sending a strong symbolic gesture to the wider public, portraying the new capital project not only as a top priority, but also as a lasting legacy".He said that in the current climate of high interest rates, foreign investors are cautious about pouring money into projects with less attractive value propositions. Widodo thus aims to reassure global investors that the project is here to stay even after the end of his administration, Dinarto added.The IKN development is estimated to cost over $30 billion. While a total of 40 trillion rupiah ($2.5 billion) has been allocated this year for IKN, the government is hoping to secure 100 trillion rupiah in private investments to finance this mega project.Rezha Bayu Oktavian Arief, co-founder and CEO of Jakartabased social enterprise and advisory firm Obviously Sustainable, said the cabinet meeting is a "strategic move" to send a message to future investors and other stakeholders."Despite the challenges, the (development of the) new capital is on track, and the government is working diligently to complete all necessary developments," he said.Arief said holding the meeting in Nusantara also highlighted a key reason behind Widodo's decision to relocate the capital from Jakarta — "to promote equality and prosperity for all Indonesians". He said this has been a consistent theme in Widodo's vision for the project since he announced the relocation plan in 2019.Canvas for futureIn his opening speech at the cabinet meeting, Widodo said moving the capital to Nusantara in East Kalimantan Province would lead to "equal distribution" of economic development. He noted that Java island, where Jakarta is located, accounts for 58 percent of the nation's GDP. The new capital will serve as a canvas for painting Indonesia's future, he added.More than 50 percent of Indonesia's population of 280 million also live in Java, and nearly 11 million live in Jakarta. In contrast, East Kalimantan in Borneo — an island that Indonesia shares with Malaysia and Brunei — is home to less than 6 percent of the population. Widodo said this is another consideration to relocate the capital as Jakarta is densely populated.Josua Pardede, chief economist at PermataBank in Jakarta, questioned its readiness to function as the new capital, alluding to reports on problems with electricity and water supply in IKN."Investors typically look for stability and infrastructure reliability when making decisions," Pardede said. "While the symbolic cabinet meeting might generate some positive sentiment, significant investment will likely hinge on tangible progress in addressing these basic infrastructure needs."Leonardus Jegho is a freelance journalist for China Daily. BEIJING - Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Chinese Foreign Minister, will visit Myanmar and travel to Thailand to co-chair the ninth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Foreign Ministers' Meeting and attend the Informal Discussion Between the Foreign Ministers of China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand from August 14 to 17.On Wang's upcoming visit to Myanmar, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said it is aimed at deepening bilateral mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, cementing the close bond of friendship between the two peoples, and advancing the building of the China-Myanmar community with a shared future.As a friend and neighbor of Myanmar, China strictly follows the principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, supports Myanmar's effort to uphold stability, grow the economy and improve people's livelihood, and provides constructive help for parties in Myanmar to properly address differences through political consultation within the framework of the constitution and other laws, the spokesperson added.About the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC), the spokesperson said it is an innovative type of regional cooperation mechanism among China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam featuring collaboration, consultation and shared benefit. Since its launch in 2016, the mechanism has delivered fruitful results, contributing effectively to the economic and social development of the six Lancang-Mekong countries, and bringing tangible benefits to their peoples.The spokesperson said that in recent years, under the strategic guidance of leaders of China and the Mekong countries, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam have each announced jointly with China the building of a community with a shared future. All countries in the Mekong region are engaged in building a community with a shared future both bilaterally with China and multilaterally under the LMC mechanism.China hopes to work with the Mekong countries at the LMC Foreign Ministers' Meeting to review the progress of cooperation, take stock of past experience, and plan for next steps to advance LMC, to build the Lancang-Mekong region into an exemplar for high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, a pacesetter for implementing the Global Development Initiative, a pioneer for implementing the Global Security Initiative and a frontrunner for implementing the Global Civilization Initiative, and form an even closer community with a shared future for Lancang-Mekong countries, the spokesperson added.On the sidelines of the LMC meeting, at the invitation of Thailand, Wang will attend the Informal Discussion Between the Foreign Ministers of China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand to exchange views on the regional situation, jointly combating cross-border crimes and other issues, said the spokesperson.DHAKA - Inflation in Bangladesh accelerated to 11.66 percent in July, the highest in 13 years, mainly driven by higher food prices, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) reported on Monday.Data showed that it was 9.72 percent in June.Food inflation soared 14.10 percent in July, the highest in at least a decade. In June, according to BSS, food inflation was 10.42 percent.Non-food items inflation also increased to 9.68 percent in July from 9.15 percent in June, the data showed.The country's average inflation surged to 9.73 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 (July 2023-June 2024), much higher than the budgetary target of 7.5 percent for the fiscal.In the previous 2022-23 fiscal year, overall inflation was 9.02 percent.The heat wave that has scorched Asia over the past few weeks has hit Malaysia hard, with a water shortage threatening national food security and hurting key industries.Experts said the falling water reserves in the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia have shown the "broader impact" of climate change.Malaysia's National Disaster Management Agency said that as of Aug 5, raw water reserves at the Muda Dam in Kedah, the Bukit Merah Dam in Perak and the Teluk Bahang Dam in Penang have dropped to a "dangerous level" of 7.44 percent, 16.43 percent and 28.20 percent, respectively.Likewise, water reserves in five other dams in the states of Kedah, Penang and Perlis have reached a warning level of less than 59.99 percent.Serina Abdul Rahman, a lecturer at the Department of Southeast Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore, said that while Malaysia goes through cycles of drought and flooding every year, this seasonal occurrence is happening more severely and frequently."Climate change has made extreme weather phenomena more frequent and this ranges from high temperatures to more severe storms," Serina said.Extreme heat for prolonged periods, coupled with lack of rain, dries out the dams and reduces water availability, she said.Mohamad Faiz Mohd Amin, an associate professor of earth science at the Universiti Malaysia Kelantan, said the current drought in Northern Malaysia is "a stark indication of the broader impacts of climate change".Mohamad Faiz, who is also an invited researcher at the Water Resources Research Center at Kyoto University in Japan, said data showed that average temperatures have increased and rainfall patterns have become erratic in the past few years. These factors have reduced reservoir water availability, he said.He cited Kedah and Perlis, which are experiencing one of the driest periods in decades.The low water reserves have dried up the paddy fields of Kedah and could potentially slash rice production by as much as 40 percent, he said. This could lead to higher food prices and a shortage of the national staple as Kedah is the country's rice bowl.Reduced water levels are increasing the concentrations of pollutants and cutting oxygen levels, he said, which can kill fish populations and lead to a decline in biodiversity.The effect could be felt beyond the food and agricultural sector. Other water-intensive industries may face production cuts and the tourism industry could suffer as natural attractions such as rivers and lakes dry up, Mohamad Faiz said.The Malaysian Institute of Economic Research has estimated that water shortages could result in a 0.5 percent reduction in GDP growth, he said.Health issuesWater rationing is being implemented in many areas and residents are experiencing intermittent water supply, which disrupts daily activities and increases the risk of waterborne diseases and other health issues, he said.Citing data from the Malaysian Health Ministry, Mohamad Faiz said the incidence of waterborne diseases rises by 15 percent during prolonged dry periods as the dry spell usually compromises water quality.Serina from the National University of Singapore said water shortage "makes life very difficult for citizens no matter where they are"."The water shortages could happen anywhere, and people need to be more careful with water usage," she said.Mohamad Faiz said the situation stresses the urgent need for national climate adaptation strategies.There is a need for comprehensive policies on water management, infrastructure resilience and community preparedness, as well as investment in climate-resilient infrastructure and sustainable practices for long-term adaptation, he said.Officials from China and the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations reaffirmed on Monday their commitment to exploring new areas and unlocking new opportunities for cooperation and innovation, in order to pave the way for a more prosperous and sustainable future.They made the pledge at the opening ceremony of the ASEAN-China Week 2024 held in Changzhi, a city in North China's Shanxi province, vowing to build a closer community with a shared future for China and ASEAN.In a congratulatory message sent to the event, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China and ASEAN, as friendly neighbors and vibrant markets, enjoy boundless potential in their relationship.Wang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, expressed the hope that the countries could leverage complementary advantages, accelerate coordinated development, and jointly foster and strengthen new quality productive forces to inject fresh impetus into respective development and revitalization as well as boost regional stability and prosperity.The third plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee held last month reaffirmed high-quality development as the primary task in seeking Chinese modernization, with fostering new quality productive forces being one of the key instruments toward that goal.The term "new quality productive forces" is also gaining attention from ASEAN countries in the context of pursuing quality economic growth and cooperation in the long run."Innovation, as we all recognize, is the key to unlocking new avenues of growth and ensuring that our economies remain resilient and competitive in the global landscape," said Neth Pheaktra, Cambodia's minister of information.He said that new areas of collaboration in sectors such as the digital economy and green technologies are emerging, and the ongoing implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement and the progress of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement 3.0 would continue to bolster economic ties.According to statistics from ASEAN, the trade volume between the two sides reached a record of $702.3 billion last year, making China the group's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years.The Cambodian minister also spoke highly of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, saying that over the past decade, the BRI has been "a key driver" of Cambodia's infrastructure, trade and economic growth, and has brought significant infrastructure developments to the region.Moving forward, Pheaktra said he believed the innovation-driven and interconnected ASEAN-China cooperation will deliver benefits to all peoples in the region.Thet Thet Khine, Myanmar's union minister for hotels and tourism, said: "Innovation, in all its forms, is the cornerstone of sustainable development. I am particularly excited about the role that innovation can play in our industry. Tourism has been a vital component of the economies of both ASEAN and China."Noting that 2024 has been designated as the ASEAN-China Year of People-to-People Exchanges, she underscored the need to leverage innovative practices to create more resilient and sustainable tourism, and enhance cultural exchanges to build trust and strengthen bonds between ASEAN and China.Also at Monday's event, Shi Zhongjun, secretary-general of the ASEAN-China Center, announced the official launch of the ASEAN-China Import and Export Service Platform.The platform, which is already in operation, has received thousands of cooperation requests and is expected to generate an annual market demand of more than $10 billion in the future, Shi added.Jin Xiangjun, governor of Shanxi province, said the ASEAN-China Week serves as a bond to strengthen cooperation and exchanges between the province and ASEAN member states, and called for deepening cooperation in areas such as trade, education, culture and tourism.With melodious Nepalese music playing in the background, a dancer gracefully twirls and leaps on a vibrant stage. Adorned in a traditional Nepalese gunio choli in red and yellow hues, her attire flows elegantly with her movements.The inauguration of The Nepal Culture Promotion Center, along with the "Belt and Road" — Light of Culture 2024 Traditional Cultural Exchange Activity took place in Beijing on August 8.The event was organized by the China-Nepal Culture Exchange Center and drew a diverse group of participants, including experts in Chinese and Nepalese culture, tourism, and society.As an important platform to showcase and disseminate the traditional culture of China and Nepal, the "Belt and Road" — Light of Culture 2024 project aims to further promote in-depth cooperation between the two countries in the cultural field through a variety of projects such as art exhibitions and traditional performances.Bishnu Pukar Shrestha, Nepalese Ambassador to China, highlighted the rich cultural connection between the two countries that dates back to ancient times."Over the years, we have consistently shared stories that symbolize the enduring cultural ties between our nations," he said.Li Bo, President of the China-Nepal Culture Exchange Center, remarked at the ceremony: "In China, the venerable sage Laozi resides, while in Nepal, the esteemed sage Siddhartha Gautama abides. It is through the boundless wisdom of these sages that our spirits intertwine."In 2017, China and Nepal signed Memorandums of Understanding to enhance cooperation. This year marks the 69th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries."China's assistance in Nepal's development has promoted the further deepening of relations between the two countries. In particular, infrastructure, investment, trade, tourism, health, agriculture, information and telecommunication technology, and medical areas have benefited," ambassador Shrestha said."Nepal-China relations are an exemplar of barrier-free exchanges, peace, and friendship between two countries of different sizes and systems," Shrestha said.Hu Xinyue contributed to this story.SYDNEY -- The pilot of a helicopter that crashed into the roof of a hotel in Australia's Far North Queensland early Monday morning has died while two other people were injured in the incident, local media reported.The pilot was a man in his 40s, the Sydney Morning Herald reported, adding that an 83-year-old man and a 76-year-old woman were taken to hospital in a stable condition.Police have declared an emergency around the DoubleTree by Hilton on Cairns Esplanade and evacuated up to 400 people after the crash, according to the Australian ABC News broadcaster.The Cairns Post reported earlier that there were grave concerns about the male pilot, who was assessed at the scene and was reported to have sustained life-threatening injuries.According to the report, a man in his 80s and a woman in her 70s who were staying in a hotel room near the crash site suffered from smoke inhalation. They were treated for their injuries and taken to Cairns Hospital for further medical attention.Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are keen to explore nuclear energy to meet climate commitments and promote energy security, but they still need to overcome concerns over safety and funding, a regional forum heard recently."The energy needs of our regions are growing, and finding reliable, sustainable solutions is more crucial than ever. Nuclear energy, with its potential to provide consistent and low-carbon power, is a topic that we can't afford to overlook," Beni Suryadi, deputy executive director of ASEAN Center for Energy, told a forum it organized in Jakarta on Friday.The ASEAN Energy Booklet Volume 2: Nuclear Energy Development in ASEAN, was launched during the forum, featuring regional nuclear energy development, nuclear power's role in ASEAN's energy transition and advancements in nuclear technologies.Marcel Nicky Arianto, associate research analyst on power at ASEAN Center for Energy, said that while ASEAN countries aim to reach carbon neutrality by generating renewable energy such as solar and wind, they are not stable sources of power owing to their intermittency. But he said nuclear energy will not only cut carbon emissions but is also a stable and flexible energy source.As of 2022, more than 66 percent of the power generated in the ASEAN region was from coal and gas, while renewables accounted for about 33 percent.Arianto said the first step in deploying nuclear power in the region is for the governments to have "a strong political will" to use nuclear power as a means to secure energy supply and transition to a cleaner source of fuel; to create policies and laws on nuclear development; and to build the nuclear power plants.Significant progressThe ASEAN booklet has highlighted several countries that have made significant progress in their plan to use nuclear energy in the future. Indonesia, for example, has regulatory and research agencies on nuclear power and is planning to develop its first nuclear reactor by 2035. Vietnam is likewise conducting research and plans to have a small-scale nuclear reactor after 2030, while Thailand is eyeing building a power plant by 2036.But Arianto said ASEAN is facing many challenges in building nuclear power plants, the most crucial of which is ASEAN's geographic location as some countries are located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and concerns over nuclear waste management. The Fukushima nuclear accident and the Chernobyl disaster are also weighing on plans to develop a nuclear energy policy.Brianna Lazerwitz, energy economist at the International Atomic Energy Agency, said that while nuclear projects share similarities with other large scale, capital-intensive infrastructure projects, they also "present unique considerations, and that translates to unique risks for investors".prime@chinadailyapac.com KABUL - A blast was heard in Dasht-e-Barchi locality on the western edge of Afghanistan's capital city Kabul on Sunday, casualties feared.China has lodged solemn representations with Japan, urging it to immediately rectify erroneous actions after Japan twice took actions against Taiwan fishing vessels.It's reported that two Taiwan fishing vessels were detained by Japanese official ships and accused of violating fisheries regulations. The boats and the crew were released after paying fines.The Chinese government attaches great importance to safeguarding the legitimate interests of Chinese fishermen, including those from the Taiwan region, a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement.According to the China-Japan Fisheries Agreement, Japan has no right to enforce measures against Chinese fishing vessels in relevant waters, the statement said.Beijing demands Tokyo to correct mistakes and take effective measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again, the spokesperson said.TOKYO -- An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.3 on Friday struck Japanese prefecture of Kanagawa, south of Tokyo, local weather agency said.The temblor occurred at 7:57 pm local time, measuring lower 5 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7, said the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).At a depth of 10 km, the epicenter was located off the western Kanagawa prefecture at a latitude of 35.4 degrees north and a longitude of 139.2 degrees east, said the JMA.The tremor was strongly felt in Tokyo and Saitama prefecture, with no tsunami warning issued. Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka will pay a 10-day official visit to China starting from Monday, the first of its kind since taking the office in 2022.During the visit, leaders of the two countries will have in-depth exchanges of views on major issues of common concern, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Friday.China has received several leaders of Pacific Island countries this year and Prime Minister Rabuka is yet another Pacific Island country leader set to visit the country, which Mao said speaks to the close relations between China and the South Pacific region.Fiji is the first Pacific Island country to have established diplomatic ties with China.China hopes to take the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries to a new level and work with Fiji to build an even closer community with a shared future between China and Pacific Island countries, Mao said.Young Cambodian graduate Uk Sophearith hopes to make a meaningful contribution to the people living in the Lancang-Mekong River region by seizing the opportunities provided by a multilateral framework.Known as the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, or LMC, the framework was established in 2016 between China and five Southeast Asian countries along the river."For young individuals like myself, close cooperation across the Lancang-Mekong countries offers fascinating potential," Uk, who graduated recently from the Royal University of Phnom Penh, told China Daily.In July, Uk and his two teammates from China and Vietnam won the Best International Team award for their project, which offers affordable and accessible yoga classes to students to improve their mental health. They won the award at the eighth Youth Innovation Competition on Lancang-Mekong Region's Governance and Development, held at the Phuket Campus of Prince of Songkla University in Thailand.Lancang-Mekong River refers to the waterway that flows across six countries. Originating from China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, it is called Lancang River in China, while further downstream — after flowing out of Southwest China's Yunnan province — it is known as Mekong River, running across Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.Since the launch of the cooperation mechanism, member countries have been upholding the principle of "shared river and shared future" and jointly promoted the high-quality cooperation of the Belt and Road Initiative, turning it into a "golden model" of regional cooperation.The resolution adopted by the third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee on July 18 states that China will continue improving the mechanisms for high-quality cooperation under the BRI.This includes promoting cooperation in science, technology and innovation, redoubling efforts to develop multilateral platforms for cooperation in green development, the digital economy, disaster mitigation and others, which are expected to elevate LMC regional collaboration.Referring to the LMC framework, Uk said: "Expanded educational exchange programs may result from increased regional integration, giving me the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a variety of viewpoints."Cooperation in different industries will also generate new jobs, he added."I hope that more Mekong countries can grow like China," said Khun Zaw, founder and CEO of Densilar, a Myanmar-based company in the avocado industry.Noting that China has become a leader in technology and innovation, Khun Zaw said he hopes to see more cooperation in agricultural technology among the Lancang-Mekong countries, so that the neighbors can learn from China and prosper together.In July, Khun Zaw participated for the first time in the Lancang-Mekong Youth Entrepreneurs Forum in Kunming, Yunnan. During the gathering, he also met potential business partners from China and Cambodia, and is now preparing for follow-up meetings.Khun Zaw said the LMC framework provides a good platform for regional young entrepreneurs to know and network with each other.Working togetherChhay Hongmey, 18, a member of the Youth Empowerment in Climate Action Platform, told China Daily that she is interested in the training programs for youth under the LMC framework because it is important for the region's young people to work together on climate issues.The platform was established in 2020 by the United Nations Development Programme in Asia-Pacific in collaboration with its partners to engage regional youth in climate action.Chhay was a speaker at an event on climate adaptation actions and community practice sharing in 2023. The event was held at UNICEF China during the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Week in April last year.Chhay, who is working on tackling food waste in Cambodia, said she was inspired by discussions on agroecology and sustainable agriculture at the LMC event.Having read the Five-Year Plan of Action on Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (2023-2027), Chhay said the framework can make a big contribution to capacity-building, joint research and technical exchange in terms of tackling climate change challenges and facilitating water management across nations."I hope the LMC can be turned into a total green project so we can be more sustainable," said Chhay. She added that China's experience, technology and funding will be helpful for the region to implement relevant projects.Uk, the Cambodian graduate, said young people have the potential to promote the development of the Lancang-Mekong region because their energy, innovation and cultural understanding can position them as catalysts for positive changes."In the future, I hope to work across borders to gain significant expertise and knowledge while also contributing to the prosperity of the region."The Organization of Islamic Cooperation held Israel responsible for the attack on Hamas leader while affirming Iran's right to retaliate in an Iran-initiated emergency meeting.In a final communique adopted by the OIC and foreign ministers of its 57 member states on Aug 7, the OIC holds Israel "fully responsible for this heinous attack", the communique read, which it said constitutes "a crime of aggression, a flagrant violation of international law and the UN Charter and a serious infringement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran".Ismail Haniyeh, former Palestinian prime minister and head of Hamas' political bureau, was assassinated in the Iranian capital Teheran on July 31 by a projectile attack against his residence.The Muslim bloc called on refraining from engaging in any kind of assistance, cooperation, or support to Israel, which it called "the occupying power".They said such support "would prolong Israel's illegal occupation of the Palestinian territory", grant it impunity, and embolden it to "continue its crimes and flagrant violations of international law and relevant UN resolutions". And key powers in the international community are called to uphold their responsibilities in ending the 10-month conflict in Gaza.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on his X account that in the terminology of the US and Europe, those who defend their land against foreign occupation forces and fight for their home, family, and human dignity are branded terrorists.Similarly, any party who supported oppressed people under occupation "is a sponsor of terrorism", he said.This is in contrast to the West's view of Israel, he said."The occupying regime and killer of more than 40,000 people in 10 months — of whom about 10,000 are children — is not branded terrorist, but deserves ovation and applause and all-out political, security, military and arms support," Kanaani wrote."The West has lost its integrity and honor in the Gaza war and is seriously suffering moral decay and civilizational collapse," he added.Tensions remained high this week following Haniyeh's assassination. Iran, Palestine's Hamas, and Lebanon-based Hezbollah have threatened to retaliate against Israel.The ongoing conflict has already prompted some governments to issue travel advisories for their citizens in Middle Eastern countries or those planning to travel there to avoid the conflict hotspots.The United States, the United Kingdom, and France appealed to their citizens to immediately leave Lebanon.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that "no one should escalate" the conflict in the Middle East. He said that the US has been engaged in intense diplomacy with its partners and had communicated directly to Iran and Israel.He reiterated that the US would continue to defend Israel against attacks from terrorist groups or their sponsors, just as they would "continue to defend our troops"."It's urgent that everyone in the region takes stock of the situation, understand the risk of miscalculation, and make decisions that will calm tensions and not exacerbate them," said Blinken.His comments came during a joint press conference with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, and Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles in Annapolis, Maryland, US.Arhama Siddiqa, a Middle East analyst and research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan, told China Daily it was "no secret" that US support for Israel has long been a cornerstone of its foreign policy and deeply rooted in historical precedent."The Zionist lobby wields considerable influence over American political, economic, and social spheres. However, every action has its limits, and now US support for Israel is generating significant backlash," said Siddiqa.She said if the US were to navigate this turmoil, the Biden administration must pressure Netanyahu into agreeing to a cease-fire as the Israeli prime minister's actions "are central to the ongoing conflict"."The US currently has a narrow window of opportunity to address the severe and unprecedented backlash (against Israel). This moment is critical, as domestic and international criticism has reached an all-time high," said Siddiqa.Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told CNN that he believed a cease-fire could be achieved but lamented the actions of Netanyahu."The challenge that we have is that every time we get near, Israel does something that complicates the situation further, including, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in the middle of negotiations," Safadi told CNN.Safadi said their message to the world was "enough is enough" and that the only path forward was to bring about an immediate cease-fire that would help de-escalate the regional situation.This will "save the region from the abyss of further conflict" and protect it from "the agenda of Netanyahu who continues to provoke, continues to escalate", he said."So, the question is do we allow Netanyahu and his radical government to impose their agenda on the region and doom it to a future of more conflict?""Or do we do what we all believe is right and bring about that permanent and immediate cease-fire and then work with everybody to make sure that we are on a path that will ensure that everything that has happened since Oct 7 does not happen again?", referring to the day that Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel.TOKYO -- A 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Miyazaki Prefecture and other areas in southwestern Japan on Thursday, the country's weather agency said.Tsunami advisories have been issued for Miyazaki, Kochi, Ehime, Oita, Kagoshima prefectures on the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).Miyazaki Port in the southern Miyazaki Prefecture was hit by 50 cm tsunami waves following the quake, the JMA said.No abnormalities were found in nuclear plants near the quake-hit area, Kyodo News reported.Kyushu Shinkansen bullet train service was halted after the quake, the report added.The earthquake, measuring lower 6 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7, occurred at 16:43 local time. At a depth of 30 km, the epicenter was located off the waters of Hyuga-nada in southern Kyushu, according to the weather agency.The magnitude had been revised to 7.1 from 6.9.China's efforts to promote new quality productive forces will significantly contribute to the development of a pan-Asia rail network, experts say.This is especially true in Southeast Asia, they said, where China has provided technology for high-speed railways and supported the establishment of international cargo rail services. Examples include the recently launched ASEAN cargo express and the China-Laos Railway, a key project under the Belt and Road Initiative.The resolution adopted by the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stressed the importance of "improving the institutions and mechanisms for fostering new quality productive forces in line with local conditions". China is supporting all-round innovation, with education, science and technology, and talent as the basic and strategic underpinnings for Chinese modernization, all to benefit countries taking part in the BRI.Linda Tjia Yin Nor, an associate professor at the department of public and international affairs, City University of Hong Kong, said China's promotion of new quality productive forces is centered on innovation. This approach goes beyond developing the state-of-the-art technology; it also focuses on leveraging the existing technologies to benefit a broader population.Drawing on her extensive research on Chinese and Japanese railway technology, Tjia highlighted the current railway partnership between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China. She said ASEAN countries need a reliable and safe railway that is suitable for the local market, rather than "very expensive and exceptionally sophisticated "railway technologies.Boosting tradeTjia cited the ASEAN cargo express, which links Malaysia, Thailand and Laos with China, facilitating trade between ASEAN and China.The cargo express recently completed a 14-day trip from Chongqing, returning to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on July 11. The train, operated by Malaysia's railway company KTMB, traveled through Thailand and Laos. KTMB is planning to make two to three trips per month at present.Chin Yew Sin, president of the Malaysia Strategy Research Center, a Kuala Lumpur-based think tank, said the ASEAN cargo express will enhance both intraregional connectivity among ASEAN countries and external connectivity with China.It is important for ASEAN to develop a regional railway express, he said, noting its cost-effectiveness compared with air or sea transport.Chin estimates the ASEAN cargo express will reduce transportation costs between Malaysia and China by 30 percent.Rosli Azad Khan, managing director of MDS Traffic Planners & Consultants, a transport consultancy firm in Kuala Lumpur, said the launch of the ASEAN cargo express is timely in light of the sharp rise in global shipping costs.The current Palestine-Israel conflict has spurred attacks by Yemen's Houthi group on ships plying the Red Sea. The intensified attacks in the strategic waterway have disrupted shipping routes and increased freight rates.The Drewry World Container Index, which monitors the freight market, reported that on July 18, shipping prices for a 40-foot (12-meter) standard container rose to $5,937, nearly four times more than the $1,488 quoted in July last year.Expanding marketsKriengsak Chareonwongsak, president of the Institute of Future Studies for Development in Thailand, said the ASEAN cargo express has given both China and ASEAN chances to expand their markets. But this service can only be sustained if the benefits are distributed among participating countries, he said. "Laos and Thailand can't just be a way to pass through."The ASEAN cargo express is just the latest of the China-ASEAN railway partnership.Another significant component of this partnership is the China-Laos Railway, which was launched in December 2021, linking Vientiane, the capital of Laos, with Kunming in Yunnan province.It has become a key logistics route in the region, facilitating the transportation of 4.18 million metric tons of cargo from the Yexianggu station in Yunnan as of May, said Chen Haican, the station's railway freight duty officer.Anongdeth Phetkaysone, deputy managing director of the Lao Ministry of Public Works and Transport and deputy general manager of the Laos-China Railway Company, said the railway is "very important and crucial" to Laos' socioeconomic development.He emphasized Laos' agricultural focus and its geographical proximity to major agricultural nations such as Thailand and Vietnam."If the Vientiane South Station can be a hub that can transit not just domestic goods ... our main vision is that we try to connect China and ASEAN so that products from ASEAN can be linked to the Chinese mainland," Anongdeth told a media group led by China Daily and the Chinese mission to ASEAN in June."If we can reach this, it would mean huge benefit not only to Laos but also other ASEAN countries."Yang Han in Hong Kong contributed to this story.Thailand will boost the country's digital security and competitiveness, increase investment and empower human capital to promote the kingdom as a digital economy hub for Southeast Asia, a senior official revealed on Wednesday.Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Techsauce Global Summit in Bangkok, Thai Minister of Digital Economy and Society Prasert Jantararuangtong said the country will continue to move ahead in its "Thailand Vision" and build itself into a regional digital hub."We will enhance our digital security and competitiveness by investing more in infrastructure to ensure data security. The ministry will also give more support to technology research and development," Prasert said.He noted that artificial intelligence will play an important role in the map of the country's technology growth, as well as confirming that Thailand will build open data centers to support AI solutions and data sharing.Earlier this year, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin unveiled the "Thailand Vision", which laid out ambitious plans for the country to become a regional hub for tourism, medical treatment, food, aviation, logistics, electric vehicles, digital economy and finance.Srettha said his government would support the development of technology innovations and AI and would provide investment privileges for high-tech firms to open semiconductor factories or open data centers in Thailand to facilitate cloud computing.Thailand's data center market has been ranked the third largest among member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.It continues to post significant growth, thanks to the investment requirements among global and local providers operating in the industry, according to a recent report by Thailand's Kasikorn Research Center.It is estimated that investment in data centers in Thailand will reach $7.8 billion between 2024 and 2027.The predicted industry demand for digital talent means Thailand will also face a shortage of about 600,000 highly skilled digital experts by 2027."We will offer digital literacy courses suitable for laborers in the digital economy, as well as create awareness of digital skills among people. And we will further support knowledge exchange and training to increase Thailand's digital workforce," Prasert said.As Southeast Asia's leading tech event, Techsauce Global Summit aims to position Thailand as the digital gateway to the region. It is a pivotal gathering for tech and startup enthusiasts, driving innovation and digital advancement across the region."Southeast Asia is a market with great future potential where the digital economy will see a promising surge in a wide range of fields from people's daily life to the public application scenarios, such as in the government or the enterprises," said Zhou Chuanfu, vice-president of iFlytek Open Platform.As a Chinese AI company focusing on speech recognition technology, iFlytek entered the Thai market last year.At the summit, it demonstrated models and services including a multilingual translation model that supports real-time translation on a dual-sided screen. Its transparency enhances communication by allowing users to see information and each other's facial expressions through the screen."Now we are collaborating with local companies in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, using our innovation and successful experiences to speed up the region's step toward the AI trend," Zhou said.Zhou said AI can be well employed in tourism and service industries, which are among the major supporting sectors of the economy in many Southeast Asian countries."For example, our digital human customer service model can provide answers to user inquiries. The round-the-clock service that offers a variety of digital avatars and voices will be very efficient and labor-saving," he added.Amid calls for greater cooperation between the two countries, latest analysis shows that Australia's trade with China has significantly benefited Australian households.Addressing a news briefing on Friday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said that "China's development is an opportunity, not a challenge for Australia," as Beijing called for increased cooperation with Australia.Highlighting a report jointly published by the Australia China Business Council and Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre, an independent economic and social research organization, Lin said facts and statistics mentioned in the report reveal the enormous benefits that trade with China has brought for Australians and the win-win nature of China-Australia trade ties.The report, titled Australia's Trade and Economic Relationship with China, estimated that Australia's trade with China increased the average Australian household's disposable income by an average of AU$2,600 ($1,706) in the financial year 2022-23, which equals 4.6 percent of the average household's disposable income. It noted that the two-way trade with China in 2022-23 created about 595,600 jobs, accounting for 4.2 percent of the total employment in Australia.Lin said that strong economic ties will also help keep global industrial and supply chains stable and fully functional, with the links contributing to the sustained economic recovery of the two countries, the region and the wider world."China stands ready to work with Australia to take the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries as a new beginning, implement the important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries and the deliverables of Premier Li Qiang's June visit to Australia, explore new cooperation areas, make the pie of mutually beneficial cooperation bigger, and deliver more benefits to the two peoples," Lin added.The trading relationship also provides affordable goods and services to Australians, according to the report, with imports from China ranging from electronics to everyday consumer items. This accessibility has helped maintain a lower cost of living for Australians. Households in the country would be paying 4.2 percent more for the same consumption items without China as a major import partner.Chen Xiaochen, executive deputy director of the Centre for Asia Pacific Studies at East China Normal University, said the latest findings come at a time of warming relations but it is also important to recognize the undercurrents of skepticism driven by ideological concerns."Some people believe that the China-Australia economic and trade relationship is not important and have security anxieties. This report addresses these concerns," Chen said."The Australian business community uses this report to visually and quantitatively demonstrate the importance of China-Australia trade to the Australian public. Sometimes, China-Australia trade is like air and water, unnoticed but deeply integrated in Australia's economic development and improvement of living standards. This report brings these unnoticed aspects to the forefront, which is its value," he said.There is also no "security-economy dichotomy" as some Australians think, Chen added. He urged Australian policymakers to reflect on the country's culture of security anxiety and ideology-first mentality, pointing out that Australia has excessively adopted a United States-first mindset, which needs to be reconsidered.Stock markets in Asia, Europe and the United States stabilized on Tuesday and Wednesday, after massive earlier volatility over fears that the US was heading for a recession.The sell-off began on Friday, after US employment figures were down on what was expected.The data followed several other releases of bad news, including poor returns from some technology companies, and the US Federal Reserve leaving interest rates at 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent, instead of cutting them.Asian markets were also shaken by last week's surprise Bank of Japan interest rate rise.However, after the sharp falls, stocks rallied, particularly in Japan on Wednesday, after Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida said in a speech that there had been volatility in domestic and overseas financial markets, but that "it is necessary to maintain current levels of monetary easing for the time being".Markets interpreted this as a signal there will not be additional rate hikes this year, and that there will not be a risk of overtightening.The yen shifted from 144.7 against the US dollar to 146.82 and the Topix index closed 2.3 percent higher. The rally included the Nikkei 225 index, which features technology and retail companies, closing 1.2 percent higher.The rebound followed Japanese stocks falling a combined 20 percent over three sessions between Thursday and Monday, the biggest drop on record and equal to a $1.1-trillion loss.Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi index rose almost 2 percent in Wednesday trading, and Taiwan's benchmark index closed almost 4 percent up. India's benchmark Nifty 50 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng were also up by more than 1 percent.A similar story also emerged in European and US markets, with the S&P 500 rising by 0.7 percent and the technology-focused Nasdaq up 0.5 percent.London's FTSE 100 futures was up 1 percent and Europe's Stoxx 50 saw a rise of 0.8 percent.Sho Nakazawa, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley MUFG, told the Financial Times that volatility had calmed, but was likely not over."The biggest concern among market participants is whether pessimism over the US economic outlook has gone too far," Nakazawa said. "The markets will remain highly sensitive to US inflation and job statistics for the foreseeable future."And economist Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens' College at the University of Cambridge, told the BBC: "What happens in the US, economically and financially, does not stay in the US. The US has been the major driver of global economic growth, the US consumer is a very important engine of economic activity, so the world as a whole would suffer if the US were to go into recession."Thailand Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the Move Forward Party (MFP) on Wednesday, with the top party officials banned from politics for 10 years for undermining the monarchy.The verdict to dissolve the party, which came close to taking power in last year's general election but ultimately failed, is over their efforts to reform the lese majeste law, also known as Section 112 of the Criminal Law.Announcing their unanimous ruling at 3 pm on Wednesday, the nine judges said the party posed a threat to the constitutional monarchy and national security by continuously and seriously campaigning for the amendment of Section 112 of the Criminal Code.During last year's general election, the party proposed to amend the law through many political activities and channels.In April, the Election Commission of Thailand requested that the Constitutional Court should consider dissolving the party as they posed a threat to both the monarchy and the democratic form of government with the king as head of state.According to the court, such attempts diminished the value of the royal institution, showed intention to abuse the royal institution for political gain in the general election, hurt people' s faith in the institution and affected national security, local media Bangkok Post reported."Expressions of opinion toward legal amendments and the vote campaigns posed significant threats to national security," it said.In addition to the dissolution, the court imposed a 10-year ban on 11 members of the party's executives who held positions between March 25, 2021, and July 31 last year. The list includes the party leader Pita Limjaroenrat and the first Secretary-General of the party Chaithawat Tulathon, who is also the deputy leader.KATHMANDU -- Four Chinese nationals were killed when a helicopter crashed in Nuwakot district of Nepal's Bagmati province on Wednesday afternoon, the Chinese Embassy in Nepal confirmed."The helicopter belonging to Air Dynasty has crashed. We have found four dead bodies," Tilak Bharati, spokesperson for the district police, told Xinhua.He said the helicopter was flying from Kathmandu to Syafrubesi in Rasuwa district when it went down in Nuwakot's Shivapuri. The Chinese embassy confirmed that the four passengers onboard are Chinese nationals.The helicopter with four Chinese nationals aboard lost contact with the control tower in Kathmandu three minutes after taking off, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said in a statement, noting it crashed at 13:54 local time.Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has expressed his sadness over the incident.KATHMANDU -- A helicopter crashed in Nuwakot district of Nepal's Bagmati province on Wednesday afternoon, with four bodies having been found, local police said."The helicopter belonging to Air Dynasty has crashed. We have found four dead bodies," Tilak Bharati, spokesperson for the district police, told Xinhua.DHAKA -- Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus will serve as the head of Bangladesh's interim government, local media reported early Wednesday.The decision was taken at a meeting of President Mohammed Shahabuddin with chiefs of the three services and the coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement to finalize the outline of the interim government on Tuesday night, Bangladesh's state-run news agency BSS reported.The head of state gave consent to the proposal of the meeting, the president's Press Secretary Md. Joynal Abedin told the news agency.Shahabuddin said other members of the interim government would be finalized in consultation with other political parties of the country.According to the report, Shahabuddin said during the meeting that as Bangladesh is passing through a deep crisis and in order to resolve the problem, an interim government must be formed as soon as possible. He urged everyone to work together to resolve the crisis.Earlier Tuesday, Shahabuddin dissolved the parliament, paving the way for the formation of an interim government following the fall of the government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Bangladesh is facing uncertainty after the resignation and fleeing of Hasina on Monday.Sri Lanka's new national industry policy and five-year strategic plan should help the island nation boost its manufacturing sector and exports, aiding broader economic recovery and enhancing the country's presence in the global markets, experts said.Sri Lanka's Ministry of Industries has prepared a new national industry policy in a bid to boost manufacturing output, as part of wider efforts to shore up the national economy.Sirimal Abeyratne, a professor of economics at the University of Colombo, said the manufacturing sector has no limits to expansion, unlike agriculture."It is essentially a 'tradable sector' that (will) help the country to expand its presence in the global markets and integrate with global value chains," he told China Daily.Strengthening manufacturing will have a positive knock-on effect on other sectors, including agriculture and service sectors, he said."The Ministry of Industries has played a crucial role in reviving the country's economy amid past economic crises. Our goals for 2030 include increasing the manufacturing sector's contribution to gross domestic product from 16 percent to 20 percent, raising the role of entrepreneurship in the workforce from 2.8 percent to 7 percent, and boosting industrial exports' contribution to GDP from 14 percent to 20 percent," Secretary to the Ministry of Industries Shantha Weerasinghe said during a news briefing on July 31.To achieve these objectives and build a globally competitive national industry base in Sri Lanka, a five-year strategic plan for 2023-27 has been prepared and submitted to the Department of National Planning, the official said."The new national industry policy and the five-year strategic plan of Sri Lanka will be the cornerstone of progress in its ongoing economic development," said Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at National University of Singapore Business School.Urgency of recoveryThe expert noted that Sri Lanka is in urgent need of economic recovery after recent downturns."The policy and plan will set the direction for a whole-of-country approach to harness resources and investments to attain a strong economic growth momentum," Loh said.The Ministry of Industries has introduced a registration system for manufacturing industries, Weerasinghe said on July 31.Also, the government has allocated funds for a loan scheme to enhance leadership and entrepreneurship in small and medium enterprises. "The manufacturing sector will be particularly critical for Sri Lanka as it can tap into human capital more rapidly than the services sector," said Loh from Singapore."The country will have a better comparative advantage in the manufacturing sector as the costs can be lower at the onset."However, to boost the expansion of manufacturing industries, Sri Lanka will need to lean on globalizing countries such as China for technical expertise and business opportunities, he said.James Chin, professor of Asian Studies at the University of Tasmania in Australia, said the Sri Lankan economy is picking up again, which will boost trade prospects for the island nation."It is highly expected that trade in Sri Lanka will pick up for the rest of this year and next year, as the world trade recovers," he added.Xinhua contributed to this story.The Philippine authorities need to support small and medium enterprises, streamline business processing systems, and invest in infrastructure and human resources so that the country can attract more investments and create more jobs, a forum in Manila has heard."Ease of doing business is the key," Cecilio Pedro, president of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said during the hybrid forum it organized on Monday.Pedro said that starting a business in the Philippines can be a long and tedious process as investors need to secure many permits from different agencies and wait for weeks before the papers can be processed. This is why, he said, it is difficult for the Philippines to compete with other Southeast Asian countries when it comes to attracting more investments.According to a World Bank report on ease of doing business, the Philippines ranked 95th out of the 190 economies with a score of 62.8.Investors need 33 days and go through 13 procedures before they can set up a business in the Philippines. This is higher than the average 25.6 days and 6.6 procedures in East Asia and the Pacific region.Pedro said enforcing energy reforms, such as the adoption of nuclear energy that can lower high electric power rates, can also attract more investors.Pedro said a lot of Filipinos go abroad owing to a lack of opportunities in their home country. The Philippines is one of the world's biggest labor exporters, with more than 10 million Filipinos living overseas."Filipino workers are good, world-class, that's why companies abroad hire them," he said. But the problem is the Philippines is not benefiting from this brain drain, Pedro said, and that is why it is important to make the Philippines "a beautiful place to invest in and a beautiful place to do business".Fiscal incentivesPhilippine Senator Imee Marcos said other Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam provide better fiscal incentives compared with the Philippines. She said it also does not help that a lot of highly skilled Filipinos migrate to greener pastures, and that the country has high electricity rates.Marcos said the government needs to help micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the rural areas. The government can offer idle lands for free and capital loans to budding entrepreneurs, and provide skills training to workers, she said, adding that authorities can also help these enterprises in conducting research and seizing market opportunities.Marcos called for the promotion of local manufacturers to reduce reliance on business process outsourcing and remittances from overseas Filipino workers. The outsourcing industry accounts for roughly 8 percent of the Philippines' GDP and employs about 1.7 million people.Marcos, who serves as chairwoman of the foreign relations committee in the Philippines' Senate, also addressed questions on foreign policy. She urged the government to uphold an independent and balanced approach similar to other Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia, which prioritize trade and economic cooperation. China expressed on Tuesday its sincere hope for Bangladesh to restore its social stability at an early date.Bangladesh's President Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved parliament on Tuesday, paving the way for the formation of an interim government following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina amid protests in the South Asian country.China is closely following the developments in Bangladesh, a foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement."As a friendly neighbor and comprehensive strategic cooperative partner of Bangladesh, China sincerely hopes that social stability will be restored soon in the country," the statement said.DHAKA -- Bangladesh's President Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved parliament on Tuesday, paving the way for the formation of an interim government following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.The president also ordered the release of jailed former Prime Minister and key opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia, said a press release from Bangabhaban, the official residence of the president of Bangladesh."The decision to dissolve the parliament was taken following the president's discussions with the three chief of staffs of armed forces, leaders of different political parties, representatives of civil society and leaders of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement," said the press release.Shamsuddin Dider, member of the media wing of Bangladesh Nationalist Party, told Xinhua that the party's chief Khaleda Zia has already been released.The release order came a day after her archrival Hasina resigned and military took power. Hasina fled the country on Monday amid violent protests in the South Asian country.An interim government will be set up to run Bangladesh after Hasina's resignation, according to army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman.Zaman made the remarks in a broadcast to the nation on state television on Monday afternoon. He confirmed earlier media reports on Hasina's resignation."We would now go to the president to form an interim government," said Zaman.Hasina, 76, took office for her fourth straight five-year term as the country's prime minister in January this year after her ruling Bangladesh Awami League (AL) party won a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections.The chief minister of the southern Indian state of Kerala has expressed appreciation toward the Chinese ambassador to India and the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing for their messages of solidarity following last week's devastating landslides in the state that are believed to have claimed more than 350 lives.In a post on social media platform X, the chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said, "We sincerely appreciate the solidarity shown by @China_Amb_India towards the people of Wayanad during this challenging time. Also, the compassionate words of @SpoxCHN_LinJian, extending sympathies to those affected by the landslide, are truly valued.""Your encouragement further motivates us to continue our tireless efforts to rebuild and restore the affected areas," Vijayan wrote.Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian both expressed deep condolences last week over the lives lost in the massive landslides, and expressed heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured.Expressing gratitude to China, Randhir Jaiswal, a spokesperson for India's Ministry of External Affairs, posted on X on Aug 2: "Thank you @MFA_China. We appreciate your message of support and solidarity."Chinese Premier Li Qiang also sent a message to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveying condolences, on behalf of the Chinese government, following the landslide disaster, which hit hilly areas in Kerala's Wayanad district in the early hours of July 30.Search efforts in Wayanad's Mundakkai and Chooralmala continued for the seventh day on Aug 6, and authorities have intensified efforts to recover bodies. As many as 221 bodies and 166 body parts have been recovered from the landslide-hit areas, while 206 persons are still missing.Various unofficial reports, however, say that 351 people have been confirmed dead so far in the catastrophic landslides. The toll could rise further as more people are missing, and rescue workers were retrieving more bodies.Vijayan said the repercussions of the landslide, triggered by heavy rain, were yet to subside. Kerala is still in a state of shock.More personnel and equipment were deployed on Aug 4 to recover bodies, and the work resumed in the morning on Aug 5. Hundreds of personnel from various forces, including the Indian army, Navy, National Disaster Response Force, Coast Guard, and Madras Engineer Group, an engineering unit of the Indian Army, and forest department officials have been deployed in the search and rescue operation.More than 1,000 government employees are currently engaged in the disaster management and relief operations in the landslide-ravaged regions in Wayanad district, Vijayan's office said on Aug 4.At least 9,000 persons displaced by the disaster have sought refuge in government-run relief camps.The Kerala government is planning a township for the survivors "to ensure exemplary rehabilitation for those left homeless in the tragedy, Vijayan said on Aug 3 after a review meeting.The Kerala state government has requested the federal government in New Delhi to declare the catastrophic event as a national disaster.Meanwhile, a political blame game has started between the federal government and the Kerala government, which is governed by the Left Democratic Front, an alliance of left-wing political parties.Kerala government did not gauge the severity of the situation accurately despite the federal government dispatching nine National Disaster Response Force teams to the state on July 23, India's Home Minister Amit Shah said in the national parliament last week."Had those blaming the (union) government read the warnings, the situation would have been different," he declared. The Kerala government has denied that they had been warned beforehand of the potential disaster.The first landslide occurred at 2 am local time on July 30 (04:30 am Beijing Time) when people were asleep, followed by another two hours later.People in Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala villages ran to save their lives. Many of those who stayed were buried by landslides that followed one after the other destroying vital infrastructure like roads, bridges and power lines, along with homes and crops.Kerala, which is flanked by Arabian Sea to its west and the Western Ghats mountain range to the east, is accustomed to intense monsoon rainfall, given its geography.The state was ravaged by Cyclone Ockhi in 2017, and was hit again by massive floods in 2018 which claimed 483 lives and affected millions of people, among the worst in its history.A 2021 study revealed that 59 percent of Kerala's landslides occur in plantation areas, highlighting the impact of land-use changes.Wayanad lost 62 percent of its forest cover between 1950 and 2018, according to a study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. The study also warned that changing climate, stronger monsoon in the past two decades and land cover changes have contributed to increased frequency of the "heavy rainfall events".The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.DHAKA — Bangladesh Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced on Monday that an interim government, with the participation of all parties, will be formed, a local media outlet reported."After holding a fruitful discussion with all political parties, we have decided to form an interim government. We will speak with President Mohammed Shahabuddin now to resolve the situation," he was quoted by Dhaka Tribune as saying.It is reported that Waker-Uz-Zaman called for stopping all violence in the name of protest.This happened soon after Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned amid protests on the same day.Hasina, 76, took office for her fourth straight five-year term as the country's prime minister in January after her ruling Bangladesh Awami League, or AL, party won a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections.According to CNN-News18, Hasina landed in India's northeastern city of Agartala later on Monday after leaving Dhaka.Following weeks of violent demonstrations and clashes with security forces, thousands appeared to have entered Hasina's official residence in Dhaka on Monday.The protests began peacefully as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs, but the demonstrations have since morphed into an unprecedented challenge and uprising against Hasina and her ruling AL party.The government attempted to quell the violence, leaving nearly 300 people dead.At least 95 people, including at least 14 police officers, died in clashes in the capital on Sunday, the country's leading Bengali language daily newspaper Prothom Alo reported. Hundreds more were injured in the violence.At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks. The unrest has also resulted in the closure of schools and universities across the country, and authorities at one point imposed a curfew.Over the weekend, protesters called for a "noncooperation "effort, urging people not to pay taxes or utility bills and not to show up for work on Sunday, a working day in Bangladesh. Offices, banks and factories opened, but commuters in Dhaka and other cities faced challenges getting to their jobs.Hasina offered to talk with student leaders on Saturday, but a coordinator refused and announced a one-point demand for her resignation. Hasina had repeated her pledges to investigate the deaths and punish those responsible for the violence. She said she was ready to sit down whenever the protesters wanted.Xu Weiwei in Hong Kong contributed to this story.Agencies via XinhuaCambodia hosted on Monday a groundbreaking ceremony for Funan Techo Canal, a $1.7 billion project that will link the country's capital Phnom Penh to the sea.The 180-kilometer waterway will be a catalyst for economic growth and trade development when it is completed in 2028, said Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet at the groundbreaking ceremony held in Kandal Province."The Funan Techo Canal … will help enhance Cambodia's economic autonomy through strengthening national independence and ownership in transporting cargoes by waterway," Hun Manet said, as cited by Xinhua News Agency.The project will also facilitate Cambodia's trade exchange with the world, he said.Beginning from the Mekong River's Preak Takeo tributary in Kandal Province, which surrounds Phnom Penh, the project will run through Takeo and Kampot provinces before reaching the coast in southern Kep Province.Initial planning shows the two-lane waterway will be 100 meters wide and 5.4 meters deep, and capable of accommodating cargo vessels of up to 3,000 deadweight tons.It is set to play a key role in the kingdom's aspiration to transform itself into a new logistics and economic hub in the Mekong subregion.Hun Manet said the project will help attract investments in industry, agriculture, logistics, real estate, and other sectors on both sides of the canal.Environmentally friendlySun Chanthol, Cambodian deputy prime minister and first vice-president of the Council for the Development of Cambodia, said the canal will not have any adverse environmental impact.Instead, he said, it will help maintain a stable environment, ecology, and natural habitat for biodiversity.More than 10,000 people attended the groundbreaking ceremony.Different celebrations were held across Cambodia, with concerts and traditional performances commemorating the event.Mey Kalyan, an adviser to the Cambodian government and senior adviser to the Supreme National Economic Council of Cambodia, told China Daily that the canal project will contribute greatly to Cambodia's water management.With most of Cambodia's land area lying within the Mekong River basin, Mey said water management is extremely important to control flooding as well as to make sure water is available for use in the dry season.Floods have posed a recurrent threat to Cambodia as seasonal rains push the levels of the Mekong higher.In 2011, flooding caused more than $625 million in economic losses and catastrophic damage to rural infrastructure, according to the Asian Development Bank.Mey said the canal project will help Cambodia enhance flood control and improve transport, which will eventually create favorable conditions for agriculture, investment, trade and other economic activities."It will open up a new horizon for the development of Cambodia," said Mey.In a commentary published in the Khmer Times newspaper website on Monday, Yen Samnang, a research fellow at the Phnom Penh-based Asian Vision Institute think tank, said the canal project is deemed to foster regional connectivity and economic integration."The project is truly in line with Cambodia's values of sustainability, innovation, and global cooperation," he wrote.kelly@chinadailyapac.comThe first batch of Laotian drivers on the China-Laos Railway has received the license allowing them to drive the bullet train independently, opening a new chapter for Laos' railway industry."This is a major event in the history of Lao transport development and a milestone of the joint efforts between Laos and China to cultivate railway talents for Laos," said Lao Deputy Minister of Public Works and Transport Saysongkham Manodham.His comments came when presenting the licenses to the 14 drivers during a ceremony on Aug 5 at Vientiane Station in the Laotian capital. Under the close cooperation between the governments of Laos and China, the railway — a landmark project of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and bilateral friendship — was inaugurated on Dec 3, 2021, and has been safely operated for 976 days as of Aug 5, said Saysongkham.The 1,035-kilometer railway connects Vientiane with Kunming, the capital of Southwest China's Yunnan province.The electrified passenger and cargo railway is built with the full application of Chinese management and technical standards.Saysongkham said the project has helped Laos to build a modern standard-gauge railway management system from scratch.Lao Deputy Prime Minister Saleumxay Kommasith, Minister of Education and Sports Phout Simmalavong, Secretary General of the Lao People's Revolutionary Youth Union Monxay Laomuaxong, and Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Phongsaisack Inthalath also attended the ceremony.In June 2020, the Laos-China Railway Co (LCRC), a joint venture based in Vientiane responsible for the operation of the Laotian section of the railway, recruited the first batch of local locomotive driver trainees.After theoretical study, practical training, mentorship, and on-site training, a total of 66 assistant drivers were selected.By the end of 2023, about 30 assistant drivers crossed the mileage requirement of 100,000 km. The company then selected 12 assistant drivers of electric locomotives and two assistant drivers of internal combustion locomotives.After eight months of training, all 14 young Laotians have passed the relevant qualification examinations.Upon receiving their licenses, they vowed to be the engine of national railway development and practitioners of the China-Laos community with a shared future.Somxay Laolion, 24, is among the young Laotian drivers who can now drive independently on the China-Laos Railway.In 2021, he was assigned to report to the top leaders of both countries at the opening ceremony about the readiness of the train and rode the inaugural train with his Chinese mentor.At Saleumxay's order, the Aug 5 ceremony ended with a fully loaded train, independently driven by a Laotian driver, leaving the station headed for Kunming.The Chinese railway department also provided Laos with various systems for advanced railway technical standards, talent training, and vocational skills appraisal.It also dispatched long-term experts to Laos to help the Southeast Asian country build its own railway network and talent."In the next step, we will make full use of the teaching resources in Chinese railway colleges and the Lao Railway Vocational and Technical College to build a world-class Lao railway talent team, promoting the high-quality development of the China-Laos railway," said Liu Hong, general manager of the LCRC.kelly@chinadailyapac.comThe China Coast Guard took action over the weekend against Philippine ships that approached a Philippine patrol vessel staying illegally near China's Xianbin Reef in the South China Sea, according to a Chinese spokesman.In a statement released on Sunday night, Coast Guard spokesman Gan Yu said that Chinese ships monitored and warned off vessels from the Philippines' Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. These vessels had gathered around the Philippine Coast Guard ship BRP Teresa Magbanua, the largest and most advanced ship in the PCG's fleet.The Teresa Magbanua has been staying illegally near the Xianbin Reef of China's Nansha Islands since mid-April."China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their adjacent waters," Gan said. He added that the Philippine ships had infringed on China's sovereignty and maritime rights, violated the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and jeopardized regional peace and stability."The China Coast Guard will, as always, conduct rights protection and law enforcement activities in the waters under Chinese jurisdiction, firmly safeguarding national sovereignty and maritime interests," Gan stated.DHAKA -- An interim government will be set up to run Bangladesh after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned Monday amid protests in the South Asian country, according to army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman.Zaman made the remarks in a broadcast to the nation on state television on Monday afternoon. He said Hasina has resigned, which confirmed media reports earlier about her step-down."We would now go to the president to form an interim government," said Zaman.There will be no need to declare a state of emergency if the situation gets better, said Zaman while calling for maintaining peace and order in the country.He expressed hope that after his speech, the situation will improve.Hasina, 76, took office for her fourth straight five-year term as the country's prime minister in January this year after her ruling Bangladesh Awami League (AL) party won a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections."Tussau Kesuu" with Ding Liren, world chess champion from China conducts Kazakh ceremony for young Kazakhstani, DKnews.kz reports.The World Rapid and Blitz Team Championships continue with the celebration of good Kazakh traditions. The famous Chinese chess player, the 17th World Champion Ding Liren, performed the "tussau kesuu" ceremony for a young Kazakhstani.On Sunday, at the Hilton hotel in the capital, the grandmaster and reigning world champion cut the ties for little Chingiz, who is about to turn one year old."Our family was fortunate that the first cautious steps of our son coincided with the time when such a major championship, gathering stars of the chess world, is being held in Astana. It is an honor for us that the current champion Ding Liren, known for his calm character, courtesy, and great talent, conducted this important ceremony for the Kazakh people. May our Chingiz have a bright path and become a renowned champion and a valiant citizen of his country," Chingiz's father Asylkhan Karaev noted.Asylkhan himself is a chess player and a FIDE arbiter. He admits that even if his son does not follow in his footsteps, the skill of playing chess will always help him think strategically and make the right moves in life.The chess player cut the ties for the boy and, together with the child's mother, led him along the "aq jol" (white path). After the ceremony, 31-year-old Ding Liren gave the child some words of encouragement."I am honored today to participate in this symbolic ceremony. This is my first experience in such ceremonies. I hope the child will have a happy life and a bright path, whichever direction he chooses," Ding Liren said.From the items symbolizing different professions, the young Kazakhstani, walking along the white path, chose the chess queen piece. As a sign of gratitude and in Kazakh tradition, the parents presented Ding with a gift.The event was also attended by participants of a business breakfast for businesswomen, held in Astana as part of the championship. FIDE Deputy Chairperson, Latvian politician and grandmaster Dana Reizniece-Ozola, spoke on the important topic of women's leadership and overcoming barriers faced by women on the path to success.As China forges ahead with its path toward high-quality development and sci-tech self-reliance, Pakistan stands ready to deepen the "ironclad" partnership through enhanced economic cooperation and technological collaboration, said Khalil Hashmi, the nation's top envoy to Beijing.In an exclusive interview with China Daily during his recent trip to Shanghai, Hashmi welcomed the comprehensive decision adopted at the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China that laid out an effective road map for shaping China's more resilient economy over the next five years and beyond. （Video）There is an emphasis on innovation, giving full play to new quality productive forces like digital and green development, as well as people-centered philosophies, Hashmi noted."We can pursue joint ventures, research and development and promote educational exchanges in these cutting-edge fields," he said.This augurs a new phase in the time-tested friendship, often described as a bond between "iron brothers" and "all-weather strategic partners".The two nations established diplomatic ties in 1951."This relationship is unique — it has withstood many tests of times and changes and has no precedent in modern times," Hashmi affirmed.Whether it was the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the 2010 and 2022 floods in Pakistan, or the COVID-19 pandemic, each nation has rushed to the other's aid, demonstrating the spirit of solidarity as the most trusted and most reliable friend, Hashmi recalled.It is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor — the flagship project of China's transcontinental Belt and Road Initiative — that has become the modern lodestar of bilateral cooperation. According to the ambassador, CPEC has brought more than $25 billion in investments across nearly 50 projects in just a decade. CPEC is also seen as a gateway for wider regional integration."We have also agreed to extend this corridor to the region, and make it more inclusive by bringing in other interested nations to create an economically interconnected region for the ultimate welfare of people of this region," the envoy added.The corridor has helped Pakistan substantially improve infrastructure like transportation and the energy sector. "Having achieved that, we are now moving into industry and manufacturing, with a lot of focus on joint ventures."During Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's visit to China in June, more than 30 memorandums of understanding were signed between 250 Chinese and 105 Pakistani companies across 13 sectors. "The idea is to benefit from Chinese capital, technology, management practices, and efficiency to enhance our productive capabilities — I see it as a win-win."The 13 sectors, encompassing information technology, mines and minerals, pharmacy, agriculture and electric vehicles, among others, represent areas where China's technologies can be transferred to foster growth in Pakistan.Hashmi considers green technologies as one of the key areas — producing electric vehicles, solar panels, wind turbines and ion batteries, as China has developed these technologies at a large scale and at very affordable prices, enabling developing countries to benefit from these new technologies.Complementing economic ties, Pakistan is also an eager partner in China's other leaps."China has established an international space center and has launched missions to the moon and Mars, demonstrating its capabilities in space technology," Hashmi said, highlighting the recent inclusion of Pakistan's ICUBE-Q satellite in China's Chang'e 6 lunar mission.China has played a constructive regional and global role as a force for peace, development and conflict resolution, the ambassador said, citing its support for the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia and the recently inked Beijing Declaration on Ending Division and Strengthening Palestinian National Unity.China has demonstrated it is a force for positive change globally and Pakistan looks forward to working closely with China at the UN Security Council and multilateral platforms to voice developing nations' economic and security interests, Hashmi stated.While strategic priorities have evolved over decades, an abiding people-to-people connection remains the bedrock of China-Pakistan ties.Hashmi also spoke of encouraging and attracting Chinese investments in Pakistan and promoting joint ventures. "My aspiration is to see our bilateral trade, currently around $23 billion, enhanced significantly in the next two years."TOKYO -- The intense heat wave in Japan shows no signs of abating with the mercury in Kyushu nearing 40 degrees Celsius on Sunday, weather forecasts showed.Wide areas of western and eastern Japan are expected to experience temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius during the day, triggering heatstroke alerts in 37 prefectures.With the heat persisting through the night, daytime temperatures on Sunday were forecast to reach dangerously high levels, with Kurume in Fukuoka expecting a maximum of 39 degrees Celcius and Saga and Kumamoto predicting highs of 38.Tokyo is set to experience 35 degrees Celcius, marking its first extreme heat day in four days, while Nagoya is bracing for its 11th consecutive day of temperatures at 37.As of 11 am local time on Sunday, the heat stress index, or Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), reached the red level in most parts of the country, representing the highest level of heatstroke risk on the country's five-tier system, official data showed.The WBGT, which measures heatstroke risk, takes into account temperature, humidity, and sunlight intensity as one of the empirical indices representing the heat stress to which an individual is exposed.Authorities have advised residents to stay indoors in cool environments and plan summer activities that minimize exposure to the heat.Residents are urged to take heatstroke precautions seriously and adjust their plans accordingly to ensure safety during this severe heat wave.HANOI - Vietnamese President To Lam has been elected as general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee, according to a press conference here on Saturday.Lam was unanimously supported at a meeting of the 13th CPV Central Committee held in the Vietnamese capital on Saturday morning.Speaking at the press conference, Lam said he will inherit and uphold the revolutionary achievements made by late Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and previous generations of leaders.He vowed to resolutely lead and direct the entire Party, people and army, together with the CPV Central Committee, the Political Bureau, and the Party Central Committee's Secretariat, to accomplish the goals and tasks set forth by the 13th National Party Congress and successfully organize the 14th National Party Congress.On July 18, a notice issued by the Political Bureau said that due to Trong's need to focus on receiving health treatment, To Lam, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPV Central Committee and the Vietnamese president, took charge of supervising the work of the CPV Central Committee, the Political Bureau of the CPV Central Committee, and the Secretariat of the CPV Central Committee.Trong died on July 19 at the age of 80, according to the board of health protection and care for central officials.Lam, born on July 10, 1957, in Vietnam's northern Hung Yen province, has served at the Ministry of Public Security for a long time.On May 22, 2024, the 15th National Assembly elected Lam as Vietnam's president for a tenure till 2026.Lam is a member of the 11th, 12th and 13th CPV Central Committee, a member of the 12th and 13th Party Central Committee Political Bureau, and a deputy to the 14th and 15th National Assembly of Vietnam.The business community in Hong Kong has hailed President Xi Jinping's warm encouragement for its entrepreneurs, saying that the local business sector will continue to leverage its strengths actively to serve the needs of the country.The president recently replied to a letter from Hong Kong businesspeople with ancestral roots in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, including representatives such as Chao Kee-young and Pao Pui-hing, daughter of late shipping mogul Pao Yue-kong.They recently wrote to Xi to highlight the efforts they are making to support national development, and expressed their resolve to serve the nation's modernization.In his reply, Xi praised the contributions they are making to the development of their hometown and the country through their active engagement in innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as through their donations to education.Agnes Chan Sui-kuen, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce — the oldest and largest business chamber representing multinational companies operating in the city — said Xi's words reflect his sincere care and appreciation."From innovation to philanthropy, the contributions of their pioneering ancestors are a source of immense pride to Ningbo and the country. The Hong Kong business community should work to promote this entrepreneurial spirit and unite the forces of patriotism," Chan said."President Xi's cordial encouragement is very encouraging to all Hong Kong entrepreneurs of different origins and from different places," said Jonathan Choi Koon-shum, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and Hong Kong-based conglomerate Sunwah Group."Hong Kong's industrial and commercial community will continue to actively leverage its strengths to serve the needs of the country, comprehensively deepen reforms in the new era, promote Chinese modernization and contribute the strength of Hong Kong entrepreneurs," added Choi, who is a Standing Committee member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference — the nation's top political advisory body.Steve Chuang, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, told China Daily: "Hong Kong's industrial sector has actively participated in the country's reform since the 1980s. President Xi's reply reflects his high recognition of Hong Kong's business community and private enterprises, and strengthens our confidence in continuing to actively integrate into the overall development of the country."NANNING -- Police personnel from China and Vietnam concluded joint counter-terrorism training in south China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region on Friday.The training was aimed at jointly addressing the threat of terrorism and focused on combating violent terrorist activities.During the two-week program, police personnel from both sides conducted exchanges, discussions and various exercises covering subjects such as command, skills and tactics.This joint training exercise marked the first of its kind between the Chinese People's Armed Police Force and the mobile police forces of the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security. It aimed to cement friendship between the two countries, strengthen mutual trust and cooperation, and enhance joint counter-terrorism capabilities.Malaysian student Lim Jia Le has been studying at Tsinghua University for five years. Reflecting on her choice to study in China after high school, the 23-year-old said it was the best decision she made."Among the countries I received offers from, I chose China mainly because Tsinghua University ranks high internationally for majors in life sciences and chemical engineering, which are my fields of interest," Lim said.Lim said that students from her high school had been opting for China for their higher education since 2016. "They would come back home to Malaysia and share their experiences in China. I felt that China could offer more opportunities for future development, more recreational activities and a safer social environment. These factors helped me make up my mind," she said.After studying in China for five years, Lim describes her experience as overwhelmingly positive. "Compared to universities in Malaysia or Singapore, Tsinghua offers a wealth of student activities and various forums with distinguished guests, which are particularly attractive to Malaysian students. Living in China is also very convenient with its efficient food delivery and transportation services."As Malaysia and China celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations, educational exchanges between the two nations have become a new highlight, with more and more Malaysian students opting for higher education in China.Data from the Association of Graduates from Universities and Colleges of China in Malaysia show that about 1,800 Malaysian students studied in China in 2007. By 2019, this number had grown to approximately 9,500, and the number of Malaysian students enrolled in Chinese universities exceeded 10,000 in 2023. Notably, the number of postgraduate students has increased significantly in the post-pandemic era.Lim Kok Yan, president of the Association of Graduates from Universities and Colleges of China-Malaysia, said that China's economic development and growing international influence are key factors attracting Malaysian students."Many Malaysian parents believe that studying in China offers their children broader networks and perspectives. Chinese companies expanding globally often prefer to hire Malaysians with Chinese educational backgrounds. The Belt and Road Initiative has further deepened economic and trade cooperation between Malaysia and China, making it easier for Malaysian graduates to find related jobs," he said.Professor Su Yingying, dean of the School of Asian Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, or BFSU, attributed the growing popularity of China as an overseas study destination among Malaysian students to strong bilateral relations.Deepened trust"The close cooperation between China and Malaysia in various fields has deepened bilateral political trust and economic ties. Over the past decade, the Belt and Road Initiative has further strengthened this trust and therefore fostered flourishing educational and cultural exchanges," she said.In April, the Chinese Service Center for Scholarly Exchange and Malaysian Qualifications Agency signed a memorandum about degree recognition, which explored establishing a coordination mechanism and jointly addressing issues in degree recognition. "Such close cooperation between the two countries' education departments has boosted educational exchanges from both institutional and policy perspectives," Su said."More importantly, higher education is also advancing rapidly in China, with many majors now becoming internationally competitive. At the same time, China provides a safe study environment and relatively lower tuition fees, compared to other countries. These factors make China an attractive destination for Malaysian students," she said.During his visit to Shanghai in May, Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister I and Minister of Rural and Regional Development Dato' Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid bin Hamidi emphasized China's advantage in high technology and urged Malaysian youths to seize the opportunity to pursue higher education in China to gain knowledge in various fields, especially technology, Malaysian media reported."As China-Malaysia economic collaboration expands and Chinese investment in Malaysia grows, I think more Malaysian students will choose China for higher education, covering an increasing range of majors," said Su of BFSU.yangran1@chinadaily.com.cnA human rights exchange delegation, led by Jiang Jinguo, executive vice president of the China Society for Human Rights Studies, concluded its visit to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan for bilateral exchanges on Thursday.During the eight-day visit, the delegation introduced the significant deployment regarding upholding the correct view of human rights and strengthening law enforcement and judicial protection of human rights, as outlined by the third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee.The delegation provided insights into China's contemporary perspective on human rights, its achievements and experiences, reaffirming the country's commitment to promoting the comprehensive advancement of human rights endeavors.They actively coordinated with Tajik and Uzbek counterparts, maintaining converging positions and actions with China in the international human rights struggle.Various sectors in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan highly praised the remarkable achievements of China in putting people at the center, deepening comprehensive reforms, and achieving high-quality development.Both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan highly praised China's path and experience in human rights development, noting many similarities in human rights principles between their countries and China.China and India have agreed to accelerate the negotiation process and accommodate each other's legitimate concerns to find a solution to the border issue that is mutually accepted by both sides.The pledge was made as the two sides held on Wednesday the 30th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on China-India Border Affairs in New Delhi.The talks followed a recent meeting between Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in Vientiane where they agreed to work for new progress in consultations on border affairs.During Wednesday's meeting, both sides agreed to actively implement the important consensus reached in the latest meeting between the two foreign ministers. They also agreed to focus on specific border-related issues and consider each other's legitimate concerns, and to reach an early solution acceptable to both countries.They agreed to maintain diplomatic and military communication channels and strengthen negotiation mechanisms to promote the sound and stable development of China-India relations.Both sides also committed to strictly adhering to existing agreements as well as upholding peace and tranquility in the border areas.In another development, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian expressed heartfelt thanks on Thursday to relevant Indian departments and personnel as they provided humanitarian rescue work to a Chinese crew member.Recently, a Chinese crew member was accidentally injured while conducting maritime operations off Mumbai's coast. He received prompt assistance and treatment from the Indian side. The crew member is now in a stable condition and has returned to China for further recovery, Lin told a daily news briefing.CANBERRA -- The Australian government has denounced Japan's decision to expand its commercial whaling.Tanya Plibersek, minister for the environment and water, on Thursday condemned Japan's move to add fin whales to its list of commercial whalers will target."Australia is deeply disappointed by Japan's decision to expand its commercial whaling program by adding fin whales," she said in a statement.Fin whales are the second-largest whale species in the world and are listed as vulnerable to extinction on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.Japan's Fisheries Agency in May proposed expanding commercial whaling in the country's territorial waters and exclusive economic zone to include fin whales. In June the agency announced that it has authorized the hunting of up to 59 fin whales in the North Pacific in 2024.Plibersek said on Thursday that Australia is opposed to all commercial whaling and called for all countries to end the practice."Australia's efforts through the International Whaling Commission have contributed to a whaling-free Southern Ocean and a decline in commercial whaling around the world. Australia will continue to advocate for the protection and conservation of whales and the health of our ocean for future generations," she said.As China and Thailand have benefited from cultural exchange since ancient times, people-to-people exchanges between the two countries are increasingly close, showing unprecedented vitality over the past years with the all-round development of bilateral relations, said Fu Zengyou, former dean of the Confucius Institute at Chulalongkorn University.Recalling his first trip to Thailand in 1980, Fu said many people from the two countries barely knew each other then, partially due to poor transportation and a lack of communication. The condition had not changed until 1975, when China and Thailand officially established diplomatic relations.Invited by the Thai government for an exchange program, Fu and two other Chinese scholars who studied the Thai language traveled to Bangkok from Beijing by plane. Back then, there was no direct flight between the two cities and they had to transfer twice at Kunming in Southwest China's Yunnan province and Vientiane, the capital of Laos."It was an old flight. When it flew above the mountainous region at the border, we were told to wear life jackets. No one asked the cabin crew for a reason, leaving only an unearthly silence," he recalled.The plane eventually flew back to Vientiane and took off again after a two-hour repair. Fu's Chinese friends had to bid farewell to the group twice in a day, as the plane returned even before they left the airport."It was really an unforgettable and arduous journey," Fu said, making a special mention of four apples given by his neighbor as a farewell gift before he left Beijing. "I should thank her for the wishes of peace and safety for the trip," he said.During their stay in Thailand, Fu said many Thai people asked him lots of questions about China. Apart from ordinary ones such as whether China had banks or photo studios, many Thai people asked questions that came from bizarre rumors that went far beyond Fu's imagination."They asked me if we would kill elderly people aged more than 70 years old and used their bodies as fertilizer. Also, they were curious about my marriage and ask whether my wife was picked from a group of women that were 'arranged' by the government," Fu recalled with laughter."Those questions with bias mostly resulted from a lack of mutual understanding for a long time. It exactly indicated the importance of communication. Friendship only forms when you know each other well," he said, adding that language learning played a crucial role in promoting exchanges and deepening understanding between people from different countries.As co-founder of Thailand's first department of Chinese language that was launched in 1996 at Srinakharinwirot University and vice-chairman of the Thai Chinese teachers' union, Fu said Chinese language learning has been booming among Thai people over the past decades."Since Thailand and China built diplomatic relations in 1975, the Thai government has encouraged learning Mandarin thanks to the efforts from Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, who had a leading role in particular," Fu said.Having been to China more than 50 times, the Thai princess learned Mandarin well and even translated several Chinese novels into Thai. She also made great efforts to deepen the exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the fields of education, traditional medicine, science and technology, and even aerospace."More than building bridges of friendship, Princess Sirindhorn embodies the solid bond that unites China and Thailand," Fu said. Different from the 1980s when few people could speak Mandarin, he said now all Thai schools have Mandarin classes.Over the past 20 years, about 20,000 volunteer teachers from China have given language classes in Thai schools and helped to train Mandarin teachers for the kingdom.Tens of thousands of Thai students head to China annually, studying a wide range of subjects, including Mandarin, medicine, IT, science and technology. In China, the number of colleges providing Thai language classes has also increased, from seven in the 1990s to more than 50 now."Historically, cultural exchange between China and Thailand has been rich and multifaceted," Fu said."As the two countries see closer ties now, people-to-people exchanges will keep upgrading to a higher level and their long-standing friendship will also reach a new stage." In the newly opened Emsphere shopping mall, a fashion landmark in Bangkok, long lines form in front of a Thai dessert shop during the weekend.The crowd consists mainly of excited tourists, many of them obsessed not with the cakes or cookies on sale but with a 30-second opportunity to take selfies with a furry doll known as Butterbear.Fans of the bear, mostly young travelers from China and South Korea, come from afar with a must-do list and photos with the mascot, whose popularity is likened to a pop star."Butterbear is one of the Thai top streamers on Chinese social media. She is super cute. A selfie with her will definitely attract comments and likes on the internet," said Wu Qian from Chongqing in Southwest China. She visited Bangkok with her boyfriend in early July.The couple planned their trip to Thailand to coincide with the bear's "picture time", which is limited to weekend afternoons. Every customer is allowed to have just 30 seconds for a photo with the character and the lines usually stretch about two hours.The major Thai confectionery brand is also reaping the rewards of the bear's popularity, with brisk sales of its products in Bangkok and upcoming shops in China set to offer various items extending to merchandise such as bags and cups with the mascot's image.Butterbear began drawing attention in May and has about 430,000 followers on Instagram. On Chinese lifestyle app Xiaohongshu and short video platform TikTok, it has attracted nearly 1 million followers in total.The "cute factor" behind the brand's bear is just one part of its ability to become a viral hit on social media and captivate wide audiences.Editor's note: In this weekly feature China Daily gives voice to Asia and its people. The stories presented come mainly from the Asia News Network (ANN), of which China Daily is among its 20 leading titles.The South Korean economy is poised to continue its recovery in the latter half of this year but the country must address its "existential issue", which stems from problems such as low productivity and a declining population, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said on July 11."We publish surveys every two years, but this one is about an existential issue for (South) Korea," said Vincent Koen, the OECD's country studies division chief in the economics department, during a press briefing at the Ministry of Economy and Finance building in the city of Sejong.One urgent issue South Korea must address is the population decline and its notoriously low fertility rate, according to the OECD Economic Surveys: Korea 2024 report released that day."Supporting people to have the number of children they desire would dampen the projected population decline, while lengthening working lives and welcoming more foreign workers would counteract the adverse effects of aging," the report noted.For this, Koen also called for structural reforms in the labor market, improvements in labor and family policies, and changes in societal norms to counter population decline.The report also called for a "decisive upgrade" in South Korea's export-oriented growth model to bolster declining productivity.Citing the gap between large and small companies as a key reason for falling productivity, the OECD urged reforms to create a level playing field for competition. Stricter management of subsidies and benefits for small and medium-sized companies as well as streamlined regulations to enhance market competition are recommended, the report said.Meanwhile, the OECD survey report forecast a 2.6 percent growth outlook for the South Korean economy this year, driven by improved exports and strengthening domestic demand in the second half."With inflation falling back and renewed demand for computer chips powering a wave of investment in AI across the world, exports are again driving growth," Koen said.For 2025, the OECD expected that South Korea's economic growth would slow to 2.2 percent.Unlike exports, private consumption in South Korea has been weak in the first half of the year, pulled down by high interest rates and weak real wage growth. The OECD anticipates the domestic market to rebound in the latter half." (South Korea's) elevated debt servicing burdens and accumulated inflation will continue to weigh on private consumption and investment in the short term, but domestic demand should strengthen from the second half of 2024," the report stated.The Korea HeraldExposing illicit wildlife trade that thrives on e-commerce platforms is like a game of whack-a-mole, even with the use of artificial intelligence tools.Illicit online listings of the likes of ivory, pangolin scales or even live animals are often disguised using emoji, other languages and code words such as "rare collectibles" that make them difficult to detect, said Jayasri Srikantan, who spearheads a volunteer effort under wildlife conservation group World Wildlife Fund to flag illegal trade to the authorities.But an AI model is being developed to assist WWF's volunteers — called cyber spotters — to evaluate flagged listings on e-commerce platforms with greater accuracy.The system, trained on thousands of wildlife product samples and their estimated black market prices, helps to prevent false positives, ensuring the group's credibility with law enforcement partners.The program's accuracy rate is about 90 percent for now, said Jayasri, adding that new code words and trends are regularly added to the system to keep it up to date with current trends.Deployed in 2023, the WWF's Cyber Spotter AI model is part of an initiative to fund and kick-start AI projects in Singapore to spur AI adoption, led by national AI program AI Singapore.The AI system, which has been in the works since 2022, is designed to help improve the accuracy of reports compiled quarterly by the WWF and by its pool of more than 400 volunteers in Singapore, who trawl local e-commerce platforms for hours each month for signs of illegal wildlife trade, said Jayasri, WWF Singapore's head of education and outreach.Images and text from postings flagged by the cyber spotters are uploaded to an AI model, which analyzes text and photos for clues of illegally traded wildlife and their products.The team needs to avoid flagging replicas by mistake and must look out for clues in each listing's images, text and prices to ascertain if it truly involves an exploited animal. Listings that have a high mix of these elements could be flagged by the software as genuinely illegal."It's trickier than it sounds," Jayasri said. Spotting ivory, for instance, is not as easy as it seems, as Schreger lines — unique patterns found within an elephant's bones that guarantee its authenticity — are tough to discern through often blurry images online.Some sellers brazenly list protected wildlife products online, but others employ tactics to conceal their illicit offerings, Jayasri said. These tactics include using emoji or code words that hint at the creature being sold, or employing emoji representing the animal, which all "make it challenging for our team to identify genuine listings accurately".Ivory replicas can be sold at low prices while real elephant ivory is more likely to be listed in the hundreds of dollars, Jayasri said."But sellers can play all sorts of tricks to slip under the radar, like lowering the prices or using other code words so that they aren't suspected. The AI needs to consider all of this."The system does not replace the work of volunteers, who conduct final checks on the reports before they are submitted.Jayasri said the team here flags tens of thousands of listings each year in an effort to prevent the illegal trade — the second leading cause of wildlife loss after deforestation worldwide, and among the world's most profitable crime sectors.The end goal, Jayasri said, is to fully automate the system so that an AI model is able to trawl websites for illegal listings and compile a report on its own, but the technology has some way to go before achieving this level of autonomy.The international agency aims to introduce the system to its other branches soon, she said.The Straits TimesAn increasing number of foreign nationals are seeking permits to work in Bangladesh because of a lack of skilled managers and an education system not tailored to meet industrialization in the country.A total of 16,303 applications from nationals of 101 countries were approved by the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority in the fiscal year of 2022-23, up about 8 percent year-on-year.Of the cases, 6,256 are for new work permits while 10,047 are renewals, according to the annual report of the state-run investment promotion agency.In 2021-22, 15,128 applicants from 106 countries received the permits, which is a staggering 87 percent increase from that in the fiscal year preceding it. Of the figure, 7,790 were for new work permits and 7,338 renewals.Government agencies such as the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority, the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority, the NGO Affairs Bureau and some ministries grant permits to foreign nationals to work on projects.For example, as of June 2024, over 1,800 permits were issued for foreign nationals to work inside export processing zones.Nationals from India secured the highest number of work permits at 3,159 in the fiscal year of 2022-23, followed by those from China (2,339), Sri Lanka (759) and Belarus (727).Industry insiders said foreigners were hired based on their skills and on their past records of being industrious as they can contribute to outstanding outcomes for industrial development.Mohsina Yasmin, executive member of the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority, said the professionals were meeting the skills gap in the national workforce of the industrial sector, abiding by the laws of Bangladesh and paying taxes.The authority provides work permits according to the guidelines for skilled technicians and managerial level positions as they can help generate skills for manpower, Mohsina said.She pointed out that the agency issued work permits solely to those foreign nationals who were engaged in registered industrial projects, commercial offices and other organizations.The agency does not maintain data relating to the total number of foreign workers in Bangladesh, she said.Abdul Matlub Ahmad, president of the India and Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Bangladeshi investors, especially in the garment and automobile sectors, usually hire highly skilled Indian engineers and managers."Besides, there are a lot of Indian entrepreneurs of small and medium enterprises who avail long-term work permits instead of short-term visas for having to regularly travel to Bangladesh."Ahmad said he had also hired six highly skilled Indian engineers for his Nitol Niloy Group to develop the skills of local engineers and managers.He acknowledged that the investors prefer to hire such skilled professionals as they contribute to business growth and expansion."On the other hand, industries are expanding through foreign direct investments and joint ventures with local investors, all of which require skilled manpower."Mohammed Amirul Haque, managing director of Premier Cement Mills, said investors hire foreign professionals to train local managers and engineers but at the end of the day, this was not always realized."So, investors have continued to depend on foreign professionals. However, in some cases, it is better to hire local professionals than foreigners."If investors get skilled professionals locally, the outflow of funds in the form of remittances will reduce, which will help the economy.Foreigners working in Bangladesh sent home $137 million in 2022, World Bank data showed, although analysts believe the exact figure would be much higher since many people from other nations are employed in the country without valid permits.In 2020, the Transparency International Bangladesh group said an estimated $3.1 billion was channeled away every year by foreign nationals employed in the country.Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said the yearly increase in the number of foreign nationals indicate that the labor market of Bangladesh offered flexibility and satisfaction."However, a continuous rise of foreign nationals in the industrial sector was a clear indication that the local graduates and professionals are not as skilled as the foreigners."Even though local professionals can be hired at a lower pay, investors recruit foreign professionals offering high remunerations due to their professionalism and skills."The economist also said this trend raises questions and sends a negative impression about the knowledge being imparted by the educational institutions in the country.Moazzem suggested building skilled manpower by ensuring quality education to reduce dependency on foreign nationals and to reduce pressure on the forex reserve.Ferdaus Ara Begum, chief executive officer of think tank Business Initiative Leading Development, blamed the skills gap in the local workforce and a lack of quality education at the tertiary level.Besides, public university graduates tend to leave the country after gaining skills as they do not get the facilities that meet their expectations although the government spends a large amount of money on their education, she alleged.Ferdaus Ara also said there were allegations that some foreign nationals come to Bangladesh without job visas and work on a temporary basis."It is really tough to identify these temporary workers who come under tourist visas."The Daily StarThe renewed inflow of Chinese foreign direct investment will be very positive for India, said experts after senior officials expressed recently that they welcomed fresh Chinese investments, given China's key role in the global supply chains and the benefits such investments can bring to both neighbors."India should invite Chinese investment; it will be a win-win for both India and China," said Sudheendra Kulkarni, who founded the Forum for a New South Asia, which promotes cooperation between India, Pakistan and China.After imposing curbs on Chinese investment for years, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week backed her chief economic adviser's suggestion to reopen India's door for Chinese investment.The adviser, V. Anantha Nageswaran, said earlier in a media address that India should focus on getting more FDI from China, as it can help boost India's export sector and also keep the trade deficit with China under manageable levels.An economic survey report for 2023-24 tabled in the Indian Parliament on July 22, a day before the finance minister presented the Union Budget for fiscal 2024-25, also advocated attracting investments from Chinese companies to boost exports.During her budget speech in parliament, Sitharaman proposed to simplify the norms surrounding FDI and overseas investments in a bid to boost capital inflows from foreign shores."Both China and India understand the nature of an interconnected, interdependent and globalized world wherein the flow of capital, goods and people is mutually beneficial," said Karori Singh, former director and an emeritus fellow of the South Asia Studies Centre at the University of Rajasthan in India.India is focusing on improving the ease of doing business to attract more FDI and boost exports, he said.India tightened its scrutiny of investments from Chinese companies, and halted major projects from China since May 2020.Projects haltedThe curbs disrupted billions of dollars of investment from China and halted some investment projects, including those of Chinese automakers BYD and Great Wall Motor. Also affected were Chinese smartphone makers Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi. India, meanwhile, also banned more than 300 Chinese apps."To boost Indian manufacturing and plug India into the global supply chain, it is inevitable that India plugs itself into China's supply chain. Whether we do so by relying solely on imports or partially through Chinese investments is a choice that India has to make," the economic survey report said."Even though India is the fastest-growing G20 country and is now recording growth rates that outpace China's, India's economy is still a fraction of China's," it noted.The report makes a case for removing restrictions on Chinese FDI in order to turn India into an export hub that can export to the Western economies, analysts say.Biswajit Dhar, a former professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, said the tacit assumption behind the above argument is that China's technological prowess can improve the competitiveness of the Indian manufacturing sector.He noted that China was able to leverage the strengths of foreign investors to increase the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector. But the question is whether India can develop an effective strategy to benefit from Chinese companies, similar to what China did vis-a-vis Western multinationals, Dhar said.Sebastian Morris, a former professor at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, said that FDI from China will help India's manufacturing sector to be more competitive in the international market, giving a boost to its exports. But he added that it will only happen when India's currency exchange rate is more competitive.Kulkarni said there is a great scope for joint ventures between China and India in renewable energy, semiconductors and heavy engineering, as well as in digital technologies.Wang Shida, deputy director of the Institute of South Asian Studies at the Beijing-based China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said strengthening economic and trade cooperation with China is not only in line with the interests of India's industry, but also important for the government in New Delhi to realize its "Made in India" vision and help the nation achieve the developed country status by 2047.He said the Indian government and ordinary people in India are increasingly aware that restricting economic and trade cooperation with China not only hinders the growth of India's trade, but also has a negative impact on India's achievement of broader economic goals.APARAJIT CHAKRABORTY is a freelance journalist for China Daily.CHOORALMALA, India — Soldiers and rescuers worked through slush and rocks under steady rain, looking for survivors and searching for bodies in the hills of India's Kerala state on Wednesday, a day after more than 167 people were killed in monsoon landslides.Nearly 1,600 people had been rescued from the hillside villages and tea and cardamom estates in Wayanad district, and 225 were still missing, authorities said on Wednesday. They said at least 167 people died and 195 were injured, while the local Asianet news TV channel put the death toll at 230.Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said his thoughts are with the bereaved families."Deeply saddened to hear about the tragic landslides in #Wayanad, #Kerala. Our thoughts and hearts are with the people there and bereaved families," he wrote on X.Heavy rain in Kerala, one of India's most attractive tourist destinations, led to the landslides early on Tuesday, sending torrents of mud, water and tumbling boulders downhill and burying or sweeping people away to their deaths as they slept.Experts said the area had been receiving heavy rain in the past two weeks that had softened the soil and that extremely heavy rainfall on Monday triggered the landslides.The Indian Army said it rescued 1,600 people and has begun the process of constructing an alternative bridge after the main bridge linking the worst affected area of Mundakkai to the nearest town of Chooralmala was destroyed.Near the site where the bridge was washed away, a land excavator was slowly removing trees and boulders from a mound of debris."We are quite sure there are multiple bodies here," said Hamsa T. A., a fire and rescue worker, pointing to the debris. "There were many houses here, people living inside have been missing."Aparajit Chakraborty in New Delhi contributed to this story.Agencies via XinhuaBeijing has slammed Tokyo for the negative comments it made during its recent meetings with Washington, urging it to maintain the political foundation of China-Japan relations.Liu Jinsong, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's department of Asian affairs, summoned Akira Yokochi, chief minister of the Japanese embassy in China, on Tuesday, shortly after Japan and the United States held a series of meetings in Tokyo.Japan and the US held the"2+2"meeting and a ministerial meeting on "extended deterrence" on Sunday. On Monday, the two countries participated in the foreign ministers' meeting of the Quad, a grouping that also includes Australia and India.In addition, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry expressed strong opposition on Tuesday to interference from Japan and the US in China's internal affairs as well as their smearing of China.Liu, the director-general, expressed China's grave concerns and strong disapproval over the negative words and deeds against it by the Japanese side during the meetings, as well as the many fallacies, dangerous moves and false narratives in the meetings' documents, according to a statement issued by the ministry.The Japanese side's smearing and attacks on China are contradictory to its statements on promoting a strategic relationship of mutual benefit between the two countries, Liu said, calling on Tokyo to meet Beijing halfway and truly work toward such a relationship.Liu urged Japan to adopt an objective and rational perception of China, stop making unwarranted comments on China's internal affairs, and cease forming "small cliques" with certain countries to create confrontation.Yokochi said that Japan's position on handling the Taiwan question in accordance with the 1972 Japan-China joint communique remains unchanged.Japan is willing to advance the strategic relationship of mutual benefit between the two countries, he added.In another development, the Foreign Ministry announced on Wednesday China's countermeasures against US Representative Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, for his frequent words and deeds in recent years that have interfered in China's internal affairs and undermined its sovereignty, security and development interests.The countermeasures, including prohibiting all organizations and individuals within China from engaging in transactions, cooperation or other activities with McGovern and denying the lawmaker and his family entry into China, took effect on Wednesday.The countermeasures are pursuant to articles of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Countering Foreign Sanctions, the ministry said in a statement released on its website.Mo Jingxi contributed to this story.China's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, expressed condolences over the devastating landslides in the Indian state of Kerala that have claimed 159 lives so far, saying his thoughts were with the families of the victims.Sharing a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Chinese envoy wrote, "Deeply saddened to hear about the tragic landslides in #Wayanad, #Kerala. Our thoughts and hearts are with the people there and bereaved families."At least 159 people have been killed and over 200 injured after massive landslides struck the hilly areas near Meppadi in Wayanad district in South India's Kerala state. As around 200 people are still missing, the death toll may rise further, Kerala chief minister's spokesperson, PM Manoj, told this correspondent.According to government data, more than 180 people are feared trapped under debris.The search and rescue operations, which were suspended on late Tuesday night after 20 hours of operations, resumed on Wednesday morning. Wayanad district authorities started collecting data on Wednesday to determine the number of people missing following the tragedy. As many as 45 relief camps have been established in the district, accommodating 3,069 people.The Indian Army said it rescued 1,000 people and has begun the process of constructing an alternate bridge after the main bridge connecting the worst-hit Mundakkai area with the nearest town of Chooralmala was washed away.The landslides struck while people were asleep, causing widespread devastation. Many homes have been flattened, rivers are swollen, and many trees have been uprooted.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday he was "distressed by the landslides" and announced a compensation of $2,388 to the victims' families and assured Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a phone call of extending all possible assistance from the federal government.Vijayan has decided to intensify the ongoing search and rescue mission in the landslide-ravaged Wayanad district by deploying more personnel and equipment, the spokesperson said, adding that Vijayan will visit the landslide-ravaged area to take stock of the situation. Rescue teams from the Indian Army, Navy, and the National Disaster Response Force, state disaster team and local district administration are working on war footing to save the lives amid adverse weather conditions, spokesperson Manoj said. The first landslide occurred at 2 am on Tuesday (04:30 am Beijing Time on Monday), followed by another two hours later. Television footage showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach those who had been stranded. Vehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river.At least 572 mm of rain fell in the two days leading up to the landslide, Vijayan said in a statement released by his office.Several areas, including Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala, were isolated, and roads were washed away causing immense damage to homes, added Vijayan."Efforts to locate missing persons continue with all available resources," the statement said, adding that more than 3,000 people have been moved to relief camps and the government is ensuring the delivery of food and essential items there.The national flag will be flown at half-mast as the Kerala government has declared an official state mourning. All public functions and celebratory programss scheduled by the government, have been postponed."This is a colossal tragedy. Whatever is possible to be done is being done by the agencies... the state agencies, defense forces, Army, Navy, Air Force, all agencies are involved. Our heart goes out to the people," Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said."So many bodies have been found and a lot of people are missing. We need to put maximum strength from the federal government's side, state government's side and all other state governments who can help, then only the situation can be addressed. The nation is weeping," senior Indian National Congress leader KC Venugopal said, adding India needs to find out long-term and short-term strategies to stop these types of calamities in future. India Meteorological Department or IMD has predicted "heavy to very heavy rainfall" at isolated places; the "heavy to very heavy rainfall' warning is in place for Aug 1 as well, while on the following day, Kerala is likely to witness "heavy" showers."Strong surface winds with speeds reaching 30-40 gusting to 50 km/h are likely to prevail occasionally over Kerala on July 31," the IMD said in a statement today. All educational institutions will remain closed on Wednesday and holiday has been declared in 11 districts of the state, as a result of the disaster.The IMD has issued a red alert for the Wayanad district and an orange alert was issued for four nearby districts of Wayanad. A red alert indicates heavy-to-extremely heavy rain of over 20 cm in 24 hours. An orange alert means very heavy rain of 11 cm to 20 cm.The Army has started constructing a Bailey bridge to connect Mundakkai and Chooralmala. The rescue team will be able to transport ambulances, food, and water to Mundakkai, the worst hit area, once the bridge is completed.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.  The Singapore and the US' landmark deal on civil nuclear cooperation is expected to support not only the climate goals of the city-state but also the Southeast Asian region as well, analysts said.Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken signed the 123 Agreement on Wednesday. The 30-year pact, which is likely to be enforced by end-2024 following a review by the US Congress, was signed during Blinken's official visit to Singapore as part of his six-country tour of Asia.The 123 Agreement refers to section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act that requires the signing of a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement for significant transfers of US nuclear material or equipment to its partner countries.US and Singapore officials said in a joint statement that signing the agreement and joining capacity-building initiatives such as the Foundational Infrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology will lead to a better understanding of how advanced nuclear energy technologies, including small modular reactors, can potentially support climate goals, while balancing critical energy needs.The US has signed such agreement with 48 countries. Apart from Singapore, other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam have signed 123 Agreement.David Broadstock, a senior research fellow and energy transition research lead with the Sustainable and Green Finance Institute at the National University of Singapore, said by being the latest ASEAN country to sign the 123 Agreement, Singapore could have a "transparent discussion" on regional power sector development with other signatories in ASEAN.Broadstock said there has been a lot of discussion in recent years to build regional grid for clean energy. But he said this can only be done if ASEAN countries can discuss the technology and infrastructure that need to be installed to help clean electricity flow around."Signing the agreement is consistent with (Singapore) keeping the domestic pathways open, but it's also consistent with being able to increase regional dialogue on regional power solutions," Broadstock said.Singapore is exploring renewable energy resources to meet its net zero emissions goal by 2050. A report commissioned by Singapore's Energy Market Authority in 2022 revealed that geothermal energy or nuclear energy can supply about 10 percent of the city-state's energy needs by 2050.Singapore officials said they have not made any decision on the deployment of nuclear energy in the country. The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a fact sheet issued after the signing that it will conduct detailed studies of the safety, reliability, affordability, and environmental sustainability of nuclear energy before making such a decision.Rohan Gunaratna, professor of security studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said the city-state has "very rightly taken a cautious approach" before embarking on nuclear technology.Gunaratna said Singapore is aware that designs of advanced nuclear reactors are still undergoing research and development and have not begun commercial operation."Singapore has a firm commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. To prevent the spread of nuclear missile and fissile technologies is essential to international peace and security," he said.Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Balakrishnan said at the signing ceremony that current conventional nuclear technologies are not suitable for the city-state, according to local media reports."But given advances in civil nuclear technology, we need to stay abreast of breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field," Balakrishnan said.The US-Singapore joint statement said the 123 agreement builds on the long-standing civil nuclear collaboration between the two countries. For instance, since 2017, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Singapore's National Environment Agency have had arrangements to collaborate on nuclear safety matters.YANGON -- Myanmar's National Defense and Security Council (NDSC) on Wednesday extended the state of emergency in the country for six more months, the state-run Myanmar Radio and Television (MRTV) reported.TOKYO -- Japan's central bank on Wednesday decided to raise its short-term interest rates to 0.25 percent from the range of zero and 0.1 percent, local media reported.The second policy rate hike this year, which was announced after a two-day monetary policy meeting, marked the first "additional rate hike" since February 2007, national broadcaster NHK reported.The Bank of Japan also decided to halve its monthly government bond purchases to 3 trillion yen (about 20 billion US dollars) from around 6 trillion yen by March 2026, signaling steps toward normalizing its monetary policy.The US government has pledged an additional $500 million in foreign military financing to the Philippines, a move that experts say aims to "provoke" China amid tensions in the South China Sea.The commitment came during the Fourth Philippines-United States 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue held in Manila on Tuesday. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr and Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo. This marked the first 2+2 meeting held in the Philippines as previous meetings were held in Washington.Following the dialogue, Blinken said the "once-in-a-generation investment" will help modernize the Philippine Armed Forces and Coast Guard and raise US investments in the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement. The US' long-standing alliance with the Philippines is a "defensive" one, Blinken said.Teodoro said the funding will boost the Philippines' abilities to "defend itself and to deter unlawful aggression", while also aiding humanitarian assistance and disaster response.Bilveer Singh, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said that while the meeting represents a peak in bilateral relations, the US has taken advantage of the Philippines' sense of vulnerability, especially concerning tensions in the South China Sea and its relations within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.Preferring diplomacy"ASEAN is not very keen to confront China" and prefers to be more diplomatic and cautious, he said, characterizing the additional military funding as "provocative".Jaime Naval, an assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines, described the 2+2 meeting as a "natural progression" for the two long-standing treaty allies. They signed the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1951, years before the South China Sea tensions arose, Naval said.The Philippines is the only former US colony in Asia and the 1951 treaty is a continuation of a colonial-era relationship, he said. "But then, that's an agreement that countries bilaterally involved would have to tap to their own advantage."During Blinken and Austin's visit, Philippine fishers and environmental groups voiced opposition to the US-led "proxy war" and expressed concerns over expanded military access to their country.Veronica Cabe, coordinator of the Nuclear and Coal-Free Bataan Movement, highlighted the broader implications of militarization on national security and environmental sustainability, and the importance of resisting involvement in a "proxy conflict".Austin said US President Joe Biden's budget request this year includes more than $128 million to fund important infrastructure projects of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement.US government investment in EDCA locations extends beyond the Department of Defense, he said. For example, the US Agency for International Development plans to pre-position disaster relief supplies at an EDCA location later this year. "That will allow the department to work alongside our Philippine allies to rapidly provide humanitarian assistance in times of need," he said.UNITED NATIONS -- A Chinese envoy on Wednesday urged the Afghan interim government to address the legitimate concerns of the international community and take steps to effectively protect the basic rights of women and girls.Amid the mess left by the hasty withdrawal of foreign troops, the Afghan authorities have worked hard to stabilize the security situation, improve the economy and people's livelihoods, and strengthen regional and international dialogue and cooperation, said Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the UN, at the Security Council briefing on the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan."This momentum is not easy to come by," said the ambassador, noting that Afghanistan continues to face multiple challenges.Underscoring that Afghanistan's recent vice and virtue law has raised international concerns, Fu said "We must realize that women's rights and interests cannot be realized in a vacuum and that microphone diplomacy will not help solve the problem," urging the international community to take a comprehensive and objective view of the situation in Afghanistan.He said the international community should support Afghan peaceful reconstruction and economic recovery, help it eliminate the root causes of instability and underdevelopment, and create conditions conducive to safeguarding the rights and interests of all its people, including women.He called for maintaining the interactions with the Afghan authorities, and scaling up efforts to help Afghanistan overcome its difficulties. "Overseas assets of Afghanistan are Afghan people's life-saving money," Fu stressed, noting that the United States should "unconditionally unfreeze and return them all to the Afghan authorities."The ambassador also called for supporting the Afghan interim government in its fight against terrorism, urging it to take vigorous actions to resolutely combat the various terrorist forces in its territory and to prevent Afghanistan from becoming an enclave for terrorist organizations again.He added that the international community should support Afghanistan in launching alternative cultivation and drug rehabilitation programs and in combating narcotics smuggling to further consolidate achievements in the fight against narcotics.Fu said that China, as a friendly neighbor of Afghanistan, "is ready to work with regional countries and the international community to continue to provide assistance to the Afghan people to the best of its ability and to promote lasting peace, security, development, and prosperity of Afghanistan."An awards ceremony recognizing the top 50 Asian Americans in business took place in New York on Wednesday, advocating Asian American economic and business contributions and a celebration of business excellence.Outstanding 50 Asian Americans in Business award, founded by the Asian American Business Development Center (AABDC), now in its 23rd year, recognizes the achievements of Asian American corporate professionals and entrepreneurs across a wide range of industries.The individuals who received the 2024 award represent a broad spectrum of industries, including finance, technology, healthcare, marketing, and corporate leadership.Among the recipients of the Pinnacle Award are John T.C. Lee, President and CEO of MKS Instruments, Inc., a company that provides technologies and products for measuring, controlling, powering, and analyzing processes in advanced manufacturing. Another recipient is Karthik Narain, Group Chief Executive of Technology and Chief Technology Officer at Accenture, a global IT services company.The Pinnacle Award has previously been awarded to top leaders, including Raj Subramaniam, CEO of FedEx Corporation, who received the honor in 2023.The event hosted over 600 guests, including business, political, and civic leaders from the Asian American business community across the United States.AABDC is also celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. The organization has recognized more than 1,200 Asian American corporate executives and entrepreneurs.“Every year, we look forward to this prestigious event with great excitement as it exemplifies the key role that AABDC plays in society and to the AAPI community – as a champion and advocate of Asian American economic and business contributions and as a celebration of business excellence,” said John Wang, president and founder of AABDC.minluzhang@chinadailyusa.comUNITED NATIONS -- UN General Assembly on Wednesday adopted a non-binding resolution demanding that Israel leave occupied Palestinian territory within one year.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on Tuesday called on world leaders to increase global spending on addressing childhood malnutrition, an issue escalated by climate change.They made the appeal in its eighth annual Goalkeepers report published on Tuesday. Each year, the foundation releases a report to track progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.According to this year's report, climate change is projected to condemn an additional 40 million children to stunting and 28 million more to wasting from this year to 2050 for lack of immediate global action.In 2023, the World Health Organization estimated that 148 million experienced stunting and 45 million experienced wasting — the two most severe forms of chronic and acute malnutrition.Scaling up solutions now can avoid this outcome while also building resilience to climate change and spurring much-needed economic growth, said the report.The report added that the total share of foreign aid aimed at Africa has decreased in the past two decades despite intensifying challenges."This trend leaves hundreds of millions of children at serious risk of dying or suffering from preventable diseases and threatens the unprecedented progress the world made in global health across Africa between 2000 and 2020," it said.Bill Gates, report author and co-chair of the foundation, said in the report that malnutrition is "the world's worst child health crisis," and climate change is only making it worse.He called for maintaining global health funding, immediately addressing the growing threat of child malnutrition by supporting the Child Nutrition Fund, a new platform that coordinates donor financing for nutrition, as well as governments fully funding the established institutions that have proved effective at protecting millions of lives each year."If we do these three things, we won't just usher in a new global health boom and save millions of lives—we'll also prove that humanity can still rise to meet our greatest challenges," he said.Although TikTok faces a potential ban in the United States, that prospect hasn't stopped an increasing number of Americans from turning to the platform for news.About 4 in 10 young adults in the US now regularly get news on TikTok, according to a Pew Research Center analysis published on Tuesday.In four years, the share of adults who say they regularly get news from the short-form video-sharing platform has grown about fivefold, from 3 percent in 2020 to 17 percent in 2024, Pew found.Since 2020, "no social media platform we've studied has seen faster growth in the share of Americans who regularly turn to it for news", said the press release by Pew.The Pew Research Center, based in Washington DC, is "a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world", according to its website.TikTok is popular among teenagers — 63 percent of whom report using the platform — and young adults.Earlier this year, Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation, signed in April by US President Joe Biden, to force a TikTok sale or ownership divestiture by January.TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance Ltd, based in Beijing.Washington politicians have argued that TikTok shares user data with the Chinese government.TikTok has repeatedly denied the accusation and has maintained that it stores user data on servers based in the US.Today, 39 percent of adults under 30 say they regularly get news on TikTok, compared with shares of adults ages 30 to 49 (19 percent), 50 to 64 (9 percent) and 65 and older (3 percent), according to the survey conducted from July 15 to Aug 4 of more than 10,650 US adults.Around half of TikTok users (52 percent) now say they regularly get news there, up from 43 percent last year and 22 percent in 2020.TikTok users are now more likely to get news from TikTok than Facebook users are to get news from Facebook. TikTok users are less likely than users of X (formerly Twitter) to get news on the site, the survey found.Pew published another survey earlier this month that found support for a TikTok ban in the US was declining.The share of Americans who support the US government banning TikTok stood at 32 percent in that survey, down from 38 percent in the fall of 2023 and 50 percent in March 2023.Meanwhile, 28 percent of Americans oppose a ban, up from 22 percent in March 2023. The share who say they are uncertain whether the government should ban TikTok also has risen, from 28 percent in March 2023 to 39 percent now.On Monday, a lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance looked to convince a federal appeals court to block the law — which would ban the app used by 170 million Americans as soon as Jan 19 — arguing that it violates free speech rights.A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia heard two hours of arguments in the lawsuit, which was filed by TikTok and ByteDance in May, seeking an injunction, Reuters reported.US Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny contended that TikTok poses a national security threat because of its access to personal data, asserting that China can covertly manipulate information that Americans consume.Andrew Pincus, the lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance, told the judges that the US government had not demonstrated that TikTok poses national security risks. Pincus also argued that the law violates the US Constitution on numerous grounds, including running afoul of First Amendment protections against government abridgment of speech."The law before this court is unprecedented, and its effect would be staggering," Pincus said, adding that "for the first time in history, Congress has expressly targeted a specific US speaker banning its speech and the speech of 170 million Americans".The law gives ByteDance until Jan 19 to sell or divest TikTok's US assets.TikTok and ByteDance have argued that if the statute is upheld, it would show that Congress can circumvent the First Amendment "by invoking national security and ordering the publisher of any individual newspaper or website to sell to avoid being shut down".The law also prohibits app stores like Apple and Google from offering TikTok and bars internet hosting services from supporting it unless ByteDance divests TikTok by the deadline. The president could extend the deadline by three months if he certifies ByteDance is making significant progress toward a sale.TikTok and the Justice Department have asked for a ruling by Dec 6, which could allow the US Supreme Court to consider any appeal before a ban takes effect.During negotiations with the Biden administration more than two years ago, TikTok presented the government with a draft 90-page agreement that allows a third party to monitor the platform's algorithm, content moderation practices and other programming, The Associated Press reported. But it said a deal was not reached because government officials essentially walked away from the negotiating table in August 2022.The case is playing out less than two months before the Nov 5 US presidential election.Republican candidate Donald Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, are active on TikTok. The Trump administration previously sought a sale of TikTok but Trump now opposes a ban.Agencies contributed to this story.Mei Lanfang is a legendary figure in Peking Opera, and the University of Southern California is marking the 130th anniversary of his birth and whirlwind tour of the US with an exhibition.The exhibition, Reunion: Mei Lan-Fang and the United States, at USC's East Asian Library also commemorates the 94th anniversary of Mei's historic visit to America. It explores a romantic narrative of connection, legacy and reunion — honoring Mei's lasting influence and the cultural ties that continue to bridge nations.In early 1930, Mei embarked on a tour of the US, performing in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington DC, and New York.Few moments in history had brought the United States and China closer than the six months Mei spent captivating American audiences with his Peking Opera performances, according to media reports.Thousands filled theaters across the country to witness his art, and many more had the chance to meet him personally at receptions, banquets and public gatherings.The visit played a "groundbreaking" role in fostering cultural exchanges between China and the US, according to Li Shufeng, vice-president of the Chinese National Academy of Arts (CNAA), the co-organizer of the exhibition with USC."This art exhibition is an effort to follow the path paved by our predecessors," Li said during the opening ceremony of the exhibition on Sept 13 at USC East Asian Library. "It introduced American audiences to the beauty of Chinese opera and the richness of China's ancient cultural heritage, offering them a window into China's long history."Los Angeles was the most significant stop during Mei's US visit. It was in LA that he was welcomed by Hollywood and opera enthusiasts, receiving recognition from both the performing arts and academic communities. Notably, USC awarded Mei an honorary doctorate."In honor of this recognition that has spanned a century, we followed in the footsteps of President Mei Lanfang and brought his life and art back to this campus, which once held deep affection for him, continuing this beautiful and romantic story," Li said.The exhibition, which will run to Dec 20, has four sections — Children of Liyuan, Master of Danjiao, Envoy to the US, and Reunion Today — that feature oil paintings and traditional Chinese artworks centered on Mei.The exhibition also has a range of significant academic publications on Mei and the Mei school of art, along with historical artifacts such as vintage photos, playbills, and maps from Mei's 1930 visit to the US."Through these multifaceted exhibits, the exhibition brings to life Mei's personal journey, stagecraft and his historic tour of the US, offering audiences a deep and captivating glimpse into the aesthetics and spiritual essence of traditional Chinese opera, as embodied by Mei," Li explained.Melissa Just, dean of the USC Libraries, told the audience that the connection between Mei and USC makes the East Asian Library the perfect venue for this exhibition."Today with Mei's (exhibition) return to USC, this beautiful reunion allows us to step back in time and explore Mei's remarkable life. This is a true cross-cultural collaboration," Just said.The exhibition marks the beginning of cooperation between the CNAA and USC. The two sides have signed a memorandum of understanding for exchanges in the next five years. All the exhibits have been donated by the CNAA to USC.Mei and the traditional Chinese culture represented by Peking Opera also have been subjects of continuous research by scholars in the US. One notable scholar is Joshua Goldstein, a professor of history and East Asian languages and cultures at USC. Goldstein has spent decades researching the evolution and dissemination of Peking Opera. His book, Drama Kings: Players and Publics in the Re-creation of Peking Opera, 1870-1937, specifically mentions Mei's visit to the US, highlighting its significance in Peking Opera's development and international impact.Mei's historic visit to the US in the 1930s represents a significant moment in cultural exchange amid a turbulent time, Goldstein said. During his visit, Mei forged friendships with Western contemporaries, including silent film actor Charlie Chaplin."Mei was an innovative figure in Peking Opera," Goldstein noted. "He skillfully blended traditional elements with modern phenomena such as film and visual displays. His approach to character types was also innovative, moving beyond the strict limitations of previous eras."Mei has been hailed as a "creator of beauty". He inherited traditions while also pioneering innovation, organizing and producing many classic operas. Those performances continue to captivate audiences today.Two young talents from the LA Youth Peking Opera Troupe performed selections from Mei school's classics The Drunken Concubine and Mu Guiying Takes the Command, earning enthusiastic applause on Sept 13.Mei's family members, including his grandson Mei Weidong and great-grandson Mei Ruiqi, also attended the exhibition, reliving the legacy and dreams of their esteemed ancestor."As descendants of the Mei Lanfang family, we not only inherit the spirit and cultural traditions of our ancestors, but also have a responsibility to continue promoting cultural exchange and understanding," Weidong told China Daily.In fact, the Mei family has longstanding ties with USC beyond Mei Lanfang's honorary doctorate. Mei's great-grandson, Mei Ruiqi, graduated with a master's degree from USC's business school, while his great-granddaughter earned a degree from USC's medical school."This deep connection between the Mei family and USC has a rich history," Weidong said. "Moving forward, we are committed to continuing our efforts to foster cultural exchange between China and the US."American consumers could soon be stung with rising costs for buying imported goods, warn economists and retail trade organizations, after the Biden administration finalized tariff increases on certain products made in China."Lower-income US consumers will face the biggest consequences from the new tariff hikes," Thomas Fullerton, an American economist and economics professor at the University of Texas at El Paso, told China Daily."That is because they purchase more merchandise goods than services, and many of those goods are produced in China or contain components that are produced in China."The Biden administration first proposed the higher tariffs in May on more than $18 billion worth of products from China. The tariffs are scheduled to start on Sept 27.The tariffs will rise to 100 percent on electric vehicles (EVs), 50 percent on solar cells, and 25 percent on EV batteries, steel, lithium-ion batteries, aluminum and key minerals. Increased tariffs on semiconductor chips will take effect over the next two years, the Office of the US Trade Representative said. But the spike is likely to not only drive up costs for Chinese brands that ship to the US, but also for American companies and consumers who buy low-cost goods, say experts."A substantial portion, but not all, of the higher costs will be paid by US consumers," Fullerton said. "Chinese companies and US importers will also see reduced profit margins because not all the tariffs will be completely passed on in the form of higher prices."The National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), a trade association based in Washington, also has expressed concern about the impact that the tariffs will have on cash-strapped US households and importers."There is no question that tariffs raise costs for consumers, and adding new and expanded tariffs will harm working families and imperil America's national and economic security," NFTC Vice-President of Global Trade Policy Tiffany Smith told China Daily. "Tariffs are paid by US importers, not the Chinese government, and represent dollars that are no longer available for these companies to reinvest in innovation, employees, or expanding their businesses," she said. "The reality is that tariffs are blunt instruments that have not and will not resolve the complex economic challenges that exist between the United States and China."She said that an analysis by the Tax Foundation found that the new tariffs proposed by the Biden administration in May would create an additional tax burden of $3.6 billion on US businesses and consumers. The updated tariffs came after a four-year review aimed at "strengthening protections for strategic industries", the US trade representative said on Sept 13.In 2018, former president Donald Trump began the original tariffs that eventually covered more than $300 billion in imports from China, which later responded with its own tariffs. Biden not only kept Trump's tariffs in place but has increased the rate.Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, hasn't detailed her tariff policy. Trump, however, has been clear.He recently branded himself a "tariff president" and the US a "tariff nation" at a campaign rally in Wisconsin. Harris criticized his policy as a "sales tax" on American households and a "Trump tax". Trump said that it's "not going to be a cost to you. It's going to be a cost to another country." Numerous economists and retail organizations disagree. They have projected that if Trump enacts proposed tariffs of 10 to 20 percent on all goods and 60 percent on goods from China, it will ultimately hurt US consumers' wallets.In the study, "Why Trump's tariff proposals would harm working Americans", by the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely argue that the tariffs could end up hurting Americans families, farmers and exporters the most.The PIIE study said that "in contrast to Trump's frequent, and mistaken, claims that foreigners bear the impact of tariffs, economists have long understood that tariffs burden domestic purchasers of imported goods because imports are the difference between domestic demand and domestic supply a tariff affects both sides of the market".Lovely is professor emeritus of economics at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs of Syracuse University and a senior fellow of the Peterson Institute.She told China Daily: "We look at the effect of these proposals on American households as consumers of imported goods. The new taxes are economically significant — a household with median income is projected to pay $1,700 more each year in import taxes. "The new taxes are also regressive in the sense that they take a larger share of income from poorer households than richer households.''The Center for American Action Forum, a liberal think tank, estimated that tariffs proposed by Trump could amount to a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family."Model simulations conducted by S&P Global Intelligence, Moody's Analytics, and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania all confirm that tariffs are primarily paid by consumers within the United States," Fullerton said.UNITED NATIONS -- Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, on Tuesday urged Israel to heed the strong call of the international community by immediately ending its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory.In remarks at the UN General Assembly emergency special session on the Palestinian question, Fu said decades of occupation and oppression have inflicted untold sufferings on the Palestinian people, and made the long-cherished dream of independent statehood ever more elusive."Ending the occupation is not an option, but a legal obligation for Israel," he stressed.The International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its advisory opinion issued on July 19, unequivocally concluded that Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is a violation of international law, and that Israel is under an obligation to immediately bring to an end its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territories, the ambassador said, adding that the ICJ's advisory opinion affirms the long-standing consensus of the international community and pinpoints the crux of the Palestinian question."We urge Israel to heed the strong call of the international community by immediately ending its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory," he said.Fu noted that ending the occupation is to redress historical injustice and, more importantly, lay the foundation for peace.Underscoring that independent statehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people as a nation, the ambassador said the prolonged illegal occupation has hindered the realization of self-determination of the Palestinian people and given Israel an exclusive veto over Palestine. "This is unacceptable."Only a complete end to the occupation and the establishment of the Independent State of Palestine will truly make it possible for Palestine and Israel to live side by side in peace, for the two peoples to live together in peace and tranquility, and for lasting peace to be achieved in the Middle East, he said.Fu emphasized that the implementation of the two-State solution is the only viable way to resolve the question of Palestine, and is the broad consensus of the international community.He called on the international community to make greater efforts and demand that Israel implement the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, cease its military operations in Gaza, and stop its illegal settlement activities in the West Bank."China advocates the convening of a more broad-based and effective international peace conference to revitalize the political prospects of the two-State solution and to work out a timetable and a roadmap for its implementation," he said."Today is a historic moment," Fu said, noting that the State of Palestine has taken a seat among UN member states and introduced a draft resolution to the General Assembly that focuses on the implementation of the advisory opinion of the ICJ.He said China will vote in favor of the draft resolution, and hopes the resolution will give new impetus to ending the occupation, implementing the two-State solution, and advancing the Middle East peace process.In the diverse culinary landscape of the United States, there are nearly 100,000 Asian restaurants in the US, where Chinese cuisine is prominent.Yet, despite the popularity of Chinese food — which is featured on 39 percent of the menus at Asian restaurants — leaders in the Chinese catering industry are calling for a shift in focus.At a recent industry meeting, experts emphasized that while taste remains crucial, the future success of Chinese restaurants in America hinges on enhancing the overall dining experience.Amy Duan, founder of Chihuo and initiator of the Taste of Asia event, stressed that thriving in the competitive American market requires more than just flavor; it demands an investment in ambience, service and cultural storytelling."Food is the language that (means) you like people, so there's no politics, no barriers … everyone will enjoy the beauty of good food," Duan told China Daily at a recent North America Asian food industry conference and exhibition in Los Angeles.Hundreds of people in the catering industry attended the conference to discuss franchise models, marketing and brands, localization strategies and supply chains.As American consumers increasingly seek authentic, globally influenced culinary experiences, Chinese restaurant owners are encouraged to adapt and innovate, learning from the successful models of American chains like McDonald's and Burger King, to build a loyal and diverse customer base, Duan said.Chinese cuisine is renowned for its rich and diverse flavors, yet Westerners might not fully appreciate the intricate techniques and cultural significance behind its preparation.Many Chinese dishes in the US have been adapted to suit American tastes, often resulting in a sweeter, less-complex flavor profile. That has led to Americanized Chinese food becoming the primary representation of the cuisine."Most of the Chinese restaurants are feeling lonely. They don't know if it's the best way to do the business in America and how to promote the Asian food culture in America," Duan said.While discussing expanding a restaurant chain globally, the industry leaders emphasized the importance of understanding local markets, adapting to customer preferences and overcoming cultural barriers.Zhao Yong, president of the Asian American Hospitality Alliance, highlighted the challenges facing Chinese cuisine in the US, describing the industry as being in a "red ocean" state — saturated with competition but lacking in cohesive strategy.He said there are three main problems: low prices leading to a decline in quality, a lack of standardization, and the use of cheap labor, which hinders the industry's growth and potential for public recognition."For example, if there is a small restaurant in a small US town with a population of 20,000, soon there will be 10 Chinese restaurants in that town, more than McDonald's, but everyone is undercutting prices, and prices can't go any lower. This has been the traditional expansion method for Chinese restaurants in the US —competing against each other," Zhao said.To address those issues, Zhao suggested creating national Chinese food festivals, such as Hot Pot Day or Soup Dumpling Day, to promote culinary brands and encourage investment in the Chinese food supply chain.Such efforts would raise the profile of Chinese cuisine, he said.However, some experts expressed doubts about introducing too much of the original culture into the US market.Cervantes Lee, professor of hospitality business at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said that while authenticity is important, it's crucial to respect local customs and culture."The business should be managed by a team familiar with the local market, and the food's flavor must be adapted to suit local tastes," Lee said."It's important not to assume that Americans will immediately appreciate our authentic dishes," Duan said.For Asian restaurants in the US, the focus is often on delivering the best flavors and tastes. However, American customers seek more than just good food; they are drawn to the overall atmosphere — whether classic, upscale or casual — and the story behind the restaurant.Service is also crucial, as dining out is about enjoying a complete experience, a point emphasized at the gathering."Unfortunately, many Asian or Chinese restaurateurs tend to overlook the importance of environment, vibe and service, concentrating solely on taste, which isn't enough to satisfy American diners," Duan said.Still, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Thai restaurants are increasingly being included on Michelin's list in recent years. They become popular in the US partly due to adapting their offerings to local palates."This approach contrasts with simply copying menus from their home countries and trying to sell them directly to non-native audiences," Duan added.If the greatest challenge for a Chinese restaurant is to preserve the traditional flavors and cultural heritage of Chinese cuisine while adapting to local American tastes and building a loyal customer base, then Lao Sze Chuan in Chicago has achieved both.Former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel is a loyal customer, often bringing his wife and son to dine there. Emanuel's favorite dish is the dry chili chicken, recognized by the Chicago Tribune as a landmark dish of the city.His wife favors the sweet lemon crispy shrimp, a contrast to her husband's spicy preference, while their son enjoys the dry-fried string beans with tofu. Meanwhile, at the Lao Sze Chuan branch in Washington DC, former Cabinet secretary Elaine Chao could be savoring the Peking duck at the same time.Founded in Chicago in 1998 by Tony Hu, also known as Chef Tony, the upscale Chinese restaurant has become more than just another pepper steak spot."We develop the menu into four sections to cater to different tastes and preferences," Hu told China Daily.He said the menus are divided into four sections: traditional hometown dishes for older Chinese immigrants; popular spicy hot pot dishes for young people and international students; American Chinese cuisine like sesame chicken, with a unique twist; and innovative creations such as lemon crispy shrimp."Eighty percent of our customers are local Americans; many of them discover flavors and enjoy for a lifetime," Hu said.Lao Sze Chuan has 16 branches across the US, with eight more in planning stages, turning into destination dining experiences in cities such as Chicago, Washington and Houston, and in the states of Minnesota, Connecticut and Ohio."We offer over 20 brand-specific dishes and are continuously developing more," Chef Tony added. "We welcome local partners to join us."Lao Sze Chuan has received numerous accolades over the years. It was named the No 1 Chinese restaurant and the top takeout restaurant by The Daily Meal. The restaurant also has been featured as one of the best Chinese restaurants by Thrillist and Time Out magazine and has earned the Michelin Bib Gourmand Award seven times in a row.By sharing the stories behind Chinese cuisine with local communities and universities, the chef and his restaurant have attracted significant mainstream media attention."Chinese restaurants need to learn to speak up — it's not enough to just do things well," said Duan. "Chinese cuisine has so many good ingredients and stories to tell, and we are telling the story of the entire Asian community, not just about food." A man suspected in an apparent attempt to assassinate former US president Donald Trump at his Florida golf course hid out for nearly 12 hours beforehand, according to a court complaint.The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was charged with two federal gun crimes on Monday.The incident Sunday afternoon raised questions about how an armed person was able to get so close to Trump, the Republican presidential candidate in the Nov 5 election, two months after a gunman fired at Trump during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, cutting his ear with a bullet.Trump's visit to his golf course in West Palm Beach was not on his public schedule, US Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe said Monday.A Secret Service agent who was "walking the perimeter" of the course, according to the criminal complaint, opened fire after seeing a rifle barrel poking out of bushes a few hundred yards away from Trump, who was on the fifth hole fairway.The gunman fled in a Nissan sport utility vehicle "at a high rate of speed", according to the complaint filed in US District Court in West Palm Beach. Officers found a loaded SKS assault-style rifle with a scope, a digital camera and a plastic bag of food.Records show a phone associated with Routh was located at the golf course starting at 1:59 am on Sunday EDT, according to the complaint. Federal agents had requested Routh's location data from his wireless provider.The suspect was on the public side of a fence along the course's boundary, Rowe said.Routh was arrested about 40 minutes after the incident, driving north on Interstate 95. The license plate on his vehicle had been reported stolen from a Ford truck. Bodycam footage of Routh's arrest was released by the Martin County Sheriff's Office."There have been previous individuals who have taken pictures of the former president while he's golfing," Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for the district that covers Palm Beach County, told Fox News. "They've gone through the shrubs and been able to poke a camera through the fencing. You would think that perhaps maybe they would consider someone scoping the perimeter."A 2019 tip to the FBI alleged that Routh was a convicted felon who illegally possessed a firearm, Jeffrey Veltri, the agent in charge of the FBI's Miami field office, told reporters.In court on Monday, Routh was charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. He is expected back in court for a bond hearing on Sept 23 and an arraignment on Sept 30.In 2002, Routh pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered fully automatic gun, which in North Carolina is defined as a weapon of mass destruction, according to the county district attorney's office. He was sentenced to probation.Routh is a staunch supporter of Ukraine and has traveled there, seeking to recruit foreign fighters in the country's military conflict with Russia.Social media accounts linked to Routh's name showed posts on  Ukraine as well as claims that Trump is a threat to American democracy.On April 21, Routh directed a post on X to Elon Musk, owner of X and founder of SpaceX: "I would like to buy a rocket from you. I wish to load it with a warhead for Putins Black sea mansion bunker to end him. Can you give me a price please."In another X post, Routh wrote to US President Joe Biden: "@POTUS Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA ...make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose."Public access to the Facebook and X profiles has been removed.Trump has questioned the amount of aid the United States has provided to Ukraine and has vowed to end the war immediately if elected.Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has promised continued support for Ukraine.Trump claimed that Routh was acting on Democrats' "highly inflammatory language"."Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out," he said, according to Fox.Biden and Trump had a "cordial conversation" on Monday, White House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons posted on X.The Secret Service has been under scrutiny since the July shooting. The agency needs more help, including possibly more personnel, Biden told reporters on Monday, adding: "Thank God the president's OK."Agencies contributed to this story.Wildfires in Bolivia are on track to set a record for the number of blazes this year, fueled by the destructive agricultural practice of land clearing through burning, and compounded by irregular rainfall patterns.So far, the fires have destroyed more than 3 million hectares of rainforest, surpassing the devastation witnessed during the record-breaking fire season of 2010. They are not only decimating vast areas of rainforest but also shrouding cities such as Cochabamba and Santa Cruz in thick smoke, darkening the skies and raising concerns about respiratory health.The fight against the fires is putting a strain on Bolivia's limited resources, including a shortage of both firefighters and equipment.Ludy Rudon, a firefighter working along a 100-kilometer fire line in the central region, emphasized the need for more manpower to control and extinguish the major blazes."The workdays are tough considering the length of the fire line, the heat, the wind and especially the type of fuel, which is very dense and tall," Rudon said. "The rain helped very little because the density of the trees prevented the rain from reaching the ground — it was almost superficial."South America is currently at the peak of its fire season, but Bolivia has experienced an earlier outbreak because of drought. The country's Defense Minister Edmundo Novillo announced emergency measures on Sept 7 to secure international support, adding to the 2,500 firefighters and 20 aircraft already deployed.Wildfires across Latin America have grown increasingly severe in recent years."Farmers tend to clear and burn the vegetation to enrich the soil with nutrients," said Erick Sossa Sanchez, an engineer and departmental director for Cochabamba at the National Meteorology and Hydrology Service. "Then, they plant ... and harvest. Due to changes in the agricultural frontier, this (practice) has been increasing."Addressing this practice, known as chaqueo, may require legislative changes. Chaqueo involves burning vegetation before the rainy season to clear land for planting, with the ash enriching the soil. However, these fires frequently get out of control, causing massive destruction."Despite regulations prohibiting burning, many people ignored the warnings," said Oswaldo Maillard, head of the Chiquitano Dry Forest Observatory. Wildfires have ravaged the Chiquitano forest in eastern Bolivia, destroying thousands of hectares.John Zambrana Nogales, an agricultural engineer, said about 40 percent of forest fires occur on farmland, about one-fourth on public land or protected areas and 15 percent on indigenous lands.Sanchez said the Bolivian Parliament should repeal lenient regulations on chaqueo to help curb the issue.US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was the target of "what appears to be an attempted assassination" on Sunday afternoon at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, the FBI said — just two months after he survived a previous attempt on his life.Both incidents highlight the challenges of keeping presidential candidates safe in a hotly contested and polarized campaign with just more than seven weeks to go before the Nov 5 election.Trump sent an email to supporters soon after the incident saying he was "safe and well".Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Secret Service agents fired at the suspect, who was pointing an AK-47-style rifle with a scope as Trump was on the golf course.Bradshaw said the gunman also had two backpacks and a GoPro camera and was about 365 to 460 meters away, hiding in shrubbery — with the muzzle of the weapon visible — while Trump played on a nearby hole. The suspect dropped the weapon and fled in an SUV.The golf course was partially closed for Trump as he played, and agents were a few holes ahead of him when they noticed a man with the firearm, Bradshaw said.CNN, Fox News and The New York Times identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, from Hawaii, citing unidentified law enforcement officials. The FBI declined to comment.It was not clear if or how the suspect knew Trump was playing golf at the time, or what his motive was, but the attempted attack is sure to raise new questions about the level of protection he is given.CNN and CBS reported Routh was a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii who had an arrest record spanning decades and regularly posted on politics and current events, including sometimes criticizing Trump.Apprehending suspectIn neighboring Martin County, Sheriff William Snyder said the suspect was apprehended within minutes of the FBI, Secret Service and Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office putting out an urgent alert.Snyder told WPTV that the suspect "was not armed when we took him out of the car". The man had a calm, flat demeanor and showed little emotion when he was stopped by police, Snyder said, adding he did not question why he was being pulled over."He never asked, 'What is this about?' Obviously, law enforcement with long rifles, blue lights, a lot going on. He never questioned it," Snyder said.Fox News host Sean Hannity said on the air that he spoke with Trump and the former president's golf partner, Steve Witkoff, after the incident.They told Hannity they had been on the fifth hole and about to go to putt when they heard "pop pop, pop pop". Within seconds, Secret Service agents "pounced on" Trump and "covered him", Witkoff said.Trump returned to Florida on the weekend after a West Coast campaign trip. His Sunday schedule had not been made public by the campaign. Trump often spends the morning golfing before having lunch at the club.He has had increased security since the assassination attempt in July in Butler, Pennsylvania. When he has stayed at Trump Tower in New York, a line of dump trucks have been parked outside the building. At outdoor rallies now, he speaks behind bulletproof glass.The White House said President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, were briefed and would be kept updated on the investigation. It said the president was "relieved" that Trump is safe.In a statement, Harris said she was "glad" Trump was safe, adding, "Violence has no place in America."The leaders of the bipartisan task force in Congress, which has been investigating the earlier assassination attempt, said on Sunday it is monitoring the situation and has requested a briefing by the Secret Service.During the July 13 rally in Pennsylvania, Trump was fired upon, with a bullet grazing his ear. A rallygoer was killed.The shooting forced Kimberly Cheatle to resign as Secret Service director under bipartisan pressure from Congress.The gunman, identified as Thomas Crooks, 20, was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper.Agencies contributed to this story. NEW YORK --The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) "is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination" of former US President and current Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, the agency said on Sunday, just two months after an attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally.Trump was safe after shots were fired at Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. A Secret Service agent, who was ahead of the former president, spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence and "engaged" with the suspect. Trump was moving between holes five and six at his golf course with donor Steve Witkoff when gunshots went off. The course was immediately locked down.Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder said at a press conference later in the day that his agency "flooded" Interstate 95 and closed a large swath of the highway before eventually safely stopping the suspect's vehicle and detaining him.The suspect was not armed when law enforcement officials took him out of the car. He has not made any statement so far.After the incident, Trump said in a fundraising email that he is "safe and well," adding that "my resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life! ... I will never slow down. I will never give up. I WILL NEVER SURRENDER!"Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, said that he spoke with Trump after the security incident. "I'm glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits," Vance wrote on X.President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were both "relieved to know" that Trump was safe and had been briefed on the security incident.In her statement posted on X Sunday, Harris said, "I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America."Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that he had been briefed by acting Secret Service Director Ronald L. Rowe Jr over the incident."I applaud the Secret Service for their quick response to ensure former President Trump's safety," Schumer said. "There is no place in this country for political violence of any kind. The perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."Meanwhile, the leaders of the bipartisan task force in the US Congress that has been investigating the earlier assassination attempt on Trump said they are monitoring the situation and have requested a briefing from the Secret Service.Golf courses, and in particular Trump's properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds while he plays, CNN quoted people familiar with the matter as saying."A golf course is often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design -- often abutting public roads and containing elements like trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins -- make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure," the report said.The incident raises new questions about how to keep Trump safe -- not only while he is campaigning across the country, but while he spends time at his own clubs and properties, said the AP news agency."Unlike typical VIPs, who live in private residences with tall fences, Trump, while in Florida, resides in a club open to dues-paying members, and often spends his downtime at his golf courses," it said.Not too long ago, Trump was the target of an assassination attempt during a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a staccato of shots rang out in the middle of his speech, killing one attendee and severely injuring two others. According to the FBI, either a bullet or a bullet fragment struck Trump, wounding him in the ear. LOS ANGELES -- The crew of the US Polaris Dawn mission returned to Earth early Sunday, completing the commercial human spaceflight mission.SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft carrying four civilian astronauts splashed down off the coast of Dry Tortugas, Florida at 3:36 am Eastern Time Sunday (0736 GMT), according to SpaceX.The four-member crew consists of mission commander Jared Isaacman, pilot Kidd Poteet, and specialists Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon.The crew lifted off aboard the Dragon spacecraft on Tuesday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. During their five-day space journey, they traveled as high as 1,400 km above Earth, the highest humans have traveled since the Apollo program over 50 years ago, according to SpaceX.Two astronauts of the four-member crew, wearing SpaceX's newly-designed extravehicular activity suits, completed a spacewalk on Thursday, marking the first time astronauts have space-walked from a commercial spacecraft.The crew conducted scientific experiments during their multi-day mission, including essential health and human performance research for NASA's Human Research Program.

He also called on the international community to pave the way to this end by providing tangible assistance and facilitation, and urged all parties concerned to put peace and humanity first and re-channel their resources and energy to ending hostilities through diplomacy.In response to remarks by the US representative that "spread a false narrative in his earlier statement, distorting and vilifying China's position on the Ukraine issue once again," Geng emphasized that "China did not create the Ukraine crisis, much less are we a party to the conflict.""China has not supplied weapons to either party, and we have consistent and rigorous controls over dual-use items. We maintain normal trade and economic cooperation with all countries around the world, including Russia and Ukraine," he added.Underscoring that China's position on the Ukraine issue "is objective and impartial," the ambassador said that for over two years, China has been working hard to promote peace and encourage and facilitate peace talks.He elaborated the efforts made by China and other countries on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, including the six-point consensus jointly issued by China and Brazil in May this year. "This fully demonstrates that diplomatic negotiations and a political settlement meet the common expectations of the majority of countries and represent the will of the international community.""We hope that the United States will not continue to turn a deaf ear to these calls for peace, that it will desist from discrediting and obstructing the diplomatic efforts of China and other countries concerned, undermining international solidarity, creating division and antagonism, and provoking bloc confrontations, and that it will truly play a constructive role in bringing an early end to the war and achieving peace," Geng said.Finding the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other is what both nations and the international community need the most, a top Chinese envoy said on Thursday.Chinese Ambassador to the US Xie Feng, speaking at the Vision China forum at the Asia Society in New York, said that for the past 50 years, the reopening and development of China-US relations was the most important event in international relations and the biggest contributor to global peace and prosperity."History provides us inspirations to look ahead to the future," Xie said in a keynote speech.He said that in the next 50 years, charting that proper course will be critical to international relations.The forum, co-hosted by China Daily and Bank of China to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the establishment of China-US diplomatic relations, brought together more than 200 witnesses, participants and contributors to those relations to discuss "inspiration from the past" and "vision for the future".The envoy noted that the best way to commemorate the anniversary is to explore the right way to get along in the new era and usher in a brighter future."The history of the China-US relationship in the past 45 years, especially the ups and downs in recent years, tell us that pressure, sanctions, isolation, containment and blockade don't serve the purpose."Rather, they bring self-inflicted trouble and require extra work to offset the unwanted results," Xie said.He said that the two countries share ever-broader common interests, as the global significance of their relationship is increasing."The idea of 'decoupling' is illusive; viewing each other as new Cold War adversaries will prove to be the biggest strategic misjudgment in the 21st century," Xie said, adding that a conflict between China and the US would be unbearable for both and the world.The envoy underscored that among the four red lines China has drawn — Taiwan, democracy and human rights, path and system, and development rights, the Taiwan question is paramount in China-US relations and must not be crossed."For China-US relations to have a 'stable floor', it is critical to avoid touching these 'high-voltage wires'," Xie said.In his speech, Xie said that more than 10,000 American youths have visited China since President Xi Jinping proposed during his summit with US President Joe Biden last November to invite 50,000 American young people to China for exchanges and study programs over five years."The growth of China-US relations has primarily come from the joint efforts of our peoples," he said. "We will build more bridges of dialogue and communication between our peoples to sustain the tradition of friendship."Also speaking at the forum, Qu Yingpu, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily, said the country's only English-language newspaper has chronicled the development of Sino-US relations and "faithfully recorded the bonds forged between the two peoples"."China-US relations are the most important bilateral relations in the world, and they must be managed well, despite the risks and challenges," Qu said.Qu said the newspaper "has never been absent" when important moments unfolded in and between the two countries.Most recently, it covered stories including American families who once lived in the Fujian resort of Kuliang, US youth visiting China, the 80th anniversary commemoration of the "Flying Tigers", and the August debut of the giant pandas "Yun Chuan" and "Xin Bao" at San Diego Zoo."Just as President Xi Jinping pointed out 'the hope of the China-US relationship lies in the people, its foundation is in grassroots connections, its future depends on the youth, and its vitality comes from subnational exchanges' — those are the key aspects we should constantly work to strengthen," Qu said.The veteran journalist said he is a firm believer that "mutual understanding is the foundation of friendly cooperation" and that "a modernized China represents an opportunity, rather than a challenge, to the United States".Given that China and the US have accumulated remarkable "cognitive deficits" amid profound changes taking place in the world, it is crucial that the two peoples reacquaint themselves with a real, multidimensional and comprehensive view of each other's country, he said.For five years in a row, the newspaper has worked with the Chinese embassy in the US to stage an annual story-sharing event titled "My China Album", presenting photo albums that show a unique pathway to understanding, while acting as a lens through which one can appreciate the richness of another culture, Qu said.The Vision China morning session featured presentations from six Americans. They came to tell stories of friendship with China in a time wrought with uncertainty. They are people who have remained steadfast in their support of China while trade and political tensions persist, particularly in a US presidential election year.American policy for China has veered off course because the assumptions have changed, in many ways radically, David Firestein, CEO and president of the George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations said during his speech at the event."They have changed in a way that they have become less accurate than they were before," he said.He outlined six wrong assumptions: China is no longer a partner but an enemy; building a constructive relationship with China does not serve the long-term interests of the US; China no longer accepts the existing world order and seeks to reshape it; China is trying to replace the US as the sole superpower; excessive engagement with China harms the US and makes it vulnerable; China-US relations are a "zero-sum game"."They're all wrong, every one of them," Firestein said of the assumptions.In 1979, teenagers Kelly Van Dries and her elder sister Kitty were working at a rodeo in Simonton, Texas, owned by their parents. Kelly had the honor of presenting a cowboy hat to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.Sarah Lande of Iowa recalled the friendly exchanges of the city of Muscatine with Hebei province.Their presentations were followed by a Gen Z debate and exchange in the afternoon, when American and Chinese youths debated "The impact of artificial intelligence on human life" and discussed how to avoid the Thucydides Trap, while overcoming "information bubbles" for better China-US communication.Ge Haijiao, chairman of Bank of China, said it is the longest continuously operating and most globalized bank in China. The bank has been a witness, participant and contributor to the ever-deepening and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the US."Bank of China is firmly committed to promoting trade and commerce between China and the United States, to the benefit of both societies," Ge said in a message read in New York by Hu Wei, president and CEO of Bank of China USA and chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce-USA.Steve Blake, chief representative for the environmental group WildAid in Beijing, said his experience in China "has really shaped my entire life for the most part"."Study Chinese, go check out China. Don't pay so much attention to the high level — a lot of negativity around China these days. On the ground, it's still an absolutely amazing place," he said.Angela Chen, co-chair of the New York Philharmonic's International Advisory Board and the founder and president of the China Arts Foundation International, said: "I'm really touched by these stories. You should share them with US audiences. I encourage your team to make a documentary featuring all the stories shared today — US audiences should know that there are still many people building connections between the US and China," she said.John W. Allen, chairman and CEO of Greater China Corp, said:"Vision China brought us together beautifully, and the young people are our hope for all of us. I was so impressed with all of the members of the panel. I've been a friend of China Daily for decades."Belinda Robinson, Minlu Zhang and Heng Weili in New York contributed to this story.LIMA - Former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori died Wednesday at the age of 86 in Lima, "after a long battle against cancer", confirmed his daughter and political leader Keiko Fujimori."Our father, Alberto Fujimori, has just departed to meet the Lord," Keiko wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Hours before his death, the spokesperson for the Fuerza Popular party, Miguel Torres, said that the former president was in a "delicate" state and going through "a difficult time".Fujimori, who served as Peru's president from 1990 to 2000, was released from prison last December, where he was serving a 25-year sentence for crimes against humanity.The World Laureates Association Prize (WLA Prize) has unveiled its laureates for 2024, with Jon Kleinberg, a professor of Computer Science & Information Science at Cornell University, and Professor Jeremy Nathans at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine recognized for their contributions, announced the WLA Prize management committee on Thursday during a press conference in Shanghai.Unveiled at the 4th WLA Forum on Nov 1, 2021, the WLA Prize is an international science prize initiated by the World Laureates Association (WLA), managed by the WLA Foundation, and exclusively funded by HongShan.The prize is awarded annually and features two categories: "Computer Science or Mathematics" and "Life Science or Medicine." The total award for each prize, which may be divided among up to four laureates, is 10 million yuan ($1.39 million).This year, the WLA Prize in Computer Science or Mathematics is bestowed on Kleinberg "for seminal contributions at the interface of computer science and social science, including intellectual leadership in the fields of social networks and algorithmic fairness.".The selection committee, chaired by Michael I. Jordan, lauds Kleinberg's pioneering work that bridges computer science, mathematics, and social economics. Kleinberg's research not only addresses fundamental challenges within these disciplines but also fosters collaboration to tackle complex societal issues. His extensive contributions to algorithms, behavioral economics, game theory, law, and network science have reshaped the landscape of information technology and laid the groundwork for future advancements.Moreover, Kleinberg's groundbreaking studies on the structure of the World Wide Web in the 1990s have had a profound impact on search engine design, influencing the evolution of Internet search algorithms. His leadership in the study of social networks and machine learning has further enriched the field, particularly in enhancing algorithmic fairness and understanding the interaction between machine learning and human decision-making.Professor Nathans was awarded the 2024 WLA Prize in Life Science and Medicine "for discovering the genes, regulation, and plasticity underlying human color vision and elucidating disease mechanisms that lead to blindness".Chair of the Life Science or Medicine selection committee, Randy Schekman, praises Nathans for his groundbreaking research on the molecular basis of color vision. Nathan's early achievements in cloning the opsin genes responsible for color vision in cows and humans laid the foundation for understanding sensory receptors. His subsequent work on color blindness and inherited retinal degeneration revolutionized the field, unveiling crucial insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying these conditions.Nathan's discoveries, including identifying the gene for Stargardt disease and demonstrating the remarkable plasticity of the visual system in mice, have significantly advanced our comprehension of human vision. Schekman commends Nathans for his insatiable curiosity, profound knowledge of vision science, and innovative approaches, positioning him as "one of the best neuroscientists in the world".The 2024 WLA Prize Award Ceremony is set to take place in Shanghai on Oct 25, where both winners will be present to receive their accolades.The WLA Prize, which has been presented annually since 2022, is committed to celebrating groundbreaking research and innovation on a global scale, recognizing exceptional individuals who have made significant contributions to the scientific community to ensure their groundbreaking work receives the recognition it deserves.Although it's been 23 years, the commemoration of Sept 11 remains uniquely somber, even in election years.The morning after their heated presidential debate in Philadelphia, US Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, and former president Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, stood in the same row in a Manhattan ceremony Wednesday morning along with current President Joe Biden. They listened to the annual reading of the names of the victims of the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.Biden and Trump shook hands, as did the vice-president and Trump, whose running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, also was there. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg stood in the middle of the politicians.In describing the scene, The New York Times wrote that "it is a mark of the singular nature of Sept. 11 as a traumatic national touchstone that the combatants in today's scathing political wars would feel compelled to share a tent even for an hour"."Both sides knew that whoever did not show would pay a political price, so they swallowed any reservations and made the appearance."There were no formal remarks at the Ground Zero site, where on Sept 11, 2001, al-Qaida hijackers intentionally crashed two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, both of which eventually collapsed.Hijackers also crashed another jet into the Pentagon, and a fourth plane went down in a Pennsylvania field after passengers heroically stormed the cockpit and confronted the hijackers.The attacks at the three sites claimed nearly 3,000 lives.In New York, which took the brunt of the 9/11 toll, family members, including wives, husbands, sisters, brothers and now, more than two decades later, an increasing number of grandchildren, read out the names of the deceased.As the years passed, scores of people who were at Ground Zero and lucky enough to survive that fateful day ended up succumbing to cancers and other diseases due to the toxic burning at the site. Many of them were volunteers who helped clear "the pile" of debris.More than 45,000 people are living with physical ailments resulting from that day, the New York Post reported.At least 45,200 civilians and officers from the Fire Department of New York (FDNY), the New York Police Department (NYPD) and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have at least one cancer or disease that has been directly linked to 9/11.The FDNY lost 343 members on 9/11, many of whom headed into the building while others were fleeing. Now, the FDNY says that more firefighters have died from illnesses stemming from rescue and recovery efforts at Ground Zero.Last week, the names of 32 FDNY members were added to the department's World Trade Center Memorial Wall in Brooklyn, putting the deaths from illnesses to more than 360, Axios reported."As we do every year, we will reflect on the 343 members who died that day, and we will be sobered in knowing that those insurmountable losses did not end at the World Trade Center site," Fire Commissioner Robert Tucker said during the Sept 4 ceremony. "Instead, we have seen our members become sick because of time they spent working in the rescue and recovery."The NYPD lost 23 members on 9/11, but subsequent illnesses have claimed many more lives. In May, the Police Benevolent Association recognized 377 total members on its NYPD Memorial Wall as those who died from Sept 11-related illnesses, but said the number has already risen to more than 400, the New York Post reported.Many financial industry workers at Wall Street firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald were killed, as the World Trade Center was located in the Financial District, a short walk from the New York Stock Exchange.Biden, Harris and Trump also visited Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, where Flight 93 went down. The president called for a return to bipartisan unity and gave a hat to a Trump supporter, who gave him a Trump hat in return, according to spokesperson Andrew Bates.The president put on the hat, making for a viral photograph. "Thanks for the support, Joe," the Trump campaign wrote on social media.Biden and Harris later headed to a memorial at the Pentagon outside Washington."On this day 23 years ago, terrorists believed they could break our will and bring us to our knees. They were wrong. They will always be wrong. In the darkest of hours, we found light. And in the face of fear, we came together -- to defend our country, and to help one another," Biden said in a statement.Trump told Fox News of Sept 11: "It was a very, very sad, horrible day. There's never been anything like it."Agencies contributed to this story.LOS ANGELES - Bridge Fire, the largest wildfire in California as of Wednesday, exponentially exploded from 4,000 acres (16.2 square km) early Tuesday to nearly 48,000 acres (194.2 square km) with zero containment.According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), the blaze, jumping in size over ten times in 24 hours, has expanded from Los Angeles County into neighboring San Bernardino County.In an update Wednesday afternoon, officials said about 40 homes and cabins were destroyed in fire. There have been no reports of significant injuries or deaths.Bridge Fire is one of three major fires in southern California, along with Line Fire and Airport Fire, which all sparked amid an intense heatwave that brought triple digit temperatures and dry conditions to the region.Officials said a 34-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday. He was accused of sparking the Line Fire burning in the foothills of the San Bernardino National Forest, east of Los Angeles, which spanned over 34,600 acres (140.1 square km) at 14 percent containment as of Wednesday.Justin Wayne Halstenberg, a Fedex delivery driver, was allegedly started Bridge Fire intentionally on Sept. 5, but local authorities did not disclose how he did it.Meanwhile, Airport Fire, started Monday afternoon in Orange County, now stands at over 22,000 acres (89.1 square km) with zero containment, according to the latest Cal Fire data.PHILADELPHIA — US Vice-President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump faced off for the first time on Tuesday night in a 2024 US presidential debate in the city of Philadelphia.The debate, hosted by ABC News, started at the National Constitution Center.Harris shook hands with Trump after they were introduced on stage. During their over 90-minute debate, they clashed over key issues, including the economy, abortion, immigration, and US foreign policies, aiming to appeal to voters across the country.With less than eight weeks to go before the election, and days until early voting starts in some states, the debate, the only one scheduled, offered a rare opportunity for both candidates to make their case for a television audience of tens of millions of voters.Both Harris and Trump touted plans to strengthen the economy and bring down the cost of living. Harris vowed to build an "opportunity economy", citing plans to make housing more affordable and expand the child tax credit. Trump repeated his claim that he would impose tariffs on imports from other countries and also criticized the high inflation rates under the Biden-Harris administration.Abortion was a vital issue for both candidates in the debate. Trump emphasized his position that abortion should be a state issue.Harris criticized what she referred to as the "Trump abortion bans" since Roe versus Wade was overturned. She also highlighted cases where women have been unable to get abortions after being raped or struggled to get miscarriage care.They also sparred over US foreign policies regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.Trump repeatedly mentioned US President Joe Biden during the debate, and Harris reminded him, "You're not running against Joe Biden; you're running against me."The fiery debate also included personal attacks."The back-and-forth at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia was riddled with false and misleading comments, including on job growth and a baseless claim about Haitian immigrants," NBC News reported.The debate was the second presidential debate of the 2024 election, following the first one between Biden and Trump in June.Biden bowed out of the race in July due to concerns over his age, health, and debate performance. He passed the torch to Harris, who secured the Democratic presidential nomination in August.Tuesday's debate was critical as polls show a tight race with election day less than two months away.The science and technology relationship between the United States and China has entered a new era of complexity and uncertainty after a 45-year-old agreement, long considered a cornerstone of cooperation, expired on Aug 27.The US-China Science and Technology Agreement, the first official agreement signed after the normalization of US-China relations in the 1970s, ended despite the scientific community's efforts to have it renewed.Originally signed by then US president Jimmy Carter and then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979, the symbolically significant pact had been renewed every five years since it took effect, with the most recent renewal in 2018.However, the agreement's fate had been hanging in the balance since August 2023, when it was on the verge of lapsing. In an attempt to salvage the agreement, the two countries extended it twice, for six months each time, to negotiate renewal terms. Those efforts proved unsuccessful, and the most recent six-month extension expired last month.Many disappointedThe demise of the STA has sparked concern and disappointment among experts in the field.Richard Dasher, director of the US-Asia Technology Management Center at Stanford University, supports maintaining international cooperation."I think we should stay internationally focused. And I think that cooperation is good whenever we can do it. So, in principle, I would be in favor of continuing the US-China Science and Technology Agreement," Dasher told China Daily.The frustration surrounding the obstacles to renewing the STA is palpable within the scientific community.Denis Simon, a former professor at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, and Marcus Stanley, director of studies at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, voiced their exasperation by asking, "Why can't we just let American and Chinese scientists get along?"In an article published in the Quincy Institute's online magazine Responsible Statecraft the day after the agreement expired, the authors emphasized the critical role of the STA in fostering scientific collaboration."The STA provided an overarching framework for facilitating scientific exchanges, joint research projects, and the sharing of knowledge and technical expertise," they wrote.Simon and Stanley warned of the potential consequences of allowing the STA to lapse."It would be a mistake for agreements to facilitate basic scientific research cooperation such as the STA to become irretrievably damaged by the increase in US-China tensions. The decision on whether to extend, amend, or terminate the STA has profound implications for the global scientific community," they cautioned.The authors also highlighted the broader context of growing distrust between the two countries, which has contributed to the current impasse. Besides Congress, the US government has increasingly scrutinized Chinese scientists and researchers over "national security" concerns, which has hampered academic exchanges."This climate of growing distrust not only has made renewal of the STA more contentious, but it has also made the rekindling of overall science and technology cooperation more difficult," they said.Roger Pielke Jr, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank, expressed his support for continuing the STA "in the most robust form that can be negotiated between the two nations".He argued that the very existence of such an agreement is more important than its specific details, adding he viewed "decoupling" to be "a bad idea and it is also a bad idea in science and technology".Crucial supportFor decades, the STA has been instrumental in fostering scientific collaboration in areas of basic science such as agriculture, clean energy, public health and the environment. It has provided US and Chinese researchers with crucial financial, legal and political support, enabling them to work together on groundbreaking research and innovations.Dasher emphasized the interconnected nature of the global scientific community and the importance of collaboration."There's a continuum between basic research and actual commercialization, and certainly in the basic research area, there's always cooperation potential, just about everywhere," he said. "And you're seeing a lot of papers written jointly between people in China and in the United States."The agreement has contributed to a rapid increase in both the number and quality of joint papers by Chinese and US researchers. However, in recent years, research collaboration has declined, attributed to rising tensions and anti-China sentiment.A study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in June showed that scientific cooperation between the US and China had drastically decreased since 2016 when the former US president, Donald Trump, took office.The study analyzed data in three key areas: STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) trainee mobility, use of scientific works between scientists in each country, and scientist productivity in each country as measured by the production of peer-reviewed papers.Between 2016 and 2019, ethnically Chinese graduate students were 16 percent less likely to attend a US-based PhD program. Moreover, those who did attend such programs were 4 percent less likely to stay in the US after graduation, the study found.Output dropsThe researchers also documented a sharp decline in Chinese use of US science as measured by citations, although they found no such decline in the propensity of US scientists to cite Chinese research.The trends are corroborated by the State of the Science address delivered by US National Academy of Sciences President Marcia McNutt in June.McNutt presented data showing that the US is dropping in research output as measured by articles published, while China is experiencing a triple-digit percentage increase. In terms of research quality, measured by the percentage of articles in the top 1 percent cited, the US is losing ground while China has moved ahead of the European Union.The shifting landscape of scientific productivity is also reflected in the pharmaceutical industry. China's share of drugs in phase one to three trials has risen dramatically from about 3 percent in 2013 to 28 percent in 2021, while the US share is in decline, according to McNutt.China's number of patents per year surpassed the US around 2015 and is now leading by a ratio of 2 to 1 as of 2021.In the corporate world, China has emerged as a dominant force, leading the Global Fortune 500 list with 142 out of 500 companies in 2023, a stark contrast to its nonplayer status in 2000.Those statistics underscore McNutt's conclusion that advancing the frontiers of basic research now requires international partnerships to benefit all researchers.Saving livesThe importance of such partnerships is illustrated by an example provided by Dasher, involving a medical technology company. He described a collaboration between a senior electrical engineer in Silicon Valley — with innovative ideas for medical image analysis — and a professor in China."China has eight times as many medical images as the United States does. So, he cooperated with a professor in China, and the two of them have created a company about medical image analysis to detect cancer," Dasher said."That's a very good use, where China has data that is useful for everyone, and we have a technology idea. I think that kind of thing will continue."The benefits of international cooperation extend to the overall strength of the US technology sector. Dasher said one of the key strengths of Silicon Valley has been its diversity, with 13 percent of the technical workforce born in China."We've benefited from foreign people who come to the United States as students and continue to work here. I think that it's also the case where some Americans may want to go to China and work in China. So we need to maintain a very good, safe environment for people to cooperate," he emphasized.With dwindling government investment, the US industry began taking the lead around 1981 and now dominates US research investment with a 75 percent share, compared with the federal government's 20 percent.The strengths of the private sector in advancing scientific and technological development, however, have been challenged by the US government's "national security" measures aimed at containing China's development in science and technology.The biotech industry provides a stark example of the potential consequences of decoupling. Many achievements under the STA, such as US-China collaborations on gene editing research that have created disease-resistant crops and improved yields, are at risk of being reduced to historical footnotes.Patrick Beyrer, a researcher at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, said a potential US-China biotech decoupling is being expedited while everyday Americans aren't adequately prepared for the consequences.He cited the example of WuXi AppTec as a "research superstore" for its US partners, and WuXi Biologics, the second-largest biologic outsourcer in the world.Recent policy recommendations from the US House of Representatives' select committee on China have described US dependence on Chinese pharmaceutical supply chains as a "distinct national security risk", with some lawmakers proposing to block Chinese companies, such as BGI Group and WuXi AppTec, from future US federal contracting and government technology procurement.Impact on treatmentBeyrer warned that the elimination of those companies from US supply chains would have an impact on developing treatments for critical medical conditions, including hearing loss, cystic fibrosis and leukemia."In addition to China representing the largest and most cost-effective exporter of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the US market, jointly developed drugs, agricultural technologies, and other biotech-enabled solutions have improved countless American lives," he wrote in an article."The collapse of US-China biotech partnerships would spell the end of such jointly developed innovations that harbor the potential to deliver sorely needed global public goods, including saving American lives suffering from diseases such as cancer," Beyrer cautioned.Talent crunchThe challenges faced by the biotech industry are symptomatic of a broader issue affecting US-China relations in science and technology. Export controls and other measures to restrict technology transfer have moved to the heart of the relationship, increasing tensions between the two countries and posing significant challenges for US tech companies.Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, criticized the US export controls for causing an "intensely difficult problem" for US tech companies, particularly those that are in Silicon Valley."There's a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety. And I think that's true across the board in tech," Allen observed during an event at Stanford while visiting his organization's members in Silicon Valley.The semiconductor industry, in particular, has been hit hard by these restrictions. Allen said that several US chip companies have recently been banned from selling to an "ill-defined" range of Chinese customers."It's becoming more and more difficult to avoid that conflict of law, and thereby the consequences would be terminating or severely restricting what had been a very profitable enterprise for decades," he said.He emphasized the importance of China for many technology companies, both as a market and as a source of talent."China's extremely important for the tech companies; many of them have a large percentage share of their total sales in China, and many of them draw on that enormous Chinese talent pool in China, and that is not something that they can easily walk away from," he said.An April report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated that in a small subset of tech companies studied, $130 billion of market capital was lost due to export controls. When new export controls were announced, employment in affected companies declined by 7 percent."It is especially detrimental for American companies when export controls are unilateral, enforced by the American government only on American companies in such cases, and there are many unilateral export controls (that) asymmetrically hurt American firms and long-term American competitiveness," said Allen.These restrictions are disrupting long-established partnerships and hindering access to crucial talent. Allen cited the case of a US multinational company whose lead scientist in China was denied a visa to visit his own laboratories in the US."American companies need to access Chinese talent if they are to remain globally competitive. If American companies are barred from hiring Chinese talent, then other companies will be given a long-term structural advantage that probably over a very short period of time will impact American competitiveness," he argued.This talent crunch is exacerbated by the US' dependence on international students to meet its STEM workforce requirements, as noted by McNutt in her June address. The narrowing channel for data flows between R&D teams in China and the US is making this challenge more acute every day.Looking ahead, Allen acknowledged the complex political landscape that companies must navigate."We live in a political world; companies have to recognize that a potential future conflict between the United States and China would make it impossible for most international trade and investment to continue," he said."While conflict is certainly not inevitable, tensions need to be managed carefully, as we try to nudge our way to a more sustainable rules-based multipolar order."PHILADELPHIA, the United States - US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off for the first time Tuesday night in a 2024 US presidential debate in the city of Philadelphia.The debate, hosted by ABC News, started at 9 pm Eastern Time Tuesday (0100 GMT Wednesday) at the National Constitution Center.Harris shook hands with Trump after they were introduced on stage.

Surveys of the key battleground states show that Trump and Harris are within a few points of each other and the polls' margins of error.China has consistently upheld a people-centered perspective on human rights, respecting the principal position of the people, according to Baimachilin, vice-chairman of the 13th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and president of the China Society for Human Rights Studies.Baimachilin spoke at the inaugural China-Latin America and Caribbeans States (LAC) Roundtable on Human Rights in Brazil on Tuesday, which marked the first such institutional exchange and seminar between China and Latin America and the Caribbean.The roundtable, themed "Diversity of Civilizations and Pathways to Realize Human Rights", drew senior officials and experts from 17 countries — China, Brazil, Argentina, the Bahamas, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Dominica, Ecuador, Grenada, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela.He outlined China's commitment to advancing human rights through development, citing the country's large-scale education, healthcare and social security systems."Guided by the people's aspirations for a better life, China's human rights development aims to achieve common prosperity for all and advancing higher levels of human rights protection through high-quality development," said Baimachilin.With improvements in environmental quality and an increase in life expectancy to 78.6 years, the quality of life for the Chinese people has significantly improved. Additionally, China is advancing whole-process people's democracy, turning democratic values into effective institutional arrangements and concrete practices.Baimachilin said China's goal is to "ensure that people feel fairness and justice in every law enforcement decision and judicial case".He stressed China's commitment to ensuring equal rights for all, with a particular focus on the protection and support of vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities, women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities.He cited China's success at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, where Chinese athletes won 220 medals, including 94 gold, as a reflection of the nation's dedication to providing its 85 million citizens with disabilities equal opportunities for a fulfilling life.Baimachilin, however, also warned that the world is facing growing instability, with rising antiglobalization sentiments, increasing unilateralism and protectionism, and more frequent local conflicts."Global human rights deficits are deepening, and the international human rights movement is facing severe challenges, with global human rights governance still a formidable task," he noted.Baimachilin stressed the longstanding cooperation between China and Latin America, dating to the 16th century, which he said was a key avenue for mutual learning between civilizations.Marking 50 years of diplomatic ties between China and Brazil, and similar long-standing relations with other Latin American countries, Baimachilin said that the partnership has yielded significant results."We have every reason to believe that as China-LAC relations continue to grow, our human rights exchanges and cooperation will become even more profound and fruitful," he added.Officials and academics from China and Latin America underscored the importance of partnerships in addressing inequalities. They called on governments, organizations and individuals to engage in dialogue, build consensus, tackle global human rights challenges, and advance the progress of human rights worldwide.Charles Peter David, former foreign minister of Grenada, detailed the benefits of China's investments in the Caribbean, particularly in Grenada, as catalysts for economic and social progress.The partnership between China and the Caribbean is a compelling testament to how cooperative global efforts can profoundly enhance human rights and improve the lives of millions across the nations, according to David, who is also former agriculture minister of Grenada and deputy general secretary of the New National Party Grenada."It symbolizes mutual respect for the rule of law and a shared commitment to fostering economic, social and cultural development — ultimately, people-to-people development," David told the gathering.He said that China's significant investments in Grenada and the wider Caribbean have played a crucial role in driving both economic and social progress. One key example is the Grenada National Stadium, built with a generous Chinese grant, which has become a vital hub for community engagement, sports and cultural activities."This facility reflects our shared commitment to improving quality of life through infrastructure," David said, noting that joint diplomatic efforts have amplified Caribbean voices on the global stage.Zhu Qingqiao, the Chinese ambassador to Brazil, said that the promotion of human rights and exchanges between China and Latin America is entering a phase of significant opportunity.China aims to drive high-quality development through new productive forces while improving human rights protections.Similarly, Brazil and other Latin American nations are focused on eradicating hunger and poverty, with social fairness and justice as key governance goals. With more than 50 years of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, both countries have worked together to benefit their people, according to Zhu."We should oppose the politicization, weaponization and selective use of human rights issues and promote the global governance of human rights toward a fairer, just, reasonable and inclusive direction," Zhu asserted.Wang Yi, vice-president of Renmin University in China, one of the co-organizers of the event, emphasized that human rights development is a universal concern in human society, reflecting humanity's ongoing attempt to answer the philosophical question, ‘Who are we?'He said that different countries and cultures should respect and appreciate one another and engage in meaningful dialogue to build consensus on human rights.CARACAS - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday accused his Dominican counterpart Luis Abinader of being a "thief" and "bandit", after the seizure of his plane in the Dominican Republic.Speaking at an event broadcast by the state-run television channel, Maduro claimed that Abinader, with the cooperation of local officials, facilitated US authorities in seizing the aircraft.Maduro warned that the Dominican people would eventually hold Abinader accountable.The plane, a Dassault Falcon 900EX, was impounded by the US Department of Justice earlier this month for violating US sanctions against Venezuela and flown to Florida.Maduro said that Venezuela reserves its right to take legal action to address the situation and reiterated his opposition to US sanctions.When United States astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams blasted into space aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule in early June, they expected their trip to last only a week.However, three months down the line, Starliner undocked from the International Space Station and landed in New Mexico on Saturday minus the two astronauts, who remain stranded in space, because NASA deemed the Starliner's problems with its thrusters too fraught with risk for a crewed return.Despite Starliner's safe return, NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said the decision not to have the astronauts on board during the craft's journey back to earth was the right one."The Starliner's successful return seems like pure luck, as the issues it encountered could not be replicated on earth for a solution," said Lin Luzhou, assistant professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University's Academy of Regional and Global Governance."It points to problems in quality management, an area where Boeing used to excel," he added.Despite the successful docking in early June and its uneventful return, Starliner has faced persistent issues, including a failed unmanned test trip to the ISS in 2019. A do-over mission in 2022 went ahead but some thruster malfunctions remained."Boeing is shifting away from being the crown jewel of US manufacturing. In recent years, it has prioritized profit over quality," Ding Yifan, a senior fellow at Taihe Institute, a think tank in Beijing, said."Cost-cutting measures, like outsourcing key components, have further compromised standards," he said.The crashes of two Boeing 737 Max jets in 2018 and 2019, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killed 346. The company faced another blow when a door plug blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight in January."It shows a broader decline in US manufacturing capabilities," he added.Following its launch, Starliner reported helium leaks and thruster problems, extending the space mission multiple times, before NASA announced in August that the astronauts will only come back in February on a SpaceX Dragon capsule."NASA's decision to ultimately rely on the Dragon spacecraft must have come after extensive technical evaluations. However, the issues won't be resolved in just a couple of months," Lin of the Academy of Regional and Global Governance said."Space missions, particularly those involving the International Space Station, require meticulous planning and multilateral coordination," he added."It is an image issue. SpaceX's space program has indirectly benefited from NASA's budget cuts over the years, which led to the outsourcing of projects and the lay-offs of NASA engineers — many of whom ended up working for Elon Musk," Ding of Taihe Institute said.Boeing has a long history of working with NASA. Apollo 11, which was propelled by a Boeing-built rocket, landed on the moon in 1969. "Previously, ample funding supported US technological advancements. However, the focus has now turned to more profitable ventures and space exploration receives less support," Ding said."Additionally, military-industrial complexes have shifted federal budget priorities, further reducing NASA's funding and diminishing its role."Boeing incurred about $1.6 billion in cost overruns while developing the Starliner, facing repeated delays and price increases due to supply chain issues, Agence France-Presse reported."The current model for commercial space exploration undoubtedly starts with significant investment in research, which is no longer sustainable under incumbent financing mode," Lin said.According to Ding, US public finances have become increasingly strained, with growing debt leaving less room for discretionary spending. The gross federal debt of the US has surpassed $35.3 trillion, US Treasury Department data showed.NASA's budget peaked during the Apollo program in the 1960s, at more than 4.4 percent of the US federal budget, according to the Space Report website. It fell below 1 percent after 1993 and has hovered around 0.5 percent in recent years."When the government budget is primarily allocated to debt repayment and military expenses, public funding for space exploration — an area that isn't immediately profitable — diminishes," Ding said.However, despite the constraints, Lin said we are witnessing a second major wave of human space exploration since the Apollo program, with commercial space ventures booming globally."Both established players, as well as newcomers, are undergoing significant transformations, which will bring both opportunities and challenges," he said, adding that the key question is whether they can secure a competitive edge in the evolving space industry.Beijing condemned on Tuesday the so-called Biosecure Act passed by the United States House of Representatives, urging Washington to stop unwarranted oppression against Chinese enterprises.The bill, passed by 306 to 81 votes on Monday, would prohibit the US government from contracting with, or providing grants to, companies that do business with a "biotechnology company of concern".It names five Chinese companies — BGI, MGI and its subsidiary Complete Genomics, WuXi AppTec, and WuXi Biologics.China firmly opposes such discriminatory measures against its companies, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a daily news conference.Mao urged the US to abandon ideological bias, earnestly respect market principles and trade rules, stop pushing forward the legislation and provide a fair, just and nondiscriminatory business environment for companies from all countries.China will continue to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of its companies, she said, adding that the country also supports its companies in safeguarding their rights and interests in accordance with the law.The legislation needs to pass the US Senate before it can be sent to US President Joe Biden to be signed into law.The targeted companies have all said the measure is based on false and misleading allegations and would limit competition. They denied posing any threat to US national security and stressed that they do not have access to the personal data of US citizens in their operations.The act is the latest move by US lawmakers who have already succeeded this year in requiring Chinese-based parent company ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a US ban.The Biosecure Act is part of a string of China-related bills that the US lawmakers are pushing ahead this week.In what has been dubbed "China Week", the US House of Representatives is aiming to introduce dozens of bills touching on trade, technology, farm ownership and electric vehicles, in moves to counter China's political, economic and technological influence.OTTAWA - Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said Tuesday that Ottawa has suspended about 30 existing permits for arms sales to Israel, local media reported.According to the reports, Joly said Ottawa's policy is that Canadian-made arms and components cannot be used in the Gaza Strip, regardless of how they are sent to Israel.Ottawa stopped approving new arms permits for Israel in January though permits approved in the prior months were still active."We will not have any form of arms, or parts of arms, be sent to Gaza. Period. How they're being sent and where they're being sent is irrelevant," Joly was quoted as saying.According to the reports, Canada is also blocking a contract with the US government to send Quebec-made ammunition to the Israeli Defence Forces, which was announced by Washington weeks ago.Made-in-China electric vehicles are winning over car buyers across Latin America and reshaping views about Chinese products.The advanced technology and competitive pricing of Chinese vehicles — EVs as well as traditional cars — are rapidly translating into rising market share for China's automakers in the Latin American market.In 2019, Chinese carmakers sold about $2.2 billion worth of vehicles across Latin America, according to the International Trade Center. By last year, the value of Chinese vehicles sold in the region almost quadrupled to $8.56 billion, accounting for roughly 20 percent of the region's car market.The quality of the cars and their price caught the attention of buyers like Florencio Perez Romero, a pilot in Mexico. Romero recently bought a Chinese-made MG RX5 because of the features it includes, like a large touchscreen console, myriad sensors and LED lighting, as well as an appealing panoramic sunroof."These are cool features. Compared to similar SUVs in the market like Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford and Chevrolet, it seemed like a good deal," said Romero.The price tag was another big factor for Romero, who noted that when all is said and done, Chinese vehicles end up being cheaper than similar offerings from other brands.Making stridesChinese EV makers have been making strides in global markets. BYD, for example, has topped Tesla, which also makes many of its cars in China, as the top EV seller globally.But they are facing significant headwinds in North American and European markets, which have increased their scrutiny and tariffs, Oxford Economics noted in a report.The US increased the import tariffs on China-made vehicles from 27.5 percent to 100 percent in May, and Canada followed suit in late August. In June, the EU Commission announced plans to impose tariffs on imported Chinese cars, and adjusted them in August. For example, tariffs on Tesla EVs manufactured in China were cut from 20.8 percent to 9 percent while tariffs on BYD vehicles were reduced marginally from 17.4 percent to 17 percent.In Latin America, meanwhile, sales are flourishing, from Mexico all the way down to Argentina's Ushuaia, the world's southernmost city. In many markets across the region, including Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and more, where buyers are very price-conscious, the savings attached to buying a Chinese car make a big difference.In Chile, in particular, Chinese automakers have been particularly successful both in selling cars to private buyers and providing vehicles to support infrastructure development, like public transit. Chileans are increasingly willing to buy Chinese traditional cars and EVs."Brands like MG, Maxus, Great Wall and Chery have dominated the streets with the highest sales numbers among Chinese brands, suggesting considerable popularity (among) Chilean customers when buying a new vehicle," said Renzo Burotto, a historian at the University of Chile.According to the National Automotive Association of Chile, 111,108 China-made cars were imported to the country in 2023, reaching a market share of 39.4 percent.Burotto attributed the growth of Chinese EVs in Chile partly to a free trade agreement and strong commercial ties between the two nations.Chinese EVs are also increasingly visible in public transportation. Burotto pointed out that Santiago, the Chilean capital, uses more than 2,000 electric buses imported from China. Santiago, which has the second-largest fleet of such buses in the world outside of China, has replaced more than 1,000 diesel combustion buses.And there is little reason to think that buyers across Latin America will not continue scooping up Chinese cars and EVs. Any concerns about the quality, technology or safety of made-in-China products are fading quickly."China no longer just makes irons and blenders," said Burotto. "It is now not only manufacturing but also leading in innovation, with a view to sustainable development, and putting China's unparalleled production capacity at the service of Global South countries that so desperately need to emerge from their chronic infrastructure deficit."The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.LOS ANGELES - Three fast-moving wildfires continued to burn in Southern California Tuesday as millions of residents in the region are still under an excessive heat warning.The largest one, dubbed the Line Fire, had scorched at least 26,000 acres (about 105 square km) with only 5 percent containment as of Tuesday morning in San Bernardino County, forcing mandatory evacuation orders for thousands of people.There are currently 65,600 structures threatened, including 9,200 structures under evacuation orders and 56,400 structures under evacuation warnings, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire)."The north and east sides of the Line Fire continue to burn with the greatest intensity. Today will be mostly sunny over the fire area, and the smoke impacts are expected to grow as the day progresses," said Cal Fire in an update, adding that firefighters are creating control lines, protecting structures and the community, making contingency plans, and maximizing the use of aircraft when conditions are not too smoky.The fire, which broke out on Thursday, grew exponentially in size over the weekend due to soaring temperatures and critically dry vegetation amid a record-setting heat wave in Southern California.California Governor Gavin Newsom declared on Saturday a state of emergency in San Bernardino County to help ensure the availability of vital resources to suppress the fire. He announced on Monday the activation of the California National Guard to assist nearly 2,000 firefighters in battling the massive wildfire.Another wildfire, called the Bridge Fire, broke out on Sunday in the Angeles National Forest in Los Angeles County, nearly 100 km west of the Line Fire. The blaze grew to nearly 3,000 acres (about 12.1 square km) with zero containment as of Tuesday morning.A new blaze, dubbed the Airport fire, started Monday afternoon in Trabuco Canyon in Orange County. The fire charred more than 8,500 acres (about 34.4 square km) overnight with zero percent containment, prompting evacuations.The fire spread quickly in hazardous weather conditions, leading to the evacuation of more than 1,400 homes and triggering responses by more than 1,000 firefighters, reported local KABC television station, adding that two firefighters were treated for heat-related injuries and one civilian was hospitalized for smoke inhalation.Southern California is still facing dangerously hot conditions on Tuesday, and an excessive heat warning will stay in effect until Tuesday night, according to US National Weather Service Los Angeles.The massive wildfires have generated unhealthy levels of smoke in Southern California. The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a wildfire smoke advisory, valid until Tuesday night, for a large part of the region."Smoke from the Line, Bridge, and Airport fires is expected to cause PM2.5 levels to reach at least the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups," said the agency.LOS ANGELES - California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Monday the activation of the California National Guard to assist nearly 2,000 firefighters in battling a massive wildfire in Southern California's San Bernardino County.The fast-moving wildfire dubbed the Line Fire has scorched at least 23,600 acres (about 95.5 square km) with only 3 percent containment as of Monday afternoon, forcing mandatory evacuation orders for over 11,000 people and putting more than 36,000 structures at risk."As the Line Fire continues to pose a threat to San Bernardino communities, we're pouring resources into this incident aggressively by deploying more air and ground support through the California National Guard," said Newsom in a news release."This is on top of nearly 2,000 firefighters, nearly 200 engines, and air assets we already have tackling this fire," he added. "California stands with these communities and has their backs."The California National Guard will deploy four UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters for water bucket-dropping operations, and two C-130 aircraft with Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems -- a portable fire retardant delivery system, according to the news release.The fire, which broke out on Thursday, has grown exponentially in size over the weekend due to soaring temperatures and critically dry vegetation amid a record-setting heat wave in Southern California.Newsom declared on Saturday a state of emergency in San Bernardino County to help ensure the availability of vital resources to suppress the fire."Fire activity on the Line Fire was moderated in the upper elevations in the overnight hours but remained active in the thermal belts. The fire made short, intense runs in the slopes and the lighter fuels which allowed for growth," said the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.At least five school and college districts in the region were closed for students and staff on Monday due to the impacts of the ongoing Line Fire, with more school districts being closed based on the assessment of conditions within their areas, said the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools.The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a wildfire smoke advisory for a large part of Southern California."Based on satellite and webcam imagery, widespread smoke is over San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, and Los Angeles Counties," said the agency.PM 2.5 levels may reach the "Very Unhealthy" level or higher on Sunday night and Monday morning in southern Orange County, the Inland Empire, the San Bernardino Mountains, and surrounding areas, the agency warned.Another wildfire called the Bridge Fire broke out on Sunday in the Angeles National Forest in Los Angeles County, nearly 100 km west of the Line Fire. The blaze has scorched over 1,250 acres (about 5 square km) with zero containment in the past 24 hours.The Roblar Fire, which started on Saturday in San Diego County, has charred 950 acres (about 4 square km) with 25 percent containment so far.In the first four months of this presidential election year, nearly 5.5 million legal firearms were purchased in the US, according to FBI data, while the candidates from both major parties have starkly different positions on gun control.Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, advocates stricter regulations, while Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump is pro-gun rights. These contrasting stances are already resonating differently with likely voters.David Liu, owner of Arcadia Firearm & Safety in Arcadia, California, serves a predominantly Asian community 30 minutes from Monterey Park, where a tragic mass shooting during a Chinese New Year Festival left 11 dead and nine injured last year."I'm a Trump supporter. And it's not because (Republicans) support guns that I vote for them. Because I look overall on the candidates. I prefer Trump's overall policy," Liu said. "I will not vote for a guy just because he said he supports guns. That's not the point of voting for the president."Liu said that over the past two months, his sales have been slow, attributing it to a new 11 percent tax on gun sales and ammunition imposed in July by California's Democrat-controlled legislature to fund violence prevention. This is in addition to the existing federal tax of 10 or 11 percent on firearms.About 16.7 million firearms were sold in the United States last year, a 4 percent decline from 2022, according to SafeHome.org, which analyzed the FBI's national instant background-check data.The National Shooting Sports Foundation found that firearm sales to Asian Americans rose by 43 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, a response to a rise in hate crimes against the community during the pandemic.The US has more guns than people, with estimates ranging from 425 million to 475 million in a country of 333 million people as of 2022.A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in June found that only 4 percent of likely voters considered gun violence the most important issue in choosing a president, with the economy taking precedence.Nearly half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents own a gun, compared with 20 percent of Democrats and those who lean liberal, Pew Research Center found.Carl Bogus, a law professor at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, told China Daily that the Republican Party considers the gun lobby to be an "essential" part of its political coalition.Trump has called himself "the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House". He told an audience in February at the National Rifle Association's Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that "no one will lay a finger on your firearms" if he wins.In his administration, Trump reversed a law that restricted people with mental illness to purchase a gun, and banned bump stocks that can convert semiautomatic weapons into a machine gun-like weapon. In June, the Supreme Court lifted the ban, citing the Second Amendment of the Constitution.belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.comThe China Institute honored three people for promoting mutual understanding between China and the United States during the annual Blue Cloud Gala on Thursday in New York.The awards were presented to Ronald Diamond, vice-chairman of Conair LLC and chief executive of Cuisinart Outdoor; Henry Fernandez, chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley Capital International; and Sheldon Pang, vice-chairman of Freepoint Commodities and chairman of Freepoint Solar, at The Plaza Hotel."We are thrilled to have the opportunity to salute these three honorees for their outstanding leadership and contribution to our society as well as in the social exchange between the American and Chinese people," said George S. Geh, CEO of the China Institute in America. "This is aligned with our mission to promote bridge-building and cultural understanding between the US and China."Chinese Consul General in New York Huang Ping attended the gala and expressed his appreciation for the China Institute and the awardees' efforts in "making a positive impact on China-US cultural exchanges"."I have been inspired by the vision and commitment of the people and organizations that believe China and the US ... should work together," Huang said. He expressed appreciation for the China Institute's commitment to introducing China to US friends, including its history, culture, values and lifestyle."I know we were different, we are different, and we are going to be different. But we share a lot of things in common. The only problem is we just don't know each other as we need to know, so that sometimes causes problems," he said."But if we would enhance people-to-people communication, if we could have more contacts, more people flow across the Pacific, having more face-to-face chatting, we will get to know each other better."The three-time Chinese diplomat to the US hosted and took part in more than 400 events each year during his six-year term and received a special award from the China Institute."The road for China and the US is always bumpy," Huang said. "We started reengagement 50 years ago; we had our relationship mobilized 45 years ago. We believe in the power of the youth, strength, the power of unity and solidarity. We can always find a way to get along."The China Institute is a nonprofit founded in New York in 1926 by US educators John Dewey and Paul Monroe, along with Chinese scholars Hu Shi and Kuo Ping-wen."Our mission is to deepen the world's understanding of China's 5,000-year history and its rich and diverse culture," Geh said.mingmeili@chinadailyusa.com SACRAMENTO, the United States - Fueled by excessive heat and drought, several large wildfires raged across the western United States on Sunday, forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes and worrying climate experts about more fires in the coming days.In Northern California, a wildfire called the Boyles Fire erupted Sunday afternoon in the town of Clearlake, located in Lake County north of the Bay Area.The fire has rapidly consumed 76 acres (about 0.3 square km) in just three hours, with 10 percent containment achieved so far, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) said.The agency has declared the fire "an immediate threat to life", urging residents in affected areas to evacuate immediately. Approximately 30 structures are "involved" in the blaze, and around 4,000 residents in the town have been displaced from evacuation zones, said the agency in a fire update.A live video from a local news channel showed the fire was burning through thick brush that had become highly flammable due to the hot weather and dry conditions, making it particularly challenging for firefighters to control.In Southern California, the situation was even more dire. A wildfire called the Line Fire, which broke out on Thursday in San Bernardino County, has grown exponentially, quadrupling in size on Saturday.This massive wildfire already injured three people and threatens thousands of homes and businesses. As of Sunday afternoon, the fire has scorched 17,459 acres (about 71 square km) with zero percent containment, forcing mandatory evacuation orders for over 11,000 people and putting more than 35,000 structures at risk.Soaring temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 degrees Celsius) and "critically dry" vegetation contributed to its rapid expansion toward the San Bernardino Mountains.California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in San Bernardino County Saturday. The area was under a red flag warning for wildfires on Sunday.More than 600 firefighters have been dispatched to contain the Line Fire, but steep terrain and limited access have impaired their ability to reach some areas."Thunderstorm outflow winds are causing very erratic fire behavior," while "smoke is limiting aircraft access to parts of the fire," said CalFire."Hot and dry conditions mixed with thunderstorms are expected to challenge firefighters for the next few days," said the agency.In Idaho, the Lava Fire, first reported on Sept. 2, has burned 2,493 acres (about 10 square km) as of Sunday. This lightning-caused fire was burning through heavy timber, brush, and grass, prompting evacuation orders for nearby residents, the US Forest Service said.Climate scientists are particularly concerned about the formation of pyrocumulonimbus, or fire-generated storms. In photos posted on social media Sunday, pyrocumulonimbus clouds were clearly visible on top of the Lava Fire.These large plumes of smoke, generated during massive fires, can create their own weather systems. The intense heat from the fires rises into the air, and if enough moisture is present, it can generate thunderstorms.Above-normal temperatures will continue across the western United States into the High Plains, with highs from Arizona to the Central Valley from 105 to 110 degrees (about 40-43 degrees Celsius), with 95 to 100 degrees (about 35-38 degrees Celsius) expected in the Inland Northwest, according to the National Interagency Fire Center's update on Sunday.LOS ANGELES - A group of representatives of US travel agents, organized by Air China and China National Tourist Office (CNTO), departed from Los Angeles Sunday on a FAM (short for "familiarization") trip for China."It will be good to experience it ourselves, so that we can tell our clients that China would be safe to go," Joey Sy, a personal travel manager from Los Angeles-based Hyssop Travel, told Xinhua at Los Angeles International Airport.Since China introduced a series of measures in 2023 to facilitate inbound tourism, including simplifying visa processes, expanding the list of visa-free countries, and expanding international flights, the country's inbound tourism market has seen continuous growth, Wu Dawei, CNTO Los Angeles director said.Wu added that this group is aimed at further increasing the travel from the United States to China and solidifying the outcomes of the 14th China-US Tourism Leadership Summit held in Xi'an in May.The group will explore classic itinerary including Beijing, Xi'an, the Yangtze River cruises and Shanghai on this FAM trip that encompasses site inspections of accommodations, dining and tourist attractions.The first China-Latin America and Caribbean States Roundtable on Human Rights is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Sept 10.This event is co-hosted by the China Society for Human Rights Studies, Renmin University of China, and Universidade Federal Fluminense, marking a significant effort to implement the Global Civilization Initiative. It aims to foster dialogue, promote mutual learning among Chinese, Latin American, and Caribbean civilizations, and advance the diversified development of human rights in the context of modernization.This year's roundtable will also commemorate two significant milestones: the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, and the 10th anniversary of the China-CELAC Forum.The event's theme, "The Diversity of Civilizations and the Path to Achieving Human Rights," will be addressed in three parallel sessions focusing on the contributions of China and Latin America to global human rights civilization, the realization of the right to development and fundamental human rights, and current challenges and solutions for global human rights governance.Over 100 participants, including high-level officials, senators, dignitaries from China, Latin American and Caribbean nations, representatives from international organizations, academic experts, think tank analysts, legal professionals, business leaders, and media figures, will attend the event to share insights and discuss human rights issues in a global context.Douglas Dueno, a visitor from the United States, was mysteriously drawn to Jinsha Academy in Xiamen's Haicang district in Fujian province. There, he discovered the deep historical ties across the Strait, along with the captivating charm of the ancient Maritime Silk Road that connects cultures across time.Watch the video to join his journey and experience the vibrant historical and cultural energy of Haicang.Hunter Biden, 54, son of US President Joe Biden, made a surprise guilty plea to federal tax charges on Thursday, the first day of his scheduled trial.He was to stand trial in a Los Angeles federal courthouse on criminal charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes while spending heavily on drugs, sex workers and luxury items. He pleaded guilty to all nine counts he faced.Judge Mark Scarsi said he faces up to 17 years in prison and up to $450,000 in penalties and set sentencing for Dec 16.Earlier Thursday, Hunter Biden had offered to plead guilty but not admit any wrongdoing, a legal maneuver called an "Alford plea". Prosecutors opposed the move.His lawyer Abbe Lowell told the judge his client would plead guilty, despite having no prior agreement with prosecutors.In a statement after the hearing, Hunter Biden said he pleaded guilty to spare his family from having to sit through a trial that would have aired details of a period when he was addicted to drugs."For all I have put them through over the years, I can spare them this," he said, adding that he had paid back his taxes.Lowell told reporters afterward that Hunter Biden might appeal his sentence. Leo Wise, the lead prosecutor in the case, said he was stunned by the plea and took offense when Lowell suggested that the government had subjected Hunter Biden to an unfair prosecution as a result of political pressure, The New York Times reported."This idea that he's a victim of this process, it's offensive," Wise said. "We have not exacted a pound of flesh or a drop of blood. We have afforded him the same right as any American."A plea deal that Hunter Biden's defense had reached with David Weiss, the special counsel in the case, unraveled when it was reviewed by a federal judge in Delaware in July.US Representative Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, one of three congressional committees investigating President Biden via an impeachment inquiry, said,"Hunter Biden's decision to plead guilty once again affirms the integrity of the IRS whistleblowers who recommended these exact charges over two years ago before being stonewalled by the Biden-Harris Justice Department," Fox News reported.Voters will choose on Nov 5 between Vice-President Kamala Harris, a Democrat and Republican former president Donald Trump. President Biden dropped his reelection bid in July under pressure from his fellow Democrats.The trial could also have shed light on Hunter Biden's work with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma and other business dealings while his father was vice-president.He has denied any improper business dealings and the White House said that President Biden has not benefited from his son's business connections.The White House has said the president has ruled out pardoning his son, but that did not stop Republicans from claiming otherwise."Hunter Biden's bait-and-switch stunt is a clear effort to avoid a messy trial that would reveal his father's role in the family's corrupt business dealings," said Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, Fox News reported.Agencies contributed to this story.SACRAMENTO, the United States - Valley Fever, a fungal disease, has been spreading in California, with warnings from state health authorities about an increased risk through the fall, local news outlets reported Thursday.Valley Fever is caused by breathing in dust from outdoor air that contains spores of the Coccidioides fungus. It usually affects the lungs and can cause prolonged symptoms, including cough, fever, chest pain and fatigue.It can also lead to severe diseases, such as meningitis, and even death, according to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).People living in or traveling to the state's Central Valley and Central Coast regions face higher risks, warned the CDPH last week. The department said it was preparing for "another possible increase in Valley fever cases in the coming months"."If you have a lingering cough and fatigue, please talk to a doctor about Valley fever, especially if you've been outdoors in dusty air in the Central Valley or Central Coast regions," said CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer Tomas Aragon in a news release.A recent valley fever outbreak has been traced to the Lightning in a Bottle music festival held in May near Bakersfield, California, local KGET news channel said Thursday, adding that as of Aug 21, health officials had confirmed at least 19 cases of the fungal infection among festival attendees and workers, with eight individuals requiring hospitalization.The CDPH is investigating the outbreak. The electronic dance music festival at Buena Vista Lake in Kern County of California drew approximately 20,000 attendees from May 22 to 27.The surge in cases was believed to be linked to the festival's dusty conditions, exacerbated by high winds during the event. Festival organizers had implemented dust control measures, including watering the ground and providing free masks, but these efforts appeared to have been insufficient in preventing the outbreak.Valley fever has been on the rise in California in recent years, with over 9,000 cases reported last year and over 5,000 preliminary cases reported as of July 1, according to the CDPH.The department said possible causes of this recent increase include winter rains after several years of drought, an increase in soil disturbance activities in high-risk areas, and increased disease recognition.Though most cases of Valley fever in California are reported from the Central Valley and Central Coast regions, the state health department has seen increasing cases outside of these regions, including in the northern Central Valley and in Southern California.LOS ANGELES -- US President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden pleaded guilty Thursday to all nine counts in his criminal tax case in a Los Angeles federal court.Hunter Biden, 54, was indicted in California in December on nine counts related to a Justice Department investigation into his taxes. Federal prosecutors charged him with evading at least 1.4 million US dollars in tax payments.The only surviving son of President Biden had previously pleaded not guilty in the case. But a lawyer for him announced in court Thursday that Hunter Biden planned to change his not guilty plea before the start of his trial.Hunter Biden's stunning decision to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges without the benefits of a deal with prosecutors came hours after jury selection was supposed to begin in the case, according to NBC Los Angeles television station.Hunter Biden quickly responded "guilty" as the judge read out each of the nine counts, reported the television station, adding that the charges carry up to 17 years behind bars, but federal sentencing guidelines are likely to call for a much shorter sentence.His sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 16, shortly after the 2024 US presidential election set to be held on Nov. 5.Hunter Biden was convicted of three felony gun charges in a separate case in June. His conviction is related to purchasing a firearm in 2018 while addicted to crack cocaine, which is the first time in US history that a sitting president's child has been convicted of a crime.Some 1,600 years ago, long before modern globalization, a vibrant cultural melting pot existed in a region of Northeast China known as "Dragon City" — present-day Chaoyang in Liaoning province.People from different corners of the Asian continent converged on the region from the years 337 to 436.The fascinating details are part of an exhibition at the China Institute Gallery in New York City titled Gold from Dragon City: Masterpieces of Three Yan from Liaoning, 337-436, which opened on Thursday.The story of the civilization established by the nomadic Murong Xianbei people is being presented in the United States for the first time.Among the artifacts on display are glass cups, inkstones and tiger-shaped vessels from Han Chinese culture. There are long swords used by the Xianbei people.Jointly organized by the China Institute Gallery and the Liaoning Provincial Museum, the exhibition illustrates the history of ethnic integration and cultural exchange along the Silk Road, which transformed North China.Gold from Dragon City, which will run through Jan 5, 2025, also features treasures from nearly 70 years of archaeological excavations in China, including sculptures, bronze mirrors, imperial seals, equestrian objects, ceramics and jewelry, many made of gold."Gold holds the greatest significance and value in Chinese culture. Within the broader historical framework of diversity and inclusiveness in Chinese culture, the Three Yan civilization is also an important and valuable part," Liu Ning, deputy director of Liaoning Provincial Museum, told China Daily."This extraordinary exhibition illustrates the remarkable achievements of the Three Yan civilization, which is now no longer lost to history," said Willow Weilan Hai, director and chief curator of China Institute Gallery. "We have gained a deeper understanding of how ethnic integration and the cultural exchange of East and West inspired and enriched cultures along the Silk Road."Upon entering the gallery, viewers will first see two sculptures of the heads of men who are not Han Chinese, with high nose bridges and deep-set eyes. Hai explained that the entrance highlights the diversity of the society then in that region."To understand the globalization that occurred in the ancient world, you see that it's not that different from what's happening today. What's important is how understanding different people and their cultures — where they came from — helps us communicate better," Hai told China Daily.The highlight of the exhibition — a series of golden headdress ornaments worn by the Murong Xianbei people — features shimmering, swaying leaves, known as buyao, which literally means "swaying with steps".Described by Hai as "an Asian fashion of the time", the metal leaf design came from Western Asia and was introduced to North China through the Silk Road. Over time, the design became a key feature of the Three Yan culture.Revolutionary inventionAlso featured are the earliest known stirrups in human history, a revolutionary invention that transformed cavalry and warfare.With the stirrups, early warriors were able to free both hands for combat. Made from finely crafted mulberry wood and gilt bronze, the stirrups are considered masterpieces of gilded craftsmanship of the Northern Yan during the Sixteen Kingdoms period (304-439)."It was the Chinese invention of the stirrup that made Western medieval knights possible and gave us the age of chivalry," historian Robert Temple wrote in his book The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention.On Oct 19, an international symposium, "Along the Steppe-Silk Road: Studies on Mysterious Nomad Murong Xianbei", will be held at the China Institute Gallery.SACRAMENTO, the United States - As summer draws to a close, cities across the western United States are still reeling from unprecedented heatwaves that have shattered long-standing temperature records and pushed communities to their limits.From Phoenix, Arizona, to Las Vegas, Nevada, to Death Valley in California, the relentless heat has challenged daily life, strained infrastructure, and raised alarm bells about the intensifying impacts of climate change.With the high temperature exceeding 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 degrees Celsius) at Phoenix Sky Harbor Wednesday afternoon, the number of days showing 110 degrees Fahrenheit or above for the year ties last year's record at 55 days, said the National Weather Service (NWS) Phoenix in a social media post on Wednesday."Expect a new record to be set tomorrow," said the agency on Wednesday, while forecasting that temperatures over the next three days will be "well above normal".On Tuesday, Phoenix residents marked a grim milestone as the city endured its 100th consecutive day of temperatures reaching at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).According to local media, this streak has far surpassed the previous record of 76 days set in 1993. "The streak is expected to continue, with no end currently in sight," the agency said.The extreme temperatures have taken a deadly toll, and in Arizona's Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, public health officials reported 150 confirmed heat-related deaths as of Aug 24, with another 443 under investigation. Last year, the county recorded 645 heat-related deaths.Las Vegas also experienced its hottest summer on record.The city's average daily high temperature for June, July, and August reached a scorching 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius), surpassing the previous record set in 1940. On July 7, Las Vegas hit an all-time high of 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 degrees Celsius).The heat has been particularly deadly in Nevada's Clark county, which includes Las Vegas. Officials have confirmed 181 heat-related deaths so far this year, with the actual toll likely much higher due to ongoing investigations.Death Valley National Park, known for its extreme temperatures, recorded the hottest month ever measured on Earth in July, with an average temperature of 108.5 degrees Fahrenheit (42.5 degrees Celsius). The park reached at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 degrees Celsius) on 37 days during this summer.As September begins, there seems to be little relief in sight. The NWS Climate Prediction Center forecasts a 60-percent to 70-percent chance of above-normal temperatures for Las Vegas through at least mid-month.High temperatures are expected this week across the western United States, with excessive heat warnings issued for parts of southern California, Arizona, and Nevada, where temperatures are expected to peak from Wednesday through the weekend.In Los Angeles, temperatures could approach 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius), with inland areas potentially reaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 degrees Celsius) or higher this week. Palm Springs and other desert cities in California are bracing for multiple days of temperatures exceeding 43.3 degrees Celsius.Scientists attributed these extreme heatwaves to human-caused climate change, which elevates the risk of dangerously high temperatures across the globe.The US West has been hit hard by an unprecedented heat wave this year, with the prolonged heat straining energy grids, disrupting daily routines, and posing significant challenges for vulnerable populations.In cities like Las Vegas and Los Angeles, cooling centers have been opened to provide refuge for those without air conditioning, particularly the homeless. Residents are advised to drink plenty of water and limit their time outdoors, especially during the afternoons. Local authorities also urged residents to check on neighbors, especially seniors and at-risk individuals during the heat wave.The extreme temperatures heightened wildfire risks across the region as well. Oregon has seen more than 6,000 square kilometers burned by mid-August, the most of any state this year. California has been battling the park fire, the fourth-largest wildfire in state history, since mid-July.From the vast, fertile fields of Iowa and Illinois and several other farming states, US farmers used 30 million hectares of farmland to generate more than 48 million metric tons of soybean exports last year, worth $27.8 billion worldwide, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA.The US is behind Brazil, second in the world in soybean production, creating 29 percent of the total global output, according to the USDA. China ranks fourth. The No 1 soybean export market for the US is China, which, in 2023 bought $15.06 billion worth of the versatile bean.In the run-up to the 2024 US general election, the $124 billion soybean industry, which accounts for 0.6 percent of the country's GDP, is closely watching any talk on trade policies by both presidential candidates, Vice-President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, especially on tariffs.Harris hasn't revealed whether she will enact any new trade tariffs or keep the existing ones in place as President Joe Biden has done.The Biden administration has kept most of his predecessor's levies in place, and in May, raised some others on an additional $18 billion in Chinese imports, such as electric vehicles and semiconductors.Trump proposed earlier this year a new set of trade tariffs of 10 percent across the board on foreign goods and 60 percent on goods from China if he wins reelection in November.Soybean farmers are worried that any new tariffs could spark another trade war and further strain relations between the world's two largest economies.Josh Gackle, a third-generation farmer from Kulm, North Dakota, is president of the American Soybean Association. He farms 1,130 hectares of soybeans along with corn, wheat and barley."China is a very important trading partner, and we want to try and keep that happening," Gackle told China Daily. "On new tariffs, free trade is probably always better."In 2018, the Trump administration enacted import tariffs ranging between 10 percent and 50 percent on approximately $283 billion of US imports. As a countermeasure, China imposed a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of US goods in 2018, including pork and soybeans. This cost US agricultural producers around $27 billion in lost export revenue from 2018 to 2019, the USDA found. Around 95 percent was due to the trade war with China.US farmers were given $61 billion worth of bailouts to offset the losses after US agricultural exports fell dramatically between 2018 and 2020, the Financial Times reported.By 2019, a trade agreement was reached between the US and China steadying the industry.Gackle said the trade war had "a big impact on US soybean producers, but we came back in phase one, and the administration and China worked together to try and build back some of that trade relationship and it happened".In a study about why tariffs hurt working people in the US by the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, or PIIE, the authors Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely argue that tariffs could actually end up stinging US families, farmers and exporters the most."Economists have long understood that tariffs burden domestic purchasers of imported goods because imports are the difference between domestic demand and domestic supply, a tariff affects both sides of the market," according to the study.'Real distress'Lovely is a professor emeritus of economics at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs of Syracuse University and a senior fellow of PIIE. She told China Daily: "During the 2017 to 2018 trade war, agriculture was negatively affected by China's retaliatory tariffs. Former president Trump used tariff revenues to compensate farmers hurt by retaliation because the damage was big enough to cause real distress in some areas of the US."The 60 percent tariffs on Chinese goods proposed by Trump could increase household costs by $1,950, the conservative-leaning American Action Forum estimated.The PIIE study also warned that import tariffs risk a loss of business as trade partners like China set up new contracts with other countries.The billion-dollar US soybean industry relies on 500,000 people employed in some capacity, with total wages in the sector averaging $10 billion, according to a 2023 study called The Economic Impact of the US Soybeans and End Products on the US Economy, by the National Oilseed Processors Association and the United Soybean Board.After the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, producers are weary of anything that could destabilize things.The US Soybean Export Council, or USSEC, represents the entire soy supply chain, including farmers, processors, commodity shippers, merchandisers, allied agribusinesses and agricultural organizations. It works to attain market access for the use of US soy for human consumption, aquaculture and livestock feed in more than 80 countries worldwide."China is so big, they take 60 percent of the soy that goes into global trade," Jim Sutter, CEO of USSEC, told China Daily. "They're a huge market. If you don't have them, it's a problem."We went through a lot of pain as a soy industry and as a country in the last trade war. Let's learn from that."belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.com John Podesta, senior advisor to the United States president for international climate policy, will visit China from Wednesday to Friday, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced on Tuesday.During the visit, Podesta and Liu Zhenmin, China's special envoy for climate change, will co-chair the second meeting of the two countries' working group on enhancing climate action in the 2020s, as agreed by the two countries, the ministry said in a media release.It was highlighted that the two sides will engage in thorough discussions regarding practical cooperation within the Sino-US working group, domestic climate policy initiatives in each country, and the multilateral climate change process.China and US reached a consensus to establish the working group during the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, aka COP26, in Glasgow, United Kingdom, in 2021.According to a joint declaration of the two countries released during the conference, the two sides will meet regularly to address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade.WASHINGTON -- Four people were fatally shot on a commuter train in the Chicago area early Monday, and it appears the victims were attacked while sleeping in their seats, police reported Monday afternoon.According to the Forest Park Police Department, a review of security footage showed that the victims seemed to be asleep, seated separately, and did not resist the attack. The shooting occurred in two separate train cars.A suspect has been taken into custody, and a weapon was recovered. The motive is still unknown.Forest Park is a village in Cook County, Illinois, and a suburb of Chicago.Also on Labor Day, five people were shot in the afternoon when a suspect discharged a weapon into a crowd along the New York Caribbean Carnival parade route, according to police. Two people were critically wounded.In Nashville, Tennessee, six people were hurt during a shooting at a bar parking lot early Monday morning.Over 380 mass shootings have occurred in the United States in 2024 so far, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more victims are shot or killed.CARACAS - Venezuela on Monday denounced Washington's seizure of a plane used by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as part of a "repeated criminal practice".The United States has seized the plane in the Dominican Republic, claiming that its acquisition violated US sanctions."Venezuela denounces to the international community that once again, the authorities of the United States of America, in a repeated criminal practice that cannot be classified as anything other than piracy, have illegally confiscated an aircraft that has been used by the President of the Republic, justifying themselves on the coercive measures (sanctions) that they unilaterally and illegally impose around the world," Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil said on Telegram.Venezuela made it clear that "it reserves the right to take any legal action to repair this damage to the nation, as well as all other damage caused by the criminal policy of unilateral coercive measures," Gil added.In February, the United States seized a plane belonging to Venezuelan airline Emtrasur Cargo that landed in Argentina in June 2022 and was then detained for an alleged investigation.WASHINGTON -- The United States has seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's airplane in the Dominican Republic, citing sanctions laws, the Justice Department announced Monday."This morning, the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolás Maduro and his cronies," said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland."The Department will continue to pursue those who violate our sanctions and export controls to prevent them from using American resources to undermine the national security of the United States," said the attorney general.The aircraft, which is a Dassault Falcon 900EX, was seized in the Dominican Republic and transferred to the Southern District of Florida at the request of the United States "based on violations of US export control and sanctions laws", according to the statement.This incident, which came a little over a month after Maduro's re-election, represents the latest chapter in the longstanding tense relations between the United States and Venezuela.The United States has been pursuing a policy of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation against the Maduro government in support of opposition leaders.An Executive Order issued in August 2019 prohibits US persons from engaging in transactions "with persons who have acted or purported to act directly or indirectly for or on behalf of, the Government of Venezuela", according to the Justice Department statement.In March 2020, the Justice Department indicted Maduro and his aides on narco-terrorism charges, accusing Maduro and other Venezuelan officials of conspiring "with the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), causing tons of cocaine to enter and devastate American communities".Meanwhile, the US State Department offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Maduro.Also on Monday, Venezuela ordered the arrest of presidential candidate Edmundo González, who is accused of crimes including forging a public document, incitement to disobedience of laws, conspiracy and sabotage, according to a report by Bloomberg.US manufacturers, businesses and retailers are stockpiling some imported products and parts, especially those from China, because of uncertainty over tariffs heading into the US presidential election in November.Between June and July, the peak season for retailers to build inventory for the holiday season, the volume of ocean shipments to the United States from China increased by more than 4 percent over last year, according to a report by Project44, a company that provides a digital supply chain platform for businesses.The analysis suggests retailers are somewhat nervous over the tariff policy.US President Joe Biden announced in May an increase in tariffs on more than $18 billion worth of goods from China. The duties were scheduled to start on Aug 1 but have been delayed until this month.Manufacturers have asked for the higher tariffs to be reduced, delayed or abandoned, Reuters reported.Biden raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100 percent, and on semiconductors and solar cells to 50 percent. A 25 percent tariff was put on lithium-ion batteries and cranes, while steel, aluminum and solar cells imports will also cost more.Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has not said if she will keep the existing tariffs in place if she wins in November.Charles Lutvak, a spokesperson for the Harris-Tim Walz campaign, told The New York Times that she will "employ targeted and strategic tariffs to support American workers, strengthen our economy and hold our adversaries accountable".Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has floated the idea of tariffs of 60 percent or higher on imports from China. In 2018, the Trump administration enacted tariffs between 10 percent and 50 percent on $283 billion of goods from China.China responded with tariffs of its own. A trade agreement was reached in 2019, but Biden has kept the tariffs in place and also extended them.Trump said tariffs will bring back US jobs. "We are going to have 10 to 20 percent tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years," he said in a speech in North Carolina on Aug 14.Mary Lovely, a professor emeritus of economics at Syracuse University, told China Daily, "Tariffs may create jobs in directly protected sectors, but they cause job loss in sectors that use imported intermediate and capital goods."Businesses are also aware of potential strikes at East Coast and Gulf Coast ports this fall that could affect imported goods before November, the National Retail Federation found.Most recent imports into the US arrived at ports on the West Coast rather than the East Coast as the contract between the International Longshoremen's Association and the US Maritime Alliance covering East Coast and Gulf Coast ports is due to expire on Sept 30. A breakdown in negotiations could cause strikes, the NRF said.The Port of Long Beach in California has seen a 5 percent year-on-year increase in imports and has handled 22 percent of the peak season volume so far this year, Project44 found.The California ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Oakland and Seattle-Tacoma in Washington state received more than 44 percent of all imports in June and July. The ports of New York, Baltimore and Savannah, Georgia, saw a drop.Ben Hackett, founder of Hackett Associates, a consultancy for the maritime industry, said in a statement, "Importers are continuing to grow their inventories and are shifting cargo to the West Coast as a precaution against potential labor disruptions."Freight rates are rising, too.The ports of New York and New Jersey have ordered eight cranes from China's ZPMC, costing $18 million each. A 25 percent tariff — as proposed by Biden — could push up the price by $4.5 million.Production shiftBoth the Biden administration and former Trump administration have said tariffs create more production jobs in the US and lessen the country's reliance on Chinese imports. However, some production has shifted to Mexico, Vietnam and India.Lovely, who is also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, added, "In some sectors, tariffs create no new jobs in the US, as trade is diverted to third countries rather than inducing new domestic production."Other challenges include tensions in the Red Sea region, which have caused delays and rerouting from the important global shipping route.And a drought in Central America made water levels fall in the Panama Canal, affecting shipments on that route.Jonathan Gold, vice-president for supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, told China Daily, "Retailers are consistently working to mitigate any risk to the supply chain to ensure cargo arrives in a timely manner."Monthly inbound cargo volume at major US container ports last month was expected to see a record surge, according to the NRF's port tracker. Most of the goods will likely come from China.Agencies contributed to this story.belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.comThe 22nd Washington Chinese Culture Festival began on Saturday, fostering new opportunities for diverse cultures to connect and learn from each other.The crowd often erupted in cheers during the lion dance performances, particularly when Anaje Kilpatrick, an African American, performed. Many attendees were surprised to see a non-Chinese person participating in the traditional dance.Kilpatrick has been practicing Chinese kung fu for six years. "I started with tai chi. Then I joined Wong People at the Chinese Cultural Center in Chinatown, where I began learning kung fu. Since lion dance incorporates many kung fu stances, that's how I got into it, and I love it," Kilpatrick told China Daily.Meanwhile, as China seeks to boost foreign tourism, the southwestern province of Guizhou is taking it one step further by participating in Saturday's event to promote its tourismAt the festival, Nafisa Rustan, a volunteer at Guizhou's ethnic groups workshop, told China Daily: "We are showing the different minorities of Guizhou. There's Miao (people), and there's Dong (people).And there's all the drawings and the figurines, and they all represent one of the 17 minorities in Guizhou."Rustan, who is also from an ethnic group, expressed her enthusiasm: "I just like learning about other minorities ... And I think it's also really awesome sharing the culture of the Chinese."Five workshops at the event showcased Guizhou's rich cultural heritage, including traditional batik, ethnic clothing and a photo exhibition of its scenic beauty."The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive," volunteer Zou Ying told China Daily. "Everyone is saying that if they visit China, they must go to Guizhou."Attendee Nicole He shared her surprise at seeing Guizhou's traditional batik art in person."I had seen a documentary about Guizhou's batik on TV, but I never expected to encounter it here. The colors in batik aren't always easy to get right on the first try. You need to understand the process and work on it for a long time. These materials are rare, so I was amazed to see them here in DC," she told China Daily.The most common feedback from visitors about the Guizhou workshops was that they were "very unique", volunteer Maggie Wu told China Daily. The opportunity to witness authentic culture brought to Washington had many foreign guests excited, Wu said.It was a great platform for showcasing Chinese culture, she said.LOS ANGELES -- Four people, including the suspect, were dead, with another two getting injured in a shooting Saturday night in Honolulu county in the US state of Hawaii, authorities said on Sunday.Shortly after 11:15 pm Saturday local time (0915 GMT on Sunday), police officers responded to a residence in the Waianae Valley area, according to the Honolulu Police Department.Multiple 911 calls coming from the Waianae residence reported that their neighbor was operating a front loader and using it to ram multiple cars into the home. Multiple individuals were in the carport and fled or tried to flee when the suspect opened fire, striking the victims, said the department in a press release, adding that at some point, a 42-year-old male resident of the home fatally shot the suspect with a handgun.The resident who shot the suspect has been arrested for murder in the second degree, according to the press release."Three individuals, including the suspect, were pronounced dead at the scene. Additional people were taken to the hospital," said the department earlier in a Facebook post.Hours later, the department confirmed in an update that one of the wounded died at a hospital and the other two remain hospitalized.Honolulu police held a news conference on Sunday to discuss the incident. "There have been several incidents in the previous months and weeks, but this incident is not related to those. This incident happened as a result of neighbors," Honolulu Police Chief Joe Logan was quoted as saying by local news outlet HawaiiNewsNow, adding that the shooting "is not a random act, but a targeted one".Waianae Valley area is located on the west coast of the island of Oahu, which is home to the state capital, Honolulu.The shooting is the latest in a spate of violent crimes in West Oahu.Local residents said they are "frustrated and fed up about the recent string of violence that's causing chaos in the community" after multiple shootings and homicides -- many involving teens, reported local KITV television station weeks ago, adding that "the recent tragedies are forcing state leaders to get involved, increasing law enforcement here".As China expands its visa policies to attract foreign visitors and foster people-to-people exchanges, a Chinese culture festival kicked off in Washington on Saturday, providing an opportunity to learn more about Chinese culture and connect with the local community."The Chinese culture is deep in the heart of every Chinese, and we are glad to see it attracting more and more American friends with its inspiration and charm," Xie Feng, China's ambassador to the United States, said at the opening ceremony of the event."What belongs to a nation also belongs to the world. Culture is a bond of heart and emotion, transcending time and space. It connects China with the rest of the world."The 22nd Washington Chinese Culture Festival is now an annual event, a "friendship rendezvous" between the Chinese and US people, Xie said. Without the need to travel afar, US friends can have a taste of Chinese culture and its cuisine, he said."For kids, a must do is, of course, taking a picture with the giant panda mascot. On my way here, I met several American friends who traveled from various states for this festival. I could see their curiosity about Chinese culture, its history and profoundness."Regarding Chinese pop culture, Xie highlighted a Chinese AAA game that has gained widespread popularity, Black Myth: Wukong, based on the classic novel Journey to the West.The game's success is attributed to three key elements: the appealing character of Wukong, the timeless charm of Chinese culture and the "universal human desire for communication, cooperation and mutual learning", he said.Xie said he noticed that many players are drawn to the Chinese version for its "authentic voice acting", and some are even inspired to explore the original novel or visit locations featured in the game."After a journey to the West in the video game, why not take a journey to the East through travel in China? With open arms, China welcomes friends from across the world," he said, emphasizing a new rule that allows travelers from 54 countries, including the US, to have a 72-hour or 144-hour visa-free transit.US President Joe Biden sent a letter to the event and said "events like these represent America at its best"."By encouraging us to reflect on the ways our country's character has been shaped by the Chinese American community, you remind us of the importance of honoring and celebrating our roots no matter where they are," Biden said in his letter.The festival came on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US. Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, said that since the establishment of ties, "we have experienced peace and prosperity throughout all of Asia"."Perhaps most importantly, effective ties and constant diplomacy have led to an unprecedented half-century of peace in the Asia-Pacific region, and this is not something we should take for granted," he said.Positive dialogue and interaction is seen as necessary between the US and China on finance, trade and economics, instead of resorting to tariffs, said one observer."Such dialogue leads to positive trade interactions. It increases the potential for foreign-owned businesses in both nations. It carries with it the potential for good jobs for thousands of people," Anthony Moretti, department head and an associate professor of the Communication and Organizational Leadership Department at Robert Morris University in Pennsylvania, said to China Daily.Moretti referred to the US-China dialogue of the Financial Working Group (FWG) held in Shanghai Aug 15-16."There exist two parallel tracks when you think of the US and China. The political track is filled with all kinds of negativity from the US," he said. "Whether it be tariffs, other forms of sanctions, dubious legislative items, or the daily negative rhetoric, not much in the way of positive news comes out of that," Moretti said."But the business community understands how essential it is for the US and China to find ways to keep as many doors open as possible and to ensure that optimistic dialogue exists," he said."Together, we account for some 40 percent of global banking assets, and we are the home authority to 12 of the world's 30 global systemically important banks," Nicholas Tabor, assistant secretary for international financial markets at the US Department of the Treasury, said in a speech in June."The domestic financial stability of the US and China has significant implications for global financial stability, and our policies have an outsized effect on how financial risks evolve globally," he said."Working directly with our Chinese counterparts can help advance many of Treasury's priorities, including our financial stability objective, our climate goals, and the effectiveness of our global efforts to combat money laundering and illicit finance," Tabor said.He said the process of establishing channels of communication has progressed, but "much remains to be done".Moretti said that green technology is good for China, the US and the world, so it is meaningful to make efforts to "assist companies — large or small, new or enjoying a long history — that create products that are cost-effective and good for the environment"."No matter how much the politicians criticize China, they know that cooperation in areas such as pandemic research, overcoming food insecurity, and creating good-for-the-climate products brings positive results when China and the US are working together," he said.US President Joe Biden has touted green initiatives but also announced new tariffs on Chinese imports, including on products such as electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, amid US officials' accusations about Chinese manufacturing "overcapacity" and their concerns about "national security"."If you say you believe in something, then demonstrate a real commitment to it," Moretti said, adding that the tariffs imposed by the Biden administration on Chinese EVs "make no sense"."Washington wants a healthier climate, and yet it is deliberately blocking cars that are affordable, of good quality, and good for the globe from US consumers. It defies common sense to preach a message of being climate-friendly and then slam the door on one such opportunity," he said."The West is ready to criticize whatever it is that China does," he said."If the US showed a commitment to long-term strategic thinking, as China has when it comes to the most modern technologies, then it would enjoy strong market share for such products," he said. "They did not. So the criticism of China for doing so is weak."Moretti said hat more governors and mayors are leading business delegations to China."Those local and state leaders understand that American jobs created by Chinese-based companies are as good as those from US-based companies. That is another example of win-win cooperation. We need to see more of that."For Harmon Barlow, executive director of the Kentucky Dairy Development Council, his participation in the Fourth Annual US-China Agriculture Roundtable in multiple cities in China in June "was nothing like what I was kind of expecting"."I had a lot of preconceived ideas about what to expect," he told the audience on Thursday at an online event to share his experiences. "There were times I was a little bit even apprehensive about making the trip. But it turned out to be a great experience."According to Min Fan, executive director of the US Heartland China Association (USHCA), which organized the roundtable with several Chinese agencies, the delegation visited universities, farms and agricultural-experiment stations in China. They enjoyed talking with their counterparts and also sightseeing."We had a wonderful, enlightened trip," Fan said.Barlow has been to Europe, South America and Africa and knows well the international dairy markets, including China's. The trip, his first to China, opened his eyes to other facets of the country."And China, it's amazing how they have developed their own industry in the dairy world and are using much less exports than they ever have before," Barlow said.He was amazed to see the work ethic in China."Everybody is working, everybody has something to do," he said. "There's no waste."One thing he noticed is how land is used in China. "When we were on those bullet trains, and you looked across, you saw every inch of available land was in food production. I thought that was fascinating."Barlow was also struck by other aspects of China. "I found it was obviously the cleanest and probably safest place I've ever been," he said.He said it was "fascinating" to see "practically zero obesity" in China, and "the citizens were very healthy and weren't facing a lot of the issues that is really epidemic in our country today with obesity and things like that".The trip led Barlow to realize that it is important to keep the dialogue going: "It's better to talk than to yell at each other and go through what the TVs say."For Olga Bolden-Tiller, dean of agriculture at Tuskegee University, it was also her first time in China."I think what was most enlightening for me was the conversation around how the US can partner with China to really address global food security and do so from an educational standpoint," she said."I like the model that China has with a few other organizations where they are partnering with developing countries to do work on the ground in China to really uplift a lot of their producers and some of the agricultural practices," Bolden-Tiller said.Lou Swanson, professor emeritus from Colorado State University, said he enjoyed the aspect of global citizenship from the trip. "At Colorado State University, we really think that people-to-people, student-to-student, faculty-to-faculty relationships are the core for having any kind of global citizenship," said Swanson."What this trip did — and I've taken many delegations of students and faculty to China over the years — is the people-to-people dimension."Swanson said that trade and cultural exchanges are important to avoid misunderstandings that can lead to conflict. Trips like this help people "to understand the importance, but also the precariousness, of not attending to this global citizenship", he said.LOS ANGELES - A heat wave brought record-high temperatures to US Midwest states this week, with more than 60 million people included in alerts over the conditions.A late-season high-pressure system over cities in the Midwest regions such as Chicago, Des Moines and Topeka has left them experiencing rare "extreme heat" for a long period of time, according to the US National Weather Service (NWS).Chicago is in the center of an excessive heat warning that stretches north to Madison, Wisconsin, and south to Springfield, Illinois.The dangerous late August heat wave will expand over the Midwest early this week before building into the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast by mid-week, according to the NWS Weather Prediction Center."Heat indices of 105-115 and lows in the mid/upper 70s will bring a heightened risk of heat-related illness," NWS posted.The NWS warned the public of the combined dangers of heat and humidity associated with heat waves.US midwest states have set up several public cooling centers in preparation for the dangerous heat. The extreme heat prompted early dismissals and canceled classes for several school districts across the US Upper Midwest and Northeast.A new research published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that heat-related deaths in the United States rose 117 percent between 1999 and 2023.The study examined trends in heat-related mortality rates in the US population from 1999 to 2023, and found a total of 21,518 deaths were recorded as heat-related underlying or contributing cause of death during those years in the country."As temperatures continue to rise because of climate change, the recent increasing trend is likely to continue," the researchers wrote. "Local authorities in high-risk areas should consider investing in the expansion of access to hydration centers and public cooling centers or other buildings with air conditioning."Extreme heat together with humidity is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States. Approximately 1,220 people in the country are killed by extreme heat every year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The frequency and intensity of extreme heat and heat waves will continue to rise in the 21st century because of climate change, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Extended periods of high day and nighttime temperature conditions create cumulative stress on the human body, increasing the risk of illness and death from heat exposure. Heatwaves can acutely impact large populations for short periods of time, often trigger public health emergencies, and result in excess mortality and cascading socioeconomic impacts. They can also cause loss of health service delivery capacity, when power shortages accompany heatwaves and disrupt health facilities, transport and water infrastructure, according to WHO.China has made major technological advancements in the energy storage and electric vehicle sectors, and US companies could be at a disadvantage if US policies preclude them from cooperating strategically with Chinese companies, an expert said.In an online discussion about cooperation between the United States and China on climate change, Joanna Lewis, director of the Science, Technology and International Affairs Program at Georgetown University, said the two countries need to expand cooperation.The event on Tuesday was presented by the Center for American Progress.Lewis said political and economic tensions between the US and China are high, and that "is exactly when engagement on climate change is of the utmost importance" to avoid "derailing all the progress that we've made in our engagement with China" over the last 30-plus years.She said US engagement with China on climate change and clean energy has helped to build up China's own capacity to track and reduce its emissions, as well as its ability to promote "a low-carbon energy transition"."And today, we see that China has leapfrogged many other countries in these areas, and our bilateral exchanges have become much more of a two-way street," Lewis said. "I also see that engagement has led to increased ambition, transparency and trust between our two countries."She said US President Joe Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, which she said moved the US in the right direction of making clean energy industries more competitive globally, "may have gone too far in terms of completely excluding Chinese entities from participating in the US clean energy sector"."I think there has to be a conversation about our respective roles in global clean energy supply chains without just letting it devolve into a global trade war that will slow the low-carbon transition globally," she said.Lewis visited China this summer for the first time since the pandemic, meeting with Chinese officials and touring China's new clean energy manufacturing facilities. She said she witnessed how China is leading the world in some aspects of green technologies.She said there are ways that are smart and protect national security, but also allow "us to leapfrog and take advantage of a lot of the real impressive innovation that we're seeing coming out of China", Lewis said.She said the US should also have conversations with China on tough issues such as trade and research or it could risk derailing cooperation on climate change."We need to hit that head-on. I think it's silly to make engagement on basic science a political issue," Lewis said.Aug 22 marked the 120th anniversary of the birth of Deng Xiaoping, the late Chinese leader widely regarded as a pioneer of China's economic reforms. But his legacy extends far beyond China's borders.Deng's historic visit to the United States in 1979 stands out as a pivotal moment that reshaped China-US relations and set the stage for decades of collaboration between the two countries.In January 1979, just weeks after China and the US formally established diplomatic relations, Deng embarked on a groundbreaking visit. At that time, Deng was the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the US since 1949, so the trip carried enormous symbolic and practical significance."Deng's 1979 trip was extremely successful as he charismatically wooed Congress, the media and the American people," said the US Department of State's Office of the Historian, which has included Deng's visit in the "Milestones in the History of US Foreign Relations".Deng, then vice-premier of China and a pragmatic reformer, arrived in the US with clear objectives."Deng fully understood the importance of a conducive international environment for China's modernization, and the United States held the key for regional and global stability," said Zhu Zhiqun, a professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania."The purpose of the visit was to present to the United States a new and reforming China in the post-Mao era and to seek US support for China's modernization," he told China Daily.While high-level meetings were a key part of the agenda, the Chinese leader visited Atlanta, Houston and Seattle. In Atlanta, Deng toured the headquarters of Coca-Cola, signaling China's openness to US business. His visit to Boeing in Seattle underscored an interest in aviation technology.Perhaps most memorably, Deng donned a cowboy hat at a rodeo near Houston, creating an iconic image that humanized the Chinese leader for many people in the US. The famous photograph of Deng in a cowboy hat, which appeared in newspapers across the country, became a symbol of China's willingness to engage with the West."The visit was quite successful. The cities he went to were carefully chosen to highlight the goal of his visit," Zhu said. "During his visits to Coca-Cola and Boeing, Deng extended invitations to the US business community and welcomed them to invest in China."Ezra Vogel, the late socialist and renowned scholar on modern China, highlighted in his book Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China how Deng's visit fostered long-term US-China ties through business-oriented agreements and networking."American businesspeople who had heard Deng speak in the various cities immediately began to prepare for trips to China to explore business opportunities. Many of the 17 governors who met him in Atlanta planned delegations to China with local businesspeople," Vogel wrote.The then US secretaries of commerce, agriculture and energy also prepared to lead delegations in the months ahead to expand relations in their respective areas, Vogel said. "Members of Congress, even many who had complained about China in the past, vied to join these and other trips to China," he said.By visiting NASA and other institutions, Deng also helped establish the link between the scientific communities and encouraged scientific cooperation between the two countries, Zhu said.Deng's visit yielded immediate tangible results. On Jan 31, 1979, China signed a science and technology agreement with the US to accelerate scientific exchanges. That laid the foundation for extensive research cooperation that would benefit both countries and the rest of the world in the years to come.The 1980s, following Deng's visit, was a "golden period" or "honeymoon" in US-China relations, with "intensive cooperation between the two countries and growing US investment in China", Zhu said.The era saw rapid growth in trade, cultural exchanges and diplomatic cooperation. US companies began to view China as a promising market and manufacturing base, while Chinese students and researchers gained access to cutting-edge knowledge and technology in US institutions.The fundamental shift toward engagement and cooperation that Deng's visit represented has remained a significant factor in China-US relations, even as the relationship has experienced ups and downs over the decades.Despite the challenges, the importance of China-US cooperation in addressing global issues remains clear. As Deng himself stated during his visit, "Amicable cooperation between two major countries, situated on opposite shores of the Pacific, is undoubtedly an important factor working for peace in this area and in the world as a whole."Universities and colleges across the United States have revised their codes of conduct for students as they reopen in the wake of nationwide protests on campuses over the Palestine-Israel conflict.Officials at Columbia University in New York, where the protests began earlier this year with an encampment on the campus, said changes, updates and revisions to rules are in the works, but the university has not yet released all the details.New rule changes are also being implemented by the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California, the University of Denver, Indiana University and Harvard University, among others.University and college presidents and administrators have issued the stricter guidelines ahead of the one-year anniversary of Hamas' Oct 7 attack in Israel, in which more than 1,100 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage, according to Israel's Foreign Ministry.The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Wednesday at least 40,534 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory assault.Many educational institutions spent the summer talking to lawyers and staff members and revising their policies. Some now require undergraduates to attend classes on free speech, antisemitism and hatred. Most schools have not been explicit about the consequences students face if they break the rules.Kendall Easley, a spokeswoman for Columbia University, told China Daily, "University leadership takes its responsibility for the safety and well-being of the entire university community seriously", and over the summer, the university had "learned lessons" and was planning for the next academic year.She added that they "seek to strengthen the skills and training in de-escalation techniques, expand the ability to manage a range of incidents while taking into account that Columbia does not have its own police force, as many other institutions have, and potentially reducing our reliance on the New York Police Department".Katrina Armstrong, who was named Columbia's interim president after Minouche Shafik resigned on Aug 14, said in a letter that security changes will be released soon to provide guidance. The newly created Office of Institutional Equity will handle any complaints of discrimination.The school's new term starts on Sept 3. Over the summer, Columbia students organized courthouse demonstrations to support those facing criminal charges from the protests.Of the 40 students arrested or disciplined when the university called police to the campus on April 18, only two remain suspended, according to a US congressional panel, Reuters reported.Of the 80 students arrested between April 29 and May 1, only five face interim suspension without access to the campus.Activism to go onMahmoud Khalil, a student negotiator for the main protest movement, Columbia University's Apartheid Divest, said students "will continue their activism and actions until Columbia divests from Israeli apartheid".Amid the rule changes, the American Association of University Professors said colleges have "hastily enacted overly restrictive policies", arguing they "impose severe limits on speech and assembly that discourage or shut down freedom of expression".The updated guidelines for students come after three Ivy League presidents resigned over their disastrous congressional hearings on antisemitism on campus, where they were roundly criticized by Republican lawmakers. Two others also left their posts.The University of Pennsylvania, whose president, Liz Magill, resigned in December, installed temporary standards that require students to get approval two weeks before holding any event in a public space and banned encampments and demonstrations.At the University of Denver, any encampments are banned, while Indiana University students must gain permission before they hang signs from buildings and flagpoles. Protesters are not allowed to use semipermanent or permanent paint, markers or stickers on lampposts and signs.Michael Drake, president of the University of California, asked chancellors at all 10 campuses to strictly enforce rules against protests and encampments.Agencies contributed to this story.China's ambassador to the United States said that "China's journey of reform and opening-up will never stop", which means "opportunity, opportunity and opportunity" for the US and the world.Ambassador Xie Feng also said that "cooperation is the only right choice" for China and the US."Not long ago, the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its third plenary session, which made systematic planning for further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization," Xie said."A new milestone in China's reform and opening-up, the meeting is also a gateway for the world to understand China," Xie said in the keynote speech via video at the sixth US-China Business Forum held by Forbes China on Tuesday in New York."It will both shape China's future trajectory and influence the world in a significant way," he said.Xie said that with greater depth of reform will come new opportunities for growth; with higher-standard opening-up will come new market opportunities; and with higher-quality development will come new opportunities for cooperation.He said that in the first half of this year, China's GDP grew 5 percent compared with last year, outperforming many other major economies. "This shows its resilience.""Opening-up is a defining feature of Chinese modernization," Xie said, and China is aiming "to make the pie bigger and the list of cooperation longer, so as to deliver win-win outcomes for all", which means "we will open up more doors" and "we will break down more barriers".Xie said that high-quality development is the "primary task" in building China into a modern socialist country.The newly launched Chinese video game Black Myth: Wukong is an example, he said, saying it "has recently become a global hit"."Within just one hour of its launch, its concurrent player count hit 1 million, and its collaboration merch quickly sold out," he said. "So you can see the huge consumption potential in the debut economy and also the magic of integrating traditional culture with modern technology."More than 120 people attended the forum, including US-China Business Council President Craig Allen; National Committee on US-China Relations President Stephen Orlins; the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, Sean Stein; and Hu Wei, the chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce.In his remarks, Xie also said that "scapegoating solves no problem, and trade war, industrial war or tech war produces no winner" when there are new circumstances and challenges."A major inspiration we can get from China-US relations over the past 45 years is that when we work together, both countries and peoples will fare well; but when we turn against each other, both sides and the world will suffer. Cooperation is the only right choice," he said.Xie said that China and the US need to "both expand cooperation in traditional areas including economy, trade and agriculture, and nurture cooperation in new areas such as climate change and AI, so that both our countries and the world will come out as winners".He said that "there is simply no reason" why the China-US relationship should be a zero-sum game."Tesla's Gigafactory Shanghai can now produce more than 950,000 vehicles per year, and its megapack factory there is nearly half complete just three months after construction started. Apple is ramping up its investment in China, expanding its applied research center in Shanghai and opening a new lab in Shenzhen," Xie said. "All these are evidence of the vigor of China-US business cooperation.""Our two countries can help each other succeed in a race to the top, and both develop ourselves and prosper together on this vast planet," Xie said.The ambassador noted that President Xi Jinping outlined three principles for the bilateral relationship: mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation."We are ready to work with the United States in that spirit, enhance dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, and expand mutually beneficial cooperation, so as to stabilize and improve the relationship and take it forward," Xie concluded.Over recent months, a seemingly surprising trend has emerged on the global financial landscape — foreign investors are flocking to Chinese renminbi bonds, even as US bonds boast higher yields.As of July, overseas institutions' holdings in China's interbank bond market had risen for 11 consecutive months, an increase in foreign holdings of as much as 1.28 trillion yuan ($179.78 billion), according to data from the Shanghai head office of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank.At first glance, the inflow looks counterintuitive — why would investors opt for lower-yielding bonds? As of late August, the 10-year US Treasury bonds still yielded around 1.67 percentage points more than their Chinese counterparts, according to market tracker Wind Info.The answer, analysts suggest, partially lies in the anticipated interest rate cuts by the United States.The US Federal Reserve is expected to lower rates from the current 5.25 to 5.5 percent range, to avoid a recession. With China's monetary policy to remain stable, the renminbi is poised to rebound against the dollar. This has set the stage for profitable exchange rate plays, with the possibilities of investors converting dollars to renminbi, investing in Chinese bonds, and locking in a profit by selling renminbi forward at a higher rate.From October 2023 to January 2024, Chinese bonds yielded 107 basis points higher on average than US bond yields of the same maturity after taking into account foreign exchange hedging, according to calculations by BOC International.Resilience of assetsA more fundamental reason for the inflow, financial experts from home and abroad said, is something beyond technical trading strategies — the growing appeal of renminbi-denominated assets among international investors, a trend that has withstood the headwinds of US rate hikes.Since the US Fed started a drastic rate hike cycle in March 2022 to combat inflation, foreign holdings in China's interbank bond market have risen. They reached 470 billion yuan as of July, with the 1.28-trillion-yuan inflow since September last year surpassing the outflow of 810 billion yuan between March 2022 and August 2023, according to the PBOC's Shanghai head office.The allure of renminbi-denominated assets has been underpinned by a global shift away from over-reliance on the US dollar, China's expansive economic ties, and the country's ongoing financial opening-up, the experts said.These factors, they said, will continue to help the renminbi's ascent as an international currency, strengthening its reserve, payment, financing and pricing functions, and offering a win-win for the global economy."Demand for diversification of reserves away from the US dollar remains strong globally, driven by geopolitical, economic and financial dynamics," said Massimiliano Castelli, head of strategy for official institutions at UBS Asset Management."We believe the dollar is and will remain for the foreseeable future the main store of value for global investors, including reserve managers. However, currency diversification is set to continue in the future as the world gradually moves toward a multipolar system."The renminbi looks set to continue its steady rise in global foreign exchange reserves, in particular if it is supported by an improvement in the Chinese economy, the ongoing rise in the use of the renminbi in cross-border payments and the more widespread use of the digital yuan," said Castelli.Zhu Min, former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said, "The world sees that a dominant US dollar is not necessarily a good thing for the whole world, because US monetary policy and fiscal policy may have a big impact on the dollar's value and capital movements.""Having a more balanced force against the dollar is good for the whole world. So I think the renminbi will continue to internationalize to serve that role, not only for China, but for the whole world, and particularly for international financial architecture," Zhu said.The world's pursuit of alternative international currencies to the greenback, including the renminbi, has accelerated after the US froze the Russian central bank's foreign exchange reserves and removed several Russian financial institutions from the Swift messaging system in 2022, in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.'Shaky' greenbackZhang Ming, deputy director of the Institute of Finance and Banking, which is part of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the "weaponization" of the dollar has presented an important opportunity for renminbi internationalization.Many countries have realized that it is dangerous to rely solely on the greenback, said Zhang, who is also deputy director of the National Institution for Finance and Development.In July, the renminbi's share in global payments, measured by value, hit a record 4.74 percent, Swift data showed. It remained the fourth most active currency for global payments by value for the ninth consecutive month.The Chinese currency was the second-largest global currency in the trade finance market for the second consecutive month, with a market share of 6 percent in July.As the world has sought systems other than Swift, the Cross-border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS, which specializes in renminbi cross-border payment and clearing, has grown in popularity. In July, two direct and six indirect participants were added to CIPS. By the end of July, there were 150 direct participants and 1,401 indirect participants in the system.An increasing number of economies are also experimenting with central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, in cross-border payments, which can not only bypass the Swift system, but enjoy a faster settlement speed than the traditional agent bank system, as a third party intermediary is no longer required.Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia joined Project mBridge, a cross-border platform for experimenting with CBDCs — including the digital yuan — for international trade, as the sixth full participant.Project mBridge resulted from collaboration starting in 2021 between the Bank for International Settlements' innovation arm, the Bank of Thailand, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, the Digital Currency Institute of the PBOC, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.Global, domestic challengesGeopolitical dynamics, however, can be a double-edged sword, experts said, with The Wall Street Journal reporting in April that the US was drafting sanctions that threaten to cut some Chinese banks off from the global financial system.A survey by UBS Asset Management of 40 central banks, which manage about half of the global foreign exchange reserves, showed that 47 percent of them believed that US-China tensions had not yet affected the internationalization trend of the renminbi. Thirty-nine percent said it had slowed it down and 14 percent said the tensions had accelerated the trend.Zhang, from CASS, identified the US' suppression of China as a key challenge facing the renminbi's internationalization. This is in addition to domestic challenges such as economic growth slowing, the yields of financial products declining, and domestic financial risks becoming more apparent.While ramping up efforts to boost economic growth, China can further internationalize the renminbi through three main tasks, Zhang said. They are: improving the currency's function in commodity pricing, providing more high-quality renminbi financial assets to overseas investors via both onshore and offshore markets, and stepping up the development of CIPS.He said: "Since the PBOC began promoting renminbi internationalization in 2009, it has made significant progress over the past 15 years — the renminbi now holds about a 5 percent share in international transactions and 2 to 3 percent in global reserves. The area that remains relatively weak is pricing."To further strengthen the renminbi's pricing function, China — as a major buyer and seller of commodities — can promote renminbi pricing in the trade of commodities such as iron ore, copper and natural gas, Zhang said. He cited the example of Shanghai's launch of an international crude oil futures market denominated in renminbi in 2018, which has grown rapidly into the third largest of its kind in the world.The resolution adopted at the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in July said that efforts should be made to steadily and prudently advance the internationalization of the renminbi and develop offshore renminbi markets.It also said the country would push forward the development of a homegrown, controllable cross-border payment system and make steady progress in the R&D and application of the digital renminbi.Zhang said CIPS would serve as a "backup option" for China and the world, particularly if geopolitical conflicts continue to escalate and the US imposes further financial sanctions. "Not only China, but also the European Union, India and Saudi Arabia are looking for new payment and settlement systems. We are providing these countries with a second or third option as well," he said.Attracting participantsEfforts are needed to boost the number of banks directly participating in CIPS. The more direct participants there are, the stronger the network will become and the faster payment and settlement will be, Zhang said.Project mBridge may assume greater importance going forward as an alternative and more efficient option for global payment and settlement, he added.Xiong Aizong, a senior research fellow at CASS' Institute of World Economics and Politics, said there is room for development concerning offshore renminbi clearing, which can increase the cross-border trade and use of the yuan."Last year, renminbi clearing banks or arrangements were established in Brazil, Pakistan, Serbia, Cambodia and other economies, which greatly promoted the use of renminbi by enterprises and financial institutions in these economies for cross-border transactions," Xiong said.Deepening high-level financial opening-up to expand the channels for foreign investment in renminbi assets is also key to internationalizing the currency, he said. The Bond Connect program launched in 2017, the improved qualified foreign institutional investor mechanisms, and the Swap Connect market access scheme launched last year, have all added to the currency's appeal to international investors, Xiong added.Pan Gongsheng, governor of the PBOC, said in an interview with People's Daily in August that the central bank will promote renminbi internationalization by adhering to market-driven and voluntary principles, continue to improve cross-border renminbi policies, optimize the global layout of renminbi clearing banks, and promote the healthy development of the offshore renminbi markets.In line with Pan's remarks, the PBOC in August inked a memorandum of understanding with Vietnam's central bank for bilateral local currency swaps, which can facilitate cross-border trade and investment in the renminbi. By the end of 2023, the PBOC had entered into agreements with over 40 central banks for bilateral local currency swaps totaling 4.16 trillion yuan.Pan added that the central bank will keep the renminbi exchange rate generally stable at a reasonable, balanced level.Huang Yiping, dean of Peking University's National School of Development, said China should also consider providing commercialized investments, low-cost funding and government aid to developing economies to help them bridge the funding gap in achieving a green transition.Such a scheme would be comparable to the US-sponsored Marshall Plan to rebuild post-World War II Europe, but with a focus on green development. The scheme would be a "win-win" as it would facilitate the global pursuit of carbon neutrality, while helping bolster China's new energy exports and promoting the internationalization of both Chinese financial institutions and the renminbi, Huang said.Li Zitong contributed to this story.Contact the writers at zhoulanxv@chinadaily.com.cn NEW YORK -- Production at an electric vehicle battery cell plant jointly run by General Motors and Samsung SDI has been delayed as EV sales have slowed in the United States, reported The Associated Press (AP) on Wednesday.The companies finalized their agreement on Tuesday to jointly run the new factory in New Carlisle, Indiana, near South Bend, but said production would not start until 2027, according to the report. Previously the plant was expected to start making cells in 2026.The delay will be less than a year, due to market conditions and working out contract details, GM said. Construction of the factory is already under way."Electric vehicle sales in the US are still growing but have slowed as more practical consumers worry about range and the ability to recharge while traveling," said AP. "Market leader Tesla Inc. has cut prices, forcing others to follow."US electric vehicle sales overall rose about 7 percent during the first half of the year to 599,134, according to Motorintelligence.com. EVs accounted for 7.6 percent of the US new vehicle market, about the same as it was for all of last year. Lease deals, which include federal tax credits, helped to boost sales.WASHINGTON - US Special Counsel Jack Smith on Tuesday filed a new indictment in the federal criminal case against former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, following a Supreme Court decision that granted Trump sweeping immunity from prosecution for his "official" conduct as president.The new indictment dropped certain specific allegations against Trump but retains the same four criminal charges, including conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding.The indictment accused the former president of orchestrating a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election and disenfranchise millions of voters, a plan that allegedly led to a series of violent attacks on police at the US Capitol on Jan 6, 2021.The defendant used his campaign to "repeat and widely disseminate" false claims of election fraud, "to make his knowingly false claims appear legitimate, create an intense of national atmosphere of mistrust and anger, and erode public faith in the administration of the election," the court filing showed.Trump has repeatedly denied all charges. Trump's lawyers have argued that the former president's words and actions on and before Jan 6, 2021 amounted to legitimate inquiry about possible election fraud.Trump's team previously dismissed the indictment based on presidential immunity, arguing that a president has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution.On July 1, the US Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, ruled that Trump is immune for actions taken in his "official" capacity as president. The court also directed the lower courts to reassess the case and determine which allegations cannot be prosecuted."In an apparent bid to downplay any connection between Trump's conduct and his official duties, the new charging document repeatedly emphasizes the political and personal nature of many of the actions Trump took during the post-election period and on Jan 6, 2021," according to a report by Politico.Despite the latest efforts, it's unlikely that this case will go to trial before the Nov 5 presidential election. If Trump wins, he could instruct his appointees at the Justice Department to dismiss the case. The recent massive downward revision of jobs created in the United States in a one-year period prompted political reaction and also raised questions on whether the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates.The US government reported on Aug 21 that the economy created 818,000 fewer jobs from April 2023 through March 2024. It was the largest revision to federal jobs data in 15 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).The revision represented a total downward change of about 0.5 percent, meaning that  monthly job gains during the period averaged roughly 174,000, compared with the previously reported figure of 242,000.If the number remains in place through a final revision in February, it would be the largest downward revision since the 902,000 downgrade to employment in March 2009."What you're seeing is an echo of the large (pandemic-era) shocks that we're just working our way through," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, The Washington Post reported. "We're trying to ascertain the size of the labor force and its flows."The Biden administration has maintained that the job market is still robust in the United States, with unemployment from April 2023 through March 2024 averaging under 4 percent."This preliminary estimate doesn't change the fact that the jobs recovery has been and remains historically strong, delivering solid job and wage gains, strong consumer spending, and record small business creation," Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement.Biden has often mentioned jobs creation in his public comments and did so again in his speech on Aug 19 at the Democratic National Convention. He said that he had helped create "a record 16 million new jobs".Former US president Donald Trump, however, the 2024 Republican presidential candidate, seized on the revised BLS number at a campaign rally in North Carolina on Aug 21.He accused his Democratic opponent in the November election, Vice-President Kamala Harris, and Biden of "fraudulently manipulating job statistics to hide the true extent of the economic ruin that they've inflicted on America"."They said they existed and they never did exist," Trump said. "They built them up so that they could say what a wonderful job they're doing." Trump also unleashed repeated criticism of the revision that day on his Truth Social platform.Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican and the chair of the GOP-controlled House Budget Committee, said in an Aug 21 statement: "The economy is the top issue in this presidential race and the recent downwardly revised job numbers taken together with persistently high prices and interest rates (belies) a much weaker Biden-Harris economy than we were led to believe."The tax, spend, and regulate economic agenda of Biden-Harris has failed and no one knows that better than working Americans."The revision also could change the Fed's rate-cutting timetable."This is a noticeably larger than … normal revision ... it wouldn't be a stretch for the Fed to assume that recent job growth is also being overstated, strengthening its decision to shift attention from inflation toward the labor market," said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, Reuters reported."This doesn't challenge the idea we're still in an expansion, but it does signal we should expect monthly job growth to be more muted and put extra pressure on the Fed to cut rates,'' said Robert Frick, economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, to The Associated Press.Fed policymakers could consider a weaker job market as they mull future rate reductions after the initial cuts expected at their Sept 17-18 meeting.In July, payrolls were weaker than expected, eliciting talk that the Fed may have waited too long to begin cutting rates, as the unemployment rate rose to a post-pandemic high of 4.3 percent.The central bank has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25-5.50 percent range for more than a year, having raised it by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023 to tackle high inflation.The jobs-creation revision also generated responses on social media."This more than any other data has given the illusion of a strong economy this year, in stark contrast with other jobs data — e.g. household employment," posted economist Albert Edwards on X.Journalist John Carney wrote on X, "Contrary to what you might have heard from GOP officials, the revision to jobs numbers wasn't evidence of the BLS cooking the books." But he speculated that there was "a huge number of jobs created during the Biden administration" that went to people in the United States illegally.Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, defended the BLS in a series of posts on X on Aug 21."Is the Bureau of Labor Statistics a massive pro-Biden Admin shill? And are today's revisions to labor statistics evidence of (a) huge conspiracy to inflate the economic data? The answer is a declarative NO."She also wrote that she has "consistently been surprised and impressed by (BLS') professionalism, non-partisanship, and transparency. It is a pretty unique gem that accomplishes a great deal with modest funding, and helps us all make better-informed decisions."Pollak qualified her praise by saying she is someone who is "deeply skeptical of government, is shocked at how rampant corruption is in the US, and is by no means naive about the political leanings of most DC residents or govt employees".Agencies contributed to this story.Whether it's welcoming pandas back to San Diego or exploring the wilds of China for a Disney documentary, Paul Baribault has had good experiences working with the country.The most recent example was when Panda Ridge, home to giant pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, officially opened at the San Diego Zoo on Aug 8, in a much-anticipated return of the beloved giant pandas to the city after a five-year absence. It also marked the first arrival of pandas in the US in two decades.The milestone reflects the collaborative efforts between China and the United States, with Baribault, president and CEO of the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, or SDZWA, playing a pivotal role in the successful launch.In an interview with China Daily during the opening ceremony, Baribault highlighted the zoo's 30-year partnership with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, or CWCA, and the dual commitment to collaboration over the next decade."We are very proud of our relationship with CWCA. They have been incredible partners for the past 30 years and we eagerly anticipate what we will accomplish together in the next 10 years and beyond," Baribault said."My first experience working in China was in 2012, when I was with Disneynature. I worked on the nature film Born in China, where we had the opportunity to showcase the beauty of China and work with the China Wildlife Conservation Association during that time," Baribault recalled.Bringing the pandas back to San Diego was a challenge. It required hard work, meticulous planning and a healthy dose of optimism. Baribault led a dedicated task force from the SDZWA, assembling a team focused on identifying every potential obstacle.Together, they worked tirelessly to turn obstacles into opportunities, ultimately reaching their goal after a six-month sprint.Baribault, who has a bachelor's degree from Stanford University and an MBA from the University of Southern California, has a distinguished history as a leader in wildlife healthcare, conservation, science and education.His leadership since becoming SDZWA CEO in 2019 helped facilitate the return of the pandas and strengthened the zoo's ties with China."Giant pandas are emblematic of the collaborative efforts between China and the US in conservation. I hope this marks the beginning of a new era of continued global collaboration for the protection of ecosystems," Baribault said.He emphasized the unifying power of giant pandas in fostering collaboration."We are dedicated to saving wildlife worldwide by working with our Chinese partners, combining their skills with our expertise in wildlife care and conservation science," Baribault said.Before joining the SDZWA, Baribault had a significant impact on nature conservation through his work in the film industry, joining The Walt Disney Studios in 1997. He served as vice-president of animation marketing operations and strategy and general manager of the Disneynature film label, committed to continuing Walt Disney's legacy of conservation and fostering a deeper understanding of the natural world.Nature filmsWalt Disney's series True-Life Adventures began as an experiment with the documentary Seal Island (1948). The series went on to win eight Academy Awards, inspiring generations of nature filmmakers and conservationists.Under Baribault's stewardship, Disneynature films — Earth (2009), Oceans (2010), African Cats (2011), Chimpanzee (2012), Bears (2014), Monkey Kingdom (2015), and Born in China (2016) — produced seven of the top eight highest-grossing feature-length nature films in industry history.Born in China, a coproduction by Disneynature and Shanghai Media Group, took audiences on an epic journey into the wilds of China, exploring places where few have ventured.The film follows the stories of three animal families — giant pandas, golden monkeys and snow leopards — transporting viewers to some of the most extreme environments in China — from frigid mountains to the heart of bamboo forests — capturing some of the most intimate moments seen in a nature film.Based on the opening-week attendance in the US in April 2017, the film made a significant contribution to the World Wildlife Fund's efforts to protect wild pandas and snow leopards."Our filmmakers spent nearly three years battling tough terrain, freezing temperatures and the near-impossible task of finding snow leopards. China and its captivating wildlife left an incredible impression on all of us," said Baribault."When I joined the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in 2019, I made an early trip to China to underscore the importance of continuing our conservation projects together," he said.This year marks the 30th anniversary of the partnership between the CWCA and SDZWA.Si Ping, deputy secretary-general of the CWCA, who attended the opening ceremony for Panda Ridge in San Diego, stressed building an international exchange and cooperation platform that can support the conservation of the wild giant panda population in China and contribute to global biodiversity."One of the main priorities of this conservation project was not just to focus on breeding in our managed care facilities, both here and in China, but also to support access to the species in the wild and to help repopulate their natural habitats in China," she added.Productivity dropping and climate change are presenting significant challenges for the economic development in Latin America, according to a recent UN report.The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, or ECLAC, downgraded this year's regional growth forecast to 1.8 percent, significantly lower than its previous projection of 2.1 percent, indicating the challenges and potential risks the region faces.The ECLAC also reported a record-low growth rate of 0.9 percent last year, which is "lower than the 2.0 percent recorded in the 'lost decade' of the 1980s", it said. It attributed the slowdown to high inflation, limited room for monetary policy to have an effect, an uncertain economic environment and relatively low employment rates."The ECLAC report discusses some significant challenges," said Luis Ignacio Roman Morales, an economics professor at the Autonomous University of Nayarit in Mexico. "Not only are there productivity issues, but there are also implications from climate change. Export prices for Latin American products may also change too. As a result, the employment growth rate has been low."The report said Latin America and the Caribbean could face additional economic challenges because of weaker growth forecasts from its main trading partners.Export sectorSantiago Bustelo, who holds a PhD in international politics from Fudan University in China, said one of the keys to demonstrating successful development and economic growth is having a strong export sector.Asian countries such as China, Japan and South Korea "saw a big boost in growth that went hand in hand with building up a strong, competitive sector for exporting goods", Bustelo told China Daily.Chile and Israel, on the other hand, are examples of smaller countries with lower overall economic growth compared with China and South Korea, but which demonstrate highly competitive export sectors in industrial goods, commodities and technology, he said."South American countries can also develop strong export industries in these areas, which are fundamental for driving economic growth," he said.Despite the gloomy economic outlook, the ECLAC projected improved growth of 2.3 percent for Latin America and the Caribbean in 2025.Bustelo emphasized the need for targeted policies to develop strong export sectors."The development of an export sector through targeted policies, both industrial and technological, as well as complementary macroeconomic policies that encourage private sector investment, along with public investment, is critical to ensuring satisfactory economic performance and sustained high growth over the medium and long run," he said.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.LOS ANGELES - SpaceX is targeting Tuesday to launch a new mission featuring first-ever commercial spacewalk.Four civilians are set to launch on the mission, dubbed Polaris Dawn, which is scheduled to lift off at 3:38 am Eastern Time Tuesday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.This will be the first human spaceflight for the crew, consisting of Mission Pilot Kidd Poteet, Mission Specialist Sarah Gillis, and Mission Specialist and Medical Officer Anna Menon.During their multi-day mission to orbit, the crew and Dragon spacecraft will endeavor to reach the highest Earth orbit ever flown since the Apollo program and participate in the first-ever commercial spacewalk, according to SpaceX.They will also conduct 36 research studies and experiments from 31 partner institutions designed to advance both human health on Earth and during long-duration spaceflight, and test Starlink laser-based communications in space, according to SpaceX.NEW YORK - As the fall term gets underway at many US colleges, administrators are preparing for another possible surge in campus activism, reported USA Today on Monday, noting that the last school year ended acrimoniously as anti-war protests persisted on many school grounds, disrupting graduation ceremonies and jeopardizing some students' academic standing."Though on-campus demonstrations lulled this summer as students dispersed, the conditions that motivated the recent wave of activism haven't changed dramatically since the spring," said the report.While several high-profile college presidents have left their roles, many schools haven't substantively changed their investing strategies -- a demand made by the lion's share of protesters but a complicated ask in practice.International negotiations over a potential cease-fire in Gaza are tenuous. And members of Congress continue to see political opportunity in inserting themselves into the debate over how campuses should go about quelling unrest.As young activists prepare to ramp up the momentum again, harsher rules await them on some campuses. The punishments for anti-war protests have differed significantly across campuses, according to the report. SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple will unveil its iPhone 16 lineup on Sept 9, the company said on Monday.Apple is using the tagline "It's Glowtime" for the event, which will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park at 10:00 am Pacific Time.The phones are expected to support Apple's suite of AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, which were announced earlier this year.It's possible that the event could also include the unveiling of the Apple Watch Series 10, which is said to have a bigger screen and new chip, according to a report by TechCrunch.SAO PAULO - The Brazilian government announced Sunday that it is sending military aircraft to combat wildfires ravaging Brazil's southeastern state of Sao Paulo."We have asked the Defense Ministry to mobilize aircraft to combat the areas reached by the fire," said Waldez Goes, Minister of Integration and Regional Development.Goes attributed the fires to the "complicated climate emergency situation," adding that the Air Force is set to assist Sao Paulo in fighting the fires, including deploying a KC-390 cargo aircraft.The governor of Sao Paulo decreed a state of emergency in 45 municipalities on Sunday.The country's wealthiest and most populous state has been affected by a combination of high temperatures and low humidity. However, authorities suspect that some of the fires in sugar cane fields were caused by arson.On the bustling streets of San Francisco's Chinatown, campaign posters adorned with Chinese characters vie for attention alongside colorful shop signs and fruit stands. As the November elections draw near, candidates are intensifying their efforts to win over Chinese American voters, a crucial demographic in the city's political landscape.San Francisco has the highest percentage of Chinese Americans among major US cities, with 22 percent of its population identifying as such. When considering the broader Asian American community, the figure rises to 37 percent, according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau."The candidates, whether for mayor or supervisors, all hope to get Chinese American voters' support because we have become an important voting bloc that they could not afford to ignore," Louis Lam, chairman of the American Teo Chew Business Association and a board member of the Chinatown nonprofit Chinese Newcomers' Center, told China Daily.The current mayoral race exemplifies the heightened focus on Chinese American voters. Incumbent Mayor London Breed, facing a challenging reelection bid, has seen her approval rate shift dramatically among this demographic, which played an important role in her previous election.A poll conducted by the San Francisco Chronicle in February revealed that 80 percent of potential Asian voters disapprove of Breed's performance, and only 10 percent support her.Recognizing the need to regain favor with Chinese American voters, the mayor has taken actions such as increasing the police budget, granting law enforcement more authority, addressing homeless encampments, and even embarking on a trip to China.During her April visit to China, Breed signed an agreement to bring a pair of pandas to the San Francisco Zoo, a move that resonated strongly with Chinese American advocates. She also lobbied for the restoration of direct flights between China and San Francisco International Airport, which had been disrupted during the pandemic.Those efforts appear to be paying dividends. A recent Chronicle poll indicated that Breed's approval rating among Asian voters doubled over the past six months. The resurgence in support from the Asian and Chinese American communities has bolstered her standing in the mayoral race.However, Breed's challengers are not ceding ground in the battle for Chinese American votes.Former San Francisco supervisor Mark Farrell, one of Breed's main rivals, recently secured a crucial endorsement from the San Francisco Chinese American Democratic Club — an organization that had previously backed Breed in her last mayoral campaign.Farrell has been a frequent presence at community events in Chinatown, distributing Chinese-language flyers and engaging with potential voters. His campaign platform emphasizes cracking down on street homelessness and drug use, issues that resonate strongly with many Chinese American residents.Another prominent challenger, Daniel Lurie, founder of an anti-poverty nonprofit and heir to the Levi Strauss fortune, has taken a strategic approach to courting Chinese American voters.Lurie has hired a Chinese American campaign manager and enlisted Chinese American activists to bolster his outreach efforts. His campaign has been marked by personal interactions with Chinese American residents, visiting them in their homes and attending community banquets. Like his rivals, Lurie has prioritized addressing public safety concerns and combating drug use in his campaign promises.The race also features San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, who entered the contest later than his competitors but brings a strong base of support from Chinatown.As the longtime supervisor representing the district, Peskin has cultivated deep ties within the Chinese American community. His implementation of Cantonese-speaking workers during his tenure as board president has particularly endeared him to Chinatown residents.Supervisor Ahsha Safaí, another mayoral hopeful, is leveraging his existing relationships with the Chinese community to garner support. Safaí pointed to his track record of addressing issues important to Chinese American voters, such as securing funding for nonprofits supporting single-room occupancy units and sponsoring legislation to increase police foot patrols. Safaí also has hired a Chinese American campaign manager to strengthen ties with the city's Chinese community.The intense focus on Chinese American voters in this election cycle is no coincidence. Political consultant Jim Ross emphasized the critical nature of the demographic, saying to San Francisco news website Mission Local, "It will be very challenging for any candidate to win without getting the most votes from that coalition."The political engagement of San Francisco's Chinese American community has reached new heights, driven by several factors, said Lam, who attributed the surge to the community's increasing education levels and a growing awareness of their voting power."All the people I know have realized the importance of casting ballots. Even those who do not read or speak English, their children, who are well educated, can help them," he said.The successful recall elections in 2022, which replaced several progressive school board members in the city and the liberal district attorney Chesa Boudin, served as a watershed moment, demonstrating the community's ability to effect change through the ballot box, he said.Economic concerns and public safety issues remain at the forefront for many Chinese American voters. As Lam pointed out, a significant portion of the community consists of small- and medium-sized business owners or working-class individuals who are acutely affected by the city's economic challenges and crime rate."It's tragic that many businesses in Fisherman's Wharf remain closed, and an office tower downtown was sold nearly 80 percent less than the price about a decade ago," said Lam, adding that it was why he switched his support from Breed five years ago to Farrell and Lurie for the upcoming election.An increasing number of Chinese students and tech professionals are expressing their alarm on social media about being harassed in what they described as a "small dark room" at the secondary inspection areas of immigration and border authorities in the United States. (Video)The trend has sparked heightened concerns among international students about traveling to the US, in turn fueling calls for the US to halt the revocation of legally obtained visas and stemming the disruption to people-to-people exchanges.Chinese student Chen Guo (not his real name) began his journey to Boston, Massachusetts, in 2022 after he was accepted by Harvard Medical School. However, his academic dream quickly turned into a nightmare when, on arrival in the US city, he was subjected to an 18-hour secondary inspection by US Customs and Border Protection officers.Sharing his harrowing experience on Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu earlier this year, Chen described how the officers scrutinized his emails and online browsing history and chat records.The ordeal reached its climax when they discovered a screenshot of a news photo celebrating a successful Chinese satellite launch in his digital album. Despite his legally obtained visa, Chen's entry was denied and he was unceremoniously deported."They made me stand against a wall with a measuring scale for a photo; isn't that how criminals are photographed?" Chen said. "I never thought I would face such mental humiliation."Two weeks after Chen was deported, he received a collect parcel from the US, which charged him $50 in postal fees and contained his electronic devices seized by US Customs.A Chinese employee surnamed Liu, from an international Internet company specializing in short video services, shared a similar ordeal through his WeChat public account.Liu had thought he was on a routine business trip, departing from Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on March 14, 2023.He wrote in his WeChat social media account, "Life has become increasingly simple in middle age, and a single backpack is enough for a five-day business trip across continents."However, his experience at the border in Houston, Texas, shattered his relaxed and cheerful mood after getting off the plane.A CBP officer subjected him to the secondary inspection area at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Liu's electronic devices were seized and he was interrogated for over 10 hours."They asked me if I and my company were engaged in data theft, spreading sensitive information and connected to Chinese governments," Liu said.Liu's valid visa was eventually revoked despite his role in company logistics strategy, leading to his deportation from the US and a severe blow to his career. Liu later learned from a CBP officer that his sufferings arose because his name was similar to that of a Chinese scientist.The secondary inspection area is referred to as the "small dark room" on Chinese social media, although interviewees clarify it is not literally small or dark, but labeled so due to the harassment and oppressive atmosphere.More than 30 Chinese students from computer-related fields have been subjected to unwarranted harassment, scrutiny and deportation by US authorities, according to latest accounts.Most were graduate students whose research areas included artificial intelligence, information science, cybersecurity, electrical engineering, software engineering and electronic information engineering."When the students applied for their visas, the US side would have done the necessary security background checks. That is to say, they passed the security risk screening to get the visa," said Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University's Institute of International Studies and director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University."But now even if you get a visa, it is highly possible that you can be refused entry and deported when you enter the US, which is not reasonable."Shi Yinhong, director of the Center on American Studies at Renmin University of China, said that these "absurd incidents" have been on the rise amid the escalating "China threat" rhetoric, with the US increasingly viewing China as its main competitor.Shi said that the focus on "national security" signals a rise in protectionism and underscores US insecurity about advancements in science and technology.Wu from Fudan University said the political motivation behind the phenomenon is clear — it aims to control and restrict cultural exchanges between the two countries for "national security", directly leading to a decline in people-to-people interactions.Many online discussion forums have been organized through Chinese social media platforms to address the concerns, with students sharing their educational backgrounds and internship experiences and asking whether their academic credentials might affect their visa applications and entry."For students majoring in business and data at my university, will there be issues with visa approvals? I believe my major isn't sensitive, but I'm worried that pursuing this degree might be futile," asked one forum participant."Depends on your luck," replied another forum user.Chen, the student who was heading to Harvard Medical School, advised through his social media account that Chinese students from universities identified as "sensitive "by the US should consider refraining from pursuing studies or postdoctoral positions in the country.A student surnamed Chou who graduated in 2022 from the University of California, San Diego, said the US has long claimed to be a "lighthouse of openness and inclusiveness", but its actions "run into the opposite direction"."Compared to the risk of being inspected and deported during each trip to and from the US, it is a wiser choice to pursue higher education outside the US," Chou said."We have already witnessed a significant decrease in the number of Chinese students studying in the US over the past two years, and this downward trend is expected to persist," Fudan University's Wu said.According to the Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange, while China remains the largest source of international students in the US, the total number has dropped from 372,532 to 289,526 in the past four years. India surpassed China to become the largest source of international graduate students in 2023. The proportion of Chinese students in engineering fields is also decreasing annually.A source from an overseas study consultancy firm in Shanghai said that US visa rejection rates for doctoral students in high-tech fields are notably high. Even when they are not rejected, the students face rigorous scrutiny, prompting many to seek study opportunities in other countries like Britain, Singapore and Australia or at European universities.Experts said that under the pretext of safeguarding national security, US law enforcement authorities have overstretched the concept of national security and arbitrarily interrogated and repatriated Chinese students, which has caused a "chilling effect "and seriously affected the atmosphere of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries."The US attitude toward cultural and educational exchanges might be influenced by the US election and political situation," said Wu from Fudan University, adding that the US should act responsibly and be more open and inclusive in people-to-people exchanges.The Chinese e-commerce platform Dewu has emerged to shake up the global luxury goods market by offering steep discounts of up to 40 percent on luxury fashion goods and sneakers.Dewu, or its English name Poizon, was originally a platform for purchasing, reselling and discussing sneakers. But since 2018, it has sold branded clothing, handbags, watches, electronics and toys that are purchased worldwide.The platform has more than 160 million active users who often have new, legitimate goods from abroad such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Gucci to sell on the site. It is especially appealing to price-conscious Generation Z Chinese shoppers.Jeff Unze, former general manager of the San Francisco office of Dewu, was brought on to roll out the company in the United States. He has since left to work for the startup CrossTerra."They're the first Chinese company that is taking branded goods globally," Unze told China Daily. "Every other Chinese company has done fast fashion like Temu."The vast majority of Dewu's customers are in China, he said. "It has been downloaded 350 million times in China, so it is a pretty large platform and has monthly active users over 160 million."Founded in July 2015 by CEO Yang Bing, the company's headquarters is in Shanghai. By 2021, the site offered more than 100,000 new products every month and expanded into Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Japan, Europe and the Americas. Its move into the US is to gain new products and customers." (Dewu) can draw products from retailers, wholesalers, even people to people, just like eBay," Unze said. "They can get luxury or sneakers from everyone because they're doing such great work on the authentication side."Booming tradeThe success of the site is partly being attributed to it repurposing China's $81 billion daigou market, which was booming before the pandemic but was halted because of pandemic-era travel restrictions.Daigou translates to "buying on behalf of" and refers to individual business entrepreneurs who used to travel from China to the US, Japan or Europe to buy cheaper goods because of fluctuating exchange rates, then ship them back to China for sale.Dewu has captured nearly three-fourths of China's daigou sellers' trade, according to the publication Inside Retail.As it focuses on selling more luxury goods, the value of sales of Louis Vuitton on Dewu grew 11 percent year-on-year to 2.6 billion yuan ($365 million) in the first half of this year, the publication Business of Fashion reported.LVMH, the Paris-based owner of Louis Vuitton, is said to be watching the rise of the site closely as Dewu accounted for more than 14 percent of Louis Vuitton's total estimated sales in China of 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion) for the same period.Luxury goods from Hermes, Chanel, Dior and Prada have also seen higher sales year-on-year on Dewu.While most of Dewu's merchandise is purchased from the official luxury stores, the platform is chipping away at the fashion houses' profit margins.Its primary customer base is Gen Z and Alpha shoppers. Of the 264 million Gen Z population in China, 70 percent claim to have a Dewu account, said a report by consultancy firm Re-Hub, which helps luxury and premium brands in China generate online growth.Chinese Gen Z consumers "have a higher-than-average per capita disposable income and along with Gen Alpha are projected to increase their spending on luxury three times faster than other cohorts", Re-Hub said.Unze said the US expansion was to ensure it could get "a really steady supply of some of the new hot goods, things that just aren't last season and they want to source them globally to make sure they always have the full array of supply and they always have the best prices".CHICAGO — US Vice-President Kamala Harris officially accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention, or DNC, held at the United Center in Chicago on Thursday night."I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America," said Harris, 59, the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket in the country, in a speech on the DNC's fourth and final day."With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans."Harris reflected on her upbringing as a person of Indian and African descent and her experience working as a prosecutor in the Bay Area and as California's attorney general.In her speech, Harris said building the middle class would be a defining goal of her presidency, emphasizing her own middle-class roots. She elaborated on abortion rights, immigration policy and foreign policy, among other topics.She told the crowd she would bring together labor, small business owners and US companies to create jobs, and that she would endeavor "to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like healthcare and housing and groceries".Harris also blasted former president Donald Trump's actions and policies, describing the consequences of putting Trump back in the White House as "extremely serious"."We know what a second Trump term would look like," she said, saying he wanted to "pull our country back to the past".In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, lashed out at Harris' speech, saying that she stands for "incompetence" and "weakness".He gave a play-by-play on the speech, accusing Harris of making the US a "failing nation" as part of President Joe Biden's administration.Earlier on Thursday, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched near the DNC venue to express their dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's Israel policy.In her acceptance speech, Harris attempted to address the Israel-Palestine conflict."President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination," she said.On Aug 6, the DNC announced that Harris had been officially certified as the party's presidential nominee following a five-day online balloting process.On Wednesday night, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz officially accepted the party's vice-presidential nomination at the convention.Tight raceHarris has raised a record-breaking $500 million in a month and narrowed the gap or taken the lead against Trump in many opinion polls of battleground states. Nationwide, she leads Trump 46.6 percent to 43.8 percent, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight.As Democrats gather for the convention, Trump has been holding campaign rallies in multiple states this week, including key swing states Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona.The race between the two remains tight in key swing states that could decide the election results.According to the latest poll data compiled by RealClearPolitics, Harris leads Trump by 1 percentage point in Wisconsin and by 2 percentage points in Michigan.In Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Arizona, Harris trails by 0.2 percentage points, 0.9 percentage points and 0.2 percentage points, respectively.Xinhua - AgenciesA new study found that anti-Asian hate incidents in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic correlated to the degree of local economic and health disparities, and FBI data on such incidents were different from those reported by the news media.The study, called Roots of Racism: Examining the Conditions for Anti-Asian Hate During COVID-19, was initiated by The Asian American Foundation, or TAAF. It analyzed anti-Asian hate incidents, or AAHIs, using data from January 2020 to December 2021 from media data compiled by TAAF and law enforcement data documented by the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program.The study examined the relationship between social factors and anti-Asian hate, and found that there is no correlation between AAHIs and political party affiliation. Such incidents happened in counties of both Republican and Democratic strongholds.The data suggested that AAHIs were correlated to economic conditions. Counties with more income inequality, lower median household income and more free lunch recipients tended to have more AAHIs incidents. Conversely, counties with higher homeownership saw fewer AAHIs.Poor health was also connected to AAHIs. Counties with more drug overdose deaths and less sleep time saw a higher number of AAHIs.TAAF said such results were consistent with previous research that has found that income inequality is a strong predictor of neighborhood turmoil and violent crime in general.The study noticed some discrepancies between the two data sets: for the same period, the media reported 1,288 AAHIs, while the FBI recorded 1,087.At the local level, the discrepancy is large for some counties, data showed. In San Francisco, the media reported 113 AAHIs, while the FBI recorded 70.In its news release, TAAF said the discrepancies can be attributed to a variety of factors, including news coverage of incidents that may not legally be categorized as crimes, and victims choosing not to report incidents.TAAF said there is a need for improved measures to encourage reporting, whether to law enforcement or community-based support organizations, in order to accurately capture the full scope of anti-Asian hate incidents.Unwilling to reportTAAF's New York City Safety Study released earlier this year also found that Asian Americans who experienced a hate crime are less likely to report incidents to police (56 percent) than those who witnessed it (69 percent).The most common barriers to reporting were a reluctance to bring additional attention to themselves, not feeling comfortable dealing with law enforcement, or not knowing how to report."These findings clearly show that there's work to be done when it comes to both tracking and reporting anti-Asian hate incidents and addressing the factors that contribute to incidents in the first place," said Norman Chen, CEO of TAAF, in the release.Anti-Asian hate incidents continue to be an issue in the US. TAAF recently released its 2024 Social Tracking of Asian Americans in the US, or STAATUS, Index, an annual survey of people's attitudes toward Asian Americans.The survey showed that about one-third of Asian Americans were called a slur in the past year, and 61 percent of Asian Americans think that hatred toward them has increased in the past year.mayzhou@chinadailyusa.comCHICAGO - US Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday night officially accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) held at the United Center in Chicago."I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America," said Harris, the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket in the country, in a speech on the fourth and the final day of the DNC."With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a New Way Forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans," she said.Harris reflected on her upbringing as a person of Indian and African descent, and her experience working as a prosecutor in the Bay Area and as California's attorney general.In her speech, Harris said that building middle class will be a defining goal of her presidency, and that middle class is where she comes from. She elaborated on abortion rights, immigration policy, foreign policy, among other topics.The Democratic presidential nominee also blasted former President Donald Trump's actions and policies, describing that the consequences of putting Trump back in the White House as "extremely serious".In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, lashed out at Harris' speech, saying that she stands for "incompetence" and "weakness".Earlier on Thursday, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched near the DNC venue to express their dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's Israel policy.In her acceptance speech, Harris attempted to address the Israel-Palestine conflict."President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination," said the Democratic nominee.On Aug 6, the DNC announced that Harris had been officially certified as the party's presidential nominee following a five-day online balloting process.On Aug 20, she was once again confirmed as the party's presidential nominee during the DNC.In a positive sign for air travel between China and the United States, Hainan Airlines has announced the launch of a new route connecting Haikou, capital of South China's Hainan province, and Seattle, starting next month.The once-weekly round-trip flight will start on Sept 26 and include a stopover in Chongqing, in Southwest China.Flight HU445 will depart Haikou every Thursday. Both the outbound and inbound flights will include a stopover in Southwest China's Chongqing municipality.The outbound flight from China will depart Haikou Meilan International Airport at 7 am Beijing time, arriving in Chongqing at 9:10 am. It will leave the Chongqing airport at 11:20 am and arrive at Seattle Tacoma International Airport in Washington state at 9 am Seattle time. The flight time is expected to be 17 hours.The return flight will leave Seattle at 11 am local time, arriving in Chongqing at 4 pm Beijing time the next day. It will depart Chongqing at 6:30 pm and arrive at the Haikou airport at 8:45 pm, for an expected flight time of 18 hours and 45 minutes.Hainan Airlines has been flying to Seattle, but via Beijing.The new route will be the first from Haikou to the US operated by Hainan Airlines. It is expected to also support the development of the Hainan Free Trade Port.In recent years, Hainan has increased efforts to resume and launch international air routes. As of May, the province had 46 overseas passenger routes, with the number expected to reach 62 by the end of this year.The flight also could contribute to Haikou's efforts to attract international talent.In June, the city issued the "Announcement on the Recruitment of Urgently Needed Talents from Foreign College Graduates for Enterprises and Institutions in 2024".The initiative aims to recruit 342 talents from among international college graduates for enterprises and institutions.Of the positions, 19 are designated for public institutions, 10 for statutory institutions, 61 for State-owned enterprises, and 252 for enterprises within the city's key industry parks.Hainan Airlines, which was established in 1993, and its subsidiaries operated nearly 1,800 domestic and international routes as of 2023.In February 2024, Hainan Airlines was awarded the "One Star Flight Safety Diamond Award" by the Civil Aviation Administration of China for achieving 10 million consecutive hours of safe flight.US-China air travel, however, is still far below pre-pandemic levels and also has been slowed due to political tensions.The number of international flights by international airlines from North America and Europe to China is down more than 60 percent this summer from the 2018 peak of more than 13,000, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing data from industry tracker OAG.Chinese airlines, however, have reduced their flights on such routes by only 30 percent since their 2019 peak, the FT reported. And they are providing twice as many flights to those routes this summer as their Western counterparts are.The US Department of Transportation approved increased frequency for US-China flights in February, allowing Chinese passenger airlines to boost their weekly round-trip US flights to 50 from 35, as of March 2024. Still, that number is only one-third of pre-pandemic levels, airlinegeeks.com reported.CHICAGO - US Minnesota Governor Tim Walz officially accepted the Democratic Party's vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) held here on Wednesday night."It's the honor of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States," Walz said in a speech on the third day of the party's national convention scheduled for Aug 19 to 22.Walz, a former public school teacher, high school football coach, veteran, and six-term US House Representative, was elected governor of Minnesota in 2018 and re-elected in 2022.Former US President Bill Clinton, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries gave prime-time speeches. Influential talk show host Oprah Winfrey made a surprise appearance at the convention and delivered a powerful speech.On Tuesday night, former President Barack Obama, former First Lady Michelle Obama, and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff gave prime-time speeches.On the opening day of the DNC, both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and United Auto Workers President Sean Fain gave prime-time speeches. President Joe Biden, greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of delegates, closed the night of the first day by delivering a nearly hourlong keynote speech.On Monday, thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched near the venue to express their dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's Israel policy, with at least four being arrested after breaching a security fence although the vast majority of the demonstration proceeded peacefully.On Tuesday night, dozens of people were arrested after clashing with police during an unauthorized protest outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Chicago.Vice President Kamala Harris, who has already won enough delegates to become the Democratic presidential nominee in a virtual roll call vote earlier this month, is expected to officially accept the Democratic Party's presidential nomination on Thursday night.As Democrats gather for the convention, former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has been holding campaign rallies in multiple states this week, including key swing states Michigan and North Carolina.In the key swing states that could decide the results of the election, the race between the two remains tight. According to the latest poll data compiled by Real Clear Politics, Harris leads Trump by 1.0 percentage points in Wisconsin and by 2.0 percentage points in Michigan. In Pennsylvania, Harris trails by 0.2 percentage points.When it comes to selling electric vehicles, US automakers face not only consumer reluctance but rising competition from China in the international market.For example, the Ford Motor Co is adjusting its electric vehicle strategy due to softer-than-expected demand, and canceling and postponing the production of certain models. It also expects to take $1.9 billion in related charges and write-downs.Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said that China's EV companies have the advantage of a lower-cost supply chain and that Ford needs to find ways to lower its own costs to compete."We believe that the fitness of the Chinese in EVs will eventually wash over our entire industry in all regions," Farley told analysts last month.In China, retail sales of new energy vehicles nationwide reached 878,000 units in July, accounting for 51.1 percent of the total market, according to data released by the China Automobile Dealers Association.The electric vehicle market is rapidly evolving as Chinese competitors leverage advantaged cost structures such as vertical integration, low-cost engineering, multi-energy advanced battery technology and digital experiences to expand their global market share, Ford said in a statement released Wednesday.The Dearborn, Michigan-based company noted that today's electric vehicle consumers are more cost conscious than early adopters, viewing EVs as a practical way to save money on fuel and maintenance, as well as time, by charging the vehicles at home.That shift, combined with a flood of new EV options entering the market over the next 12 months, along with increasing compliance requirements, has amplified price pressures.Ford's EV business is on pace to lose about $5 billion this year. In the three-month period ended in June, the company lost approximately $44,000 on each electric vehicle sold.Ford said it will cut capital spending on EVs; it will now spend 30 percent of its annual capital budget to develop them rather than the current 40 percent.Not only is Ford facing competition from China, but its American competitor in the EV market, Tesla, also has lowered its prices.Executives have stated that the company is working to reduce losses on its current EV lineup while ensuring that future models are profitable.The company announced Wednesday that it would cancel plans for a three-row electric SUV due to high battery costs. Instead, the company will focus on producing those vehicles as gas-electric hybrids, with more details to be revealed at a future event.The changes will force Ford to write down $400 million of its current assets due to big electric SUVs, and it is also expected to have additional expenses of up to $1.5 billion."With pricing and margin compression, we've made the decision to adjust our product and technology roadmap and industrial footprint to meet our goal of reaching positive EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) within the first 12 months of launch for all new models," Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said in the statement.The company stated that it will focus on hybrids in areas where it holds a competitive advantage — such as commercial vans, midsize and large pickup trucks, and long-range SUVs.It plans to offer a variety of electrification options aimed at accelerating customer adoption, including lower prices and extended ranges.Sales of gas-electric hybrids in the US jumped 35.3 percent from January through June to 715,768, eclipsing electric vehicle sales, according to The Associated Press."These dynamics underscore the necessity of a globally competitive cost structure while being selective about customer and product segments to ensure profitable growth and capital efficiency," the company said.In May, the Biden administration imposed 100 percent tariffs on EVs made in China, which went into effect on Aug 1.Agencies contributed to this story.A new study found that anti-Asian hate incidents (AAHIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic correlated to the degree of local economic and health disparities, and the FBI data on such incidents were different from that reported by the news media.The study, called "Roots of Racism: Examining the Conditions for Anti-Asian Hate During COVID-19", was initiated by The Asian American Foundation (TAAF).

For example, For San Francisco, the media reported 113 AAHIs while the FBI recorded 70. In Kings County (Brooklyn), New York, the media reported 56 hate incidents while the FBI recorded none.There were reverse discrepancies, too. In Los Angeles, the FBI reported 90 incidents while the media reported 79. In Indiana County, Pennsylvania, the FBI reported 27 incidents while the media reported none.In its news release, TAAF said the discrepancies can be attributed to a variety of factors, including news coverage of incidents that may not legally be categorized as crimes, and victims choosing not to report incidents.TAAF said there is a need for improved measures to encourage reporting, whether to law enforcement or to community-based support organizations, in order to accurately capture the full scope of anti-Asian hate incidents.TAAF's New York City Safety Study released earlier this year also found that Asian Americans who experienced a hate crime are less likely to report incidents to police (56 percent) than those who witnessed (69 percent) it.The most common barriers to reporting were a reluctance to bring additional attention to themselves, not feeling comfortable dealing with law enforcement, or not knowing how to report.   "These findings clearly show that there's work to be done when it comes to both tracking and reporting anti-Asian hate incidents and addressing the factors that contribute to incidents in the first place," said Norman Chen, president and CEO of TAAF, in the release. Anti-Asian hate incidents continue to be an issue in the United States.

Raised by university dean Li Liren and his wife, Rong's life takes a dramatic turn when he solves a complex problem posed by his professor, Hayes.The remarkable achievement catches the attention of the enigmatic 701 Bureau, led by director Zheng, thrusting Rong into the clandestine world of code breaking.Directed by Chinese filmmaker Chen Sicheng, Decoded features a stellar ensemble cast, including Liu Haoran, John Cusack, Chen Daoming, Daniel Wu and Yu Feihong. This film marks Chen Sicheng's latest bold venture following the remarkable success of his Detective Chinatown series and Sheep Without a Shepherd.The story unfolds in the high-stakes world of espionage, loaded with suspense and tension.Through the art of decoding, the film portrays the relationship between mentor and protégé as a poetic and fateful duel, where each becomes both the cause and the effect of the other, according to Bohan Gong, senior manager of International Distribution Department at CMC Pictures."In addition to its compelling story, Decoded showcases breathtaking visuals, immersive soundscapes, and meticulous production design, pushing sensory boundaries," Gong said. "This film sets a new benchmark for Chinese filmmaking, offering a fresh, innovative approach to the industry."Audiences have praised the film's visual effects, sound design and emotional depth, expressing admiration for its cinematography, acting and international collaboration. They highlighted the impressive work of the crew and actors from both China and America.Andrzej Bartkowiak, a Hollywood cinematographer and film director, commended the film for its universal appeal."The film is truly international. It tackles important subjects, but at its core, it's about geniuses — and geniuses are universal. It's a story about two geniuses from different countries," Bartkowiak told China Daily. "The film was beautifully executed in every aspect — scope, lighting, directing, acting — it was flawless. I loved it.""This film is absolutely spectacular — beautifully crafted with not only great cinematography but also amazing effects and stunning fantasy elements. It's truly a work of art," said Charles Herzfeld, a production manager and writer.Digital artist Hari Tahov praised the film, calling the visual effects incredible. "What I loved most were the sound effects — they truly deepened the entire experience for me. The actor delivered an incredible performance; I could really feel his emotions, and the story's development was very touching," he said. "It was also a collaborative effort, involving actors and crew from two different countries — China and America."The movie will be released globally starting Thursday. The initial wave of screenings will take place in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, with additional regions to be announced soon.CHICAGO - The US Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates at its September meeting if economic data continues to come in as expected, according to minutes of the Fed's July 30-31 meeting released Wednesday."Almost all participants remarked that while the incoming data regarding inflation were encouraging, additional information was needed to provide greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward the Committee's 2 percent objective before it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate," said the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-setting body."Nevertheless, participants viewed the incoming data as enhancing their confidence that inflation was moving toward the Committee's objective," said the minutes. "The vast majority observed that, if the data continued to come in about as expected, it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting."Factors such as a continued waning of pricing power, moderating economic growth, and the runoff in excess household savings accumulated during the pandemic -- which had contributed to recent disinflation -- would likely continue to put downward pressure on inflation in coming months, the minutes said.Participants also noted that real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was solid in the first half of the year, though slower than the robust pace seen in the second half of last year.The Fed's latest minutes were released a few hours after the US Labor Department reported that monthly payroll data had overestimated job growth by approximately 818,000 over the 12 months ending in March, signaling a weaker labor market than previously reported.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group's FedWatch Tool, which acts as a barometer for the market's expectation of the Fed funds target rate, showed that the probability of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points at the September meeting is 62 percent as of Wednesday night.Editor's note: As Chinese companies move their operations to Mexico, they are not just sidestepping tariffs but also sparking a surge in local investment and job creation. China Daily looks at how international politics and economics are intertwining to drive significant shifts in manufacturing and trade.When you buy drinks from McDonald's, Wendy's, or Dunkin', the straws and cups you use are likely from a Chinese company, while the drinks are either produced in Mexico or the United States and are a product of a complex trilateral trade relationship.After former US president Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports and restricted Chinese investments starting in March 2018, the company making the cups, Fuling Plastics, began to face tariffs on many of its products.As a result, Fuling moved a factory to Indonesia. Around 2019, it also moved some production to Monterrey, Mexico. And then, Fuling opened a factory in Pennsylvania.Fuling Plastics is not the only Chinese company moving factories to North America amid rising US-China geopolitical tensions.Monterrey is the capital of Nuevo Leon, a state in Northern Mexico. Chinese corporations last year were responsible for more than 30 percent of the foreign investment in the state, second only to the US at 47 percent, The New York Times reported."A lot of our customers that are close to the border of Mexico can take advantage of competitive pricing and shorter lead times. Not only do we avoid the tariffs coming out of China, but customers within a reasonable distance of Monterrey can enjoy the same type of products manufactured in Mexico at a fairly competitive price," Tom Melchiorre, president of Direct Link USA, a joint venture of Fuling Plastics, told China Daily.The company currently has about 120 employees in Mexico operating out of a facility of 80,000 square feet (7,432 square meters), but soon it will expand to more than 200,000 square feet and about 400 employees. Only the management is from China, while all other employees are Mexican.The Ministry of Economy of Nuevo Leon reported that the state received $13 billion in investments from October 2021 to April 2023, creating 88,000 new jobs.The Mexican Ministry of Economy recorded 378 foreign direct investment announcements in 2023, worth $110.7 billion. The US led with $42.1 billion, followed by China with $11.2 billion.In 2022, China's direct investment in Mexico rose 48 percent year-on-year. Chinese companies now represent the fastest-growing source of foreign investment in Mexico.The trend of Chinese investment in Mexico started around 2019 and will likely continue as the US imposes more tariffs on Chinese products and industries.The increasing tariffs from the US have been imposed on items from China such as solar panels, electric vehicles and EV batteries, which have led to shipping costs rising about six times, Melchiorre said."When you're producing commodity products, and shipping costs rise that much, your product is now 15 to 20 percent higher. So, I think it becomes more and more attractive to manufacture in Mexico as we continue to face these challenges," Melchiorre said.Mexico's exports to the US last year surpassed China's for the first time in two decades, a development linked to the political tensions between China and the US. However, the trade relationship between China and the US is resilient, even under strained conditions.Researchers analyzed the evolution of the trilateral trade relationship between Mexico, the US and China from 1993 to 2020, and found that, in general, for every 1 percent increase in Mexico's exports to the US, Mexico's imports from China increased by 1.06 percent.Xuedong Liu, professor of economics and engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, noted that since 1993, about half of the US trade surplus with Mexico has been offset by a growing deficit with China, making Mexico a key assembly hub for North America, and China an influential player in the region's trade.Cost-effective goodsMexico chose Chinese products, not for political reasons, but for their high cost-effectiveness and the lack of substitutes from other countries, Liu told China Daily."The primary reason is that Mexico's local supply chain is not robust enough to meet all its needs. To increase exports to the US, Mexico must also increase its imports. These imports don't necessarily have to come from China; they could come from other countries," he said."However, Mexico ultimately chooses Chinese products due to their competitive pricing. This choice isn't driven by any specific policy or political measure but by market economics."Chinese products offer better value for money compared to those from other countries. If this weren't the case, local manufacturers in Mexico would opt for imports from countries like Vietnam, Indonesia or Brazil. However, these countries either lack competitive pricing or a complete supply chain for certain products," Liu added.The Joe Biden administration in July announced new tariffs on imports of Mexican steel containing Chinese components. The US will now impose a 25 percent tariff on such steel, the same rate imposed on steel from China. Previously, Mexican steel with Chinese components was exempt from duty."These tariffs that the United States put in place specifically to try to prevent metals that come from China from entering their country represent a risk for Mexican exports, because part of the exports are produced in China and not in Mexico, and in the short term, it is very unlikely that Mexico will be able to change that so those commodities are produced here," Ana Azuara, commodity markets specialist at Grupo Financiero Base, told BNamericas, an online source of daily business information and intelligence on Latin America.The tariffs were costly for Mexico, and to compensate for the economic toll, the US and Mexico agreed that steel imported from Brazil that is processed in Mexico and then exported to the US will not be subject to tariffs, Liu said."But Brazilian steel is not as cost-effective as Chinese steel. It is currently very difficult to estimate the potential economic impact on Mexico," he said."Unlike Vietnam and Malaysia, Mexico has a stronger industrial base (to manufacture its own products), especially after joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the predecessor to the USMCA, in 1994."USMCA is a free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada, which replaced NAFTA in 2018.Still, Mexico faces challenges with its supply chain, lacking intermediate and capital goods, which limits its export capacity. So, to increase exports, Mexico needs to increase imports, Liu said.Mexico is now importing more products from China which used to come from North America. In 2019, 17.7 percent of Mexico's imports in electronics such as mobile phones, auto parts and motor vehicles came from China, sectors where the US was traditionally the main supplier, according to Americas Quarterly, a nonprofit publication.Some believe that in the contest between the two major powers, the US and China, Mexico has not yet found a strategy to address the increasingly complex trilateral trade relationship. Caught between US-China trade dynamics, Mexico's relationship with China has become more politically complicated.In January 2023, the US, Mexico and Canada established a committee to substitute imports from Asia with products manufactured in North America.Before 2021, trade between China and Mexico was primarily driven by mutual benefit and market principles, Liu said.Since 2023, bilateral trade between China and Mexico "has not only been influenced by economic and market factors but also political ones", Liu said. He said that it is a new characteristic of the trade relationship.Mexico welcomes Chinese investment. In 2019, ahead of his visit to China, former Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said the country wants to deepen economic ties with China by increasing its exports and attracting more Chinese investment.Ebrard told reporters via a video link from the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in 2019 that he would be prioritizing the expansion of business ties during his visit to China."What we're interested in is increasing Mexico's presence in China, Mexico's capacity to export to China, and China's investments in Mexico," he said, according to Reuters."The structural reasons that are bringing capital to Mexico are here to stay," said Juan Carlos Baker Pineda, Mexico's former vice-minister for external trade. "I have no indication that the trade war between China and the US is going to diminish any time soon."While the Chinese origin of the capital coming into Mexico may be uncomfortable for the policies of some countries, according to international trade legislation, those products are, to all intents and purposes, Mexican," the BBC quoted him as saying.Citing examplesAn example of such products is Mexico's auto manufacturing industry. In 2023, Tesla announced plans to establish a factory in Mexico, which attracted a large number of suppliers to the country.Many of those suppliers were already producing components or raw materials for Tesla in China. The Chinese auto parts makers are rapidly setting up plants on the outskirts of Monterrey, where Tesla plans its manufacturing plant.While "Made in Mexico" is gaining ground in the North American market, Chinese companies still hold an advantage due to their stronger technical and supply chain foundations, experts said."Mexico now aims to strengthen local supply chains and increase production value, but this has been a long-standing issue. While China has invested heavily in technology and research over the past 50 years, Mexico has not, making it difficult to achieve these goals quickly," Liu said."Most of the companies going to Mexico are bringing skills that we don't currently have in Mexico," Jose Luis Enciso, business intelligence director for Keno Consulting in Beijing, told China Daily. "This will benefit us by introducing new skills and creating new suppliers. It will also benefit the Chinese investors because they will gain access to a new market and become more efficient."Meanwhile, it is not easy for Chinese companies, capital and technology to enter the Mexican market.Going to Mexico "has helped reduce lead times, which is an advantage for our customers, not having such a long lead time coming from China. You're cutting your lead time from 100 days to 30 days to two weeks. So, there are a lot of advantages to producing in Mexico," Melchiorre said.There also are some disadvantages. Resin, the raw material for Melchiorre's company's products, is more expensive in Mexico, he said. Compared with China, the cost of labor also is higher in Mexico. And shipping is very expensive, especially when the company produces and ships throughout North America."The further north we go, the more expensive and less competitive we are out of Mexico," Melchiorre said.Cultural differences are another issue for Chinese companies operating in Mexico. There are not many Latin Americans who speak Chinese, and not many Chinese who have Spanish skills and industry experience.That can lead to misunderstandings and make it difficult for companies to understand the local context, said Enciso, whose company provides consulting services for Chinese businesses entering Mexico.While Mexican companies are accustomed to working with European and US firms, integrating Chinese companies can be challenging. That is due to the need for local expertise in engineering, legal and accounting services, which also must align with the practices of Chinese companies, Enciso added.Enciso, who also served as minister counselor for trade affairs at Mexico's embassy in China, remains positive about the future development of economic and trade relations between the two countries."While we don't have a free trade agreement in place, Mexico and China have developed a very good economic and policy dialogue over the past 10 years," he said.The recent efforts to strengthen ties between China and Mexico involve multiple sectors.China Southern Airlines announced a direct route from Shenzhen to Mexico City in May, and Hainan Airlines resumed direct flights between Beijing and Tijuana and Mexico City in July.The connectivity is really going to help enhance people-to-people exchanges, Enciso said.Several major ocean carriers have opened new China-to-Mexico trade routes in recent months. At the government level, Mexican Tourism Secretary Miguel Torruco visited China in July, which led to support from both governments to continue strengthening bilateral relationships."Certainly, the global policy environment will continue to evolve, unfortunately, with more protectionist measures and security concerns. However, I believe it's only a matter of time until common ground is found to recognize the positive aspects of increasing trade and investment," Enciso said.In the world of beauty, Yue-Sai Kan has dedicated decades of her life to bridging understanding between China and the world through the blending of Eastern and Western cultures.Called "the most famous woman in China" by People magazine, Kan launched her new book, The Most Famous Woman in China and How She Did It, after this notable moniker. More than 200 people attended the book signing and panel discussion co-hosted by the China Institute in New York City on Aug 13."Everything I have done in my life has never been done by others, but I have always been focused on cultural exchanges between the East and the West, and I am committed to bridging understanding between China and the world," Kan said.She said the book, her first autobiography in English, is more than just a chronicle of her life. It also offers a lens into the evolving relationship between the East and West, as seen through her eyes.An Emmy-winning television host, producer, successful entrepreneur, fashion icon, bestselling author and philanthropist, Kan describes herself as a "pioneer "having been the first to break new ground on TV and in the cosmetics industry, influenced by her childhood experiences and pursuit of beauty.Born in Guilin in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and raised in Hong Kong, Kan received little pampering from her parents.Caught speeding up the clock to shorten her piano practice as a little girl, Kan faced punishment from her mother with a feather duster. But she cleverly avoided it by affectionately rubbing her cheek against her mother's wrist.Despite the strict upbringing, her mother supported her early interest in beauty, especially when she found Kan playing with jewelry or experimenting with lipstick in front of a mirror.Her father, a painter who would start over if he found even a small detail unsatisfactory in his work, exposed her early to art. This cultivated her appreciation for beauty and instilled a strict attitude toward it.Kan said her parents' support had contributed a lot to her growth.At 16, Kan went to the United States to attend the Brigham Young University-Hawaii. Her experience studying in the US, coupled with her adventurous spirit, deepened her understanding of Westerners and people from diverse ethnicities and backgrounds. This experience then helped shape her commitment to represent Chinese culture through her own identity.After a brief return to Hong Kong, Kan moved back to the US.In January 1972, she arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York with just $150 in cash.She began her television career in New York, using her persistence and resilience to establish roots in the city.In 1978, Kan produced and hosted the TV show Looking East, which introduced Chinese topics to mainstream US media and brought China to the US audience for the first time.In her autobiography, Kan described how she launched the show amid skepticism from friends, quickly transitioning to a successful start.Lack of informationAt the book-signing event, Kan said the lack of information about China was why she felt compelled to create Looking East. She wanted the show to help people in the US better understand China, bridging a significant cultural gap.In 1984, Kan was invited by PBS to host a live broadcast in China for the 35th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.This event marked the first television collaboration between China and the US. In her book, she wrote that seeing Tian'anmen Square during the hour-long live broadcast filled her with pride.Not only did Kan captivate the US audience, but she was also invited by the Chinese government to produce the show One World, which reached an audience of 400 million people.This program helped Chinese viewers gain a global perspective through her eyes. The 1988 TV program introduced China's reform and opening-up process to the US audience, playing a key role in familiarizing the US with the New China.Kan also consistently held herself to high standards. As a host, she made a lasting impression on viewers in both China and the US with her iconic "Yue-Sai Cut", vibrant clothing and signature red lips. Those elements resonated deeply with viewers in both countries.Later, Kan founded Yue Sai Cosmetics, where she was personally involved in every step from sourcing to research and development, testing and mass production.She integrated traditional Chinese herbal formulas into her cosmetics, creating a color palette specifically suited for sensitive skin and the complexions of Chinese women.In her book, Kan detailed the journey of creating her cosmetics brand. Additionally, she introduced "Yue-Sai wawa" — dolls that feature black hair and yellow skin dressed in traditional Chinese attire, making a significant cultural impact.To this day, Kan remains dedicated to fostering exchanges and cultural understanding between China and the US. Kan has built a diverse network of friends ranging from high-profile politicians and business leaders to ordinary citizens across both China and the US."Art, culture, education, business and culinary, always connect people," she said.Trina Solar US has secured $235 million in financing for its planned 1.35 million-square-foot solar plant in Wilmer, a small city about 15 miles south of downtown Dallas in Texas.The company, a subsidiary of Trina Solar, which is based in China's Jiangsu province, will use the loan to construct and operate a solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing plant.Standard Chartered, the London bank that arranged the deal, announced the "green" loan in a news release on Aug 7.Trina Solar leased the space at Tradepoint 45 West to set up a factory to manufacture and assemble high-power solar panels and PV modules, a company statement said.The plant is expected to be operating by year-end and provide 1,500 local jobs when at full capacity."We were thrilled to bring together this group of leaders and community members to celebrate our commitment to the City of Wilmer and the clean energy industry," Steven Zhu, president of Trina Solar North America, said in the company's first announcement of the factory."This facility represents a significant investment in American manufacturing that will bolster the US solar market in addition to positioning Texas as a leader in the transition to a sustainable future," he said.Jerry Wu, CFO at Trina Solar, said in a statement that the project is "the first non-recourse syndicated project financing in the United States raised by a PV module manufacturer and renewable enterprise".The factory capacity is 5 gigawatts, the company said.A recent analysis by Reuters concluded that Chinese companies will have at least 20 gigawatts of annual solar panel-production capacity on American soil within the next year. Chinese companies account for about one-fifth of the solar factories announced since the United States adopted new climate subsidies under Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act program.There are a few major solar panel projects underway by Chinese companies. Illuminate USA, a joint venture between Chinese solar equipment maker Longi and US company Invenergy, began manufacturing at a 5-gigawatt plant in Pataskala, Ohio, in February. The project is expected to employ 1,000 workers at full capacity.China-based solar cell and module manufacturer JA Solar will establish a 2-gigawatt production facility in Phoenix, Arizona. Expected to be operational by year-end, the company said the $60 million investment will create 600 new jobs.Another Chinese company, Runergy, is building a 5-gigawatt solar module plant in Huntsville, Alabama, which is creating 800 jobs.Some experts say that China's presence in solar panel production on US soil will help the domestic solar manufacturing industry mature while creating jobs."They have a lot more experience building factories and setting up supply chains," David Feldman, a solar market researcher with the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told Reuters.Zhu told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that the US market needs Chinese solar manufacturers for their technological know-how, ability to bring suppliers from China, capital, and appetite for investment.China is a leading producer of solar energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that in 2023, 407-446 gigawatts direct current of photovoltaics was installed globally, and China represented 60 percent of 2023 global total installs.While the United States was the second-largest market in terms of cumulative and annual installations, it lags with 26.3 gigawatts installed in 2023, according to the IEA.The trouble seems to never end for Boeing.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday ordered inspections of Boeing 787 aircraft following a midair dive by a LATAM Airlines plane in March in which more than 50 of its 263 passengers were injured.The FAA had received a report saying that the dive happened when the captain's seat moved, causing the autopilot to disconnect. The plane rapidly descended until the first officer took control.Since then, the FAA has received four additional reports of similar issues, the most recent in June, according to numerous media reports.The FAA's inspection will affect 158 airplanes registered in the United States and 737 airplanes globally, the agency said in the statement, according to Reuters. It requires airlines to inspect the captain's and first officer's seats on 787-8, 787-9 and 787-10 models within 30 days to check for missing or cracked rocker switch caps or damaged switch covers.On March 11, the Chilean multinational airline LATAM's flight LA800 experienced a "sudden midair drop" about an hour before landing during its journey from Sydney to Santiago, Chile, with a stop in Auckland, New Zealand.During the plane's sudden descent, passengers were hurt as some were knocked into the cabin ceiling. A passenger said a pilot had told him he had lost control of the plane when "my gauges just kind of went blank on me'', CNN reported in March."The plane, unannounced, just dropped. I mean it dropped unlike anything I've ever experienced on any kind of minor turbulence, and people were thrown out of their seats, hit the top of the roof of the plane, thrown down the aisles," passenger Brian Jokat told the BBC in March."My neighbor who was in the seat two over from me, there was a gap in between us, as soon as I woke, I looked, and he was on the ceiling, and I thought I was dreaming," he said.Boeing's manufacturing reputation took another hit on Tuesday when it halted the launch of its 777X aircraft after the company found problems between the engine and the plane's wings during a test flight.In the first week of 2024, a Boeing 737 MAX 9 passenger jet lost a rear door plug in midflight, leading to rapid decompression and forcing an emergency landing.In February, a United 737 MAX 8 reported its rudder pedals stuck during landing.In March, a Boeing 777-200 lost a tire shortly after takeoff, and there was a fuel leak on a United 777-300.In April, the FAA investigated Boeing after the company admitted that it may have missed some inspections of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.LOS ANGELES - The KP.3.1.1 COVID-19 variant, now the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant circulating in the United States, has been causing increasing infections in the country, the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed.KP.3.1.1, of the Omicron family, is among many currently co-circulating JN.1-derived variants in the United States.For the two-week period ending Aug 17, KP.3.1.1 is predicted to account for between 31 percent and 43 percent of COVID-19 clinical specimens, compared to between 20 percent and 26 percent for the two-week period ending Aug 3, according to the CDC data released on Monday.The rise in prevalence of KP.3.1.1 comes as markers of COVID-19 activity, including test positivity, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, remain elevated, particularly among adults ages 65 years and older and children younger than 2 years.CDC recommends that the public get COVID-19 vaccines to protect against serious illness from COVID-19. Updated COVID-19 vaccines that can provide protection during the 2024 to 2025 respiratory virus season will be available in the fall, according to the agency.China's recent retrieval of the first-ever samples from the far side of the moon has renewed talks about the possibilities of the United States and China joining in space-based research programs aimed at addressing global challenges, particularly climate change."The US and China each have very innovative space programs, and one area, for example, where the US and China could work together today would be space-based solar," Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, and founding director of the university's Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory, told China Daily.Space-based solar power, a concept involving the collection of solar energy in outer space via satellites and its distribution to Earth, has been gaining traction globally. As countries worldwide invest in research and development for the technology, international organizations are simultaneously pushing for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.The decreasing costs associated with launching materials into space have made the idea of deploying large solar panels — which beam power back to Earth using microwaves — increasingly feasible.Kammen suggested that the US and China could challenge each other to collaborate on making space-based solar a reality.'No nighttime'He emphasized the continuous nature of this energy source: "Space-based solar is on 24/7. There is no nighttime in space."Both nations already have made significant strides in this field. In the US, Caltech's space solar power prototype, launched into orbit last year, has successfully demonstrated its ability to wirelessly transmit power in space and beam detectable power to Earth for the first time.China, for its part, has achieved a milestone in its efforts to build a space solar power station in 2022. The China Academy of Space Technology has plans for a space high-voltage transfer and wireless power transmission experiment to be conducted in low Earth orbit by 2028, as outlined in its 2022 publication in the journal China Space Science and Technology.Drawing inspiration from popular culture, Kammen referred to the movie The Martian, in which a stranded US astronaut is rescued through a joint effort between the US and China. He saw the fictional scenario as an example of how the two nations could work together in reality, combining their respective technological strengths to achieve common goals."There's an opportunity to work peacefully together in space, to show that no matter who's going to be on the moon next, we have a chance to do clean energy in space as a bridge," said Kammen."That's an exciting opportunity," he said, and stressed the urgency of doing so. "We're going to need those breakthroughs because both the US and China are behind schedule to meet their climate goals."The US has aimed to cut emissions in half by 2030, and the Chinese goal is to realize carbon neutrality before 2060.The increase in extreme weather events in recent years highlights the urgency for the world to tackle climate change together, Wang Zhen, a research professor of international politics at the Institute of International Relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told China Daily.China and the US, the two largest economies in the world, have great potential for cooperation, particularly in areas of climate change and clean energy, Wang said.China is a pioneer in clean energy development in terms of solar power and electric vehicles, while the US holds strengths in software development and artificial intelligence, reflecting strong complementarity, he said."Cooperation between the US and China will strengthen both countries and benefit the world," Wang said.CHICAGO - The 2024 Democratic National Convention (DNC) kicked off at the United Center in Chicago, the US state of Illinois on Monday, as thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched near the venue to express their dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The convention, where Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination, is scheduled for Aug 19-22. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will formally accept the party's vice presidential nomination.Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in a neighborhood park to voice their discontent and anger toward the Biden administration's Israel policy, as the Palestinian death toll from Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has surpassed 40,000 since the outbreak of the current conflict on Oct 7, 2023.Chicago police said that arrests were made but didn't specify the number.On the opening day of the DNC, both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and United Auto Workers president Sean Fain gave prime-time speeches.President Joe Biden, greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of delegates, delivered a nearly hourlong keynote speech in which he highlighted his accomplishments since taking office, lashed out at former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and urged voters to support Harris in her bid for the White House."She's tough, she's experienced and she has enormous integrity," Biden continued. "Her story represents the best American story. And like many of our best presidents, she was also vice president," Biden said.As Biden concluded his speech, he was joined on stage by his family, including Jill Biden, as well as Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff.As Democrats gathered for the convention, Trump took to social media to criticize his opponent."Kamala Harris can't answer how she'd pay for any of her new liberal spending schemes that will bankrupt our country!" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Harris unveiled a sweeping economic agenda on Friday, which includes measures to cut taxes for the middle class, reduce grocery costs, take on price gouging, and lower the costs of owning and renting a home, among others.In the key swing states that could decide the results of the election, the race between the two remains tight.According to the latest poll data compiled by Real Clear Politics, Harris leads Trump by 1.0 percentage points in Wisconsin and by 2.0 percentage points in Michigan. In Pennsylvania, Harris trails by 0.2 percentage points. NEW YORK -- Former US Representative George Santos, who was expelled from Congress last year, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft on Monday.The guilty plea came just weeks before the New York Republican was set to stand trial on 23 federal felony counts, including allegations of fraud related to COVID-19 unemployment benefits, misusing campaign funds and lying about his personal finances on House disclosure reports."I betrayed the trust of my constituents and supporters. I deeply regret my conduct," Santos said at a Long Island courtroom in New York.The former congressman's sentencing hearing is set for Feb 7, 2025.Santos, 36, faces more than six years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines and owes at least $370,000 in restitution, according to The Associated Press.In December 2023, the US House of Representatives voted 311-114 to expel Santos from Congress over his lies, scandals and alleged campaign finance crimes.Many Chinese students and tech professionals are increasingly expressing their alarm via social media about being harassed in what they described as a "small dark room" at the secondary inspection areas of US immigration and border authorities.The trend has sparked heightened concerns among international students about traveling to the United States, in turn fueling calls for the US to halt the revocation of legally obtained visas and stemming the disruption to people-to-people exchanges.Watch the video for more details.At one of the main entrances on the southern end of Central Park across from West 59th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, a police poster stapled to a pole reads:"UP TO $3,500 REWARD FOR INFORMATION REGARDING A ROBBERY." It shows photos of the alleged robbers around 10:25 pm inside the park near East 62nd Street.The poster says the "perpetrators" robbed a man at knifepoint on Aug 1 there and later used his credit cards.Early Sunday morning, some 30 feet from the poster was a long "Police Command" vehicle with blinking red lights. An officer knocked on its door to get in. All 14 police vans lined up in front, behind and next to the command post were empty."Too early for police and for the robbers," Mohammed, a pedicab driver who said he was from "somewhere in West Africa'' and has worked for nine years in the park, told China Daily. "They will be back tonight, but they won't stay long. It's all for the public — especially tourists — to see."In the two weeks since that Aug 1 robbery listed on the poster, police said there have been at least 10 other robberies inside or near the park's south end. Central Park is the city's most visited tourist site, with an estimated 42 million visitors annually, according to the private, nonprofit Nature Conservancy, which oversees maintenance of the park."This is a migrant robbery pattern," Chief of Patrol John Chell told reporters on Aug 14, from where those police vehicles were parked Sunday."We believe these groups are responsible for most, if not all, of them," he said. Chell said they work in groups of eight and 12, as well as in pairs of two.Where Chell spoke that day was a sea of blue as the NYPD showed how officers will be deployed to counter the spate of robberies — on foot, scooters, bicycles, horseback and in patrol cars.Up to 100 additional police officers will be in the park at all hours for an indefinite period, according to officials, who said the increased police presence will be most noticeable from 7 pm to midnight.About 135 officers currently work in the Central Park Precinct. The additional officers are being pulled from various police units."There's no secret being kept here," Chell said. "Crime is up in this park."Police statistics show crime has spiked dramatically this year compared with the same period last year. At least 30 robberies have been reported in Central Park this year, compared with just 10 during the same period in 2023, the ABC News affiliate reported.There also have been 10 felony assaults this year compared with seven last year, according to police data.The area of the park where the recent spate of robberies has occurred runs from Columbus Circle on the southwest to around The Plaza Hotel and Grand Army Plaza on the southeast side, areas teeming with tourists.Most of the victims have been tourists, police said. No one has been hurt during the robberies.Jen, who declined to give her last name, said she recently arrived from China for a short visit and had been warned about potential violence in the city before visiting but said, "I wanted to come anyway."It's daytime, the park is beautiful and safe now with all the runners and walkers. But I would never be here at night," she said.She was with her friend Liu, who said he also was from China, has worked in the city for more than 10 years in technology, and lives in downtown Manhattan."News reports didn't say whether the robbery victims included Asians, but that doesn't matter, because there's already enough hate crime against Asians in the city," he said.Starting at month's end, drones will be used to cover the park, officials said. They said the drones can respond to incidents in less than one minute and track suspects until police arrive."We're not going to tolerate crimes at one of the most iconic locations in the world," said Tarik Sheppard, deputy police commissioner of public information.Agencies contributed to this story.Decades of agricultural cooperation between China and Uruguay have greatly benefited Uruguayan farmers, with a strong desire to further this partnership into technological innovation, a Uruguayan agricultural expert says.Miguel Sierra, manager of innovation and communication at the National Agricultural Research Institute of Uruguay, recently concluded a 21-day visit to China. Reflecting on the trip, he stressed China's advanced status in scientific and technological innovation."In Uruguay, I work on agricultural cooperation projects with China, and my recent visit has reinforced my belief that China is at the first world level of scientific and technological innovation," he said."I visited various institutions showcasing cutting-edge research. Having visited many countries and being a member of numerous agricultural research networks in Latin America, I can confidently say that China's advancements are impressive."Sierra stressed China's technological prowess, such as using digital technology to monitor animal health. "These technological applications can be incredibly practical for commercial use," he said.While China already has high scientific capabilities, its current challenge is to integrate this capacity with the economy to generate greater economic returns, he said. "China has made strides here, with many institutions employing technological brokers to bridge the gap between research and the innovation sector."Building connections between science and the economy is crucial, Sierra said, expressing hope that Uruguay can learn from China's practices.Top export marketSierra said China and Uruguay have a long history of agricultural collaboration, starting with a 1993 agreement. Since 2013, China has become Uruguay's top export market, particularly for beef and soybeans."There are tens of thousands of farmers in Uruguay who depend on beef and soybean sales. When business opportunities in China arise, these farmers can earn more, bringing positive impacts to local society," he said.From a commercial perspective, the bilateral collaboration is strong, but there is room for improvement in science, technology and innovation. "Successive Uruguayan governments over the last 15 years have prioritized the development of a long-term agricultural collaboration strategy with China," Sierra said."Uruguay has strong scientific capabilities in life sciences but needs to generate more value and connect science with innovation and the global market. In this process, China is an ideal partner. For China, Uruguay offers a test platform for its scientific and technological innovation and a gateway to Mercosur (the Southern Common Market)."SANTO DOMINGO -- At the invitation of President of the Dominican Republic Luis Abinader, Chinese President Xi Jinping's Special Envoy and Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong attended Abinader's second-term inauguration here on Friday.Abinader met with Jin at the National Palace on Thursday.Jin conveyed cordial greetings and best wishes from President Xi to Abinader and congratulated him on his re-election as president of the Dominican Republic.He said since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries six years ago, the bilateral relations have achieved comprehensive and rapid development.China is willing to work with the Dominican Republic to continue to firmly support each other, enhance practical cooperation, promote cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, and push the bilateral relations to achieve more results, so as to better benefit the people of both sides, Jin said.He also elaborated on the guiding principles of the third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee to Abinader.For his part, Abinader asked Jin to convey his sincere greetings and best wishes to President Xi and expressed his heartfelt gratitude to President Xi for sending a special envoy to attend the inauguration ceremony of his new term.Abinader said that developing relations with China is of special importance to the Dominican Republic, and he looks forward to further deepening mutually beneficial cooperation with China in various fields and pushing for greater development of bilateral relations.Columbia University President Minouche Shafik has resigned after a brief tenure following criticisms over how she handled a series of raucous pro-Palestinian student protests on the Ivy League school's campus.Shafik's resignation on Wednesday came a few months after students created a makeshift tent community in mid-April on the Manhattan campus in solidarity with the people of Gaza over the Israel-Palestine conflict.When the tents were removed by police officers, the students returned the next day, setting off a wave of similar protests at universities nationwide.Shafik's surprise resignation letter sent by email to the Columbia community cited the ill effects of the protests and discord around it. She wrote that while the campus had made progress, it was "difficult to overcome divergent views across our community"."This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in the community. Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead," she wrote.Columbia's Board of Trustees announced that the new interim president will be Katrina Armstrong, a medical doctor who has been the CEO of Columbia's medical center and dean of its medical school since 2022."Challenging times present both the opportunity and the responsibility for serious leadership to emerge from every group and individual within a community," Armstrong said in a statement. "As I step into this role, I am acutely aware of the trials the University has faced over the past year."Shafik, who was appointed in July last year, was the first female leader of the school. Her tenure was one of the shortest in the school's 270-year history.She is the third leader of an Ivy League university to step down in eight months following highly charged testimonies at a congressional hearing on campus antisemitism. All were criticized by Republican lawmakers.After the testimonies, the University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill resigned in December. A month later, Harvard University President Claudine Gay resigned.Nationwide campus demonstrations began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct 7, killing more than 1,100 people.Israel's devastating retaliatory offensive has killed 40,005 Palestinians, Gaza's Health Ministry said on Thursday.Pro-Palestinian demonstrators called on the schools to cut financial ties with Israel and any companies that supported the Israeli fighting.Amid the protests, Shafik had denounced antisemitism on campus, but was criticized for not doing enough to reprimand some faculty members and students.A new round of college protests is expected in the fall, according to Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the main protest movement.belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.comScores of legal organizations and hundreds of lawyers from around the world have told US President Joe Biden that broad economic sanctions imposed by the United States amount to collective punishment and violate international law, and that it should end.In a letter addressed to Biden, the signers called for the US to "comply with the international law by ending the use of broad, unilateral coercive measures that extensively harm civilian populations".The letter said the unilateral application of certain economic sanctions by Washington constitutes collective punishment, "which is considered a war crime" and prohibited by the Geneva Conventions.Collective punishment has become a standard practice of US foreign policy through sanctions, and the US imposes them more than any other country, the letter said.While the use of sanctions is different from conventional warfare, "its collective impact on civilians can be just as indiscriminate, punitive, and deadly", the signatories said.Hundreds of millions of people currently live under the sanctions, and notable cases include Cuba, Iran, Syria and Venezuela.The sanctions "can spark and prolong economic crisis, hinder access to essential goods like food, fuel and medicine, and increase poverty, hunger, disease and even death rates, especially among the children", the letter said.Civilian suffering is not merely an incidental cost of sanction policies, but it is also the intent, the letter said. It cited comments by Mike Pompeo, former US secretary of state, about the effectiveness of the Donald Trump administration's sanctions against Iran. He said: "Things are much worse for the Iranian people, and we're convinced that will lead the Iranian people to rise up and change the behavior of the regime."US officials are aware that sanctions cause suffering.Conditions induced by sanctions often drive mass migration, as in Cuba and Venezuela recently.Human rights groups have said that more than 7 million people — about 25 percent of Venezuela's population — have fled the South American country in the past decade.The letter echoes a recent report by Michael Fakhri, a United Nations special rapporteur, who spent two weeks in Venezuela to assess the situation.Economic crisis"I saw firsthand how unilateral coercive measures in the form of economic sanctions have constrained the government's fiscal ability to implement their social protection programs and deliver basic public services," Fakhri wrote in his report.Nearly 82 percent of Venezuelans live in poverty based on income levels, and 53 percent are exposed to extreme poverty, with insufficient income to purchase a basic food basket.Fakhri also recommended lifting sanctions on Venezuela."The United States does not consider itself to be at war with these states that it's imposing sanctions on, and nevertheless is doing things that have effects that states have outlawed even in the context of war," Ntina Tzouvala, associate professor at the Australian National University College of Law, told Bloomberg.She said the US government's increased targeting of financial transactions and aggressive prosecutions by the Justice Department "creates a culture of overcompliance from private actors".Agencies contributed to this story.Scientists of Chinese descent in the United States have been leaving the country because of "pull factors" from China and the "push factor" of the China Initiative of 2018, according to a major research study published in an American scientific journal.The trend suggests a reverse brain drain, and the data used for the analysis is extensive.The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used Microsoft Academic Graph to analyze trends in the migration of US-based Chinese scientists between 2010 and 2021.The database tracks more than 200 million scientists from over 25,000 institutions worldwide.Also, a brief on the study, published in July by the Stanford Center on China's Economy and Institutions, concluded that the discontinued China Initiative "provided scientists of Chinese descent in the US with higher incentives to leave and lower incentives to apply for federal grants".The purported objective of the China Initiative — launched by the Justice Department under the Trump administration and halted in 2022 under the Biden administration — was to reduce economic espionage.The study identified the working countries of researchers through their academic affiliations in publications and tracked those with Chinese surnames who initially published in the US but later changed their affiliations to institutions abroad.The study identified 19,955 scientists of Chinese descent who began their careers in the US but left for other countries, including China, between 2010 and 2021.The researchers said that contributing to the trend were "pull factors" from China, including the country's large and rapidly growing investments in science, high social prestige, and attractive financial rewards connected to positions in Chinese institutions.But the analysis also showed a "push factor" in the US. Following the implementation of the China Initiative, departures of US-based, China-born scientists increased by 75 percent, the study found.The data showed that as of 2021, of those leaving the US, the percentage of scientists moving back to China increased to 67 percent, up from 48 percent in 2010. The life sciences field witnessed the most significant exodus abroad, with more than 1,000 life scientists leaving in 2021.The researchers also conducted an online survey of 1,304 US-based scientists of Chinese descent between December 2021 and March 2022 to find out why more were leaving.The survey results revealed the chilling effects of the China Initiative. About 35 percent of Chinese scientists in the US said that they felt unwelcome; 72 percent didn't feel safe as academic researchers; 42 percent were fearful of conducting research; and 65 percent were worried about collaborations with China.Of the five possible reasons for "not feeling safe as an academic researcher in the US", the foremost reason cited by the respondents-67 percent of them — was fear of "US government investigations into Chinese-origin researchers".About 45 percent of respondents said that they now avoid federal research grants, and 61 percent said that they had considered leaving the US.MIT professor Gang Chen, who had espionage charges slapped on him under the China Initiative only for them to be dismissed in 2022, said publicly that after undergoing the lengthy legal process that damaged his reputation and forced many of his students to adjust their career paths, he was avoiding federally funded research out of fear.Students from China have been an important source of US-based scientists for more than two decades. The study said that in 2020, of all US doctoral degrees in science and engineering, 17 percent — roughly 5,800 of 34,000 — went to foreign students from China, and the vast majority of those had chosen to stay in the US in previous years."It's unfortunate that the China Initiative has turned out to be a government-sanctioned persecution of people of Chinese heritage," a STEM(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) professor in Houston who spoke on condition of anonymity told China Daily. "The federal government was wrong to prosecute people primarily based on race. It is not a surprise that such a practice has created fear in the community."An analysis by Race, Racism and the Law, a civil rights group, concluded that of the 148 defendants across 77 cases collected in the FBI database, 130-approximately 90 percent — were of Chinese heritage.Only 25 percent of them were convicted, and few of the convictions were related to espionage. The conviction rate was dramatically lower than the Justice Department's 91 percent overall conviction rate.In June, Marcia McNutt, the president of the National Academy of Sciences, said that while the US still spends the most money among any country on research and development, China is set to soon outpace those investments.An aviation expert has cited severe icing as a potential cause of the recent plane crash in Brazil, which is the world's deadliest aviation disaster since January last year, as bereaved families wait for answers on the tragedy.The aircraft, operated by Brazilian airline Voepass, crashed in a residential neighborhood on Aug 9, killing all 62 people.The ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop was en route from Cascavel in southern Brazil to Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo. According to the Brazilian Air Force, the pilots did not report any emergency or adverse weather conditions. The plane was flying normally at 1:21 pm when radar contact was lost at 1:22 pm, and it crashed about eight minutes later.While the cause of the crash has not yet been determined, aviation expert Daniel Calazans, head of the Professor Kalazans Institute in Brazil, which trains pilots, suggested that severe icing might be a factor."There was a weather forecast for severe icing along the route and at cruising altitude," Calazans said."If deicing devices are not used, this could cause deformation in the wings and control surfaces (aileron, elevators, flaps), leading to the aircraft losing lift and possibly crashing."If the aircraft surfaces were to freeze and parts of the aircraft were to be deformed, the pilot could lose complete control and might no longer be able to keep the plane in flight."Marcel Moura, chief operations officer of Voepass, said at a news briefing that the plane was sensitive to ice. While some ice had been anticipated, it was predicted to be within an acceptable range, he said.Calazans said a thorough analysis of the contributing factors is needed to determine if the accident could have been avoided. "It is still too early to determine this," he said, adding that the black boxes are expected to be investigated in about a year.Voepass officials are working with Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center to investigate the crash.Voepass CEO Eduardo Busch said the plane had two black boxes that store flight data. However, the boxes, which have not yet been recovered, might have sustained damage during the crash. Authorities are expected to issue a preliminary report on their investigation in 30 days.Identifying bodiesOver the weekend, more than 40 families of the victims traveled to Sao Paulo to identify the bodies.Apart from the aircraft's pilot and co-pilot, other crash victims included eight doctors, four college professors from Unioeste university in Cascavel, a 3-year-old child, a lawyer who specialized in cases against airlines, and a Venezuelan family and their dog.This was the world's worst plane crash since January last year, when 72 people onboard a Yeti Airlines plane in Nepal died after the aircraft stalled and crashed while making its landing approach. The Yeti plane was an ATR 72, similar to the one used in the Voepass flight, but an investigation had attributed the Nepal tragedy to pilot error.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.People in the United States haven't revved up their enthusiasm for electric vehicles despite plenty of dealerships nationwide offering steep discounts. Meanwhile, in China, EV sales are soaring.The drop in demand for EVs in the US comes after international automakers bet big and invested billions of dollars over the past few years in EV fleets.In 2023, EV sales grew nearly 50 percent, according to data from Motor Intelligence, a vehicle sales data provider in the US. In the first six months of this year, growth increased by just 6.8 percent as consumer interest waned.Richard, who declined to give his surname, is a buyer for Major World, a large auto dealership in Long Island City, Queens, New York, which sells new and used cars, EVs, trucks and SUVs.He told China Daily: "We bought a lot of EVs that go toward the taxi and limousine people, but most people don't come in looking for (EVs); they prefer other non-EV cars."EVs at the dealership range in price from $14,000 to $17,000 for a small Chevrolet Bolt model to $19,000 to $22,000 for larger 2022 and 2023 models. Newer EV models range in sticker price from $40,000 to $50,000.Richard believes consumers will respond to lower-priced EVs when the automobiles have a longer battery life."If you don't have that battery that will give you the distance, customers will be slow to buy."Consumer interest in buying EVs and hybrids is vastly different in China, where sales sped past internal-combustion-engine cars for the first time last month.About 51 percent of all vehicle sales in July consisted of EVs and hybrids, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.At least 878,000 EVs and hybrids were sold in July, an increase of 37 percent over the same period last year. Conventional car sales fell by 26 percent to 840,000, the association said.China exported 376,000 cars worldwide in July, up 20 percent on 2023, according to the car association.In May, US President Joe Biden's administration imposed 100 percent tariffs on EVs and batteries made in China. The tariffs essentially cut off the imports of Chinese cars.Political considerationWhile the White House has advocated for clean energy, there also is a political consideration of importing cheaper vehicles.In the US, besides the cost of EVs, battery concerns and the tariffs, which went into effect on Aug 1, there is a lack of charging stations.There were approximately 61,000 such stations in the US as of February, according to the Pew Research Center.California has 43,780 charging stations, the highest number of individual public charging ports, for the 1.2 million electric vehicles registered by the state's residents.Nationwide, rural areas have even fewer charging stations. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act gave tax credits to incentivize the installation of EV-charging stations outside urban areas.In contrast, China has invested heavily in EV infrastructure. By the end of June, the total number of charging piles in China reached 10.24 million units, according to the National Energy Administration.The falling demand for battery-powered cars and trucks has left US car dealers with too much stock as they get ready to roll out the new 2025 models this fall.In June, dealerships had on average 125 days of supply of EVs, according to figures from Cox Automotive; they usually have around 60 days. The dealers are also selling many EVs at a loss and offering finance deals.Agencies contributed to this story.NEW YORK -- Perchlorate, a chemical found in rocket fuel, has contaminated water and food and is more likely to be found in food given to babies and children, according to a study from Consumer Reports.The chemical is naturally occurring and man-made, but it is being found more often in groundwater, according to the Department of Toxic Substances Control.Most of the food found to be contaminated with perchlorate was children's food, like cereal and chicken nuggets, James Rogers, a trained food and water microbiologist and director of Food Safety Research and Testing at Consumer Reports, was quoted by USA Today on Thursday as elaborating on this topic.According to the study, which was released last week, researchers analyzed 196 samples of 63 supermarket products and 10 fast food items, and found that about 67 percent of the samples had measurable levels of perchlorate.The top three product categories had the highest levels of perchlorate are baby/kid food, fruits and vegetables, and fast food. And according to Rogers, as reported by USA today, beef burritos, chicken sandwiches and French fries are the top three particular foods that contained the highest concentration of perchlorate.The food tested did not contain dangerous levels of perchlorate, but Rogers said that there is no strict definition of what is considered to be a "dangerous level."Rogers said consuming unsafe levels of the chemical can negatively affect a person's thyroid. "Thyroid hormones affect metabolism, and having bad thyroid function could lead, in this case, to type 2 diabetes."Thyroid problems can lead to type 2 diabetes for adults, but children and fetuses can face complications with neurodevelopment, which "can result in a lowering of IQ of the children."Exposure to high levels of perchlorate can affect the thyroid in multiple ways, according to the FDA. It can interfere with iodide uptake into the thyroid gland, disrupt thyroid functions, and possibly lead to a reduction in thyroid hormone production. WASHINGTON - US Vice Presidential nominees - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Ohio Senator J.D. Vance - on Thursday agreed to participate in a debate hosted by CBS News, which is scheduled for Oct 1.The debate will be moderated by "CBS Evening News" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and "Face the Nation" moderator and CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan, according to the network.On Wednesday, the network announced that Walz agreed to the Oct. 1 date, after proposing four dates for a debate between the two vice presidential nominees."See you on October 1, JD," Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said Wednesday in a post on "X", formerly known as Twitter.Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, said in a post on "X" Thursday that he has agreed to the debate."Not only do I accept the CBS debate on October 1st, I accept the CNN debate on September 18th as well. I look forward to seeing you at both!" said Vance.Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, picked Vance as his running mate on July 15, the first day of the Republican National Convention held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris quickly consolidated support within the party and won enough delegates to become the Democratic nominee after a five-day online balloting process in early August.On Aug. 6, Harris announced that she selected Walz as her running mate. On the same day, the two kicked off a five-day campaign tour in key swing states including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada.Last week, ABC announced that Trump and Harris agreed to a presidential debate to be hosted by the network on Sept. 10, setting up the first confrontation between the new opponents on stage prior to the November election.LOS ANGELES - Democratic lawmakers from the western US state of California are urging the Biden administration to halt its reported plans of imposing new restrictions on technology exports to China, arguing that a further round of controls "could send longstanding US companies into a death spiral," Reuters reported on Wednesday.According to the report, US Democratic lawmakers from California, the largest economy in the United States, said that "unilateral curbs benefit foreign rivals at the expense of US businesses.""We ask that you pause additional unilateral export controls until you have adequately justified that such controls will not damage US competitiveness in advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment," Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Zoe Lofgren were quoted as saying in a letter addressed to Alan Estevez, who oversees export controls at the US Commerce Department.In the letter, the lawmakers noted that US allies have not imposed similarly aggressive China export curbs on their own companies."The letter is a sign of growing pushback against Biden's semiconductor policy among Democrats from California, home to the US' top chipmaking equipment companies LAM, Applied Materials, and KLA," said the report.The Netherlands and Japan, home to chipmaking equipment producers ASML and Tokyo Electron, respectively, have also imposed restrictions on equipment exports to China, although they have not gone as far as implementing some of the strictest measures imposed by the United States, it added.NEW YORK - Columbia University President Minouche Shafik announced her resignation Wednesday amid continuous tensions arising over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Shafik's resignation took effect on Wednesday and Katrina Armstrong, CEO of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, will serve as interim president.It has been a period of turmoil where it has been difficult to overcome divergent views across the Columbia University community and "this period has taken a considerable toll on my family," said Shafik in her announcement.Shafik has been under pressure in recent months as her handling of the encampment at Columbia University drew criticism on and off campus.Together with three other officials from the university, Shafik testified before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on antisemitism on campus in April.Columbia University started to restrict campus access starting from Monday, only allowing Columbia-affiliated persons to visit its campus.As a British-American academic and economist, Shafik started to serve as the 20th president of Columbia University in July 2023.Following her counterparts at Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania, Shafik is the third president of an Ivy League university to step down in the wake of campus protests over Gaza.Shafik is expected to chair a review of the British government's approach to international development and how to improve capability, according to her announcement.NEW YORK - Paramount Global is restructuring its TV-production business as part of a cost-cutting effort and what the company said were significant changes in the TV and streaming marketplaces.Paramount on Tuesday said that Paramount Television Studios was shutting down at the end of the week, and that its sister TV unit -- CBS Studios -- would absorb the production of Paramount shows as a result of the move. CBS Studios produces content for the CBS network, Paramount+ and other platforms."For decades, Paramount has been one of the pre-eminent producers of television shows," said The Wall Street Journal in its report about the move. Paramount Television Studios recently produced several hits for streaming services including "13 Reasons Why" for Netflix, "Reacher" for Amazon Prime Video and "Defending Jacob" for Apple TV+."Over the past several years, however, the studio has shrunk in size and status -- a victim of industry consolidation and challenges facing its parent company," noted The Journal.The move is part of a shake-up at Paramount Global that will result in about 15 percent of its US workforce being eliminated, or a cut of approximately 2,000 jobs. Paramount Global parent National Amusements is in the process of being acquired by Skydance Media in a complex deal that would result in the combination of Paramount and Skydance.In a memo to staff, Paramount Global Co-Chief Executive George Cheeks said the decision isn't based on the performance of the studio, but rather is "the result of significant changes in the TV and streaming marketplace and the need to streamline our company."China's envoy to the United Nations on Tuesday "strongly condemned" Israel's attack on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza City.Three Israeli rockets struck the Al-Taba'een School on Saturday, where many displaced Palestinians were seeking shelter and participating in dawn prayers. More than 100 Palestinians were killed, and dozens were injured in the assault, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said.Israel said it targeted the school because Hamas fighters were sheltering there."China strongly condemns the assault," Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the UN, told a Security Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the attack."Civilians and civilian infrastructure should never be targets of military action — this is a red line defined by international humanitarian law. The repeated attacks on schools, where large numbers of civilians seek refuge, are appalling," said Fu.He said that over the past 10 months, millions of people in Gaza have had their homes destroyed, and families have been torn apart, forcing them to move from place to place in search of safety, only to face bombings and the constant threat of death."There is no longer any safe haven in Gaza," Fu said.Three schools in Gaza City were hit within 48 hours between Aug 3 and 4 and two schools hit on Aug 8, with Al-Taba'een on Saturday the latest such attack, according to Lisa Doughten, director of the Financing and Partnerships Division at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.At least 21 schools in Gaza, all serving as shelters, have been attacked, resulting in at least 274 fatalities, according to the UN Human Rights Office. Saturday's strike was one of the deadliest on a school sheltering displaced people since the conflict began, said Doughten.Fu urged the US to push Israel to halt its military operations in Gaza as Israel's "largest arms supplier"."An immediate and lasting cease-fire is the urgent hope of the people of Gaza and a strong consensus within the international community," he said, noting that the council two months ago passed its first cease-fire resolution, and the US said that Israel had accepted a cease-fire agreement."But the reality is quite the opposite. We have seen no credible signs of Israel committing to a cease-fire; instead, there is an escalation in military actions and rising civilian casualties," Fu said."We urge the US to act with sincerity and responsibility, pushing Israel to halt its military operations in Gaza and end the killing of civilians as soon as possible," he said.Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich last week said it might be "justified and moral" to starve 2 million people in Gaza in order to free Israeli hostages.Fu condemned the statement, calling it "horrifying" and "entirely unacceptable". "Hunger should never be used as a weapon; humanitarian issues should not be politicized; and civilian lives should not be bargaining chips," he said.He then urged Israel to fulfill "its international humanitarian obligations, open all border crossings, and ensure the rapid, large-scale, and safe delivery of humanitarian aid".Separately, last week, Israeli surveillance footage reportedly showed Israeli soldiers sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee inside the Sde Teiman prison.Fu said China is "seriously concerned" about the incident and called for an investigation and accountability."China urges Israel to immediately halt all settlement activities, effectively curb the escalating settler violence, and stop undermining the foundation of the two-state solution," Fu continued.He reiterated that the two-state solution "is the only viable path to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. China supports the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and advocates for convening a larger, more authoritative and more effective international conference," he said.UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Monday also condemned the school attacks in Gaza."The Secretary-General condemns the continued loss of life in Gaza, including women and children, as we witness yet another devastating strike by Israel on the Al-Taba'een school in Gaza City, sheltering hundreds of displaced Palestinians families, with scores of fatalities, amidst continued horror, displacement, and suffering in Gaza," said UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq.Violence in Gaza has killed almost 40,000 Palestinians and injured more than 90,000 others, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.Starbucks, which has struggled this year in its two largest coffee markets — the US and China — on Tuesday ousted its CEO, responding to pressure from an activist investor and its longtime former boss.The Seattle-based company, the world's largest coffee chain, named Brian Niccol, the CEO at Chipotle Mexican Grill since 2018, as its new chairman and CEO, to replace Laxman Narasimhan, effective Sept 9. Niccol will become the fourth Starbucks CEO in four and a half years."[Niccol] has my respect and full support," said Howard Schultz, who has become the company's biggest independent shareholder during his three stints as its leader, in a press release issued by Starbucks.Narasimhan was removed after approximately 16 months in the job. Starbucks had hired him from Reckitt, a UK-based consumer products company. He was the first external leader of the modern iteration of Starbucks and was personally chosen as the successor to Schultz, who transformed the company from a local coffee chain into a global icon. But during Narasimhan's short time as CEO, Starbucks in 2020 had its first decline in comparable store sales by more than 20 percent.With the leadership change, Starbucks' shares surged 24.5 percent, positioning the company for a record one-day percentage gain, while Chipotle shares fell by about 7.5 percent in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday.Starbucks has more than $36 billion in annual revenue and 38,000 stores across more than 80 countries.Chipotle has reported $10 billion in annual revenue at its 3,500 restaurants, largely in the United States.The Financial Times reported Tuesday that Starbucks' board made the decision to oust Narasimhan after its management strategy came under attack from activist investor Elliott Management, which controls a sizable minority stake.Elliott had been holding talks with the chain over a number of demands, including board representation, the FT reported. The 70-year-old Schultz, who built Starbucks into a global brand, privately expressed his opposition to a settlement with Elliott, according to the FT.In a statement, Elliott said it viewed the management change "as a transformational step forward for the company''.In April, Starbucks reduced its financial outlook for the second time this year due to a slowdown in cafe traffic, which affected sales and profits.In China, Starbucks' second-largest market by sales, the competition has become increasingly tougher in recent years.Under Narasimhan's tenure, Starbucks intended to accelerate drink-making and open thousands of additional locations in China as part of its "reinvention" strategy. The plan, initially developed by Schultz, emphasized increased automation and aggressive expansion.Starbucks has been working to establish a first-mover advantage in China since opening its first café in the country in 1999. Under Schultz's expansion plan, the company branched out from major cities into smaller ones, opening hundreds of new stores each year.Schultz spoke about his travels to China to promote the company and to help connect the US and China through shared values.But he also wrote in a LinkedIn post in May that Starbucks should start by improving its operations, which were "the primary reason for the company's fall from grace''. "The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience, through the eyes of a merchant. The answer does not lie in data, but in the stores," he wrote.In China, Starbucks faces increasing competition from Luckin Coffee, which has gradually occupied the country's coffee market with fast mobility services and innovative coffee-making.Luckin Coffee, which was founded in Beijing in 2017 and is now headquartered in Xiamen, East China's Fujian province, has surpassed Starbucks by sales and number of stores, according to its earnings reports in 2023.Luckin has focused its strategy on its mobile app and integrated delivery services from the beginning, a model that Starbucks later adopted for its Chinese operations.Luckin operates approximately 13,300 stores, nearly double Starbucks' 6,800 locations in China. To drive its growth, Luckin has leveraged rapid-delivery services, mobile-payment options and unique offerings like a cheese-flavored latte, which has resonated well with Chinese consumers. The company also has previously promoted a coffee infused with Maotai, a famous maker of baijiu liquor in China.Niccol will need to devise Starbucks' next strategy in China. At Chipotle, he has helped more than double sales from 2018 to 2023 by implementing new safety protocols, modernizing the chain's ordering systems, introducing new ingredients and opening new locations.Niccol is "a hall of fame restaurant CEO" who will use his savvy marketing lessons from Chipotle to "create brand buzz" at Starbucks, TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a research note, according to Axios. "He appreciates what makes a premium brand special."Deutsche Bank analyst Lauren Silberman cut her price target on Starbucks from $115 to $108 per share, while affirming a buy rating. "We believe efforts focused on innovation, targeted promotions and marketing should start to drive improving SSS (same-store sales)," she said.Silberman told TheStreet.com, a financial news website, that Starbucks launched Spicy Refreshers on April 16 and will launch Summer-Berry Refreshers on May 7, "both unique platforms that should resonate with younger consumers and in the afternoon".Agencies contributed to this story.Chinese autonomous driving company WeRide is looking for its shares to take a ride on the Nasdaq.WeRide, based in Guangzhou in South China's Guangdong province, plans to offer 6.45 million American depositary shares, or ADS, at a price range of $15.50 to $18.50 in its upcoming initial public offering, according to a filing by the company late on Friday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.The main underwriters of the offering are Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and China International Capital Corporation, a multinational investment management and financial services company based in Beijing.WeRide was founded in 2017 by Tony Han, who is also chairman and CEO. The company plans to trade under the symbol WRD on Nasdaq.The company reported its last year revenue of 401.8 million yuan ($55.3 million). For the first six months of this year, it had a revenue of 150.3 million yuan, according to the filing.It will be the largest IPO by a Chinese company on the US stock market since Zeekr, a luxury EV startup owned by Geely, began selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange in May, TechCrunch reported.WeRide also may have to contend with a US Commerce Department proposal that could bar Chinese software in autonomous and connected vehicles, Reuters reported last Monday, citing sources briefed on the matter.President Joe Biden's administration plans to issue a rule that would bar Chinese software in vehicles in the United States with Level 3 automation and above, which would in effect ban testing of autonomous vehicles produced by Chinese companies on US roads.WeRide generates most of its revenue from sales of its Level 4 autonomous driving vehicles "primarily including robobuses, robotaxis and robosweepers, and related sensor suites; and … the provision of L4 autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) services, including the provision of L4 operational and technical support services as well as ADAS research and development services", the SEC filing said.The White House also will propose barring vehicles with Chinese-developed advanced wireless communications abilities modules from US roads, sources told Reuters.Under the proposal, automakers and suppliers would need to verify that none of their connected vehicles or advanced autonomous vehicle software was developed in a "foreign entity of concern".A Commerce Department spokesperson said on Aug 4 that the department "is concerned about the national security risks associated with" such vehicles.In response, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said electric vehicles are a globalized industry."Only division of labor and cooperation can bring mutual benefits, and only fair competition can bring technological progress," the spokesperson said. "China urges the US to earnestly abide by market principles and international trade rules, and create a level playing field for companies from all countries. China will firmly defend its lawful rights and interests."Agencies contributed to this story.Data showing the national debt of the United States at a record high of $35 trillion and an unemployment rate that is surging have sparked worries about the health of the US economy. Experts said the large federal debt reflects inadequate policy responses and failure of governance, and carries wide ramifications for the world.The gross federal debt of the US surpassed $35 trillion at the end of July, Treasury Department data showed. This translates into a per capita debt of $104,000, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that focuses on addressing long-term fiscal challenges in the US.Chen Weidong, general manager of the Research Institute of the Bank of China, said the large US federal debt is the result of the continued accumulation of fiscal imbalances. Government spending has been rising rapidly to support social security and the economy, he said, noting that military spending has climbed, particularly after the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The gross national debt grew rapidly from $20 trillion in September 2017 to $30 trillion in early 2022 to $34 trillion in late 2023.According to Tian Lihui, dean of the Institute of Finance and Development at Nankai University, during the pandemic, the US government adopted large-scale fiscal stimulus measures and purchased securities from the market to boost liquidity, leading to soaring federal debt.In addition, US debts are globally deemed as a safe haven, which allows the US government to borrow more money at a lower cost, Tian said."The high debt level can cause significant problems if economic conditions worsen," Ke Jing, associate research professor at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of International Relations, said.The record debt figures were revealed as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics said in early August that unemployment rate had risen to 4.3 percent, the highest since October 2021, beating the projection of 4.1 percent. The nonfarm payrolls — a key employment index — increased only by 114,000 in July, a slowing from 179,000 jobs added in June.Financial news site MarketWatch reported that a closely tracked recession indicator, the Sahm rule, had been triggered. The rule says a recession is imminent when the unemployment rate, based on a three-month average, is half a percentage point above its lowest point over the previous 12 months.Economists from the Goldman Sachs Group have hiked the probability of a US recession in the next year to 25 percent from 15 percent, Bloomberg reported.Worries about an imminent recession in the US have led to stock price fluctuations in major stock markets around the world.The situation has prompted further speculations on whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.The Fed kept its benchmark policy interest rate unchanged in July at a two-decade high of 5.25 to 5.50 percent. The budget office predicts annual interest costs will rise to $1.7 trillion in 2034 from $892 billion this year, the New York Times reported."The interest spending is too high for the government to sustain," Ke from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of International Relations said.With high interest rates, the US national debt will continue to soar. This would increase borrowing costs for businesses, discouraging investment and consumption, Ke added.Chen of the Research Institute of the Bank of China said the Fed is likely to initiate a rate cut in September and perhaps another in the fourth quarter to better balance inflation and economic growth.The consumer price index rose 3 percent in June from a year earlier, according to the US Labor Department, below the 3.1 percent market expectation."There is not necessarily a need to cut interest rates at the moment, but the Fed might lower its rate to influence the financial market and balance politics," Tian of the Institute of Finance and Development at Nankai University said.Rating agency Moody's in November lowered its outlook on the US credit rating to "negative" from "stable", citing large fiscal deficits and a decline in debt affordability, several months after Fitch downgraded US credit rating to AA+ from AAA."There is a contradiction between the escalating US debt and its role as a global safe asset," Chen said. On one hand, to strengthen its reserve asset status, the US must continually increase fiscal deficits to produce these safe assets. On the other hand, expanding fiscal deficits heighten the risk of default, which undermines its status as "safe assets", he added.The US abuse of financial sanctions due to dollar hegemony and the high national debt are eroding the credibility of the dollar, diminishing international investors' confidence, Chen said.Tian attributed the downgrades to governance failure and the shortsightedness of bipartisan politics.Despite the considerable amount of federal debt, it is not getting much attention from the contenders for the White House, US media reported."National debt primarily functions as a financial tool rather than being shouldered directly by households, making it less of a focus for US voters," Tian said."Hardly can both parties find a solution as debt is not a problem that can be fixed in one or two administrations," Ke said. It is an "elephant in the room" as the two parties diverge on how to reduce debt, she added.According to her, the US political system, with its frequent changes in administration, makes it challenging to maintain a consistent long-term goal.Chen said to effectively address the debt problem, the US government could either raise taxes or cut social welfare spending. However, higher taxes might dampen business sentiments, while cutting welfare could result in social discontent, making both options difficult to implement.Tian warned of the potential risks brought by the surge in national debt as it could push up borrowing costs and increase risks to global financial stability, putting pressure on the economic growth of developing countries.If the US debt problem leads to a global reassessment of the dollar's status, it could profoundly impact the international trade system that relies on the dollar, Ke added.NEW YORK -- An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.0 jolted Southern California at 19:20:24 GMT on Monday, the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences said.The epicenter, with a depth of 10.0 km, was initially determined to be at 33.91 degrees north latitude and 118.30 degrees west longitude.United by musical instruments and shared melodies, over 700 young musicians from around the world participated in the World Orchestra Week in New York from Aug 1 to 7.Over seven consecutive days in Carnegie Hall, youth orchestras took turns performing on stage, collaborating with top conductors and soloists.Five youth orchestras from Africa, Asia, Europe and South America collaborated with US orchestras in New York City. Participants included the National Children's Symphony of Venezuela, Beijing Youth Orchestra and the National Youth Orchestra of the USA, or NYO-USA."Everyone is here for one thing, music. Hearing each other's pieces and stuff will definitely bring us closer," Jeremiah La Fayette, an 18-year-old from Tampa, Florida, who plays the viola in the NYOUSA, told China Daily."Since this is the place where I live, and people are coming from across the world, I'd like to help as much as possible to make them feel comfortable and make them new friends over here."Sydney Richardson, 17, from East Texas, told China Daily that even though there are some language barriers with friends from other countries, they still can read different lines of other orchestra's pieces and play music together."Music is the language of the world, and it's the only thing that no matter where you're from, you will understand the notes and staff, the rhythm and everything," she said.Richardson said she received a bookmark with a little panda on it from her new Chinese friends.Liu Fenghe, an 18-year-old cello player from Beijing, told China Daily that it was fun to discuss music with US musicians."Music and culture are closely linked. On the pentatonic scale, Chinese music places more emphasis on melody, while Western music, with its triadic harmonies, focuses more on the interplay between different parts. This is why we can observe both the similarities and differences in music brought about by culture," he said.The Beijing Youth Orchestra made its debut performance in the United States on Aug 4 at Carnegie Hall. The orchestra, established on June 23, is made up of 130 young musicians from schools such as the Central Conservatory of Music.They performed selections of masterpieces from both Chinese and Western music, such as Bao Yuankai's Chinese Sights and Sounds, Zhao Jiping's Pipa Concerto No 2 and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No 5 in E minor."For me, it was quite a challenge," Jin Zhicheng, a horn player of the Beijing Youth Orchestra, told China Daily. "Our orchestra was just established, and it was my first time performing such large pieces. Seeing the reaction from the New York audience gave me a great sense of accomplishment."Traditional instrument"I think the audience here is incredibly enthusiastic. I felt especially proud when I introduced the traditional Chinese instrument, the pipa, before the performance," Wang Fucan, 17, principal cellist of the Beijing Youth Orchestra, told China Daily.He explained to the audience the sounds of the pipa and its connection to the Silk Road."On the first day the orchestra was established, I told the students that we must showcase our passion for music, art and life," Lyu Jia, conductor of the Beijing Youth Orchestra, told China Daily."Through music, they gained a profound spiritual experience and felt the charm of both Chinese and Western cultures, confidently performing on a world-renowned stage. I believe this experience will be life-changing and incredibly beneficial for them."Sarah Johnson, chief education officer at Carnegie Hall, told China Daily that it was not only about music, but also cultural exchanges."In music, you don't need words. You don't need language. Music as a bridge builder, a safe collaborative space for people to share experiences, and now it's time for the younger generation," she said.Clive Gillinson, executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, told China Daily that it has been a dream for quite a long time to create a national youth orchestra week at Carnegie Hall.Zhang Yao, vice-president of the China National Centre for the Performing Arts, or NCPA, told China Daily that when the Philadelphia Orchestra made its groundbreaking tour 51 years ago, its performances significantly contributed to US-China relations."Symphony music can contribute to the friendship between China and the US," he said. "We especially hope that more foreign friends and young people will come to the NCPA to perform, watch performances and learn about Chinese culture."mingmeili@chinadailyusa.comThe Institute of High Energy Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) held a memorial service on Sunday for Tsung-Dao Lee, the renowned physicist and Nobel laureate. More than 330 academicians, experts, representatives from over 30 universities and research institutions, and individuals from various sectors gathered to honor Lee's legacy.Wei Zhixiang, deputy director of the CAS Bureau of Frontier Science and Basic Research, highlighted Lee's unwavering support for basic research in China. Lee played a pivotal role in advancing the nation's scientific talent and fostering international collaboration, particularly between China and the United States, through his active participation in China-US academic exchanges.Gao Yuanning, an academician and dean of the School of Physics at Peking University, acknowledged Lee's visionary contributions to the development of the physics discipline at the university. Lee was instrumental in promoting high-level talent cultivation, interdisciplinary research, and international cooperation in physics and related fields.Zhou Shangui, director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at CAS, noted that the institute's growth and success were significantly influenced by Lee's recommendations. His initiatives, such as the establishment of the China-US Physics Examination and Application and the National Natural Science Foundation, were particularly impactful.Wang Yifang, director of the Institute of High Energy Physics at CAS, reflected on Lee's six-decade academic career and his remarkable contributions to China's high-energy physics, science education, and talent development."Remembering Lee is our greatest motivation to continue striving. The best way to honor him is by carrying forward his scientific spirit and continuing his unfinished work," Wang said.Lee passed away at his home in San Francisco on Aug 4, 2024. He was 97.China called on the international community to guard against interference and sabotage attempts by the National Endowment for Democracy under the organization's pretext of "promoting democracy", so as to uphold world peace and development and international fairness and justice.In a document released on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced the United States for using the NED for infiltration, interference and subversion purposes against other countries under the guise of democracy, freedom and human rights."This has grossly violated other countries' sovereignty, security and development interests, blatantly breached international law and basic norms of international relations, and severely jeopardized world peace and stability," it said.The NED, acting as the US government's "white gloves", has long engaged in subverting state power in other countries, meddling in other countries' internal affairs, inciting division and confrontation, misleading public opinion and conducting ideological infiltration, the document said.Funded by the US government, the NED is the implementer of the Central Intelligence Agency's covert operations, it said."The idea was that the NED would do somewhat overtly what the CIA had been doing covertly for decades, and thus, hopefully, eliminate the stigma associated with CIA covert activities," the document quoted the late William Blum, a US scholar, as saying.According to a report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, almost all the NED's funds come from the US Congress.Kenneth Wollack, chairman of the NED board of directors, once told the US Congress that the NED's long-term goal was to empower the opponents of US enemies and their ability to change foreign governments.The document said the NED's attempts to overthrow the Iranian government through a human rights movement have been dubbed by Iranian media as "the NED Trojan Horse", disrupting order and inciting unrest in Iran.The NED has supported pro-US media outlets, cultivated "democracy activists" and financed groups for "democracy and freedom" in Arab countries, according to its 2021 Annual Report.The document also noted that the NED has long been infiltrating Europe, co-opting European Union officials and financing "independent media" outlets in Europe to tilt public opinion in favor of Washington.It criticized the NED for inciting division and confrontation to undermine the stability of other countries, saying the NED supports"Taiwan independence" separatist forces, colludes with anti-China destabilizing forces in Hong Kong, supports the anti-China organization "World Uyghur Congress" and shows support for "Tibet independence" activities.The NED has kept changing tactics and gone even further in acting against the historical trends of peace, development and win-win cooperation, it said, adding that its true nature and innumerable misdeeds have drawn strong condemnation from US individuals and global society.Former US Congressman Ron Paul once said that the NED wasted a lot of US taxpayers' money to support foreign politicians and parties favored by the US, and provided "soft money" to fund foreign election activities, but portrayed such manipulation of elections as "promoting democracy".The Russian Foreign Ministry in 2015 listed the NED as an "undesirable organization" and banned its activities in Russia."It is unpopular and despicable for Washington to use the NED as a means of foreign interference as every country has the right to pursue a development path suited to its national realities and the needs of its people," said Wang Congyue, an associate researcher at the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.SAO PAULO -- A passenger plane crashed in the interior of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo on Friday, killing all 61 aboard, the airline company Voepass confirmed.The airline said the number of death was 61, not 62 as initially reported.In a statement, Voepass said the plane that crashed in the city of Vinhedo was carrying 57 passengers and four crew members, and none of them survived the accident.The plane of the Brazilian regional airline was traveling from the city of Cascavel in the southern state of Parana to Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo.The aircraft, which has a capacity to carry 68 passengers, fell on houses in the neighborhood of Capela de Vinhedo.Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called for a minute of silence before starting his participation in an event in the port of Itajai in the southern state of Santa Catarina.The president expressed "total solidarity with families and friends of the victims" on the social platform X. LOS ANGELES -- Media conglomerate Paramount Global announced on Thursday that it will cut 15 percent of its US-based workforce, or about 2,000 jobs, as part of a broader cost-cutting plan.The cuts will focus on two areas, including redundant functions in marketing and communications and in finance, legal, technology and other support roles, said Chris McCarthy, co-chief executive officer of Paramount Global, during a second-quarter earnings conference call."These actions will take place in the coming weeks and will largely be completed by the end of the year," he said, adding that "these are difficult decisions to make."The second-quarter earnings report released on Thursday revealed significant financial challenges for Paramount, which owns CBS, Paramount Pictures and popular cable networks.The company reported a massive operating loss due to a 5.98-billion-US-dollar write-down on the value of its cable TV networks.This devaluation is linked to Paramount's pending acquisition by Skydance Media, which is expected to close by Sept. 30, 2025.The job cuts are part of a previously cost-saving plan announced by Paramount's three co-chief executive officers to reduce annual costs by 500 million dollars ahead of the Skydance merger.This restructuring came as Paramount faced declining revenues in its traditional media operations. Overall revenue for the second quarter fell 11 percent to 6.8 billion dollars, with the company's TV operations -- its largest business segment -- experiencing a 17 percent revenue drop.The decline in TV revenue was attributed to an 11 percent decrease in advertising revenue and a 5 percent reduction in affiliate and subscription fees. These figures reflected the challenges traditional media companies face in an increasingly digital landscape.However, amid the financial turbulence, Paramount's streaming business emerged as a bright spot after turning a profit for the first time, with second-quarter revenue increasing by 13 percent and subscription revenue growing 12 percent year-over-year, according to the report.BEIJING -- For Ramona Klein, a 77-year-old Native Indian woman in America, hunger, physical punishment and forced labor are all she can remember about a former North Dakota Native boarding school at which she stayed beginning at the age of seven.During her stay, Klein was frequently punished by kneeling on the broom handles and was beaten all over her body with a short paddle by the warden."It's a lifelong scar, it's a lifelong wound," she said.Klein's experience epitomizes the tragic history of Aboriginal Americans. The US Interior Department recently released an investigative report showing that at least 973 Native American children died between 1819 and 1969 while attending US government-run or supported boarding schools.Many of those children were abused in boarding schools, forced to convert their beliefs and punished for speaking their Native languages, leaving lasting damage to Aboriginal communities."A WAR ON ABORIGINAL CHILDREN"Since the enactment of the Civilization Fund Act in 1819, the United States has established Native boarding schools on a large scale across the country, forcing Native children to enroll and destroy their cultural roots.The conditions in these schools were deplorable, and many children were subjected to physical punishment and sexual abuse at school, some dying as a result.The US Interior Department's report showed that at least 74 cemeteries had been discovered at 65 former boarding school sites across the United States for the burial of children who died while at school.Native American boarding schools are a gruesome chapter in American history, said American scholar Barbara Landis, "I don't think there's any way to whitewash that."Similar scenarios played out in Canada as well. Native children were taken, most of the time by coerce, to Native residential schools characterized by poor hygiene, physical abuse and hard labor.According to a report released by Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, between the 1840s and the 1990s, the Canadian government established 139 residential schools to which at least 150,000 Aboriginal children were forcibly sent, and more than 4,000 were abused and killed at school. There are more than 1,700 unmarked graves near the former sites of Aboriginal residential schools in many parts of Canada."Those schools were a war on Aboriginal children," said survivor Doris Young.In Australia, to assimilate Aboriginal people, the Australian government instituted a series of policies in the early 20th century that allowed authorities in some federal states to take Aboriginal children from their parents at any time and for any reason and send them to Native boarding schools. In these places, Native children were forced to perform heavy physical labor and endure inhuman abuse.A report released by the Australian government in 1997 estimated that between 1900 and 1980, about one-third of Native children were sent to boarding schools in Australia, dubbed the "Stolen Generation.""DON'T TRY TO TELL ME THIS WASN'T GENOCIDE"From the moment European colonizers set foot on the American continent, they viewed Native peoples as an obstacle to their plundering and a threat to the colonies. To drive out these "savages," the colonists waged wars against the Native Indians, killing and displacing them. However, war proved costly for the colonists, so the first president of the United States, George Washington, and others suggested that bloodshed could be minimized by forcing the Native Americans to assimilate into white culture.In 1881, Carl Schurz, then US Secretary of the Interior, said that the cost of "educating" a Native Indian child was far less than killing a Native Indian in a war. Investing in establishing more boarding schools was not only "a philanthropic act, but also the truest and wisest economy."In the late 1800s, the US government opened the first boarding school for Native Indian children, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, whose founder, Richard Henry Pratt, was the original author of the infamous slogan, "Kill the Indian in him, and save the man." Over the next half-century, nearly 8,000 Aboriginal children attended the school.The Canadian government, "inspired" by the United States, followed suit in establishing residential schools throughout the country and prohibited Native children from entering other schools.The boarding schools in the United States and Canada committed cultural genocide against the "uncivilized" Aboriginal people under the guise of eradicating their "savage" Indigenous cultures and "rescuing them.""Don't try to tell me this wasn't genocide!" survivor Ben Sherman said, "They went after our language, our culture, our family ties, our land. They succeeded on almost every level."Data from the Statistics Canada 2021 Census shows that most of Canada's over 70 Aboriginal languages are on the verge of disappearing, with only 13.1 percent of Aboriginal people being able to speak their Native languages fluently.STOLEN LANDMany have noticed the sins of Aboriginal boarding schools but rarely discussed the motive behind the policy of cultural genocide.The report of the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered a clear answer -- the government "wished to divest itself of its legal and financial obligations to Aboriginal people and gain control over their land and resources."According to the statistics of American researchers, from 1887 to 1933, the US government plundered about 360,000 square kilometers of land from the Native Indians through unequal agreements, excessive expropriation or massacre.The period of the greatest expansion of the boarding school system coincided with the colossal theft of Indigenous land, said Brenda Child, a professor at the University of Minnesota in the United States.The land taken from the Native Indians, along with its underground resources, was allocated by the government to public institutions such as colleges and universities.Professor Child's University of Minnesota was one of the institutions built on the "stolen" land. According to a report released by the US news portal Grist in February, since its establishment in 1851, the University of Minnesota has taken more than 750 square kilometers of land from Aboriginal tribes through relevant legislation.The university reaps huge benefits by renting or selling land, grazing, mining and other activities. Between 2018 and 2022, those lands produced more than 17 million US dollars in revenue, primarily through leases for mining iron and taconite, the report said.Australia, which is vast and sparsely populated, has long been recognized by colonists as "terra nullius" -- meaning land belonging to no one. They deprived the Aborigines of their ownership of land through legislation and occupied their land by expulsion and confiscation.In the process of land looting by colonists, many Native Australians were killed, while those who survived lost their food sources as they were deprived of land for agricultural production.According to a study by Australian researchers, the First Nations population went from an estimated 1 to 1.5 million before the invasion in 1788 to less than 100,000 by the early 1900s.LINGERING TRAUMAThe traumatic experience at boarding schools not only caused lifelong trauma but also had a lasting impact on the next generation of Indigenous communities."Our people are still suffering, our youths are suffering, our children are still being born into very dysfunctional families that were created because of the IRS (Indian Residential School) system, so now we have a whole host of problems," said Dawn McIntyre, a descendant of a survivor of the former Beauval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan in central Canada.Residential schools have destroyed Indigenous cultures and family structures, and the experiences of abuse have left Indigenous people suffering from depression, violence and drug addiction.Canadian studies indicated that the lack of formal education in residential schools has resulted in lower literacy skills among the Indigenous people, which leads to lower income levels and higher rates of crime and suicide. Another Canadian study found that children of residential school survivors are at greater risk of sexual and alcohol abuse."It continues to go through generations, and it continues to snowball, and it takes a really great deal of effort for a person to lift themselves out of that," McIntyre said.Indigenous communities in the United States and Australia also suffered from the lingering effects of the boarding school system.Former boarding school attendees were more likely to have chronic physical health conditions, including diabetes, and they had nearly four times the risk of any type of cancer as those who were not subjected to boarding schools, according to a study by Ursula Bear, an assistant professor of Population Health at the University of North Dakota.Notably, Bear also found that someone whose father attended a Native boarding school had more possibilities of having chronic physical health problems than someone whose father did not attend.Australian government statistics showed that the average life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is over eight years lower than that of non-Indigenous Australians, with higher rates of infant mortality, obesity, unemployment and suicide.According to Australian researcher Patrick Wolfe, invasion is a structure, not an event. The suffering of the Indigenous communities is not only from the past but still being perpetuated today."Compulsory residential boarding school education has had profound consequences for several generations of American Indians," said Bear.August 2024IntroductionThe National Endowment for Democracy (NED) acts as the US government's "white gloves." It has long engaged in subverting state power in other countries, meddling in other countries' internal affairs, inciting division and confrontation, misleading public opinion, and conducting ideological infiltration, all under the pretext of promoting democracy. Its innumerable evil deeds have caused grave harm and drawn strong condemnation from the international community.In recent years, NED has kept changing tactics and gone even further in acting against the historical trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation. It has become more notorious for its infiltration, subversion and sabotage attempts against other countries. It is imperative to unmask NED and alert all countries to the need to see through its true colors, guard against and fight back its disruption and sabotage attempts, safeguard their national sovereignty, security and development interests, and uphold world peace and development and international fairness and justice.Ⅰ. NED—the US government's "white gloves"NED claims to be an NGO that provides support for democracy abroad. In fact, it acts as the US government's "white gloves" in carrying out subversion, infiltration and sabotage across the world.1. NED is the implementer of CIA covert operations. In the early days of the Cold War, CIA supported opposition activities in socialist countries in Eastern Europe via "private voluntary organizations" to advance "peaceful evolution." After such activities were exposed in the mid to late 1960s, the US government began contemplating cooperation with civil society organizations to conduct similar activities. Hence the idea of setting up an organization of this kind. As William Blum, an American scholar, wrote, "The idea was that the NED would do somewhat overtly what the CIA had been doing covertly for decades, and thus, hopefully, eliminate the stigma associated with CIA covert activities."Ⅰ2. NED was established under the auspices of the US government. In 1981, after he came into office, President Ronald Reagan intended to promote his "Project Democracy" abroad, and proposed a government-funded and privately-run foundation to openly support "democratic movements abroad." One of the purposes of NED, created in 1983, is to encourage the establishment and growth of democratic development in a manner consistent both with the broad concerns of US national interests and with the specific requirements of the democratic groups in other countries which are aided by programs funded by NED.3. NED is funded by US government. On November 22, 1983, the US Congress passed the NED Act which reiterated the purposes of NED and clarified such issues as congressional appropriations, financial audit by the government, and the requirement to report to the Congress and the President. In 1983, the year when NED was established, the Congress provided US$18 million to NED. Over the past 40-plus years, the volume of congressional appropriations has kept increasing in general. According to data from USAspending.gov, NED received an appropriation of US$315 million in FY2023. As a report of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace revealed, "Almost all the NED's funds come from the US Congress."II4. NED programs are run under the guidance of the US State Department and embassies abroad. As required by the enabling legislation for NED, NED should consult with the State Department on its program plans to seek foreign policy guidance. According to a USAID report "Democracy Promotion Programs Funded by the US Government," NED consults on an ongoing basis with the State Department, through the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, with USIA and with US embassies abroad on programmatic matters.5. NED reports to the US government on its work and accepts audit and oversight by the government. According to the NED Act, NED shall submit to the President an annual report for the preceding fiscal year no later than December 31 of each year. The report should include NED's operations, activities and accomplishments. Audit of NED is conducted annually by the US Government General Accounting Office. A report of each audit shall be made to the Congress, and a copy of each report shall be furnished to the President.6. The US government has access to information on all NED-funded programs. According to the NED Act, NED or any of its duly authorized representatives shall have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the recipient pertinent to assistance provided through NED. The US Comptroller General or any of his duly authorized representatives shall also have access thereto.7. NED's mandate is endorsed by the US government. Philip Agee, a former CIA officer, said on a 1995 TV show, "Nowadays, instead of having just the CIA going around behind the scenes and trying to manipulate the process secretly by inserting money here and instructions there and so forth, they have now a sidekick, which is this National Endowment for Democracy, NED." In a report entitled "The National Endowment for Democracy: A Prudent Investment in the Future," Kim Holmes, former Assistant Secretary of State, argues that "Funding the NED is a prudent investment because it is far less expensive to aid friendly democrats than it is to defend against hostile dictatorships."II. Instigating color revolutions to subvert state power in other countries1. Attempting to overthrow the Iranian government. In September 2022, protests against hijab rules broke out in Iran. Masih Alinejad, a reporter for the Voice of America Persian Service, released batches of unverified information and pictures to incite public sentiments. According to Al Mayadeen, a Lebanese news channel, between 2015 and 2022, Masih Alinejad received US$628,000 in funding from NED and some other American institutions. Iran Daily cited a document from Iran's Revolutionary Guards as saying that NED used its ties with Masih Alinejad to interfere in Iran's internal affairs during the hijab protests. In the meantime, NED also supported the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) and the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) in their fabrication of fake news, and supported dissidents in working with anti-government organizations and media outlets to stage smear campaigns. NED regularly published commentaries on its Journal of Democracy to call for a regime change in Iran through human rights movement. NED is dubbed by Iranian media as a "National Enemy for Democracy" and "the NED Trojan" disrupting order and inciting unrest in Iran.2. Using various tactics to infiltrate Arab countries. Since the start of the Arab Spring, NED has made extensive use of social media platforms and funded NGOs for releasing multimedia content and providing online training, in a bid to instigate color revolutions. NED has also run a talent reserve program for democratic transition in the region, funded NGOs to help "supporters of democracy," "human rights activists" and "dissidents" in exile, encouraged local trade unions to strengthen capacity building, and supported scholars and activists in plotting "constitutional reforms" in various countries.3. Playing a part in Ukraine's "color revolution." During the 2004 Orange Revolution, NED provided US$65 million to the Ukrainian opposition. Between 2007 and 2015, NED allocated more than US$30 million to support Ukrainian NGOs and promote "civic participation." During the 2013-2014 Euromaidan, NED financed the Mass Media Institute to spread inflammatory information. NED also spent tens of millions of dollars in the use of such social media platforms as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram to spread disinformation, heighten ethnic tensions in Ukraine, and stir up ethnic antagonism in eastern Ukraine.4. Attempting to overthrow the DPRK government. In July 2002, NED President Carl Gershman told the media that NED was working with the Congress to carry out activities through a number of NGOs and sway public opinion regarding the DPRK, with a view to undermining the DPRK system. In July 2021, Gershman told the media that thanks to NED-funded human rights programs, "The totalitarian system [in the DPRK] is beginning to erode, and eventually this will bring about the system's unraveling."Ⅲ. Colluding with all sorts of elements to meddle in other countries' internal affairs1. Cultivating pro-US forces in target countries◆According to its 2021 Annual Report, NED supported pro-US media outlets, cultivated "democracy activists," and financed groups for "democracy and freedom" in Arab countries.◆In May 2021, NED President Carl Gershman said that despite being prohibited from Russia, NED funded the operation of a large number of organizations in Russia and supported Russian opposition figures in exile in their struggle against the Russian government at important political junctures, such as the State Duma, presidential and local elections.Ⅲ◆NED has long been infiltrating Europe and co-opting EU officials. It has been encouraging voice for transatlanticism within EU institutions while suppressing voice for strategic autonomy, and financing "independent media" in Europe to tilt public opinion in favor of the US.◆ Taking Mexico as a major target country for infiltration, NED has supported organizations like the Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity (MCCI) and the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO), and obstructed the electricity reform in Mexico. In 2021, the Mexican government sent a note to the US government condemning NED's funding of anti-government organizations in Mexico as "an act of interventionism" "promoting a coup."◆ Since 2017, NED has funded 54 anti-Cuba organizations. In 2018, the Cuban Democratic Directorate, an anti-government organization, said that it had received "democracy funds" from the US and paid US$48,000 to its employees, agents and contractors in Cuba.◆Over the years, NED has been funding scholars and journalists to promote "democratization reforms" in Iran and carry out cultural infiltration against Iran.2. Misrepresenting the human rights situation in other countries◆The NED-sponsored Journal of Democracy habitually holds developing countries to the standard of American-style democracy and criticizes their presidential elections, economic policies, human rights situations, and democratic transitions.◆In July 2023, the Journal of Democracy published five articles on Indian democracy under the theme of "Is India Still a Democracy," claiming that since Prime Minister Narendra Modi rose to power, his government has engaged in what is, by some accounts, a wholesale dismantling of democratic institutions, norms, and practices. In April 2024, the Journal of Democracy published an article "Why This Election Is India's Most Important," claiming that democratic governance in India has been steadily eroding since Modi's second term began and that the future of India as a plural, secular democracy could be on the line if Prime Minister Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party win a third consecutive term.◆Having classified members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as "dictatorships," NED has continued to export its values to those countries through academic, cultural and media activities. According to the NED website and other sources, NED launched 11 programs in the GCC countries in 2021 with an investment of US$1.8 million, to support "democracy activists," slam the human rights record of those countries, and stoke social tensions in the name of promoting freedom of the press.3. Manipulating and interfering in other countries' elections◆ In April 2022 and December 2023, Serbia held its presidential, National Assembly and local elections. NED interfered in the entire election process, and went all out to root for pro-US opposition candidates in the run-up to the elections. In May 2023, after two consecutive shooting incidents in Serbia, NED-sponsored human rights groups and pro-US opposition organizations staged mass demonstrations to demand the resignation of the Serbian gov ernment.◆NED has long been financing the Philippines' Rappler news website. According to a report on the NED website, between 2017 and 2021, Rappler received a total of US$786,000 in funding from NED. During the 2022 general election, Rappler lobbied the Philippines' Commission on Elections for access to internal information including election trends and campaign spending of candidates, which raised questions from various quarters about the fairness and independence of the election. The authorized access was eventually revoked under intense public pressure.◆NED has long funded anti-Iran organizations such as the Foundation for Democracy in Iran (FDI) to sabotage elections. This has been admitted in an article by American social activist Kenneth R. Timmerman, the executive director of FDI.◆In January 2023, Damon Wilson, President of NED, publicly expressed concerns about democracy and fairness of the Nigerian general election during his interview with a Nigerian TV program.Ⅳ. Inciting division and confrontation to undermine the stability of other countriesKenneth Wollak, chairman of the NED board of directors, once told the US Congress NED's long-term efforts to empower the opponents of US enemies and their abilities to change foreign governments.Ⅳ1. Supporting "Taiwan independence" separatist forces. In 2022, NED and the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party authorities co-hosted a Global Assembly of the World Movement for Democracy and invited European parliamentarians and think tank representatives. They tried to mobilize "democratic forces" to open up the "frontline of democratic struggle in the East" and hype up the false narrative of "Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow." In July 2023, NED President Damon Wilson went to Taiwan for the 20th anniversary celebration of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, and presented a "Democracy Service Medal" to Tsai Ing-wen.2. Colluding with anti-China destabilizing forces in Hong Kong. NED has long been colluding with those who attempt to destabilize Hong Kong by providing funds and public support. In 2020, NED set up several projects under its Hong Kong-related program with a total amount of over US$310,000 to fund those attempting to destabilize Hong Kong. In 2023, NED colluded with organizations such as the Hong Kong Watch and Amnesty International, as well as anti-China lawmakers from the US, UK and Germany, and nominated Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, one of the elements bent on destabilizing Hong Kong, for the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize.3. NED has long supported the anti-China organization "World Uyghur Congress (WUC)," with average annual funding ranging from US$5 million to US$6 million. In March 2024, NED invited a "WUC" leader to speak at its event, smearing China's ethnic policies and the development of regions with large ethnic minority populations.NED provided financial support to Hidayet Oguzhan, leader of the "East Turkistan Education and Solidarity Association," and instructed Hidayet Oguzhan to ramp up anti-China rallies and sow discord between China and Türkiye. NED also funded Rushan Abbas, the head of an "East Turkistan" organization, so that she could frequently visit Türkiye and work with "East Turkistan" forces to stir up trouble.4. In March 2023, NED President Damon Wilson led a NED delegation to Dharamsala, India, to meet with "Tibet independence" leaders and show support for "Tibet independence" activities. In November 2023, NED gave the Democracy Award for Individual Courage to Jigme Gyatso, a "Tibet independence" activist. In April 2024, NED invited the "Kalon Tripa" of the "Tibetan government-in-exile" Penpa Tsering to its headquarters.5. NED funded the establishment of three local NGO groupings in Georgia at the beginning of the 21st century to organize demonstrations in capital Tbilisi. In May 2024, NED rallied support for and instigated protests in Georgia against the foreign agents bill.Ⅴ. Fabricating false information to mislead public opinion1. NED President Damon Wilson, in an interview with Asahi Shimbun, falsely alleged that China used technical means and AI to surveil citizens. On November 30, 2023, NED Vice President Christopher Walker made up lies about CPC monopolizing ideas when testifying before the US House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. Ⅴ2. NED-backed Serbian NGOs coordinated with CNN's Serbia branch to fabricate China-related fake news, slandering projects undertaken by the Chinese side and hyping up so-called environmental protection, labor and corruption issues.3. NED funded the International Republican Institute (IRI) to launch the second phase of the Bolstering Europe Against the Subversive Tactics of the CPC project, which fabricates and disseminates the so-called threat of CPC to democratic values and transatlantic solidarity.4. NED invested US$17.41 million to carry out 92 projects on "DPRK defectors." It funded ROK NGOs to run DPRK-themed radios, producing and broadcasting on a weekly basis stories about "DPRK defectors" from the perspective of "democracy and human rights." It created DPRK-themed online publications to spread negative news about the DPRK, trained "defectors" to become reporters, and encouraged them to defame the DPRK by writing online posts and attending video interviews.5. NED formed an information matrix against Iran together with Iran International, the Persian service of VOA and BBC, and other anti-Iran media. Negative information is provided to anti-Iran media by NED and its affiliated agencies to instigate intensive news coverage against Iran.Ⅵ. Using "academic activities" as a cloak for interference and infiltration1. NED funded the Governance Center for Public Policies (GCPP) in Iraq, which released the National Index for Democratic Transformation in Iraq report for six consecutive years, giving low scores every time to Iraq's democracy, and categorizing Iraq as a "partial authoritarian transitional" country. People from across the society in Iraq disapprove the report as it did not truthfully reflect Iraq's progress in government administration, social governance, democracy and legal system. They believe the purpose of keeping the scores low is to provide excuses for continued US interference in Iraq's internal affairs and postponement of its military withdrawal.2. In March 2024, NED's core grantee institution Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE), together with the Philippines Makati Business Club and other associations, jointly published the first State of Sustainability Reporting in the Philippines, unfairly imposing upon the Philippines carbon emission standards and obligations of the US and other industrialized countries in the West to pressure the government of the Philippines to change the country's economic structure.3. NED provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding to the European Values Center for Security Policy (EVC), Global Security Center (GSC) and other think tanks to organize various seminars and activities that incite the EU to follow suit with the US "small yard, high fence" policy.4. Since the beginning of the Ukraine crisis, the NED-funded Belgrade Center for Security Policy has supported protests by pro-Western demonstrations and criticized Serbia's foreign policy.5. From January 2022 to January 2023, NED funded, through Atlas Network, the Turkish digital media platform daktilo1984.com, and supported activities on this platform that spread discontent and incite ethnic tension, social conflict and political differences.6. NED has long funded NGOs in "Kosovo" to instigate tension between the Serbian government and the Pristina provisional self-governance institution. In December 2023, the NED-funded think tank Sbunker released a report saying that "Kosovo" is a relatively successful case of American support for nation building and promotion of democracy, an attempt to whitewash US' true intention to invade and split other countries.7. NED used social media to wage information warfare against Iran. During the protests against hijab rules, a large number of social media bots with a big following emerged, disguising as personal accounts or independent media to spread anti-Iran information and mislead the public.8. NED and USAID funded multiple Ukrainian organizations to serve as "fact-checkers" of Ukraine's social media. But such "fact-checking" is in fact an information filter created by the US on the Ukrainian Internet to deceive the Ukrainian people.Ⅶ. NED exposed and criticized by the US and the international community1. NED's true nature exposed by Americans◆Former federal congressman Ron Paul once posted that NED wasted a lot of American taxpayers' money to support foreign politicians and parties favored by the US, and such actions clearly violate the domestic law of the United States. NED provided "soft money" to fund foreign elections but portrayed such manipulation of election as "promoting democracy."◆Former federal congressman Barney Frank called for cutting the funding for NED in the 1980s. He argued that giving money to a French union for political purposes, rather than funding public transportation or research on cancer, is not reasonable.◆The New York Times published "Mixed US Signals Helped Tilt Haiti Toward Chaos" in January 29, 2006, which reveals how the US government subverted, through NED, Haiti's democratically elected government.◆In September 2021, Stephen Kinzer, a former reporter of The New York Times, published articles in the New York Review of Books website unveiling that NED collaborates with CIA and USAID to support insurgent forces in other countries in a bid to overthrow regimes that the US dislikes. According to the articles, early members of the NED board of directors were mostly warmongers, and among the current board members are former federal senators enthusiastic about regime change in Cuba and Nicaragua. The mission of NED is to overthrow unfriendly foreign governments and install regimes more in line with American interests.2. NED's misdeeds exposed and criticized by the international community◆On July 29, 2015, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement officially listing NED as an "undesirable organization" and banned its activities within Russian territory. The statement said the US Department of State had made a clearly hypocritical statement about being "deeply troubled" over the fate of Russian civic society. Most of NED's projects aimed to destabilize the domestic situation in countries trying to pursue an independent policy in line with its own national interests rather than following Washington's lead.◆In May 2022, the Russian news agency TASS reported that when interviewed by the magazine National Defense, Russia's Assistant Secretary of the Security Council Nail Mukhitov commented that NED mainly affects young people, attempting to erode their patriotism and downplay the role of Russia in the modern world order. Using "liberating the people" as an excuse, the West attempts to install negative views about Russia in its citizens.◆French journalist Frédéric Charpier published the book CIA in France: 60 Years of Interference in French Affairs in 2008, revealing NED activities in France, and stated that NED relies on disbursement from three agencies—US State Department, USIA, and USAID, and serves the US diplomatic and military policies.◆In 2010, the French website Voltaire Network published an article by its founder, Thierry Meyssan, titled "NED, the Legal Window of the CIA," exposing NED's direct involvement in French NGOs, its interference in French elections, among other misdeeds.◆In 2018, the Hungarian media Figyelo blacklisted the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a civil human rights organization funded by NED, as "Soros mercenaries," accusing it of colluding with foreign forces and undermining the stability of Hungary.◆In April 2023, NED opened funding applications to recruit non-partisan, independent media seeking to defend human rights and the rule of law, and support freedom of speech. Stephen Kinzer, former reporter of The New York Times, cautioned world governments that NED's sole purpose is training people to destabilize governments that Washington disapproves.◆The Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of Russia pointed out in its article "the National Endowment for Democracy at 40: Back to Basics?" that NED allows the US government to pursue a simultaneous two-level foreign policy with current dictatorial governments, in which the US government maintains relations, while NED works at the sub-state level over the long term to cultivate required political forces capable of replacing these governments in the future. NED can play a role in sensitive areas where government programs are inconvenient.◆In June 2023, Agencia Brasil quoted Camila Feix Vidal, professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, as saying that NED is strong evidence of democracy being used as a pretext for seeking gains and a moral excuse for meddling in other countries.◆In 2016, the Indian government put NED under watch list due to its donation to NGOs in contravention of the provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act.ConclusionUnder the guise of democracy, freedom, and human rights, the United States has used NED for infiltration, interference and subversion against other countries. This has grossly violated other countries' sovereignty, security and development interests, blatantly breached international law and basic norms of international relations, and severely jeopardized world peace and stability. Such unpopular and despicable acts are firmly opposed by the international community.The world is moving toward multipolarity, and there need to be greater democracy in international relations. Every country has the right to pursue a development path suited to its national realities and the needs of its people. No country is in a position to lecture others on democracy and human rights, still less using democracy and human rights as excuses to infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries, interfere in their internal affairs and incite ideological confrontation. Following humanity's common values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, members of the international community should engage in exchanges and dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and equality, and work together to contribute to the progress of humanity.NoteⅠ.William Henry Blum, Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower, Zed book, 2006II.Thomas Carothers, Benjamin Feldman, Examining U.S. Relations with Authoritarian Countries, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Dec.2023Ⅲ.RT, American 'Regime change' specialists NED claim credit for Belarus protests & boast of funding Russian opposition during prank call, 17th May, 2021Ⅳ.Edward Hunt, NED Pursues Regime Change by Playing the Long Game, Counterpunch, 6th July, 2018Ⅴ.U.S. House of Representatives Document Repository: docs.house.govLOS ANGELES -- Two US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts find themselves on an unexpectedly extended mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as technical issues plague their return spacecraft, Boeing's Starliner.The intended short test mission has stretched beyond 60 days, with no definite return date in prospect.During a press conference on Wednesday, Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, said that "we could take either path," either returning the astronauts on Starliner or seeking an alternative method of using SpaceX.On June 5, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams were launched to the ISS as part of Starliner's first crewed test flight, and multiple technical problems have since occurred.The issues plaguing Starliner include failures in the reaction control system (RCS) thrusters, which are crucial for the spacecraft's maneuverability and safe return to Earth, and helium leaks in the propulsion system. These problems have raised concerns about the capsule's safety and reliability.The space agency is seriously considering a backup plan involving a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule to bring the two back to Earth. This contingency could extend their stay in space to approximately eight months, with a potential return date around February 2025, according to Wednesday's briefing.Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program, revealed that planning for this backup option began last month. "We started in early July, doing some early planning with SpaceX for some of these contingencies," Stich explained. "Then, as we got closer and got a little bit more data, we started to put a few more things in place."The Starliner issues have broader implications for NASA's commercial crew program. The agency has long emphasized the importance of having multiple providers for crew transportation to ensure redundancy and continuous access to the ISS. SpaceX has been successfully ferrying astronauts to and from the station since 2020, while Boeing has faced repeated setbacks and delays with its Starliner program.These latest complications have resulted in additional financial strain for Boeing. The company has recently announced a 125-million-US-dollar write-off related to unplanned costs for the Starliner program, adding to 1.5 billion dollars in previous write-offs.NASA has pushed back the launch of the next SpaceX Crew Dragon mission, originally scheduled for Aug. 18, to no earlier than Sept. 24. This delay provides additional time for decision-making regarding Starliner and potential crew adjustments.If implemented, the contingency plan would involve sending only two astronauts instead of the usual four on the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight. Wilmore and Williams would join the space station crew as full-fledged members for a six-month stay and return on the Crew Dragon around February 2025.During their extended stay, Wilmore and Williams have been fully integrated into the ISS crew, participating in various scientific experiments and maintenance tasks.Their activities include conducting ultrasound scans to study how space affects human veins, working on manufacturing higher-quality optical fibers in microgravity experiments, and participating in fluid physics studies to understand how to manage liquids without gravity.Additionally, they have been involved in routine maintenance tasks, including some less glamorous chores like toilet maintenance. They also had to take emergency precautions when a defunct Russian satellite broke apart near the ISS, forcing them to prepare for a potential evacuation.A final decision on whether to proceed with the Starliner return or switch to the SpaceX backup plan is expected by mid-August. Until then, Wilmore and Williams will continue their extended stay aboard the ISS.Argentina's economic relationship with China has become increasingly important, with growing trade highlighted by increasing beef exports from the South American country."For Argentina, maintaining and strengthening ties with China is crucially important for its economy, as it provides market diversification, investments and financing benefits," Alejandro Marco del Pont, an international relations expert at Argentina's National University of La Plata, or UNLP, said.Between 2017 and 2022, Argentina's exports to China grew by 12.8 percent per year, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a data visualization tool for international trade. Although the value of exports fell last year, growth picked up again this year.In May, China imported $525 million worth of Argentine products, mostly made up of soybeans, other grains and meat.Argentina is one of the world's major beef exporters and China has emerged as one of the largest importers. China is Argentina's second-largest trading partner after neighbor Brazil and the top market for its beef exports.Argentina's beef exports to China reached 234,000 metric tons in the first five months of this year, representing 75.8 percent of Argentina's total beef exports.China has implemented measures to ensure food security and meet the increased appetite for high-quality protein sources. In 2017, China expanded bilateral and multilateral trade agreements and overseas agricultural activities under its Belt and Road Initiative, which includes Argentina.Major boostChina's projected rise in Argentine beef imports this year is set to provide a major economic boost for the Latin American country as it struggles to shake off a years-long economic crisis.This progression underscores Argentina's heavy reliance on China for its economic growth and export diversification.In 2003, China was Argentina's fourth-largest trading partner. By 2022, China had risen to second place, making up 21 percent of Argentina's imports and 9 percent of its exports."While the diplomatic relationship between China and Argentina dates back to their establishment of ties in 1972, their commercial relationship really picked up after the signing of a strategic cooperation agreement in 2004," Sebastian Schulz, a sociologist at UNLP, said.Argentina stands to benefit from China's economic opening-up and promotion of globalization by increasing its beef exports, said Schulz, an expert on Chinese studies.With the signing of recent trade deals, Schulz noted that both nations emphasized diversifying their trade baskets, presenting opportunities for Argentina's industrial businesses.Schulz said China and Argentina have complementary economies and there are opportunities to deepen the commercial relationship through synergies."Considering China's decision to deepen commercial opening to the rest of the world, Argentina could further increase export volumes to the Asian country," Schulz said."This could help Argentina balance trade and diversify exports, bringing in more foreign currency crucial for national development and boosting growth in medium- and high-tech industries."The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.NEW YORK -- Former US president Donald Trump and incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris have agreed to a Sept 10 debate on ABC, the network said on Thursday.Both Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and Harris, his Democratic counterpart, have confirmed their participation in the debate, said the network in a statement.The 90-minute debate is expected to be held in Philadelphia, and the ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis will serve as moderators, according to The New York Times. The debate will probably be held without a live audience, but the exact format and ground rules are still being determined, the report said, quoting two people with knowledge of the plans.The announcement followed a Trump news conference in Palm Beach, Florida, during which he proposed three debates with Harris. Trump had previously agreed to debate President Joe Biden on Sept. 10, but pulled out after Biden withdrew from the Democratic ticket.Trump also said that he would debate Harris on two other occasions, at events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. But the Harris campaign has not agreed to those debates, which were not part of the original debate schedule that Biden and Trump had agreed upon in May.At this year's previous debate in June, Biden's shaky and diminished performance set off a panic among Democrats that ultimately led to the president ceding his spot atop his party's ticket.It was another US-China exchange, only this one was not focused on weighty issues such as trade or politics but on literary scholarship.About a dozen literary scholars from China and the United States gathered at the University of Houston on Tuesday for a symposium on topics including literature and art criticism, translation, and artificial intelligence and human writing.Also featured was the book Essentials of Chinese Literature and Art Criticism Volume I. The collection of theoretical critiques penned by eminent contemporary Chinese literary and art critics offers a detailed analysis of China's view of literature and art theory, as well as critical practice from the ancient to the modern period. The book will be available to the public in November.Xu Yuechun, vice-chairman and secretary-general of the Chinese Literature and Art Critics Association, and director of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Literature and Art Criticism Center, is the book's co-editor."I hope this book will work as a bridge for the exchanges on literature critics between China and the world, and for deepening such dialogues," Xu said, adding that the book collected the best works in 2021 and 2022.The US already has a rich collection of Chinese traditional artworks, he said, and the two countries share a long history of cultural and art exchange and cooperation, with influences on both sides to inspire each other.Xu said Chinese tradition calls for "harmony in diversity" and that he hopes the book will help the world better understand Chinese scholars' literary thinking.Karen Thornber, professor of literature and East Asian languages and civilizations at Harvard University, said via video link that although she had only enough time to skim through the book, she deemed it "a wonderful opportunity for English-speaking scholars to have access to first-rate or more first-rate Chinese scholarship on a range of topics in the arts and humanities".Fundamental reasonZhang Qingmin, director of the Literature and Art Research Center at Henan University, who shared his thoughts on current Chinese literary and art criticism, said the Chinese scholars essentially presented the fundamental reason "why we view art and aesthetics 'this way, not that way'"."I believe that our American colleagues have received these messages," he said.Haun Saussy, a professor at the University of Chicago, using a 1687 Latin translation of Confucius' sayings, showed how translation does not actually reproduce an original. Instead, it produces an interpretation of an original — but in another language.Zhang said Janell Watson, a professor from Virginia Tech, "focused on the topic of whether AI brings unlimited possibilities to artistic creation or the 'death of the author', and explored how literature and art can … influence technology in the process of technological innovation and artistic development"."Many new ideas and new viewpoints presented by everyone are very inspiring for us to explore and build a Chinese literary theory and criticism discourse system from a global perspective," Zhang said.Alessandro Carrera, chair of the Department of Modern and Classical Languages at the University of Houston, shared his love of Chinese literature. Carrera said he has a collection of Chinese classics in translation, such as The Book of Changes, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The Dream of the Red Chamber.He said the first Chinese novel he read was The Chess Master by Ah Cheng, published in 1984, which he called "a short novel that really opened a world for me and made me want to read more and to look for other authors".Recalling Europe's interactions with Chinese literature, Carrera, a native of Italy, talked about Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit priest who was the first European man to enter the Forbidden City in Beijing, in 1601, and became "a great scholar of Chinese culture".California Governor Gavin Newsom declared "California Panda Day" to celebrate the first public appearance of two new giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo on Thursday."This week, California is proud to celebrate another iconic bear as a pair of giant pandas make their public debut at the San Diego Zoo," said the proclamation, which was released on Wednesday.Newsom, who traveled to China last year to discuss issues including economic development and ways to address climate change, said that the conservation collaboration exemplifies the long-standing history of California and China working together toward common goals."We hope that the newly arrived panda 'envoys of friendship' will lead to further exchanges and cooperation between California and China," he said in the statement.Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, who arrived at the end of June, are the first pandas to enter the United States in over two decades. After several weeks of acclimating to their new surroundings, they made their official debut at the Zoo's Panda Ridge on Thursday.Panda Ridge has been designed to replicate the pandas' native habitat as closely as possible, offering them a comfortable and engaging space in which to live and thrive. It features lush vegetation, bamboo groves and various items to stimulate the pandas' natural behavior.Yun Chuan prefers to rest lazily on the climbing frames, while Xin Bao, the smaller of the two, is smart and curious, making the most of her opportunities to explore everything around her.Together, the two pandas consume up to 18 kilograms of locally grown bamboo each day.At an exclusive media preview on Wednesday, hundreds of panda enthusiasts got a sneak peek at the pandas. Many expressed their excitement about the return of pandas to the zoo, noting that they are an integral part of San Diego's history."We felt really sad, the whole city was sad when the pandas left," said zoo visitor Sheron Natalie. "We waited and waited, and finally they came back. We are so happy."Jessica Chenoweth was likewise enthusiastic. "They're now coming back. It feels like this is their family's home, and I can't wait to bring my son later to see them firsthand," she said.Adriana Sanchez, a website operator from Mexico, said she will promote the pandas on her site, which has 13,000 followers who are mothers. "We have a song about pandas, and we all love to sing it in Mexico City," she said.A visitor identified only as Noreen said that the pandas "represent a real sense of peace. That panda right there is a signal of diplomacy between the United States and China. We hope it's a good beginning to bring them back together."San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, who visited China in June to participate in farewell ceremonies for the panda pair before they began their journey to the US, said that Yun Chuan and Xin Bao symbolize the enduring friendship between the two countries.Since the arrival of the pair, the San Diego Zoo has collaborated with Chinese experts to meet the pandas' dietary needs and preferences. Veterinary teams from both the US and China are closely monitoring various health factors, including weight and appetite, to ensure that the pandas thrive.Staff members have provided the pandas with a variety of fresh bamboo, along with a local adaptation of a traditional Chinese bun called "panda bread".Pandas are solitary animals in the wild and are housed separately in zoos, except during the brief breeding season. San Diego Zoo officials hope the pandas will eventually produce cubs, with the first opportunity likely to occur next spring or the following year.SAN DIEGO, the United States - To celebrate the highly anticipated public debut of two giant pandas -- Yun Chuan and Xin Bao -- at the San Diego Zoo on Thursday, California Governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday proclaimed Aug 8 as California Panda Day.The two iconic black and white bears landed in California from China on June 27 for 10-year international giant panda protection cooperation with San Diego Zoo, marking a new round of such collaboration between the two nations.Newsom called the newly arrived panda pair "envoys of friendship" in a statement, wishing the beloved bears would lead to further exchanges and cooperation between California and China.He pointed out that San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance was the first organization in the United States to establish a cooperative panda conservation program with China."Their innovative conservation science has advanced efforts to protect and care for giant pandas around the world," explained the governor, noting that as a testament to its success, Yun Chuan, the five-year-old male panda was the son of Zhen Zhen, a female panda born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007.Newsom said the conservation collaboration is part of California and China's long history of working together toward shared goals, adding that the Golden State, the largest economy and most populous state in the United States, and China have enjoyed "strong foundation of partnership and deep cultural and economic ties".The governor also pointed out that giant pandas are beloved around the world and their conservation story is an inspiring example of strong partnerships and innovative strategies to protect the world's natural heritage."As the San Diego Zoo welcomes visitors to Panda Ridge this week, I encourage Californians to take this unique opportunity to appreciate one of the most iconic wildlife species and recognize the important partnerships at work to help them thrive for generations to come," he concluded.San Diego Zoo is one of the most visited zoos in the United States. Located north of downtown San Diego in Balboa Park, it is home to more than 12,000 animals representing over 680 species and subspecies.China's leading electric vehicle maker BYD could bring lower-priced cars to the Canadian market, but will have to consider several factors, including the prospect of higher tariffs, an auto industry expert said.A report by Automotive News Canada said BYD is planning to enter the Canadian car market to expand its presence in North America.The company, based in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, already manufactures electric buses in North America.Public documents filed in Ottawa in late July showed that lobbyists representing BYD registered with the federal and Ontario governments to "advise on matters related to the expected market entry of BYD into Canada for the sale of passenger electric vehicles, and the establishment of a new business, and the application of tariffs on EVs".BYD also plans to build a plant in Mexico, which would take two to three years to open, its Americas head Stella Li told Reuters in May.Its competitive pricing could give it an advantage in Canada, said John Holmes, professor emeritus at Queen's University in Ontario, who specializes in the political economy of the North American automobile industry."Unlike the consumer tax credits built into the US Inflation Reduction Act to encourage EV purchases, consumer incentives in Canada are much more modest and vary across provinces. Thus, the relatively high price of EVs currently sold in Canada has slowed the growth of that segment of the automotive market," Holmes told China Daily."Canadian tariffs on imported vehicles from outside the USMCA bloc (vehicles that meet the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement rules of origin and content value) are relatively small. Therefore, imported Chinese-built EVs would enter at a significantly lower price point than EVs currently for sale in Canada."The USMCA increased the requirement for North American-produced components in automobile manufacturing from 62.5 percent over its predecessor, the North American Free Trade Agreement, to 75 percent.Public consultationOttawa opened a monthlong public consultation period on July 2 about possible increased tariffs on Chinese EVs, saying that allowing the vehicles "could lead to an exponential surge of imports that will adversely affect planned EV investments and the transformation of Canada's automotive sector".But the results of the 30-day consultation conducted by Canada's finance minister have not been released.Holmes said BYD would have to consider its prospects if a tariff or surtax similar to those imposed by the US on Chinese EVs, where they are 100 percent, was enacted.It may take BYD some time to satisfy Canadian regulators on safety standards, Holmes added.BYD will also face the challenge of establishing a dealership and service network in Canada, where the majority of the population resides close to the US border."There is also the challenge of range anxiety on the part of consumers, especially given the negative effect of very low winter temperatures on EV battery performance," Holmes said.Agencies contributed to this story.China's recent retrieval of the first-ever samples from the far side of the moon has renewed talks about the possibilities of the United States and China joining in space-based research programs aimed at addressing global challenges, particularly climate change."The US and China each have very innovative space programs, and one area, for example, where the US and China could work together today would be space-based solar," Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, and founding director of the university's Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory, told China Daily.Space-based solar power, a concept involving the collection of solar energy in outer space via satellites and its distribution to Earth, has been gaining traction globally. As countries worldwide invest in research and development for the technology, international organizations are simultaneously pushing for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.The decreasing costs associated with launching materials into space have made the idea of deploying large, kilometer-square, mylar solar panels — which beam power back to Earth using microwaves — increasingly feasible.Kammen, who was a coordinating lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Nobel Peace Prize-winning report in 2007, suggested that the US and China could challenge each other to collaborate on making space-based solar a reality.He emphasized the continuous nature of this energy source: "Space-based solar is on 24/7. There is no nighttime in space. And so, adding space-based solar could be beaming power to Los Angeles to Beijing, to Guangzhou to Shenzhen to San Francisco."Both nations already have made significant strides in this field. In the United States, Caltech's space solar power prototype, launched into orbit last year, has successfully demonstrated its ability to wirelessly transmit power in space and beam detectable power to Earth for the first time.Meanwhile, NASA is developing technologies that will indirectly benefit space-based solar power, including projects focused on autonomous systems, wireless power beaming and in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing, according to a NASA report early this year.China, for its part, has achieved a milestone in its efforts to build a space solar power station in 2022. The China Academy of Space Technology has plans for a space high-voltage transfer and wireless power transmission experiment to be conducted in low Earth orbit by 2028, as outlined in its 2022 publication in the journal China Space Science and Technology.Kammen acknowledged the political sensitivities surrounding such collaboration, particularly regarding data transfers and information-sharing. Despite those challenges, he saw opportunities for cooperation in other areas as well, such as fusion power.He cited the advanced research being conducted at Tsinghua University and China's fusion reactor as potential areas for joint efforts in deployment and new research.Drawing inspiration from popular culture, Kammen referred to the movie The Martian, in which a stranded American astronaut is rescued through a joint effort between the US and China. He saw the fictional scenario as an example of how the two nations could work together in reality, combining their respective technological strengths to achieve common goals."There's an opportunity to work peacefully together in space, to show that no matter who's going to be on the moon next, we have a chance to do clean energy in space as a bridge," said Kammen. Both countries have interests in lunar exploration, with the discovery of significant water ice on the moon opening up new possibilities. Potentially high-value materials on the moon, as well as resources on Mars and asteroids, present further opportunities for joint ventures that could benefit both nations while protecting their individual intellectual property, he said."That's an exciting opportunity," said Kammen, and stressed the urgency of doing so. "We're going to need those breakthroughs because both the US and China are behind schedule to meet their climate goals," he said.The US has aimed to cut emissions in half by 2030, and the Chinese goal is to realize carbon neutrality by 2060.US Vice-President Kamala Harris on Tuesday selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, 60, as her vice-presidential running mate, adding the folksy and popular Midwestern state executive to the Democratic ticket as the party seeks to hold onto key Northern battleground states this fall.Harris will hold her first rally with Walz on Tuesday in Philadelphia, the first stop in a four-day tour of battleground states that includes visits to Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and elsewhere.In picking Walz, she has selected a politician with executive governing experience, and signaled the importance of Midwestern battleground states such as Wisconsin and Michigan. A two-term governor and current chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, Walz is also a hunter and gun owner, which can often help candidates connect in rural areas.Walz wasn't widely known outside of Minnesota before his name appeared on Harris shortlists. But he gained some Democratic fans outside his state in recent weeks for television interviews that hit at former president Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Senator J.D. Vance without being overly nasty. He called the pair "weird'', a word that went viral among Democrats and on the internet.Walz now faces introducing himself to the country with about three months left before the election, including a potential debate against Vance.The choice of a running mate for Harris was among the most closely watched decisions of her fledgling campaign, as she sought to bolster the ticket's prospects for victory in November and rapidly find someone who could be a governing partner.In recent days, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania was perceived to be the front-runner over Walz and Arizona Senator John Kelly, but Walz was also seen by many as a safer choice for Harris because of his liberal stands and that Shapiro had come under fire from some progressives in the party and fellow Democrats. Shapiro especially received heavy scrutiny recently over his response to pro-Palestinian protests that emerged in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.It has been about two weeks since President Joe Biden announced he wouldn't seek reelection and Harris quickly moved to lead the Democratic ticket into the Nov 5 election against Trump, becoming the first black and South Asian American nominee for a major US party's White House campaign.The most recent poll from CBS News shows Harris, 59, and Trump, 78, in a tight race nationally, with the Democrat holding a one-point lead over Trump.Agencies contributed to this report.aiheping@chinadailyusa.comWASHINGTON - Kamala Harris, the US vice president and the daughter of immigrants, has officially clinched the Democratic nomination for the presidency, becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket in the country.Harris, previously unsuccessful in her presidential bid, has now secured the Democratic nomination, a significant moment for the party. This follows President Joe Biden's underwhelming debate performance in June, sparking internal conflicts within the party. The lead-up to Harris' nomination has been marked by intense discussions and turbulence among Democrats regarding their party's future and Biden's chances of reelection.Following a five-day online balloting process by delegates of the Democratic National Convention, Harris's nomination was officially confirmed on Monday night. The Democratic Party announced that 99 percent of the delegates had voted in favor of Harris in a statement released just before midnight. The party will now proceed to formally certify the vote and will hold a celebratory roll call during the upcoming party convention in Chicago later this month.Harris has indicated that she intends to stay aligned with the key themes and policies that defined Biden's campaign, including democracy, gun violence prevention, and abortion rights. However, her approach may be more impassioned, especially when she draws upon her prosecutorial experience to criticize Donald Trump and highlight his 34 felony convictions related to falsifying business records as part of a hush money scheme.Harris was born on Oct 20, 1964, in Oakland, California. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a breast cancer scientist from India, and her father, Donald Harris, was a Jamaican-born professor at Stanford University.Harris worked as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before becoming California's attorney general in 2010 and later a US senator in 2016.During her time in the Senate, she emerged as a vocal critic of Trump and gained attention for her role on the Judiciary Committee, particularly during the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Although Harris initially ran for president in 2020 with high expectations, she faced challenges with campaign organization and message consistency, leading to her withdrawal before the Iowa caucuses.However, she remained a top contender for the vice presidential nomination, given her close relationship with Biden and her experience as a prosecutor. After securing the nomination, Biden chose Harris as his running mate.As vice president, Harris faced criticism for her role in addressing migration issues at the US-Mexico border and her tie-breaking votes in the Senate. She also became a prominent advocate for abortion rights following the Supreme Court's ruling on Roe v. Wade.After Biden endorsed Harris following the end of his candidacy on July 21, her 2024 presidential bid saw a surge in enthusiasm among the Democratic base. Donations poured in, volunteers showed up at field offices, and supporters grew in numbers, leading to venue swaps for events.The Trump campaign has sought to define Harris negatively, criticizing her for border crossings and making derogatory comments about her heritage."I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black," stated Trump at the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago. "So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?"In her response, Harris aptly characterized it as "the same old show -- the divisiveness and the disrespect"."The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us. They are an essential source of our strength," Harris said.The granddaughter of US General Claire Lee Chennault, the founder of the World War II-era Flying Tigers, said he remained in China because he "heard the cries for help".When Chennault decided to stay behind and offer his services to China in July 1937, the US government threatened to revoke his citizenship if he did not return home and cease helping China.However, his compassion was unwavering and he accepted his new role as an adviser to the Chinese Air Force, said his granddaughter Nell Calloway, director of the Chennault Aviation and Military Museum in Monroe, Louisiana.Calloway recalled her grandfather's story at a recent gathering of the new generation of Flying Tigers, formerly known as the American Volunteer Group, during the 45th Anniversary of US-China Diplomatic Relations Forum hosted by Flying Tigers-friendly organizations.The celebration was held in Whittier, California, a city in Los Angeles County and the hometown of former US president Richard Nixon, as the Flying Tigers organizations aim to carry on the fighter pilots' spirit and their friendship between the two peoples.Chennault arrived in China on June 1, 1937, but it was not easy for him to stay in a foreign land as he was hard of hearing and did not understand the language."He stayed because he heard the cries for help from a people in desperate need," Calloway said. "He did not let cultural differences, political affiliation or ideology stand in the way of his humanity or serving his fellow man."When the war was over, Chennault wrote in his 1949 memoir Way of a Fighter, "It is my fondest hope that the sign of the Flying Tiger remains aloft just as long as it is needed and that it will always be remembered on both shores of the Pacific as the symbol of two great peoples working toward a common goal in war and peace."The legacy of the Flying Tigers shows how much the United States and China can accomplish together over the course of history, said US Representative Judy Chu of California.Risking lives for peace"I was so impressed that so many brave young men quit their jobs to volunteer to fight with the Chinese to protect China from her enemies," Chu told the audience. "And they weren't even an official part of the US military because the US was not yet at war with Japan, but these men were still willing to risk their lives for peace."The Flying Tigers produced 39 US aces during their brief combat history. The official tally of the American Volunteer Group at the time was 299 Japanese planes destroyed in seven months.In March 1943, Chennault, then a major general, was made the commander of the 14th Air Force, which was formed out of the China Air Task Force.When the US eventually entered World War II, thousands more went on to serve in both Asia and Europe, including another 20,000 Chinese Americans like Chu's father, who fought for the US despite facing racial discrimination at home because of the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882-1943)."For my father's whole life, he was so proud of his service to his country. Of course, I thought of him when Congress passed legislation in 2018 to finally award the 20,000 Chinese American veterans who fought in World War II with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor," Chu said.Reciprocal gratitudeAs the Flying Tigers fought alongside the Chinese people to resist Japanese aggression, the Chinese were deeply grateful for their contributions and went to great lengths to rescue and protect them.Hundreds of Flying Tigers were saved, at the cost of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians who sacrificed their lives."This is a glorious and honorable chapter written by the people of our two great nations with flesh and blood in defending world peace and justice," said Chinese Consul General in Los Angeles Guo Shaochun.In the 1970s, in a demonstration of political courage and strategic vision, Chinese and US leaders made the historic decision to reopen exchanges.In 1972, Nixon visited China, and a handshake extended to Premier Zhou Enlai crossed the Pacific, ending decades of disengagement. The two countries established formal diplomatic relations on Jan 1, 1979, which marked the beginning of a new chapter in friendly bilateral exchanges.Over the past 45 years, the China-US relationship has forged ahead despite twists and turns, growing into the most important bilateral relationship in the world, Guo said."There are so many lessons we may learn from the 45-year history. The most important one is that both China and the US gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, and working together is our only correct choice," he said. "The broadest consensus is that we should make the China-US relationship work rather than mess it up. The only right way to get along is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation."This year, efforts have increased on both sides to collect and promote the stories. Local schools, especially the alma maters of Flying Tigers veterans, have joined the Flying Tigers Friendship School program.More US teenagers are visiting China to attend Flying Tigers-themed summer camps, helping to build bridges of mutual understanding and friendship between China and the US, Guo said."This year marks the 45th anniversary of the China-US diplomatic relationship. We have every reason to carry on the friendship forged by the Flying Tigers, promote its spirit among the younger generation and inject youthful strength into China-US relations," he said.renali@chinadailyusa.com NEW YORK -- US stocks ended sharply lower on Monday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1,033.99 points, or 2.60 percent, to 38,703.27. The S&P 500 sank 160.23 points, or 3.00 percent, to 5,186.33. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 576.08 points, or 3.43 percent, to 16,200.08.All of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with technology and communication services leading the laggards by going down 3.78 percent and 3.35 percent, respectively. Industrials posted the weakest decline, down 1.72 percent. NEW YORK — Nearly everything on Wall Street is tumbling Monday as fear about a slowing US economy worsens and sets off another sell-off for financial markets around the world.The S&P 500 was down by 2.4% in midday trading and on track for its worst day since 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was reeling by 864 points, or 2.2%, as of 11:40 am Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.7%.The drops were just the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.It was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing US employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the US economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the US economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2% and bitcoin dropped below $55,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1%.That's in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.90%.APVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro is set to begin a third six-year term with a focus on maintaining the country's growth momentum of the past few years and overcoming the negative effect of sanctions imposed by the United States."People did not trust the opposition in the election and knew who was responsible for the sanctions," Maduro said on Thursday. "Venezuela has broken hyperinflation and managed to stabilize the dollar exchange rate for months."The National Electoral Council on Saturday reaffirmed Maduro as the winner of the presidential elections held on July 28, with about 97 percent of the votes tallied.Meanwhile, Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday the recent US position on Venezuela's elections was "reckless" and renewed his call for the international community to avoid interventionism.In a news conference, Lopez Obrador said statements such as the one made by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday do not help resolve electoral disputes. Blinken has claimed opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia received the most votes in the election.After a few difficult years, Venezuela shifted back to growth from 2021. In 2022, real GDP expanded by 8 percent and added another 4 percent in 2023, according to the International Monetary Fund. Maduro has predicted growth would hit 8 percent this year.Venezuela has the tools at its disposal to ramp up growth, including the largest oil reserves in the world, but US sanctions have curbed its ability to trade its oil in international markets, curbing production and causing underinvestment, experts said.Since 2015, Venezuela has had 932 sanctions and seven US executive orders leveled against it and "this does not rule out the possibility of more so-called sanctions", said Vladimir Adrianza Salas, a professor and researcher at Venezuela's National Centre for Historical Studies.Affected by blockadeFranco Vielma, a sociologist at think tank Mision Verdad in capital Caracas, said: "In Venezuela, the economy is fundamentally based on oil exports. Before 2016-17, 92 percent of the foreign currency income was from oil exports, and this inventory of foreign currency dramatically decreased due to the blockade since 2017."The country returned to growth at the beginning of this decade. "It is estimated that in 2024, the Venezuelan economy will be the fastest-growing in Latin America," Vielma said.Maduro has put forward a plan for the next five years, the Seven Transformations project, to diversify the economy beyond oil. It aims to "ensure that 95 percent of the food consumed is produced in Venezuela, making the country much less vulnerable to economic and commercial blockades", Vielma said.Looking abroad, Maduro has called for greater integration into the international system and has expressed an aspiration to join the BRICS.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.WASHINGTON -- US Vice-President Kamala Harris has won enough delegate votes to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Jaime Harrison announced on Friday, noting that the results are not yet official.The virtual voting process closes for delegates on Monday, and the DNC is expected to make official announcement of the results Monday evening. The Democratic National Convention, which is scheduled for Aug. 19-22, will formally nominate the party's presidential candidate.The virtual voting process for approximately 4,700 delegates started on Thursday morning. One and a half days into the voting, Harris's campaign reported that she has obtained more than the 2,350 votes required to secure the nomination.Harris, 59, would be the first Black woman and the first Indian American in US history to receive a major party's presidential nomination.Earlier, US media reports said that Harris is expected to reveal her running mate by Monday, and will hold their first rally together in Philadelphia on Tuesday.Top vice presidential picks include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.On July 21, US President Joe Biden announced that he was dropping out of the 2024 presidential race, under mounting pressure from within the Democratic Party due to concerns about his fitness for office. Biden immediately offered his full support for nominating Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate.Harris quickly consolidated support within the Democratic Party, and announced the next day that she had secured enough support from Democratic delegates to become the party's nominee.The latest data shows that Harris is narrowing gap with former President Donald Trump in the presidential race. According to polling data compiled by the US election information website Real Clear Politics, as of July 31, Trump led Harris by an average of 1.2 percentage points in national polls, compared with an advantage of 1.7 percentage points before Biden dropped out.In key swing states Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Trump led Harris by an average of 0.2 percentage points and 2.7 percentage points separately, while in Michigan, Harris flipped the situation and took the lead by an average of 2.0 percentage points.Kamala Harris is used to political attacks on her race and gender in the United States.The 59-year-old, who is both South Asian and black, faced a slew of questions and comments from the right wing in 2019 when she first ran for president.In the days after she became the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee, attacks on her racial identity and gender have increased.Harris was born in California; her parents immigrated from India and Jamaica and later became naturalized US citizens. She became the US' first woman vice-president in 2020 and would become the first woman president if she is elected in November.Political analysts suggest that the focus on Harris' race and gender has exposed how divisive US politics can be for women who seek the highest office, eight years after Hillary Clinton's failed presidential bid.Harris' Republican opponent, former president Donald Trump, drew gasps from an audience at the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago on Wednesday by questioning her racial identity."She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?" he told Rachel Scott, an ABC News correspondent.Harris quickly responded that Trump was putting on "the same old show, the divisiveness and the disrespect".Republican criticismShe has also faced criticism from several Republicans who branded her a "DEI hire". The phrase refers to diversity, equity and inclusion policies of recent years that stem from executive orders in the 1960s by presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.US Representative Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, said of Harris in an interview with CNN last month: "Biden said first off, he's going to hire a black female for vice-president. He just skipped over, what about white females, what about any other group, when you go down that route you take mediocrity and that's what they have right now. One hundred percent she is a DEI hire."In 2020, Trump questioned whether she met citizenship requirements, as he had previously questioned where Barack Obama, the country's first black president, was born. Trump said he had "heard" that Harris wasn't born in the US because her parents were born abroad, and so she "doesn't meet the requirements to be vice-president", a claim that was debunked.US Representative Harriet Hageman of Wyoming said in a video clip that Harris was "intellectually, just really kind of the bottom of the barrel".While many Republicans have criticized Harris, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and the chair of the House GOP campaign arm, Richard Hudson of North Carolina, urged their party to focus on her policies.belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.comA US report has confirmed that at least 973 Native American children died while attending federal Indian boarding schools between 1819 and 1969, but acknowledged that "the actual number of children who died while in Indian boarding schools is greater".Many of the children were buried in at least 74 marked and unmarked burial sites at 65 former schools across the country, according to the report released on Tuesday by the US Department of Interior. The actual number of children who died and the number of potential burial sites are probably greater, the report said.The report urges the US government to formally apologize for the 150-year-long "deliberate and strategic actions" to assimilate the children and destroy their culture.The Indian boarding school system was established by the US government to "civilize" and assimilate Native Americans into Anglo-American culture. Children were forcefully taken from their homes and put into boarding schools.The Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative under the Interior Department has identified by name 18,624 Native children who entered the school system, adding that it is not a comprehensive list.Additional children may have died after becoming sick at school and being sent home, officials said.In a letter presenting the report to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary, the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Bryan Newland, who led the investigation, wrote: "For the first time in the history of the country, the US government is accounting for its role in operating Indian boarding schools to forcibly assimilate Indian children, and working to set us on a path to heal from the wounds inflicted by those schools."Newland described one piece of history related to the schools."On Dec 28, 1890, the US military entered Third Mesa of Hopi and took 104 children from their families so they could be sent to the Keams Canyon Boarding School. Four years later, on Nov 25, 1894, two US cavalry companies with rapid-fire artillery guns arrived again at Third Mesa to arrest 19 Hopi leaders as prisoners of war after they refused to send additional Hopi children to the school."Newland said those Indian leaders were imprisoned for almost one year on Alcatraz Island, a former US military installation in San Francisco Bay.The report also said the US government appropriated more than $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars between 1871 and 1969 for the federal Indian boarding school system and other similar institutions and associated assimilation policies.After removal from their Indian tribes and families, many children sent to the boarding schools didn't return home, the report said.Students' sufferingChildren in boarding schools were punished for using their own native language in the schools. Some suffered sexual abuse. The report shared some accounts of the boarding school experiences in the project "The Road to Healing"."I experience feelings of abandonment because I think of my mother standing on that sidewalk as we were loaded into the green bus to be taken to a boarding school. And I can see it — still have the image of my mom burned in my brain and in my heart where she was crying. What does a mother think? She was helpless," said an Arizona participant."Unfortunately, Wrangell was a place that attracted pedophiles and many matrons, men and women, perpetrated themselves upon little boys and girls. … We saw girls going home in the middle of the school year pregnant, and a lot of these children were like 11 and 12, 13 years old," a participant from Alaska stated.The report cited studies showing that Native children who were separated from their parents suffered both physically and mentally and have had higher rates of suicide and substance abuse compared with the general population.The report said the US government "should issue a formal acknowledgment of its role in adopting a national policy of forced assimilation of Indian children and carrying out this policy through the removal and confinement of Indian children from their families and Indian Tribes and the Native Hawaiian Community and placement in the federal Indian boarding school system".NEW YORK -- US carriers Delta Air Lines and United Airlines on late Wednesday temporarily suspended their flights to the Israeli city of Tel Aviv amid heightening tensions in the Middle East region.United Airlines suspended its daily services to and from Tel Aviv, beginning with the Wednesday evening's flight from Newark Liberty International Airport in New York to Tel Aviv, the company said, citing "security reasons.""We continue to closely monitor the situation and will make decisions on resuming service with a focus on the safety of our customers and crews," a company spokesperson said in an announcement.Delta paused flights between New York and Tel Aviv through Friday, Aug. 2, "due to ongoing conflict in the region," the airline said on its website.Delta has issued a waiver for customers who booked travel to/from Tel Aviv before Aug. 14, allowing them to change their plans without paying a fare difference.The airline said it "is continuously monitoring the evolving security environment and assessing our operations based on security guidance and intelligence reports. "The US Department of State updated a travel advisory for the Mideast region on Wednesday, warning US citizens not to travel to Northern Israel and the West Bank, due to the rising tensions between Hezbollah and Israel, as well as armed conflicts.WASHINGTON -- The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged at a 22-year high of 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent, as inflation continues to be cooling, hinting that a rate cut might come as soon as September."Inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated. In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective," the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's policy-setting body, said in a statement after a two-day policy meeting.Regarding the Fed's statement, the language reflected an improvement compared to the June meeting. Previously, the policy statement mentioned only "modest further progress" in reducing price pressures.The committee reiterated that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.In addition, the committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, the statement said.When asked whether a September rate cut is a reasonable expectation, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters at a press conference Wednesday afternoon that "we have made no decisions about future meetings. That includes the September meeting."The Fed chair, however, noted that "the broad sense of the committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate."Noting that the last couple of inflation readings have "added to confidence," Powell said "we've seen progress across all three categories of core PCE inflations, goods, non-house services, and housing services."In the second quarter, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 2.6 percent, compared with an increase of 3.4 percent in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased 2.9 percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.7 percent in the previous quarter."We think the time (for a rate cut) is approaching. If we get the data that we hope we get, a reduction or policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting," the Fed chief said.CARACAS -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday submitted an appeal to the Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice to audit and certify the results of Sunday's presidential elections amid calls for greater transparency.Maduro asked the highest court to summon the pertinent institutions "to compare all the elements of evidence and certify, by carrying out an expert opinion of the highest technical level, the electoral results of July 28."He went to the Supreme Court accompanied by First Lady Cilia Flores, Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez, Attorney General Reinaldo Munoz and Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil, among other members of his cabinet.In remarks to the press upon leaving the court, Maduro said: "I have told the Electoral Chamber that I am willing to be summoned, interrogated ... investigated by the Electoral Chamber as the winning presidential candidate of Sunday's elections and as head of state; I am showing up, I am submitting to justice."The Great Patriotic Pole and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, which backed Maduro's reelection bid, are ready "to present 100 percent of the electoral records that are in our hands," he said, adding that the Electoral Chamber should expect the same from each candidate and political organization.On Monday, Venezuela's National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner of the presidential elections, paving the way for his third six-year term, from 2025 to 2031.With eyes peeking out from a hidden burrow in the grass, the creature quickly scurries toward a block that buzzed with life just hours earlier. It's one of the nocturnal rulers of the street — rats — poised to attack the garbage in black plastic bags piled high on the sidewalks of New York City, awaiting pickup by sanitation workers.Street garbage has become a daily banquet for New York's rat population. The city generates about 14 billion pounds of trash a year, potentially feeding roughly 3 million rats. That's the number of rodents estimated in the city in a 2023 study.Controlling the rat population in the city remains a challenge despite numerous efforts. In January, the city Sanitation Department said New York was winning the war on rats, as rodent sightings in mitigation zones were down across the city.In early July, Mayor Eric Adams joined department officials to unveil the city's first official trash bin meant to keep the streets cleaner and curb the rat population. All residential buildings with one to nine units will be required to put trash in rat-proof containers as of Nov 12.Once the rule takes effect, officials say that 70 percent of all trash in New York City will be containerized.The latest attempt to lower or control the number of rodents featured the formation of the "Rat Pack", a nickname inspired by the group of 1950s celebrities that included Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. Adams asked New Yorkers to join the "elite squad of dedicated anti-rat activists"."We're really proud of the city's efforts of going after public enemy number one. Now we're doing something new. We're recruiting an entirely new generation of the 'Rat Pack,'" Adams said during a news conference in Brooklyn on Sunday.Though anyone can join, the initiative is designed for building superintendents, property managers, community gardeners and business owners."From cutting our rats' food supplies to closing down rat havens, Rat Pack members will be able to defend their communities from rodents and achieve our goal of making New York City the least rat-friendly city in America," he said. "We need you to help reduce the rat population in our city, and the rat swag will be your badge of honor as you walk through your communities."That swag is a T-shirt or hat with a rat logo on it. But before they can get their hands on one, there are three things New Yorkers must do.They must attend a two-hour New York City Health Department "rat academy" session that will give instructions on how to deal with rodents. They will need to participate in a rat-mitigation event and go out on a rat walk, hosted by Kathy Corradi, the city's first "rat czar".A former elementary school teacher in Brooklyn, Corradi was appointed last year by the mayor. She coordinates with city government agencies, community organizations and the private sector to reduce the city's rat population.City officials are so determined to fight the rat population that they will host a "National Urban Rat Summit" Sept 18-19. It will bring together researchers at academic institutions and municipal pest-control managers from Boston, New Orleans and Seattle. They will share best practices on rodent mitigation and the science of urban rat management."New Yorkers may not know this about me — but I hate rats, and I'm confident most of our city's residents do as well," Adams said in announcing the summit. "The best way to defeat our enemy is to know our enemy. That's why we're holding this inaugural summit to bring experts and leaders from across the country together to better understand urban rats and how to manage their populations."Reaction from some city residents to the Rat Pack and the new garbage bins ranged from "at least it's an effort" to "it's a waste of time" and "only in New York, a rat patrol"."It all sounds like a good cause, because there is a lot of trash in New York, like nobody cares," Anaiyah Glover, a resident of the Bronx, told China Daily. "I've seen thousands, thousands [of rats]," she said. "They have run at me, straight on. It was scary."She recalled when a "big fat one" ran toward her. She moved to the side of the street and jumped over the "baby melon big" rat. "It was really fat, like, he ate a lot," she said.Maura, who asked that her last name not be used, lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with her husband and teenage son. One evening, back when her son was a toddler, she said she took him inside their building lobby and then came back out for his stroller. "There was a rat in it," she said. Her son had followed her: "'It's so cute,' he said as I screamed."CARACAS -- Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil on Tuesday announced that the Venezuelan government has decided to sever diplomatic relations with Peru."The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has decided to sever diplomatic relations with the Republic of Peru, on the basis of Article 45 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961," Gil said on social media platform X.Gil's announcement followed statements by his Peruvian counterpart, Javier Gonzalez-Olaechea, who said, "Peru will not accept the violation of the popular will of the Venezuelan people," referring to the country's presidential election."We are forced to make this decision after the reckless declarations of the Peruvian foreign minister that ignore the will of the Venezuelan people and our constitution," the Venezuelan diplomat added.California is experiencing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, with recent data indicating a sharp increase in the levels of coronavirus in wastewater across the state.The levels are considered "very high" and have been since early July, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.For the seven-day period ending July 20, the wastewater levels were at 93 percent of the peak in the summer of 2022 and have already surpassed last summer's peak.Overall, 37 states and the District of Columbia have rates of coronavirus in wastewater classified as "high" or "very high".As of last weekend, California's current seven-day test-positivity rate was 13.8 percent, an increase of 2.3 percentage points from the previous week. That rate is approaching the highs of the summer of 2022, which peaked at 16.1 percent.Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious disease at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, told the Los Angeles Times that more people are seeking outpatient treatment."The wastewater numbers are still headed up. So we're definitely seeing more and more cases," she said. "If you have cough-and-cold symptoms, at this point, living in Los Angeles, you should really think that they are COVID until proven otherwise."There was an average of 286 COVID-19-positive patients in hospitals for the week ending July 20 in Los Angeles County. That number is about half of last summer's peak and one-quarter of the peak from summer 2022."This virus is still very, very new to humans, and the virus wants to live, and the way that it lives is by evading immunity," said Hudson.Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at the University of California, San Francisco, told the Los Angeles Times that there is lot of COVID outside the hospital, and "almost everybody has it".Other states with "high" or "very high" coronavirus levels in wastewater are Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.Agencies contributed to this story.Footwear retailers and other importers in the United States may have to put on their running shoes in a rush to bring in goods before tariffs on China get raised again.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who kicked off the tariff spree on Chinese imports in 2018 when he was US president, earlier this year floated the idea of putting a 60 percent tariff on all imports from China and 10 percent on all imports worldwide."That (possibility) is obviously driving a lot of interest for our members about how to start to bring in products maybe prior to some of those decisions to push duties up," said Matt Priest, the president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.He said it would "obviously impact costing and our consumers, who ultimately pay the price of those duties".Priest made the comments at a Port of Los Angeles webinar on July 17 about monthly container traffic at the California port, where two-thirds of US shoe imports arrive.Port of LA Executive Director Gene Seroka said that footwear traffic is a top 10 driver of import volume at the port "year after year".More than 90 percent of the shoes sold in the US come from Asia — from China, Vietnam and Indonesia, Priest said.The US footwear industry imports 2.5 billion pairs of shoes a year and already pays $4 billion a year in tariffs, according to footwearnews.com.In 2019, Trump's second round of tariffs added a 15 percent duty on about half of the footwear imports from China. He cut the rate to 7.5 percent in 2020.Priest said the industry has seen weaker purchasing power from people in households making under $100,000 a year, and they could face higher costs buying shoes in the back-to-school season."Footwear is kind of the barometer of the overall health of the economy because people need to buy shoes," he said.In an interview with Fox News Sunday on Feb 4, Trump dismissed the notion of a "trade war" with China but said of the 60 percent tariff idea, "maybe it's going to be even more".Trump imposed tariffs on an estimated $380 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2018 and 2019. The administration of US President Joe Biden has kept most of those levies in place, and in May, raised some others on an additional $18 billion in Chinese imports, such as electric vehicles and semiconductors.In a July 18 speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump said he would welcome Chinese EV companies, if they built factories in the US."Those plants are going to be built in the United States, and our people are going to man those plants," he said, or he would impose tariffs as high as 200 percent on the cars entering the country.Priest said there's been a "run on capacity to get product in" ahead of the start of the higher tariffs on electric vehicles on Aug 1, which has led to a spike in shipping container rates.Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, told China Daily that higher tariffs could present a dilemma for the Federal Reserve, which has signaled it would eventually cut interest rates."More tariffs will certainly add to inflation and make the Fed's job harder. My guess is that the Trump and Biden tariffs added about one percentage point to the CPI (consumer price index) between 2018 and 2023, in other words about 0.2 percentage points annually for five years.'High probability'"If Trump is elected, I see a high probability that he will slap high tariffs on virtually all US imports from China," Hufbauer said. "Trump has talked about a 60 percent rate; my forecast is that he will at least go for 40 percent."China will retaliate. This will cause an enormous amount of trade diversion, both Chinese and US exports. It will also cause some outright trade destruction, maybe on the order of $200 billion annually," he said."That's bad news for the world economy. A few other countries will be tempted to increase their own tariffs or nontariff barriers, if only to dampen the effects of trade diversion. All told, this will shave something off world economic growth, perhaps 0.1 percent," he said.In a June 26 article, Erica York, senior economist and research director with the nonprofit Tax Foundation's Center for Federal Tax Policy, wrote that the current Trump-Biden tariffs amount to an average annual tax increase on US households of $625.York estimated that the current tariffs would lead to the loss of 142,000 full-time equivalent jobs.CARACAS -- Venezuelan authorities have arrested 749 people for participating in violent riots following Sunday's presidential elections, Attorney General Tarek William Saab said Tuesday.Those arrested face charges of "incitement, obstructing public roads, hate crimes ... resisting arrest and, in the most serious cases, terrorism," the attorney general said at a press conference.According to Saab, as a result of the violence, 48 military and police officers have been injured, some by gunshots, and a military officer in northern Aragua state was killed.Authorities have verified that far-right groups have been using minors and people under the influence of drugs in riots in various cities in Venezuela.The riots, Saab said, are not protests but rather the work of "armed criminals" looking "to create chaos. They wanted ... this to escalate to the national level ... so there is foreign intervention."Venezuela held presidential elections on Sunday, and the National Electoral Council on Monday declared President Nicolas Maduro the winner of the elections.As wildfires in California burn hundreds of thousands of acres and threaten houses, US home insurers reported their biggest loss of the century last year. A report by AM Best, a credit rating agency, said that "the segment suffered a $15.2 billion underwriting loss in 2023, more than double the losses seen in the previous year. The 2023 loss was also the worst this century, with $14.8 billion in losses in 2011 the next highest."In 2023, there were a record 28 weather and climate disasters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with total damages of at least $92.9 billion. For comparison, the annual average for such events between 1980 and 2023 was 8.5.While CLM (Claims and Litigation Management), an organization for claims and litigation professionals, estimated that Hurricane Beryl, on the US Gulf Coast, the first hurricane of 2024, would cost the US insurance industry between $2.5 billion and $4.5 billion, more than 100 wildfires are raging in the United States, with the largest burning in California.According to California fire officials, the Park Fire, the sixth-largest wildfire in California history, had burned more than 370,000 acres as of Monday — an area larger than the city of Phoenix — with 134 structures destroyed.Another wildfire, the Borel Fire, destroyed the historic mining community of Havilah, where only a few buildings were left standing, according to the Los Angeles Times. An evacuation order was in effect for the town with a population of 250.In total, more than 726,000 acres have burned in the state this year as of Monday, with 232 structures destroyed, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). In Oregon, the 2024 wildfire season so far has burned 1,142,727 acres, according to the Oregon Fires and Hotspots Dashboard. The Durkee Fire, the largest active blaze, has burned almost 300,000 acres, with 23 structures destroyed.Multiple fires also are burning in Utah and Colorado.A wildfire in the Canadian Rockies' largest national park is still not controlled, according to the Jasper National Park Facebook page. An estimated 30 percent of houses and businesses in the popular Canadian resort town of Jasper, Alberta, were incinerated as a wildfire continued to roar through the area.  The fire forced thousands of visitors, seasonal workers and residents to flee Jasper. The AM Best report said one of the major reasons for the increased losses is population migration into areas where weather-related events are occurring more frequently."The US population overall grew 7.4 percent between 2010-2020 but rose 10.2 percent in the South and 9.2 percent in the West during the period," said David Blades, associate director of industry research and analytics at AM Best. "Population trends show residents increasingly moving toward regions that are more prone to hurricanes, severe convective storms or even wildfires."According to the US census, California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Washington accounted for 53 percent of US population growth between 2010 and 2020. All six states are prone to severe weather-related events.Christopher Graham, senior industry analyst at AM Best, said in a company video that if the Category 5 Hurricane Andrew in 1992 occurred today, the damage could double due to population growth. At $58.6 billion in damages, Hurricane Andrew is rated as the most costly catastrophe for the US between 1900-2023.For the flood-prone South, more buildings mean less nature to absorb rainfall, thus causing more flooding, according to Graham."The same goes for California with the wildfires. Building in areas more prone to wildfires and then human activities create more wildfires" and "there are a whole lot of human activities in the area that's prone to catastrophes exacerbating catastrophes," Graham said.In the Park Fire, Ronnie Stout, 42, has been arrested and accused of starting the blaze. Stout is suspected of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully and causing the inferno, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said.Some insurance companies aren't writing new policies or are pulling out of the areas prone to catastrophes, said Graham.For example, State Farm, the largest homeowners insurance company in the US, will stop covering more than 72,000 homes and apartments in California this summer. The company said the decision is due to soaring costs, increasing wildfire risks and outdated regulations, The Orange County Register reported.Agencies contributed to this story.mayzhou@chinadailyusa.comWASHINGTON - US President Joe Biden on Monday announced a plan to reform the Supreme Court, saying that he looked forward to working with Congress to prevent the abuse of presidential power and "restore faith" in the nation's highest court."President Biden believes that no one -- neither the President nor the Supreme Court -- is above the law," the White House said in a fact sheet.In the face of this "crisis of confidence" in America's democratic institutions, Biden was calling for three reforms to "restore trust and accountability": No immunity for crimes a former president committed in office; Term limits for Supreme Court justices; Binding code of conduct for the Supreme Court, according to the fact sheet.Firstly, Biden called for a constitutional amendment that makes clear no president is above the law or immune from prosecution for crimes committed while in office.This came in response to the court's July 1 ruling, which determined that presidents cannot be prosecuted for "official acts" performed while in office, a decision related to a case involving former President Donald Trump, who was indicted by a federal grand jury for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.Secondly, Biden supported a system in which the president would appoint a Justice every two years to spend 18 years in active service on the Supreme Court. Currently, Supreme Court Justices serve lifetime appointments on the court.During his tenure, Trump nominated three conservative justices, shifting the balance of the Supreme Court from a 5-4 to a 6-3 conservative majority, thereby strengthening the conservative advantage. Biden has become more vocal in his criticism of the Supreme Court and its decisions."In recent years, the Supreme Court has overturned long-established legal precedents protecting fundamental rights. This Court has gutted civil rights protections, taken away a woman's right to choose, and now granted Presidents broad immunity from prosecution for crimes they commit in office," the White House said.Thirdly, Biden believed that Congress should pass binding, enforceable conduct and ethics rules that require Justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity, and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest."Recent ethics scandals involving some Justices have caused the public to question the fairness and independence that are essential for the Court to faithfully carry out its mission to deliver justice for all Americans," according to the fact sheet.Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have faced scrutiny for their personal conduct. Thomas did not disclose receiving extravagant travel from wealthy Republican donors. Alito's wife displayed flags outside their homes associated with the Jan 6, 2021, Capitol riot and efforts to overturn the 2020 election."President Biden and Vice President (Kamala) Harris look forward to working with Congress and empowering the American people to prevent the abuse of Presidential power, restore faith in the Supreme Court, and strengthen the guardrails of democracy," the White House said.In a statement released Monday, Harris, who has become the Democrats' likely White House nominee, said that "there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court as its fairness has been called into question after numerous ethics scandals and decision after decision overturning long-standing precedent."Implementing term limits and an ethics code for the Supreme Court would likely necessitate new legislation, which means the currently divided Congress is not anticipated to address this issue before the yearend. The House is controlled by Republicans, while Democrats have a slim majority in the Senate.Furthermore, even if Democrats gain control of both chambers following the election in November, they are unlikely to achieve the 60 Senate seats required to overcome a filibuster. A constitutional amendment would face even greater challenges.Reform and modernization were key takeaways from the communique issued at the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, experts from a think tank in the United States said.They also see reform and modernization as crucial to boosting productivity and long-term growth through technological innovation.Guoguang Wu, a senior fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, said the Party is sending a "very strong signal to Chinese people and the international society that we will have reform".Wu offered his observations on Friday at a webinar held by Asia Society, a think tank and nonprofit organization, titled "The Third Plenum: What is Xi Jinping's Plan for China?"Lizzi Lee, a fellow on Chinese economy at the ASPI's Center for China Analysis, noted that the emphasis of the third plenary session was on "Chinese-style modernization", including emphasis on technology innovation and the "new quality productive forces".The plenary session also highlighted challenges such as income inequality, trade tensions and fiscal issues and noted strategies to address those issues through supply chain policies, market roles and financial reforms.Lee noted two other points: self-sufficiency and major breakthroughs, especially in frontier science, which is "no surprise given the rising geopolitical tensions, particularly with the US".She said the plan also emphasizes a dual role of State guidance and intense competition among private sector companies and entrepreneurs.In its original text, the communique said that "we must better leverage the role of the market, foster a fairer and more dynamic market environment, and make resource allocation as efficient and productive as possible. We will lift restrictions on the market while ensuring effective regulation, striving to better maintain order in the market and remedy market failures".The government "will continue to provide guidance and support for industry supply chains, while the private sector drives growth and innovation". That strategy has already been successful in the electric vehicle and battery sectors, and China plans to extend it to key areas such as semiconductors, medical equipment and machine tools, Lee said.China has a major economic goal to lift per capita GDP to that of a mid-level developed country by 2035, and to reach that target, China's economy would need to grow at about 4.5 to 5 percent annually, she said.According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on July 15, China's economy grew by 4.7 percent in the second quarter of the year after 5.3 percent growth in the first quarter."It's clear to me from the third plenum document that the Chinese leadership has decided that to sustain this level of growth, China needs systemic upgrading along the global value chain, not just short-term stimuli," Lee said.Bert Hofman, an honorary senior fellow on Chinese economy at the ASPI's Center for China Analysis, said the document is "about high-quality development, the high-standard socialist market economy as being the tool for this Chinese modernization".Hofman saw a consistent policy on the supply side. He said that the policy is about significantly increasing investment in science and technology and integrating it with industrial policy. The goal is to use various tools to link current and future technologies with high-quality productive forces.Hofman also said that one of the most important points of the third plenum is the reaffirmation of a key principle acknowledged by the third plenary session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 2013: that the market plays a decisive role in allocating resources.He said that he believes that the government-market balance is now even stronger than in 2013.Although this principle wasn't mentioned in the communique, it is reiterated in the resolution, emphasizing the need to leverage the market's role, he noted.The plenum clearly recognizes the fiscal problems in China, particularly at the local level due to issues in the real estate sector, he said.There are promises of tax and transfer reforms, centralizing expenditures and improving budget management. The resolution provides a clearer framework and direction for addressing those issues, he added.WASHINGTON - The US federal government's total public debt has surpassed 35 trillion US dollars for the first time, as recorded at the end of last week, according to data released by the Treasury Department Monday.The total public debt outstanding climbed to 35 trillion dollars on Friday, according to the newly released Daily Treasury Statement. The data is updated at the end of each business day with data from the previous business day.Just seven months ago, the US national debt surpassed 34 trillion dollars in late December 2023. Three months before that, the United States reached a historic milestone by passing 33 trillion dollars."The borrowing just keeps marching along, reckless and unyielding," said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, in a statement. "Yet despite all the risks and warning signs, these alarm bells seem to be falling on deaf ears.""We are going to have to get serious about the debt, and soon. Election years cannot be an exception for trying to prevent completely foreseeable dangers -- and the debt is one of the major dangers we are facing," said MacGuineas.According to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan organization focused on addressing US long-term fiscal challenges, the national debt of 35.001 trillion dollars translates to 103,945 dollars of debt per person in the United States."Our deficits are caused mainly by predictable structural factors: our aging baby-boom generation, rising healthcare costs, and a tax system that does not bring in enough money to pay for what the government has promised its citizens," the foundation said.Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former official at the International Monetary Fund, told Xinhua earlier that "there can be no question that the US budget deficit is on an unsustainable path."The "dangerous trajectory" poses "serious questions for the dollar" and inflation's long-run outlook, Lachman said.China congratulated Venezuela on Monday on successfully holding its presidential election, as well as Nicolas Maduro on his reelection as president.China and Venezuela are good friends and good partners supporting each other, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular news conference.Noting that this year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations, Lin said China highly values the development of bilateral ties, and hopes to work with Venezuela to keep enriching the content of their all-weather strategic partnership to better benefit the people of both countries.Incumbent Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has secured a third term after being declared the winner of the South American nation's presidential elections, according to the electoral authority.Venezuelans took to the polls on July 28 in a hotly contested election between Maduro and retired diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez, the face of a coalition of opposition parties.The results were expected to be challenged by opposition parties, who allege widespread fraud in counting of votes.The National Electoral Council (CNE) said that with 80 percent of votes counted, Maduro had secured 51.2 percent of the vote, ahead of Gonzalez on 44.2 percent. The CNE said it announced the results as Maduro's lead was insurmountable.Maduro's United Socialist Party has been in power for a quarter of a century, with Maduro in office as president since 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez. His next six-year term starts in 2025.The president went into the election trailing in opinion polls with opposition parties blaming him for an economic contraction unprecedented outside wartime.Gonzalez represented the Democratic Unity Platform after being chosen in April to replace Maria Corina Machado, who was blocked from running in elections for 15 years by the country's Supreme Tribunal of Justice.Eight other candidates stood on the ballot but only Gonzalez posed any real challenge to Maduro."For the first time in history, there are nine opposition candidates. This has never happened in any presidential election," said Franco Vielma, a sociologist at the Mision Verdad think tank."All remained separate, and the traditional opposition candidate (Gonzalez) did not benefit from any withdrawals by other opposition candidates," Vielma said, noting that splitting the vote indicated a severe weakness among the opposition.Despite enjoying momentum, Gonzalez could not manage to unite the opposition, Vielma said.Gonzalez had to overcome significant challenges including the fact that he was virtually unknown before being nominated, Vielma said, noting that this worked against the opposition."The electoral process was optimal," said Deny Reyes, a director at Radio del Sur in Caracas, the country's capital. "This was a positive and mostly peaceful election.""The streets are quiet," he said, although he noted that crowds were beginning to gather.Despite the potential for violence and unrest, the vote was mostly peaceful.Polls opened at 6 am but many voters started lining up to vote hours before. Some 21 million people were eligible to vote in 15,000 voting centers set up across the country.According to Vielma from Mision Verdad, Maduro has claimed he "plans to advance the diversification of the economy away from oil dependence, promote small and medium-sized enterprises, and maintain state control over strategic resources".Venezuela has some of the largest oil reserves in the world and was once one of the continent's richest economies.However, falling oil prices, domestic shortages, and hyperinflation have seen unrest and the mass emigration of an estimated 8 million Venezuelans.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.CARACAS -- Venezuelans went to polling stations across the country and cast ballots on Sunday in the presidential election.Aime Nogal Mendez, a member of the National Electoral Council (CNE), said she has been "touring voting centers" since early Sunday morning.The official CNE account on social media platform X clarified that, according to the law, voters must show their ID card to vote, even if it is expired. The law states that polling stations will be open from 6:00 am (1000 GMT) to 6:00 pm (2200 GMT), and will stay open as long as there are people waiting to vote.Minutes after the voting process began, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro Moros, who's seeking a third term in office, cast his vote at Fuerte Tiuna, Caracas. He said the election had started peacefully and called for high voter turnout."I am sure everything will go well, and tomorrow will be a beautiful day," Maduro told the media."Respect for the electoral process is respect for the Constitution," said the president, highlighting the need for all participating political forces to respect the electoral authority and recognize the official results of the National Electoral Council.Maduro is running against nine presidential candidates. Of all the candidates, Edmundo Gonzalez, a retired diplomat, is seen as a significant challenge to Maduro.More than 21.6 million Venezuelans are eligible to vote, choosing from among 10 presidential candidates. The head of state will lead the nation from 2025 to 2031. NEW YORK -- SpaceX and NASA said on Friday they planned to launch the SpaceX Crew-9 mission, a crew rotation mission to the International Space Station (ISS), no earlier than Aug 18.According to the announcement, the international crew will lift off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft.Crew-9 is the ninth crew rotation mission with SpaceX to the ISS under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.The spacecraft is scheduled to carry four astronauts to the orbiting laboratory for a six-month science research plan.In a dramatic move to address California's long-standing homelessness crisis, Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday issued an executive order for dismantling thousands of homeless encampments across the state.The action marks the most comprehensive response yet to a recent US Supreme Court ruling that expanded government authority to remove homeless individuals from public spaces."This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them — and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same," Newsom said in a statement.The governor's decision comes in the wake of a June 28 Supreme Court ruling that upheld an Oregon city's ban on homeless residents sleeping outdoors, saying the city had not violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment by ticketing homeless campers.The ruling overturned previous opinions by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, which had deemed it unconstitutional to punish people for sleeping in public spaces when they had no other legal options.Many politicians, including Newsom, blamed the appellate court's rulings, saying it limited the abilities of cities to address homelessness with arrests and citations.California's homelessness crisis has reached staggering proportions, with more than 180,000 people estimated to have experienced homelessness on any given night in 2023. Of these, 123,000 individuals were living in unsheltered conditions, inhabiting tents, trailers and vehicles across the state, according to the governor's office.Since taking office in 2019, Newsom's administration has invested approximately $24 billion to address homelessness. More than 165,000 homeless people were moved into interim or permanent housing in the 2022-23 fiscal year.Additionally, the California Department of Transportation has removed 11,188 encampments from state right of way since July 2021, according to the executive order.However, the effectiveness of the cleanup efforts has been called into question. A recent study by the RAND Center on Housing and Homelessness found that encampment cleanups have no long-term effect on reducing the number of people living on the streets.The study pointed to rising rents, high home prices, regulatory barriers to housing production and a lack of coordination among service entities as contributing factors to the persistent problem.The root causes of homelessness in California are complex and multifaceted, said researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, in their report last year. The study revealed that 75 percent of homeless adults in the state were local residents, with many citing unaffordable housing as the primary reason for their situation.California has the nation's highest housing costs, further complicating efforts to address the crisis. And despite extensive investment in homelessness programs, the state still faces a shortage of emergency housing.A growing list of Hollywood celebrities have shifted their support to US Vice-President Kamala Harris following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race.Just a month ago, Hollywood's elite turned out in force for a fundraising event for Biden, organized by former DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg. The event raised more than $30 million, making it the largest single-evening campaign haul in Democratic history. Attendees included George Clooney, Barbra Streisand and Julia Roberts.Beneath the surface camaraderie at the fundraising event, however, signs of strain emerged due to Biden's meandering answers. Influential Hollywood figures, who had consistently supported the president, expressed significant concerns over the 81-year-old's cognitive abilities, according to the Los Angeles Times.Biden's disastrous debate performance against former president Donald Trump on June 27 further compounded those concerns. Loyal supporters, previously steadfast in their backing, began advocating for him to step down.The cascade of influential voices calling for change significantly shifted the political landscape, leading to increased support for Harris. On Sunday, Biden dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House and endorsed Harris to succeed him.In 24 hours, stars from film, television, fashion, music and media — such as Jamie Lee Curtis, Spike Lee, Questlove and Ariana Grande — have voiced their support for Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.Harris raised $81 million for her White House bid in the first 24 hours after Biden announced he would not seek reelection, setting a record for the largest campaign haul in that time frame. According to Harris' campaign, more than 880,000 donors contributed to her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees.As expected, Biden and Harris received the majority of their funds from Californians, reflecting the state's large population and concentration of wealthy donors.Support from high-profile figures can significantly enhance a campaign, both financially and in terms of public visibility. A-list endorsements can attract considerable attention and potentially sway voter opinions, according to Andrzej Bartkowiak, a Hollywood cinematographer and film director.Hollywood also influences public opinion through its entertainment, according to writer and producer Bob Underwood."If you create content that resonates emotionally with people, you gain insights into how your audience feels about various issues. That's why Hollywood plays a crucial role for Democrats," Underwood told China Daily.Wilmot Reed Hastings, co-founder and executive chairman of Netflix, has donated $7 million to a super PAC (political action committee) supporting Harris, the largest single contribution to a candidate, according to a source who wasn't authorized to speak publicly."We are fully committed to Kamala and have been since she announced," said Andy Spahn, a Los Angeles political consultant who collaborates with media figures like Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg. "There is tremendous excitement and energy around Kamala's candidacy. We are all in."Agencies contributed to this story.Amid rapidly growing economic and social links, the Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, or China-CELAC Forum, marked its first decade last week.Since its inception in 2014, when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Brazil, the forum has facilitated over 90 cooperative events, strengthening links between China and the LAC region through trade, investment and partnerships across multiple industries. Trade between China and the region has almost doubled at that time to almost half a trillion dollars."In recent years, in line with the rise of its international prominence, China has promoted a set of multilateral cooperation mechanisms aimed at strengthening ties with other regions of the world," said Sebastian Schulz, a researcher at the National University of La Plata in Argentina and a researcher at the university's Center for Chinese Studies."The purpose of these initiatives is to create spaces for dialogue and partnership in areas such as commerce, finance, culture, society, education and technology, among others."Trade facilitation has been the most significant contribution of the forum, said Renzo Burotto, a historian at the University of Chile. As a result of the forum's work, China has become the largest trading partner for several Latin American countries, including Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay."Now that China has learned from its integration and going-out experience, it has positioned itself as an irreplaceable trading partner, strengthened commercial and financial institutions at both bilateral and multilateral levels with Latin American countries, and aligned its industrial and development policies with the region's export demands," Burotto said.The forum has helped China strengthen existing free trade agreements, or FTAs, with Chile, Peru and Costa Rica while facilitating Chinese investments in Latin American infrastructure projects by providing a channel to identify opportunities and coordinate priorities.CELAC was founded in 2010 to facilitate the integration of economies of some 33 member states throughout the LAC region.The forum emerged four years later when, on July 17, 2014, Xi attended a meeting of regional leaders in Brazil. That was a year after Xi launched China's Belt and Road Initiative to boost connectivity among countries in multiple regions.The first meeting of foreign ministers of forum member countries was held in Beijing in January 2015 and participants signed the first cooperation plan that included provisions to promote infrastructure development.Trade between China and Latin America has surged.Between 2000 and 2020, annual trade between the two sides skyrocketed from $12 billion to $315 billion, a 26-fold increase, according to the World Economic Forum. In 2022, trade stood at around $450 billion.Lin Jian, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, commented on the anniversary during a regular news conference on July 17, and highlighted the 90 events that have been held through the forum.Continuous progress"Over the past decade, thanks to the joint efforts of both sides, continuous progress has been made in building a China-LAC community with a shared future; and the China-LAC relationship has ushered in a new era characterized by equality, mutual benefit, innovation, openness and more benefit for the people," he said.Lin noted that China has signed Belt and Road cooperation memorandums of understanding with 22 countries in the region, and the annual trade is now nearly $500 billion.China pursued "dual-track cooperation", said Schulz. "On one hand, it's through bilateral agreements like those signed under strategic partnerships, Belt and Road Initiative or free trade agreements. On the other hand, the modalities, guiding principles and objectives of the relationships are defined regionally within the framework of the China-CELAC Forum."Despite concerns that may arise in individual countries, Burotto said Latin America should maintain strong relations with both China and traditional partners. He called for leveraging the platform to address mutual interests and concerns."Strengthening Latin America's engagement with China could demonstrate not only the interdependence of a shared future but also the high costs and counterproductiveness of decoupling or de-risking from China due to political pressures," said Burotto.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.In a busy week for Boeing, the aircraft maker has resumed delivery of 737 MAX aircraft to Chinese airlines, picked up some large orders and reached a guilty-plea deal on a criminal conspiracy charge regarding two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX jet.Boeing handed over a 737 MAX 8 to Xiamen Airlines on July 20 from Zhoushan Putuoshan Airport, where Boeing's 737 completion and delivery center is located, according to Simple Flying, an online aviation news outlet. Soon after, Boeing delivered another 737 MAX 8 to Hainan Airlines.Boeing's deliveries to China had been temporarily suspended since April due to a regulatory review of the 25-hour cockpit voice recorder (CVR) batteries.Boeing's deliveries to China have been intermittent since 2019, in part due to two fatal crashes of MAX jets that killed 348 people, and also from rising tensions over issues ranging from trade, technology to national security between the US and China.Simple Fly reported that 80 737 MAXs assigned to Chinese airlines haven't been delivered, with aircraft ages varying from 1 to more than 5 years.Overall, about 200 fully or mostly finished airplanes are parked in airfields, outside plants or other locations, awaiting parts such as interiors or engines.Boeing has been experiencing problems with plane delivery since the two MAX crashes, and recently slowed production again due to regulatory and safety scrutiny after the door panel of a Boeing 737 MAX 9 operated by Alaska Airlines blew off midair in January.Boeing's statement on second-quarter deliveries showed that the company has delivered 175 planes in the first half of 2024, a big reduction compared to 266 from the first half of 2023.Despite all the issues, Boeing picked up large orders at the Farnborough International Air show outside London, which concludes Friday.Korean Air said it would purchase up to 50 Boeing wide-body planes. The agreement calls for the airline to receive 20 777Xs and 20 787 Dreamliners, with an option to buy 10 more Dreamliners.In another agreement, with Japan Air, Boeing will deliver up to 20 additional 787 Dreamliners, including 10 787-9s, with options for 10 more.Qatar Airways also signed an agreement to purchase an additional 20 Boeing 777X aircraft, bringing the airline's commitment to the twin-aisle plane with folding wings to 94, including both passenger and freighter variants.Boeing also received a significant order of 20 737 MAX 8 narrow-body planes from Macquarie AirFinance.Overall, Boeing received orders for 118 planes at the air show, while Airbus received total orders of 85 planes as of Thursday.While Boeing is picking up pace in orders, it is still facing the aftermath of safety issues related to its MAX jets. A court filing submitted on Wednesday showed that Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government and would pay another $243.6 million in a penalty on top of the same amount previously paid by Boeing if the deal is approved.Based on the plea agreement reached earlier with the US Justice Department in July, Boeing admitted that through its employees it made an agreement "by dishonest means" to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration that evaluated the 737 MAX.As a result of Boeing's deception, the FAA was given incomplete and inaccurate information about the plane's flight-control software and how much training pilots would need to operate it before the agency gave its approval.The court document says that the US government won't charge Boeing with any other criminal offense related to the conduct. Boeing also will be put on a three-year organizational probation and "shall invest in its compliance, quality, and safety programs a total of at least $455 million". Boeing is also required to have its board meet with the families of crash victims.Agencies contributed to this story.In a dramatic move to address California's longstanding homelessness crisis, Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday issued an executive order mandating the dismantling of thousands of homeless encampments across the state.The action marks the most comprehensive response yet to a recent US Supreme Court's ruling that expanded government authority to remove homeless individuals from public spaces."This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them — and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same," Newsom said in a statement. "The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets. There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part."The governor's decision comes in the wake of a June 28 Supreme Court ruling that upheld an Oregon city's ban on homeless residents sleeping outdoors, saying the city had not violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment by ticketing homeless campers.The ruling overturned previous opinions by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, which had deemed it unconstitutional to punish people for sleeping in public spaces when they had no other legal options.Many politicians, including Newsom, blamed the appellate court's rulings, saying it limited the abilities of cities to address homelessness with arrests and citations.California's homelessness crisis has reached staggering proportions, with more than 180,000 people estimated to have experienced homelessness on any given night in 2023. Of these, 123,000 individuals were living in unsheltered conditions, inhabiting tents, trailers and vehicles across the state, according to the governor's office.Since taking office in 2019, Newsom's administration has invested approximately $24 billion into addressing homelessness. More than 165,000 people were moved from homelessness into interim or permanent housing in the 2022-23 fiscal year.Additionally, the California Department of Transportation has removed 11,188 encampments and 248,275 cubic yards of debris from state rights of way since July 2021, according to the executive order.However, the effectiveness of the cleanup efforts has been called into question. A recent study by the RAND Center on Housing and Homelessness found that encampment cleanups have no long-term effect on reducing the number of people living on the streets.The study pointed to rising rents, high home prices, regulatory barriers to housing production and a lack of coordination among service entities as contributing factors to the persistent problem.The root causes of homelessness in California are complex and multifaceted, said researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, in their report last year. The study revealed that 75 percent of homeless adults in the state were local residents, with many citing unaffordable housing as the primary reason for their situation.California has the nation's highest housing costs, further complicating efforts to address the crisis. And despite extensive investment in homelessness programs, the state still faces a shortage of emergency housing.The governor's order has ignited a heated debate among California officials and advocacy groups. Supporters of the move, like San Francisco Mayor London Breed, have welcomed the decision. The city plans to begin removing encampments next month and may start citing homeless individuals who refuse offers of shelter.On the other side of the debate, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who opposed the Supreme Court's decision, criticized Newsom's order."Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work," Bass said in a statement. "We thank the Governor for his partnership thus far and hope that he will continue collaboration on strategies that work."A growing list of Hollywood celebrities have shifted their support to US Vice-President Kamala Harris following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race.Just a month ago, Hollywood's elite turned out in force for a fundraising event for Biden, organized by former DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg. The event raised more than $30 million, making it the largest single-evening campaign haul in Democratic history. Attendees included George Clooney, Barbra Streisand and Julia Roberts.Beneath the surface camaraderie at the fundraising event, however, signs of strain emerged due to Biden's meandering answers. Influential Hollywood figures, who had consistently supported the president, expressed significant concerns about the 81-year-old's cognitive abilities, according to the Los Angeles Times.Biden's disastrous debate performance against former president Donald Trump on June 27 further compounded those concerns. Loyal supporters, previously steadfast in their backing, began advocating for him to step down.The cascade of influential voices calling for change significantly shifted the political landscape, leading to increased support for Harris. On Sunday, Biden dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House and endorsed Harris to succeed him.Biden's decision to not seek re-election was praised by Democratic political figures and personalities. Clooney, in a statement to CNN, said Biden displayed "true leadership" and, "We're all so excited to do whatever we can to support Vice-President Harris in her historic quest."On June 10, the actor wrote a blistering op-ed for The New York Times, stating, "I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee."Andre Morgan, a film and television producer, told China Daily that Hollywood still loves Biden. "They love him more. Hollywood is very predictable," he said.In 24 hours, stars from film, television, fashion, music and media — such as Jamie Lee Curtis, Spike Lee, Questlove and Ariana Grande — have voiced their support for Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.Harris raised $81 million for her White House bid in the first 24 hours after Biden announced he would not seek reelection, setting a record for the largest campaign haul in that time frame. According to Harris' campaign, more than 880,000 donors contributed to her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees.As expected, Biden and Harris received the majority of their funds from Californians, reflecting the state's large population and concentration of wealthy donors.Support from high-profile figures can significantly enhance a campaign, both financially and in terms of public visibility. A-list endorsements can attract considerable attention and potentially sway voter opinions, according to Andrzej Bartkowiak, a Hollywood cinematographer and film director."I have faith in her to do what is right, not just for America but for the world," Bartkowiak said of Harris.Hollywood also influences public opinion through its entertainment, according to writer and producer Bob Underwood."If you create content that resonates emotionally with people, you gain insight into how your audience feels about various issues. That's why Hollywood plays a crucial role for Democrats," Underwood told China Daily.Wilmot Reed Hastings, co-founder and executive chairman of Netflix, has donated $7 million to a super PAC (political action committees) supporting Harris, the largest single contribution to a candidate, according to a source who wasn't authorized to speak publicly."We are fully committed to Kamala and have been since she announced," said Andy Spahn, a Los Angeles political consultant who collaborates with media figures like Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg. "There is tremendous excitement and energy around Kamala's candidacy. We are all in."Agencies contributed to this story.China's top UN envoy reiterated on Thursday that China is "not a creator of the Ukraine crisis" but rather, it promotes peace and a political solution."China is not a creator of the Ukraine crisis, much less a party to it," Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, said at a Security Council meeting initiated by Russia to discuss the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine."However, we did not sit by. On the contrary, we have all along insisted on promoting peace and negotiation and pushing for a political solution, (to) which the international community can bear witness," Fu said.Fu made his statement to refute a US envoy's claim that China's "partnership and large-scale support is propping up the Russian defense industrial base"."Russia deploys its acquisitions from China in attacks that kill civilians and destroy Ukraine's infrastructure," said Robert Wood, US deputy permanent representative to the UN.China's effort to promote peace in the Ukraine conflict "is not something that the United States can write off simply by resorting to slandering", Fu said.He emphasized that China has "never poured oil on the fire or taken advantage of the situation, nor has it provided lethal weapons to any party to the conflict. China exercises stricter control over military and civilian dual-use items."The Chinese enterprises carry out normal economic and trade cooperation with other countries, including Russia and Ukraine, in accordance with the rules of the WTO and the rules of the market. This is totally reasonable, justified and beyond reproach," Fu added.Fu mentioned Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba's visit to China and said the two sides had in-depth exchanges of views on the Ukraine crisis."We note that Foreign Minister Kuleba said that Ukraine values China's views and has carefully studied the six-point understandings proposed by China and Brazil on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, and that Ukraine is willing and ready to engage in dialogue and negotiation with Russia," he said.Kuleba met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday in Guangzhou, the first visit to China by a Ukrainian foreign minister since the military conflict with Russian began in February 2022.The Ukraine situation occurred against the "backdrop of historical complexities and practical realities", Fu said, adding that it is "in essence an eruption of security dynamics in Europe"."China had no part in creating this crisis, nor is it a party to the conflict. China has not provided lethal weaponry to any party to the conflict and has not and will not do anything to profit from it. China's position on the Ukraine issue has been consistent and clear. It is to urge and promote peace through a political settlement," he said.Pro-Palestine protests turned violent in Washington, DC, on Wednesday as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the US Congress.The protesters called for the United States to stop military aid to Israel. They hoisted Palestinian flags and burned US ones outside Washington's Union Station in demonstrations.About 1 kilometer away, police used pepper spray on some of the thousands of protesters who gathered outside the US Capitol while Netanyahu spoke.Before Netanyahu's speech, some protesters tried to block his route to the Capitol but were removed from the street by police. After being turned away by officers near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of the nearby rail station.Various videos posted on social media platform X showed police and protesters clashing, along with images of monuments covered in red paint and slogans in favor of Palestine and against Israel.Netanyahu was scheduled to meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris on Thursday and former president Donald Trump on Friday.Shortly before Netanyahu started speaking, Capitol Police said protesters in a march tried crossing a blockade and did not retreat when asked."The crowd failed to obey our order to move back from our police line. We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line," police said in a statement."We were no threat (to police)," said Sarah Bowles, a pharmacy technician from Delaware who attended the protest and assisted injured protesters. One of the protesting groups said police attacked demonstrators as they marched.Nine people were arrested across Washington, including four on charges of assaulting a police officer outside Union Station.Capitol Police said in a post on X that six people who disrupted Netanyahu's address were removed from the House gallery and arrested."Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the congressional buildings is against the law," police said.Outside of Union Station, protesters shouted "Let them go!" at officers who formed a circle around several people who were arrested. One person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance.'Wanted criminal'Pro-Palestinian groups and university students have for months protested in the US against Israel's offensive in Gaza, where health authorities say nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed.A stage at the protest site near the Capitol was decked out with banners, including one that declared the Israeli leader a "wanted war criminal" in reference to an arrest warrant sought by International Criminal Court prosecutors. Netanyahu denies war crime allegations.Dozens of Democratic lawmakers skipped Netanyahu's speech to Congress in protest over the deaths and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where nearly all of its 2.3 million people have been displaced.US Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up signs that said "war criminal "and "guilty of genocide" during Netanyahu's speech.Meanwhile, negotiations on a cease-fire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages and Biden and Netanyahu will discuss remaining gaps on Thursday, a senior US official said on Wednesday.The official, briefing reporters ahead of their talks, said the remaining obstacles are bridgeable and there will be more meetings aimed at reaching a deal between Israel and Hamas over the next week.Militants of Hamas stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies. Hamas and other militants are still holding 120 hostages, and Israel believes around a third of them are dead.Months of stop-start talks have failed to produce a deal to secure the release of some of the remaining hostages.The senior US official said both Israel and Hamas still have some issues to resolve but that a deal is close in which a six-week ceasefire would take place in exchange for the release of women, elderly men and wounded hostages over a 42-day period.Agencies contributed to this story.In face of the recent record-setting heat wave that tested California's power grid, experts attributed the state's success to its commitment to renewable energy and called for collaboration with China to accelerate the path to a fully clean electricity grid.California has set aggressive targets for renewable energy adoption, with state law requiring 90 percent of all retail electricity sales to come from renewable sources by 2035 and 100 percent by 2045. To meet those ambitious goals, the state is turning its attention to offshore wind power."In California, we have zero offshore wind today ... right now, China is far ahead of the US on the offshore wind industry," Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, and director of its Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory, said.California has designated two zones for offshore wind farms — one in Humboldt Bay in the north, and another in central California. "Offshore wind is exciting because it can be permitted more quickly and serves as a 'battery' for the grid," Kammen said.Offshore wind can complement the production cycles of solar and on-land wind energy. That characteristic is particularly valuable, as solar production quickly diminishes when the sun sets, requiring system operators to replace those megawatts with other sources in real time to maintain grid stability.It also offers flexibility in energy production, capable of generating electricity during peak demand and producing hydrogen or methanol during periods of low electricity prices. That flexibility presents huge opportunities to decarbonize sectors that have traditionally been difficult to transition to clean energy, Kammen said.The state can directly apply some of China's practices, he said. "The best way to apply it is not just to read about it, but to actually get partners from China."California has already taken such steps by inviting engineering groups from Norway. The state is also exploring opportunities in fuel cells, hydrogen production and other offshore renewable energy sources, such as tidal and wave power. Those areas promise rich opportunities for knowledge exchange and collaboration with Chinese partners, who have wide experience in the fields, Kammen added.California and China have a history of partnership in developing clean energy technologies.Kammen, however, stressed the need to accelerate the collaborations. He highlighted his own partnerships with research colleagues at Tsinghua University and North China Electric Power University, as well as with Chinese companies such as Geely."We want to build more of those teams so that we can move quickly when the politics let it happen," he said.Gaining momentumDespite tensions at the national level, locality cooperation between China and the United States has gained momentum recently."I think the conference may give you the best example," said Richard Dasher, director of the US-Asia Technology Management Center at Stanford University, referring to the 2024 Global Green Development Summit at his university on the weekend.The summit, held by the Global Green Development Alliance, brought together climate and energy experts, as well as business leaders from both countries to discuss "energy transition and innovation for carbon neutrality".Companies must provide solutions that are both economically viable and attractive to consumers, Dasher said.Kammen emphasized the need for a combination of Silicon Valley's innovative mentality and the large-scale industrial capacity of entities such as China's State Grid and the State Grid Electric Vehicle Service.He pointed to the productivity of new companies and university offshoots as evidence of the potential for collaborative innovation with Chinese companies.US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday night in a nationally televised address that he decided not to seek a second term because he wanted to "pass the torch to a new generation", which he said is "the best way" to unite the nation.In the 13-minute speech, Biden made references to the danger he said the United States would face if Donald Trump wins the Nov 5 election, without naming the former president and Republican nominee.He said he was dropping out of the race against Trump to help heal the wounds in the Democratic Party and unite Democrats in the goal of winning."Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition," he said during a prime-time address in the Oval Office."You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. But there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices and that time and place is now," he said.It was Biden's first explanation about his abrupt departure from the 2024 presidential race and capped more than 50 years in politics.Biden said that during the last six months of his time in office, he will be focused on his job as president, from working to grow the economy to "defending our personal freedoms".The president touched on a lot of the themes of his campaign.The political aspects of the message prompted Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump, to post on X: "Every single network that televised this campaign speech will be getting follow-up letters from our attorneys regarding equal time."Biden said he would call for Supreme Court reform in his final months in office.The Supreme Court and its 6-3 conservative majority has in recent years made a series of landmark decisions, overturning Roe versus Wade on abortion rights, limiting affirmative action and granting wide immunity to presidents for official acts taken while in office.Praise for HarrisBiden also praised Vice-President Kamala Harris, 59, the likely Democratic nominee, as a strong leader who would make an effective president, saying that she is experienced, tough and capable.The speech comes after he dropped his bid early Sunday afternoon in a letter addressed to "my fellow Americans", the first sitting president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 not to seek a second term in the White House.Then he announced the decision in a post on X and he followed that moments later with an endorsement of Harris for the nomination.Harris has consolidated support from within the Democratic Party and is expected to win a virtual roll call of Democratic delegates — perhaps without opposition — as early as Aug 1 and no later than Aug 7.Biden returned to the White House on Tuesday after testing negative for COVID-19. He began drafting his anticipated address while isolating with the virus in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, senior officials told CNN.A Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Tuesday showed Harris with a 2 percentage-point lead over Trump, 44 percent to 42 percent. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS showed Trump leading Harris, 49 percent to 46 percent. Both findings were within the polls' margins of error.The Harris campaign on Wednesday said it had raised $126 million since Sunday, with 64 percent of donors making their first contribution of the 2024 campaign.Agencies contributed to this story.It was an occasion to celebrate the personal experiences of the sister-city relationships over the years.Alix Nathan, president of the Portland-Suzhou Sister City Association in Oregon, said at the sixth US-China Sister Cities Summit on Friday in Tacoma, Washington state, that one of the most crucial aspects of the exchanges and relationship with sister city Suzhou, in East China's Jiangsu province, is in education."For more than 20 years, Portland has been using and working with schools in the US and Suzhou to facilitate reciprocal school-to-school bilateral group programing for students," Nathan told China Daily.His association has assisted in the effort by spending a minimum of one week visiting each other's classrooms, city attractions, parks and museums, as well as spending time with host families."Obviously, during the pandemic, many of these programs were shut down," he said. "However, now we're very excited to rekindle this relationship, as we have many schools restarting their activities to promote American students from Portland going to China, with more than 12 schools now enlisted in activities to foster exchanges in the coming year."During the summit, a delegation of 13 students from the Affiliated High School of Fuzhou Institute of Education in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian province, arrived in Tacoma for an 11-day educational exchange program."Besides the beautiful country and the delicious food we had, making friends and talking to people was the best part," Izabell Saldana, a 12th grader at Lincoln High School in Tacoma, said of her multicity trip to China last month. "I do believe that this is absolutely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."Celeste Nunez Salcido, director of international business resources for the New Mexico Trade Alliance, was the US fellow during the 2023 Gansu International Fellowship Program organized by the Gansu provincial government.The fellowship convenes professional candidates from around the world to learn about Gansu's and China's economic development efforts, cultural heritage, language and history to promote mutual understanding and peaceful cooperation.Salcido's participation in the program marked the first exchange opportunity between Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Lanzhou, Gansu province, since the pandemic."Here, every one of you is a citizen diplomat," she said in her speech at the end of the summit. "Every one of you has the ability and power to strengthen these friendships that lead to cooperation."She said cooperation is important for the shared challenges of the future."The US and China are the top two global economies. This is not going to change in the near future. And that means that we need people to understand each other," she said.Yang Wanming, president of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, told China Daily it will launch a youth exchange program next year, inviting and organizing trips for 1,000 US high school and university students aged 16 to 22 to China."Through a seven-to-10-day visit, students will experience a real, multidimensional and comprehensive China. They will become young ambassadors for promoting Sino-American relations," Yang said. US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday after outrage expressed by both political parties over her agency's failure to prevent an assassination attempt against former president Donald Trump at a campaign rally 10 days ago in Pennsylvania.Cheatle, 53, announced her resignation through an internal email. She said that "in light of recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to step down as your director". Cheatle said that she didn't want the calls for her resignation "to be a distraction from the great work" the agency is doing.Cheatle served on the team of agents that secured Vice-President Dick Cheney on Sept. 11, 2001. Cheatle later worked on Joe Biden's detail during his vice-presidency and was assigned to his wife, Jill Biden.President Biden issued a statement Tuesday after her resignation: "As a leader, it takes honor, courage and incredible integrity to take full responsibility for an organization tasked with one of the most challenging jobs in public service."Within minutes after news of Cheatle's resignation broke, Trump posted a statement on his social media network saying: "The Biden/Harris Administration did not properly protect me, and I was forced to take a bullet for Democracy. IT WAS MY GREAT HONOR TO DO SO!"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appointed Secret Service Deputy Director Ronald Rowe as the agency's acting director. Rowe is a 24-year veteran of the service. In an interview last week, Rowe defended Cheatle's leadership and said she shouldn't resign.The security measure during Trump's July 13 rally was seriously flawed by not monitoring a nearby warehouse, where the gunman, Thomas Crooks, 20, positioned himself for the shooting.The day before her resignation, Cheatle testified at a congressional hearing where she offered no clear answers to the failure to protect Trump.She acknowledged that the shooter was identified as suspicious — having had a range finder and backpack — more than an hour before he opened fire. She also acknowledged that Secret Service agents had received multiple notifications of a person acting suspiciously "somewhere between two and five times" prior to the shooting.However, the potential threat seemed to not have been conveyed to Trump's security team."If the detail had been passed information that there was a threat, the detail would never have brought the former president out on the stage," Cheatle said in the hearing.Crooks fired at least six rounds from an AR-15-style rifle from the roof of the American Glass Research building, roughly 400 feet from where Trump spoke. The shots killed one spectator, critically injured two others and grazed Trump's right ear.A Secret Service sniper team shot back, killing Crooks, whose motive remains unknown.House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Tuesday agreed to form a bipartisan task force to lead the congressional investigation into the assassination attempt."The security failures that allowed an assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life are shocking," Johnson and Jeffries said in a joint statement. "The task force will be empowered with subpoena authority and will move quickly to find the facts, ensure accountability, and make certain such failures never happen again." US Vice-President Kamala Harris, having now secured backing from Congress' top Democrats, held her first presidential-style campaign rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday, where she sharply criticized the Republican nominee Donald Trump.Harris continued to bolster her political support Tuesday after announcing that she also had secured pledges from enough party delegates to secure the Democratic nomination for president.Harris, 59, had moved quickly to shore up her likely nomination after President Joe Biden, 81, on Sunday announced that he would not seek reelection. Biden endorsed Harris that day, and the vice-president's campaign picked up steam.Most Democratic lawmakers have lined up behind her candidacy, including the party's leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who endorsed Harris on Tuesday at a joint press conference. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed Harris on Monday.Democrats were looking to unify the party following a tumultuous month of infighting over whether Biden should remain the nominee.An Associated Press unofficial survey found that Harris has the support of 3,095 delegates from various states — 1,976 are needed for the nomination. Delegates still may vote for the candidate they prefer when the party picks its new nominee next month at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago."This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. This is about who we fight for," she said before an enthusiastic audience Tuesday at a high school in West Allis, a Milwaukee suburb.Wisconsin, along with Michigan and Ohio are crucial US Rust Belt battleground states in the November election."The path to the White House goes through Wisconsin. And to win in Wisconsin, we are counting on you, right here in Milwaukee," Harris said in the 17-minute speech. "Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?" she said. "We believe in the sacred freedom to vote. We believe that every person in our nation should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence … and we trust women to make decisions about their own bodies."Of her time as a prosecutor in California, Harris said she "took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women; fraudsters who ripped off consumers; cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type," in an apparent reference to some of the former president's legal issues.Harris has previously served as the San Francisco district attorney, the California attorney general and a US senator from the state.She has faced some controversy for her stance on marijuana. During Harris' tenure as district attorney in San Francisco from 2004 to 2011, more than 1,900 people were convicted for marijuana offenses, Forbes reported.She opposed a California ballot initiative in 2010 that would legalize cannabis, although she did favor its medical use. In 2015, she favored the lifting of a federal ban on medical marijuana.In a call with reporters on Tuesday, Trump criticized Harris' record on immigration since she was tasked by Biden with looking into the root causes of the migration surge."Kamala Harris was appointed border czar, as you know, in March 2021, and since that time, millions and millions of illegal aliens have invaded our country, and countless Americans have been killed by migrant crime because of her willful demolition of American borders and laws," Trump said on the call.A July 22 YouGov poll showed Trump had a 15 percent lead on Harris on the issue of immigration.Recent polls on voter preference overall are mixed.Harris led Trump 44 percent to 42 percent among registered voters in a national Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday.A recent YouGov poll showed Trump ahead 44 percent to 39 percent, among registered voters. A Yahoo News poll had each candidate with 46 percent, in a contest that has five candidates.Trump said Tuesday that he would like to debate Harris "more than once" but did not commit to appearing at the next scheduled debate in September on ABC.Trump told reporters that he was "not thrilled at ABC" and may want another network, such as Fox, to air the debate. He said he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice — during the June 27 debate that led to the president bowing out of the race, and then in September.But Trump said he still wants to debate Harris."I think debating's important for a presidential race," he said. "You sort of have an obligation to debate."Agencies contributed to this story.WASHINGTON - US Vice President Kamala Harris, who has garnered wide support to become the Democratic presidential nominee, holds a two-percentage-point lead over Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to the latest poll.In a Reuters/Ipsos survey conducted on Monday and Tuesday, one of the first following incumbent President Joe Biden's exit from the race on Sunday, Harris leads Trump by 44 percent to 42 percent, a margin within the poll's error range.Harris, 59, is viewed as "mentally sharp and capable of handling challenges" by 56 percent of registered voters, compared to 49 percent for Trump, 78.On Monday, Harris announced that she had secured enough support from her party, just a day after Biden withdrew from the race under growing pressure from Democrats concerned about his age and mental fitness to serve another term.A PBS/NPR/Marist survey conducted on Monday shows Trump leading Harris 46-45 percent, with 9 percent of respondents undecided.The poll further indicates that 41 percent of Americans, including 65 percent of Democrats, believe Biden's departure improves the Democrats' chances of winning in November.In her first presidential campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Tuesday, Harris framed the choice between herself and Trump as one between "freedom, compassion, and the rule of law" versus "chaos, fear, and hate"."Donald Trump wants to take our country backward," she told a cheering crowd.Meanwhile, Trump expressed confidence in his ability to beat Harris during a conference call on Tuesday, offering to engage in "more than one debate" with her. He spent much of the call criticizing Harris' record on immigration and border issues, according to US media reports.The Chancay Port project in Peru, being built by China's COSCO Shipping, could facilitate trade with the entire Latin American region and cut the time it takes to ship products by almost two weeks.The $3.5 billion mega project, identified as a gateway from Latin America to Asia, could facilitate direct shipping between the two regions, said Carlos Aquino, an economist and director of the Center for Asian Studies at Peru's National University of San Marcos.Chancay also has the potential to become South America's main logistics hub because it could facilitate the shipment of products from mountain and jungle regions, Aquino said. Opening a direct shipping route will also be more cost-effective to export products to China.Alejandro Indacochea, president of Indacochea Asociados, a law firm that specializes in oil and gas, said he expects the port will cut shipment times.Other countries in the region could also benefit from the port. Brazil, a large buyer of Chinese products and supplier of commodities to China, could benefit from the port as could nearby countries such as Ecuador, Colombia and Chile, Indacochea said. The port could support the development of the entire Peruvian coast, as well as agricultural and mining exports."If Brazil could send its cargo through the port of Chancay and directly to China, it is said that it could save perhaps up to 15 days or a little more (in transport time). So, I believe that this is another great benefit," Aquino told China Daily.China's state-owned COSCO Shipping holds a 60 percent stake in the Chancay Port project, the first phase of which could be completed later this year. COSCO invested $1.3 billion in the first phase of the mega port, which is about 83 percent complete.Challenges remainHowever, Indacochea said that challenges remain in the development of the port, including developing a complementary infrastructure network, integrating the port with an industrial park and railway networks, and facilitating the routing of exports through it."This project is in the pipeline, but I don't think the geopolitical and economic scope and magnitude it has for Latin America is fully appreciated," Indacochea said.More than 35 percent of Peru's export trade is directed to China, which consumes 80 percent of the Andean nation's copper exports, Indacochea said.In Beijing late last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with visiting Peruvian President Dina Boluarte Zegarra.The two leaders said they aim to boost trade and strengthen economic ties. They also agreed to upgrade an existing free trade agreement. China and Peru signed an FTA in 2009, the first such agreement that Beijing signed with a country in Latin America.The meeting resulted in cooperation agreements covering various fields, including the digital economy and scientific and technological innovation.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.OTTAWA -- About 17,500 Albertans were out of their homes from the Jasper and nearby wildfires in western Canada, local media reported Tuesday.Everyone in Jasper National Park, the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies, along with residents of the Jasper townsite were ordered out late Monday night.The Albertan province, the Municipality of Jasper and Jasper National Park said Tuesday that evacuation from the town and the park was "progressing well."On Tuesday, British Columbia Wildfire was reporting 300 active wildfires, and Alberta Wildfire was reporting 176 active wildfires.Thick smoke from wildfires in Alberta and British Columbia settled over Alberta, according to CTV News.The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) in Calgary was rated as a 7 (high risk), with some locations, including Edmonton and Red Deer, reaching a 10+ (the highest rating on the AQHI scale), CTV News reported.UNITED NATIONS -- Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, on Tuesday called on all parties concerned to stay on the course of political solution to the Yemen crisis, emphasizing that "the settlement of the Yemeni question requires political and diplomatic means."In remarks at the Security Council briefing on Yemen, Fu said China hopes that all parties concerned will stay on the course of political solution, build consensus, meet each other halfway, jointly promote a Yemeni-led and Yemeni-owned comprehensive political process, and resolve tensions and differences through dialogue and negotiation."The international community should provide assistance and play a constructive role in this regard," he pointed out.With the ongoing tensions in the Red Sea unsettling, the Chinese side once again urged the Houthis to respect the right of navigation of commercial vessels under international law in the Red Sea, cease attacks, and maintain safe navigation in the Red Sea water, said Fu.He also called on other relevant parties to maintain restraint and halt any actions that may exacerbate tensions.Addressing the humanitarian situation in Yemen, which "remains grim," the ambassador said the international community should scale up humanitarian and development assistance to Yemen, support and help the government and people of Yemen to develop economy and improve living conditions.He noted that China expresses its serious concerns of the detention of UN personnel in Yemen, and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all UN personnel.Stressing that the tensions in the Red Sea are a prominent manifestation of the spillover of the Gaza conflict, Fu called for the full and effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions and the promotion of an immediate ceasefire in Gaza."We call on all parties to exercise restraint, avoid further escalations, and prevent plunging the entire region into an even greater catastrophe," he said, adding that China stays committed to working with the international community and making unremitting efforts for the political settlement of the Yemeni question and the maintenance of peace and stability in the Middle East. WASHINGTON -- US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday after widespread outrage over the agency's failure to prevent the recent assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month.Cheatle's resignation came one day after she was grilled at a congressional hearing by lawmakers, who said she failed to answer basic questions and demanded that she step down immediately.At the hearing held by the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, Cheatle acknowledged that it was "the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades".The committee issued a statement following the hearing. "Republican and Democrat members pressed US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle for answers on the egregious security lapses that led to the attempted assassination of (former) President Trump, the murder of an innocent victim, and harm to others in the crowd at the campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania," it said."Director Cheatle could not or refused to answer basic questions from Committee members, leading Republican and Democrat members to call for Director Cheatle's immediate resignation," the committee said.At the hearing, Cheatle frequently stated that it's only 9 days after the shooting, and she was still waiting for reports of the ongoing investigations, emphasizing her effort to ensure the information she provided was accurate.When asked why the Secret Service failed to secure a rooftop in proximity to the rally site and with a clear view of Trump's podium, Cheatle suggested that the Secret Service had intentionally left the rooftop unattended, as the agency preferred "sterile" rooftops, meaning empty ones.She explained that the warehouse rooftop was meant to have "overwatch", with law enforcement officers monitoring it from a higher vantage point. "There was a plan in place to provide overwatch and we are still looking into responsibilities and who was going to provide overwatch."When asked whether the Trump detail requested additional resources before the event, Cheatle said that "for the event on July 13th, the assets that were requested for that day, were given".A recorded footage clearly showed the gunman, who was getting into position to assassinate Trump, caught the attention of some people around. When asked why the rally wasn't paused at that point when people alarmed officers, Cheatle said "we are currently still combing through communications and when communications were passed."The US Secret Service has been facing scrutiny after a 20-year-old man, identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as Thomas Matthew Crooks, armed with an AR-style rifle, was able to get close enough to shoot and injure the former president. WASHINGTON - US Vice President Kamala Harris said late Monday that she has secured enough support of Democratic delegates to become the party's nominee for the upcoming presidential election."Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee," she wrote in a statement sent by her campaign. "I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon."Under mounting pressure from within the Democratic Party, US President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he was dropping out of the 2024 presidential race. He also offered his full support for nominating Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate.Harris has won endorsement from a number of prominent Democratic figures including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has urged the party to unify and charge forward to "resoundingly defeat" former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.The United States as a staunch backer of Israel should seize the opportunity to urge visiting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to observe United Nations resolutions and international laws, experts said.They also said the international community needs to work together to ensure the International Court of Justice's decision to call Israel's presence in Palestinian territory unlawful is implemented.Netanyahu, who left for the US on Monday, traveled to Washington to meet with US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. Netanyahu told reporters before he boarded the plane that his visit would be an opportunity to discuss the goals for both Israel and the US in the "critical months ahead".Ayman Yousef, a professor of international relations at the Arab American University in Jenin in the West Bank, said the meeting would be a chance for the Democratic Party to apply pressure on Netanyahu.Yousef said they can push the Israeli prime minister to agree to a cease-fire deal with Hamas and also avoid any negative intervention by him in the coming US elections.The ICJ said on Friday that Israel's presence in the Palestinian territory was unlawful. The call came just a day after the Knesset, Israel's parliament, rejected a resolution establishing Palestinian statehood, which was widely criticized.Netanyahu has slammed the ICJ ruling as "absurd", adding that no opinion from The Hague "can deny the historical truth or legal right of Israelis" to live in their "ancestral home".The UN Security Council had previously passed several resolutions on Gaza. The latest one, Resolution 2735, passed in June.Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, said the ICJ's legal opinion "confirms and reinforces the Palestinian people's attainment of their legitimate and legal rights in accordance with international and UN resolutions to regain the Palestinian territories seized by the Israeli occupation forces".The countries that have backed the ICJ's decision include Belgium, Iceland, Norway, Ireland, Slovenia, Spain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt. Traditional US allies Australia and the United Kingdom said they respected the ICJ's role in upholding international law and the independence of the ICJ, respectively.Omar Awadallah, Palestine's assistant foreign minister for the UN and Specialized Agencies, said the "historic" advisory opinion was "not only for the question of Palestine but for justice and for all the legal system".Awadallah, who was part of the delegation to the ICJ sessions, said he believed that this determination "will help in achieving justice and stability in the region if it's implemented"."Our move will be toward countries bilaterally. That means that we will be working with states toward taking irreversible steps, toward taking actions by putting consequences on this illegal occupation," Awadallah told China Daily.Hassan Ben Imran, board member at Law for Palestine, a nonprofit human rights organization, lauded the court's advisory opinion as it offered several legal grounds for Palestinians "to further their legal struggle for freedom and liberation".But he said he is not optimistic that Israel would comply with the resolutions, suggesting that the only way forward could be imposing economic, political, and military sanctions on Israel, including suspending its UN membership.United States President Joe Biden, after nearly a month of mounting pressure from his own party, dropped his reelection bid on Sunday and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris to head the Democratic ticket in November."It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president," he wrote in a letter posted on social media. "And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus entirely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term."Biden's endorsement of Harris came in a subsequent post on social media platform X."Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year," Biden wrote. "Democrats — it's time to come together and beat Trump."Harris said, "I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party- and our nation — to defeat Donald Trump." She added that she was honored to have Biden's endorsement, and wrote on X that "my intention is to earn and win this nomination".The Democratic candidate, to be nominated at the Democratic National Convention, which starts on Aug 19 in Chicago, will face former president Trump, 78, the Republican nominee.While Trump said on Sunday that Harris would be easier to defeat than Biden, he continued to criticize Biden, telling NBC News, "There has never been a president who has done such damage to our country, from energy independence to letting in millions and millions of illegal immigrants."House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, wrote on social media: "The Democrat Party forced the Democrat nominee off the ballot, just over 100 days before the election. Having invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president, the self-proclaimed 'party of democracy' has proven exactly the opposite."Debbie Walsh, director at the Center for American Women and Politics, said of Harris, 59, who is of Jamaican and Asian Indian descent, "Should she win the nomination, the nation will watch a multiracial woman compete in a presidential general election for the first time in history."Harris began shoring up support on Sunday. The North Carolina and South Carolina delegates pledged their backing for her on Sunday evening, as did some governors and members of Congress.While Biden endorsed Harris, her nomination is not guaranteed, and there could be a rare open convention, also referred to as a "floor fight". There also has been talk of Democrats selecting a nominee virtually before the convention.Harris needs the backing of 1,969 of the 3,936 Democratic delegates to secure the nomination.Among the names mentioned as other potential Democratic presidential candidates are governors Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Andy Beshear of Kentucky. Some of them also could be considered as potential vice-presidential running mates for Harris.Biden and Harris together had raised a $240 million war chest as of June 30, according to The New York Times.Media reports circulated last week that Biden, 81, would step down on Sunday, but the stories lost steam after Biden angrily dismissed them.The president's political fortunes began to crumble after his dismal performance in a debate with Trump on June 27.Former president Barack Obama praised Biden, his former vice-president, in a statement on Medium.com on Sunday, saying that Biden "wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America".Obama said Biden "pointed us away from the four years of chaos, falsehood and division that had characterized Donald Trump's administration".Agencies contributed to this story. WASHINGTON -- Former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, on Monday endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee, consolidating support for Harris following incumbent President Joe Biden's exit from the race."With immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future, I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for President of the United States. My enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris for President is official, personal and political," Pelosi said in a statement posted on her personal account on X, formerly known as Twitter."Politically, make no mistake: Kamala Harris as a woman in politics is brilliantly astute -- and I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory in November," said Pelosi.Noting that diversity is the Democratic Party's strength, the former House speaker also urged the party to unify and charge forward to "resoundingly defeat" former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.Pelosi's statement came one day after Biden announced that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race, after a new wave of concerns about his age and mental fitness surged following his disastrous debate performance on June 27.After announcing his withdrawal, Biden offered his full support for nominating Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate and urged Democrats to unite to defeat Trump. Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife, former US Senator and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, have also expressed their support for Harris as the party's nominee.However, in statements released shortly after Biden's exit, Pelosi and other Democratic heavyweights such as former President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries did not immediately endorse Harris, sparking speculation whether they want to leave their options open.As one of Biden's staunchest allies, Pelosi's approval acts as a significant show of support for Harris. This gesture is significant as it follows a tumultuous few weeks within the Democratic Party, characterized by internal disputes. WASHINGTON - US Vice-President Kamala Harris made her first public appearance on Monday since entering the presidential race after President Joe Biden, 81, abruptly abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed her as his successor."Joe Biden's legacy over the last three years is unmatched in modern history," Harris said, before delivering remarks at a White House event to honor college athletes.ReutersSAN FRANCISCO — CrowdStrike's routine update of its widely used cybersecurity software, which caused clients' computer systems to crash globally on Friday, apparently did not undergo adequate quality checks before it was deployed, security experts say.The latest version of its Falcon sensor software was meant to make CrowdStrike clients' systems more secure against hacking by updating the threats it defends against. But a faulty code in the update files resulted in one of the most widespread tech outages in recent years for companies using Microsoft's Windows operating system.Global banks, airlines, hospitals and government offices were disrupted. "We currently estimate that CrowdStrike's update affected 8.5 million Windows devices," Microsoft said in a blog post on Saturday.CrowdStrike released information to fix affected systems, but experts said getting them back online would take time as it required manually weeding out the flawed code."What it looks like is, potentially, the vetting or the sandboxing they do when they look at code, maybe somehow this file was not included in that or slipped through," said Steve Cobb, chief security officer at Security Scorecard in New York, which also had some systems affected by the issue.Problems came to light quickly after the update was rolled out on Friday and users posted pictures on social media of computers with blue screens displaying error messages.Patrick Wardle, a security researcher specializing in studying threats against operating systems, said his analysis identified the code responsible for the outage.The update's problem was "in a file that contains either configuration information or signatures", he said. Such signatures are code that detects specific types of malicious code or malware."It's very common that security products update their signatures, like once a day ... because they're continually monitoring for new malware and because they want to make sure that their customers are protected from the latest threats," he said.The frequency of updates "is probably the reason why (CrowdStrike) didn't test it as much", he said.It is unclear how that faulty code got into the update and why it was not detected before being released to customers."Ideally, this would have been rolled out to a limited pool first," said John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress Labs in Maryland. "That is a safer approach to avoid a big mess like this."Agencies via Xinhua US President Joe Biden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee, moments after he made a stunning decision that he would no longer seek the Democratic nomination for president."Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year," Biden said in a post shared on X on Sunday.

He is the first sitting US president to not seek reelection since Lyndon B. Johnson in March 1968."Should she win the nomination, the nation will watch a multiracial woman compete in a presidential general election for the first time in history," Debbie Walsh, director at the Center for American Women & Politics, said of Harris, 59, who is of Jamaican and Asian Indian descent.Harris previously served as a US senator from California and as California attorney general.She immediately got to work shoring up her support on Sunday, and as the evening wore on she appeared to be quickly building momentum. The North Carolina and South Carolina delegates pledged their support to her on Sunday evening as did a growing list of Democratic governors and members of Congress.While Biden did endorse Harris, her nomination is not guaranteed, and there could be a rare open convention, also referred to as a "floor fight". There also had been talk of Democrats selecting a nominee virtually before the convention.But Representative Nanette Barragán of California, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who said she spoke with Harris on Sunday, said the vice-president wants to forego a virtual roll call for the nomination process and instead hold a process that adheres to regular order.Harris needs the backing of 1,969 of the 3,936 Democratic delegates to secure her nomination, Reuters reported."Biden does not control his delegates: He cannot tell them whom to vote for next month. And party politics being what it is, they are most likely to go with whomever they think has the best chance to defeat Mr. Trump," The New York Times reported on Sunday.Among the names mentioned as other potential Democratic presidential candidates are governors Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.Although Newsom wrote on X on Sunday: "With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump's dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America's Vice President, @KamalaHarris."Whitmer and Beshear issued statements praising Biden but did not mention Harris.Biden and Harris together had raised a massive campaign war chest of $240 million through various entities as of June 30, according to the Times.ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform, announced it had collected $46.7 million as of 9 pm ET from small-dollar donations for Harris' campaign.Media reports circulated last week that Biden would step down on Sunday, but the stories lost steam as Biden angrily dismissed them.Biden's political fortunes began to crumble after his dismal performance in a debate with Trump on June 27. Gaffes in subsequent interviews and appearances led to more doubts about whether he should continue.Former president Barack Obama praised Biden, his former vice-president, in a statement on Medium.com on Sunday, saying Biden "wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America".Obama said Biden "pointed us away from the four years of chaos, falsehood, and division that had characterized Donald Trump's administration"."We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges."Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, in comments from his family compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, said neither party will address what he considers the major issues facing the US.Agencies contributed to this story. With critical days ahead, President Joe Biden is facing the stark reality that more people want him to consider stepping aside from the 2024 election, as former president Donald Trump accepts the Republican nomination at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.The New York Times reported on Thursday that "several people" close to Biden have said he has begun to "accept the idea" that he may have to drop out of the contest.But the White House denied he would drop out, the Times reported.Democratic leaders in the House and Senate — Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer — have told Biden directly that he will not only lose the White House, but also endanger their efforts to win back the House, according to reports in multiple news outlets.Opinion polls show four of the seven most competitive states are looking increasingly out of reach for Biden. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, said it believes it is now competitive in Democratic-leaning states, including Minnesota, New Hampshire and Virginia.Senator Jon Tester, who faces a challenging reelection battle in Montana this year, on Thursday, became the 21st congressional Democrat and the second senator to publicly call on Biden to drop out.Former president Barack Obama has told others that Biden, who was Obama's vice-president, should rethink his candidacy, The Washington Post reported, citing anonymous sources.This came as Trump predicted an "incredible victory" on Thursday in accepting the Republican presidential nomination at the party's national convention on Thursday."We will have an incredible victory," Trump said at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.It was his first speech since a 20-year-old man shot at him, causing a wound to one ear and killing a bystander during a rally last weekend.Promising to complete a wall on the United States-Mexico border, Trump said an "invasion" of immigrants had brought "destruction" and "misery" to a "nation in decline".He vowed to end Biden's massive spending on fighting climate change, calling it a "scam".Meanwhile, US Vice-President Kamala Harris has been courting Asian American voters, speaking at events in Las Vegas and Philadelphia this month in an effort to woo the increasingly important voting bloc.Harris, who is of South Asian and Jamaican descent, is the first female US vice-president and is encouraging Asian American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI, voters to back Biden's reelection bid.Harris' speech before a crowd of AAPI community leaders and organizers at the Pennsylvania Convention Center last Saturday was overshadowed later that day by the attempted assassination of Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.With rumors of Biden dropping out, political pundits are also speculating whether Harris would make a better candidate against Trump.The Democratic National Convention will begin on Aug 19 in Chicago.The Philadelphia event was organized by Asian Pacific Islander American Vote, or APIAVote, an advocacy group focused on mobilizing Asian American voters.The 2024 Asian American Voter Survey, which APIAVote helped conduct along with three other groups, found that 46 percent polled said they would likely vote for Biden, down from 54 percent in 2020, and 31 percent for Trump, up 1 percentage point from 2020, with the rest undecided.The survey of 2,479 voters from the six largest Asian American groups was released on July 10.Christine Chen, co-founder and executive director of APIAVote, said in a news release that "while there's little evidence of a broad political realignment of Asian American voters, recent elections have shown that their political identities are more tenuous than their voting habits imply, and that when candidates make concerted efforts to engage them, Asian American voters are persuadable".The survey also found that 31 percent identify as independent, compared with 25 percent in 2020.Agencies contributed to this story.belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.com  SAN FRANCISCO -- A faulty software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Friday morning has affected computers-running Microsoft Windows at organizations, causing major IT outage, taking out banks, airlines and businesses globally.U.S. federal airspace officials announced a nationwide ground stop of air traffic on Friday due to the outages.

"I had God on my side," he said.The former president called on Democrats to "immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy"."They should drop these partisan witch hunts which I have been going through for approximately eight years," Trump said, alluding to the multiple criminal cases he's mired in.He praised a recent federal judge's decision to dismiss the case against him involving allegations of holding classified documents and obstructing efforts to recover them, which President Joe Biden called a "specious" decision.In early July, the US Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, ruled that Trump has immunity from criminal charges for his 'official' actions conducted as president in the attempts to reverse the 2020 election results, a decision harshly criticized by Democrats.In the speech, Trump lashed out at the Biden administration's policies, highlighting surging inflation, an influx of illegal immigrants and a chaotic international situation."We have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable, ravaging the incomes of working and low-income families and simply crashing our people like never before," Trump said.He pledged to continue building the US-Mexico border wall, accusing illegal immigrants of destroying the country. "I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing a wall," he said.Trump also vowed to end the "electric vehicle mandate" and bring back car manufacturing, threatening to put a tariff of 100 to 200 percent on each imported car.The former president signed a 1.5 trillion tax cut in late 2017 and called for a fresh round of tax cuts while pledging to cut federal debt with "tremendous" economic growth."To all of the forgotten men and women who have been neglected, abandoned and left behind, you will be forgotten no longer," Trump concluded his speech by making a similar appeal from 2016.Thursday marks the final day of the four-day Republican National Convention. On Wednesday night, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, author of the bestselling memoir "Hillbilly Elegy", accepted the party's nomination for vice president and introduced himself to the nation.The Republican National Convention was held as Biden grapples with intensifying pressure from his Democratic Party to drop out of the race. About 20 Democratic lawmakers urged him to step aside.Former US president Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have reportedly expressed concerns privately that they think the president's chances of beating Trump in November are diminishing.According to the latest average of polls from Real Clear Politics, Trump leads President Joe Biden by 3.0 percentage points. In crucial swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, Trump leads by 3.3, 1.7 and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. LAS VEGAS/MILWAUKEE — US President Joe Biden again faced calls to exit the presidential race as he tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, while former president Donald Trump's running mate J.D. Vance formally accepted the Republican vice-presidential nomination.Biden tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling Wednesday in Las Vegas and is experiencing "mild symptoms" including "general malaise" from the infection, the White House said.Biden was scheduled to speak at a conference for the Latino civil rights and advocacy group UnidosUS, but he would no longer be able to attend. Biden previously tested positive in 2022.The diagnosis came as Biden faces mounting pressure from some Democrats to step down from the presidential race due to concerns about his age and mental fitness following his poor debate performance against Trump in late June.Prominent Democratic Representative Adam Schiff on Wednesday joined nearly 20 Congress members of his party to press Biden to withdraw from his reelection bid, as the Democratic National Committee grapples with uncertainties in the nomination process scheduled to be completed by the end of next month.While the "choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone", it is time for Biden "to pass the torch" and "secure his legacy of leadership" by allowing another Democrat to beat Trump, Schiff said in a statement.US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told Biden in a meeting on Saturday it would be better for the country and the Democratic Party if he ended his reelection campaign, ABC News reported on Wednesday.Across the United States, nearly two-thirds of Democrats and 70 percent of citizens said Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to a latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.The AP-NORC poll, conducted from July 11-15, also found that only about 3 in 10 Democrats are extremely or very confident that he has the mental capability to serve effectively as president, down slightly from 40 percent in an AP-NORC poll in February.In response to Schiff's comments, the Biden campaign has pointed to what it called "extensive support" for him and his reelection bid from members of Congress in key swing states, as well as from the Congressional black and Hispanic caucuses.The Democratic National Committee is pushing ahead with plans for a virtual vote to formally make Biden its nominee in the first week of August, before the Democratic convention scheduled for Aug 19-22 completes the nomination process.Meanwhile, Vance urged voters to "choose a new path" as he formally accepted his nomination to be the Republican Party's vice-presidential candidate in an address on Wednesday."I stand here humbled, and I'm overwhelmed with gratitude to say I officially accept your nomination to be vice-president of the United States of America," he told the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Trump, who has just survived an assassination attempt, is set to formally accept his party's nomination with an address later on Thursday.Hundreds of people attended a vigil to remember the former fire chief killed at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania.In the face of security concerns aired after the shooting, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has agreed to testify before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on July 22 for a hearing related to the shooting, the panel said on Wednesday.US prosecutors formally appealed on Wednesday a federal judge's decision to throw out the criminal case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith accusing Trump of illegally holding on to classified documents following the end of his presidency.Smith's office filed a notice indicating it would ask the Atlanta-based 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals to revive the case and reverse Florida-based US District Judge Aileen Cannon's ruling on Monday that Smith had been unlawfully appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland.Agencies/XinhuaMILWAUKEE, the United States - J.D. Vance, a senator from the US state of Ohio and author of the bestselling memoir "Hillbilly Elegy", on Wednesday night accepted the nomination for vice president at the ongoing Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Introducing himself to the nation as Donald Trump's vice-presidential pick, Vance used his speech at the convention to recount his tough upbringing and argue that the Republican Party is most attuned to the difficulties faced by struggling Americans, especially the overlooked working class."To the people of Middletown, Ohio, and all the forgotten communities in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio, and every corner of our nation, I promise you this," Vance said. "I will be a vice president who never forgets where he came from."Vance, 39, had a tumultuous childhood and was raised by his grandparents in impoverished Rust Belt Ohio. He joined the Marines after graduating from high school and later attended Ohio State University and Yale Law School.He was once a fierce critic of Trump but shifted his opinion after meeting Trump in 2021, becoming a close ally and a staunch defender. He was elected to the US Senate in 2022 with Trump's endorsement.Wednesday marks the third day of the Republican National Convention. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Former Director of the US Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott were among a long list of speakers.On Tuesday, Trump's former rivals and critics, including former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and Senator Marco Rubio, took the stage to make speeches, highlighting the party's unity.Trump, who just recently survived an attempted assassination, is expected to accept the Republican nomination for president on Thursday and will make a keynote speech.WASHINGTON - Across the United States, nearly two-thirds of Democrats and 70 percent Americans said US President Joe Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to a latest Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.The AP-NORC poll, conducted from July 11-15, also found that only about three in 10 Democrats are extremely or very confident that he has the mental capability to serve effectively as president, down slightly from 40 percent in an AP-NORC poll in February.Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling Wednesday in Las Vegas, is facing growing calls from his own party to step aside, amid questioning about his age and mental fitness to do the job, after last month's dismal debate performance.Prominent Democratic Representative Adam Schiff on Wednesday joined nearly 20 Congress members of his party to press Biden to withdraw from his reelection bid, as the Democratic National Committee grapples with uncertainties on the nomination process scheduled to complete by end of next month.While the "choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone", it is time for Biden "to pass the torch" and "secure his legacy of leadership" by allowing another Democrat to beat former president Donald Trump, Schiff said in a statement. The representative from California is close to former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, making his call particularly notable.Trump received enough delegate votes on Monday to officially become the Republican Party's nominee in the Nov 5 presidential election.In response to Schiff's comments, the Biden campaign has pointed to what it called "extensive support" for him and his reelection bid from members of Congress in key swing states, as well as from the Congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses.Biden is traveling in Nevada this week, and the campaign noted that he's been joined on the trip by "nearly a dozen" Congressional Black Caucus members, according to an AP report.Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee is pushing ahead with plans for a virtual vote to formally make Biden its nominee in the first week of August, before the Democratic convention scheduled for Aug 19-22 completes the nomination process.While the exact date of the virtual vote remains undecided, a group of House Democrats have cautioned about swiftly nominating Biden as the party's pick for reelection, saying the virtual roll call would be a "terrible idea" to stifle debate about the party's nominee."It could deeply undermine the morale and unity of Democrats," according to a letter from the group obtained by the Associated Press.From yarns and fabrics to finished garments and home products — each stitch connects China's textile industry to the world.This week, more than 500 Chinese companies are displaying their latest innovations and sustainability efforts at a major industry event at the Javits Center in New York City.The 25th China Textile and Apparel Trade Fair, Texworld New York City, Apparel Sourcing New York City, and Home Textiles Sourcing Expo New York City are participating in the three-day exhibition at the sprawling convention center in Manhattan, which started on Tuesday.It primarily focuses on two major themes: "Future Trends" and "Sustainability". More companies are joining the eco-friendly movement; 137 Chinese companies have environmentally friendly certifications, about 29 percent of participants.The semiannual exhibition is jointly organized by the Sub-Council of Textile Industry, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and Messe Frankfurt North America.More than 700 enterprises from 22 countries and regions will converge in an exhibition area of more than 21,500 square feet (20,000 square meters).Long lines formed in the registration area, made up of buyers from the textile and apparel industry, including retail giants Target, Macy's, Walmart, JCPenney, Athleta, American Eagle and Ralph Lauren.Chinese companies also featured those companies' logos at their booths, indicating who buys their products."We have participated in this exhibition for more than a decade. The biggest change we've seen is the gradual upgrading of the Chinese textile industry," said Sheng Wubin, CEO of Ningbo Mondiland Fashions, a maker and distributor of men's suits and coats."We are now producing more advanced products, with faster response times in product development, higher technical requirements and superior quality," Sheng told China Daily.The company has annual revenue of $30 million, with markets in the Americas, Europe and Japan."Ningbo is the hometown of tailors. Our local industry integrated with the development of Ningbo and Shanghai very early," he said. "In the 1920s and 1930s, we introduced many Italian, Japanese and German suit-making technologies and equipment into our garment town, forming a complete system."Sheng said that the company's greatest strength "lies in our understanding of different markets and meeting their stylistic needs with significant changes and improvements"."Ningbo's strong supply chain has also provided us with substantial support," he said. "We hope to see Chinese diplomats wearing suits designed and made in China on the international stage."Zameer Syed, the operational director of SNS Fashion Ltd, noted that speed of delivery and fabric innovation are strengths of the Chinese manufacturers.SNS, which started operations in China in 2002, supplies fabrics to most US apparel branches."All the Chinese supplies are not regular supplies; they have innovations and sustainability," Syed said.Constantin von Vieregge, president and CEO of Messe Frankfurt, said: "There was always the 'stigma' that Chinese exhibitors are lower quality, the cheap fashion. But that has changed completely over the years. So you can see they're getting better and better from a quality perspective."The company has been cooperating with the CCPIT for years, bringing Chinese companies and exhibitors to North America, France, Brazil, and Singapore as well as international exhibitors to Shanghai.The locations are hubs of international sourcing for yarns and fabrics and serve as selling windows for knitting, hosiery, sports and outdoor wear and digital intelligence technology in the industry."It [the partnership with China] is a very, very important one for us because obviously, the Chinese economy is such a strong economy; there are so many great exhibitors," von Vieregge said. "Everybody needs clothes, and we all need affordable clothes."Von Vieregge said "the consumer wins" in a competitive situation.He said that having so many Chinese companies participating in the global textile market is not overcapacity but vibrancy."The demand will regulate the market," he said. "The strongest partner, or the strongest company, will always win.""Now we see there are more and more coming from Chinese exhibitors, the awareness about sustainability and you can see every year it's getting better and better," von Vieregge said.Erin Baker, a fashion student from Kent State University, told China Daily that it's been "really cool to see, just different kind of ways people are trying to implement sustainability into their brands"."They were able to kind of show us insight into how more brands are the more sustainable, what is behind the scenes," she said. "Sustainability is a trend."Gigi Marinho, also a fashion student at Kent State, said she was "wowed" watching a demonstration of the design and manufacturing process of a Chinese textile company.China's textile and apparel exports totaled $115.84 billion from January to May 2024, a 1.4 percent increase over the same period in 2023, according to the General Administration of Customs. In May, export value exceeded $26 billion, a year-on-year increase of 4.5 percent.Exports to the United States rebounded, growing by 9 percent year-on-year, while exports to ASEAN countries saw a jump year-on-year of 21.3 percent.UNITED NATIONS - As instability intensifies in Haiti, displaced women and girls are increasingly vulnerable to sexual violence, according to a report by UN Women released on Wednesday.The report paints a grim picture of the living conditions for approximately 300,000 displaced women and girls in Haiti amid political chaos, rampant gang violence, and the ongoing hurricane season.With over half of the 580,000 displaced persons in Haiti being female, the UN Women Rapid Gender Assessment underscores the peril in makeshift camps lacking essential amenities, making them particularly susceptible to sexual and gender-based violence.The survey, conducted in April across six major displacement sites in Port-au-Prince, revealed a lack of basic security measures like lighting and locks in critical areas, including bedrooms and bathrooms.The presence of gangs and the daily threat of stray bullets amplify the dangers, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced protection measures in these camps.The study also noted that aggression, particularly rape, is often employed as a tactic by gangs to control women's access to humanitarian aid within the camps."Our report tells us that the level of insecurity and brutality, including sexual violence, that women are facing at the hands of gangs in Haiti is unprecedented. It must stop now," UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said.She urged the Haitian government to adopt preventive and responsive measures against the violence and to involve women more in camp management to ensure their safety concerns are addressed.The report further revealed the economic desperation faced by the women in the camps, with nearly 90 percent having no source of income. Over 10 percent have considered or resorted to sex work to meet their basic needs, while 20 percent knew someone who had engaged in such activities. Additionally, about 16 percent of respondents reported feeling intimidated, harassed, or traumatized by armed gangs, and almost 70 percent were mentally affected by the increase in violence.In response, UN Women is aiding women's organizations in Haiti to support displaced communities through various projects funded by international partners, including training police officers to prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence and supporting women entrepreneurs affected by the ongoing violence.This report underlines the critical situation in Haiti and the essential role of international and local actions in safeguarding and empowering the displaced female population amidst the crisis.WASHINGTON - US President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, the White House confirmed."Earlier today following his first event in Las Vegas, President Biden tested positive for COVID-19. He is vaccinated and boosted, and he is experiencing mild symptoms," White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement."He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time," she said."The president presented this afternoon with upper respiratory symptoms, to include rhinorhea (runny nose) and non-productive cough, with general mailaise," according to a note from Biden's doctor provided by Jean-Pierre.Biden was scheduled to speak at a conference for the Latino civil rights and advocacy group UnidosUS, but he would no longer be able to attend."Regrettably, I was just on the phone with President Biden and he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon. The president has been at many events, as we all know, and he just tested positive for Covid," Janet Murguia, president of the group, told attendees after Biden was late to his scheduled appearance.This is not the first time the 81-year-old Biden tests positive for COVID-19. He previously tested positive in 2022.The latest news came as Biden faces mounting pressure from some Democrats to step down from the presidential race due to concerns about his age and mental fitness following his poor debate performance against former US president Donald Trump in late June.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its forecasts for China's economic growth to 5 percent this year and 4.5 percent next year, according to its July 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update released on Tuesday.The report projected global economic growth to remain at 3.2 percent, the same as the April forecast.Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, said at a news briefing that the forecast for China had risen from 4.6 percent for 2024 and 4.1 percent for 2025 compared with the April outlook."And this revision was in part based on stronger consumption numbers in the first quarter of the year, stronger exports also, and that led us to that revision," he said."One of the reasons is that we expect that the new program, which is called trading and equipment upgrade, put in place by the Chinese authority, will help boost consumption and investment and growth at the same time," said Jean-Marc Natal, who is the deputy chief of the World Economic Studies Division in the IMF's Research Department."We have been recommending a shift towards consumption in the last few years, and this is one step in the right direction," he told reporters at the news briefing.The China National Bureau of Statistics released its latest economic figures on Tuesday, including that China's GDP grew by 5 percent year-on-year.Lin Jian, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said: "Judging by this scorecard, the Chinese economy did a pretty good job in the first half of 2024."Despite the rising instability and uncertainty in the global economy, China's economy withstood the pressure and played an important role as an anchor and source of strength," said Lin.The IMF said it still expects the world economy to grow 3.2 percent in 2024, unchanged from its previous forecast in April; It forecast growth of 3.3 percent in 2025, 0.1 percent higher than in April."Global growth remains steady," said Gourinchas, estimating that China and India would account for nearly half of global growth this year. The IMF raised its growth forecast for India to 7 percent this year, mainly based on a better outlook for private consumption, especially in rural areas.Overall, the outlook raised the growth forecast for emerging markets and developing economies in 2024 to 4.3 percent. It also predicted that the euro area's growth is expected to increase to 0.9 percent in 2024 and 1.5 percent next year."Global activity and world trade firmed up at the turn of the year, with trade spurred by strong exports from Asia," said the report.The IMF lowered expectations for the United States and Japan. The report said due to a "slower-than-expected start to the year", US growth in 2024 was downgraded to 2.6 percent; April's forecast was 2.7 percent. Japan's growth is expected to be 0.7 percent this year, 0.2 percent lower than projected.Warning that government balance sheets are weak coming out of the pandemic and then vulnerable to new shocks, Gourinchas, in a blog on the July 2024 WEO, called the US a "concerning" example, and that at full employment, it "maintains a fiscal stance that pushes its debt-to-GDP ratio steadily higher, with risks to both the domestic and global economy".The WEO report also warned that inflation risks have increased, with services prices holding up disinflation, which increases the prospect of interest rates staying elevated longer "in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty"."We see an explosion in the number of trade-restrictive measures," Gourinchas said, noting that the measures include export restrictions and industrial policies, and both may lead to retaliation."One concern we have is that going forward, this will weigh down on global activity," he said.The report also said that a resurgence of tariffs could lead to retaliation and a "costly race to the bottom"."So, let's remember that when we look at the assessment of, for instance, the previous rounds of tariffs that have been imposed by countries, very often the cost assessment finds that it's the country that imposes the tariffs that bear the cost of these tariffs," he said. "And so, it hurts the domestic economy, and it also inflicts spillovers to other countries as well."Arrests for illegally crossing the US-Mexico border dropped by 29 percent in June over the previous month, the lowest count of Joe Biden's presidency, according to figures announced Tuesday by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).The agency credited the decrease to the presidential proclamation announced on June 4 by Biden to temporarily suspend asylum eligibility for those who illegally enter across the border.As a result, the border encounters in June dropped to about 83,500 incidents from 117,900 in May. CBP said the June border encounter number is the lowest since January 2021 as well as lower than the number of encounters in June 2019, the last comparable year prior to the pandemicThe drop came as Biden has been repeatedly criticized for the surge of border crossings in recent years and the public sentiment about immigration is at its lowest in two decades. A June Gallup poll showed 55 percent of Americans want to see a decreased level of immigration, the highest since 2001. Former president Donald Trump has made a major issue in his White House bid.The seven-day average also dropped more than 50 percent to below 1,900 encounters per day from the date of Biden's announcement to the end of the month.The CBP also doubled the rate at which noncitizens were removed from US Border Patrol custody in June. Under the new policy, the Homeland Security Department has removed or returned more than 70,000 individuals to more than 170 countries since June 5. More than 150 international repatriation flights were used as part of the efforts.The total removals and returns over the past fiscal year exceeded removals and returns in any fiscal year since 2010, said CBP. A majority of US-Mexico border encounters during the past three fiscal years resulted in a removal, return or expulsion."Recent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully," said Troy Miller, acting CPB protection commissionerAsylum processing at ports of entry has continued under Biden's proclamation. US border officials have continued to process and admit roughly 1,500 migrants each day at the legal entry points.San Diego was the busiest of the Border Patrol's nine sectors bordering Mexico by number of arrests, followed by Tucson, Arizona.The American Civil Liberties Union and a coalition of immigrant advocacy groups sued the Biden administration last month over his June 4 order, saying it differs little from a similar move during the Trump administration that was blocked by the courts, violates US asylum law and increases the chances of American officials sending migrants back to places where they can be harmed.Wine glasses clinked as enthusiasts in New York savored the rich flavors of various red and white wines from the eastern foothills of Ningxia's Helan Mountain.More than 100 people attended the promotion of the Ningxia Hui autonomous region's specialty industries at the Chinese Consulate General on Monday evening, where they enjoyed wine and a goji berry-tasting.It was the Ningxia delegation's second visit to the United States this year, as the region in Northwest China is trying to widen its market in the US and internationally.The Fourth China International Wine Culture and Tourism Expo will be hosted by the regional government from Aug 9 to 11 in Yinchuan, Ningxia's capital, and welcomes winemakers and visitors from around the world to join and taste the wine, the delegation announced."I've heard that people who are separated by an ocean can be brought together by a glass of wine," David Adelman, managing director and general counsel of asset manager Krane Funds Advisors and a trustee of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, told China Daily."I've been to vineyards in Argentina, South Africa, of course, California. So, I've been lucky enough in my life to taste some nice wine," he said, noting that he is still learning more about wine from China. "I think China will do a magnificent job promoting its wine across the world, including the US," he added.The wine region lies at Helan Mountain and stretches along the Yellow River, forming a corridor seen as a golden zone for the high-quality growth of wine grapes, with more than 2,800 hours of sunshine a year and less than 8 inches of rainfall.It is the largest area for growing wine grapes in China, covering 40,133 hectares (99,170 acres), with 128 wineries producing 140 million bottles of wine. The output value is $5.5 billion, and the wine is exported to 40 countries according to data from the delegation.The region grows grapes for wines such as cabernet sauvignon, merlot, marselan, riesling and others.Ningxia's wines have won more than 1,000 honors internationally, including the Decanter, Concours Mondial de Bruxelles and the Berliner Wein Trophy.The region's venture into winemaking began in the 1980s and has since grown significantly, attracting winemakers and companies from China and the West."Not only does the wine offer an excellent taste, but it also provides the region with massive job opportunities, lifting residents out of poverty," said Bai Yuzhen, the director-general of the Ningxia foreign affairs office."Wine is a great connector, and it's a cultural product in many countries of the world," said Pablo Piñeiro Aramburu, consul general of Argentina in New York. "I think it has a great future."It has improved enormously. It has a lot of potential, and today we have a very good wine," he said, recalling that when he started his career in China years ago, the wine industry in Ningxia had just started."It needed development; wine needs a lot of time to evolve and become a better product," he said. "And now, today, I was impressed.""I didn't know anything about it, so it was very educational to understand that. I knew that [in China], we're producing wine, but not to this extent. It's very informative," said Francesco Rizzo Marullo, chairman of the United Nations World Cultural Arts Organization."I tried the wine, and I liked it. So, as an Italian, I think it's a compliment," he said. "It's a good wine what we tasted tonight. It was really good. It's something I would drink on a day-by-day basis.''He said that when people are dining with others of different nationalities and cultures, wine is a good cultural ambassador that connects people easily."I've been to China twice. And so next time I can add Ningxia to my bucket list," he said.China's envoy to the United Nations said on Tuesday that some countries intend to "create another system outside the existing system of international law", and he called NATO a "troublemaker"."We often hear the talk about a rules-based international order by some countries. But what kind of rules are they talking about? And who are the rulemakers? No one has given us a clear and precise answer," said Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the UN."I would like to emphasize that there is only one order in the world, that is the international order based on international law. There is only one set of rules, and they are the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. There is no room for ambiguity on matters of principle, and the positions must be clearly staked out," Fu said.He delivered the statement at a UN Security Council meeting on multilateral cooperation for a more just, democratic and sustainable world order, convened by Russia, which is presiding over the 15-member body in July.He called on NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to stop being a "troublemaker"."NATO, a regional military bloc left over from the Cold War, has been seeking to expand its sphere of influence," he said, "stirring up confrontation between camps, and even shifting the blame to countries outside the region to frame them on the issue of Ukraine."History has amply proved that wherever NATO's hand extends, turmoil and chaos will ensue. China hereby advises NATO and certain countries to conduct some soul-searching and stop being the troublemakers who jeopardize common security at the expense of others," he said.NATO is attempting to expand its reach to the Asia-Pacific region. Last year, NATO announced plans to open a liaison office in Japan.During last week's NATO summit in Washington, the alliance claimed that China is a "decisive enabler" of the Ukraine crisis.China strongly condemns the "irresponsible and provocative remarks", said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian. He said such a statement is "steeped in Cold War mentality and ideological bias and consists of baseless accusations".Fu also emphasized that common development and security are essential for a fair international order. He stressed the need for reforms in the international financial system and AI governance to help developing countries."Some individual countries have overstretched the concept of national security by building a 'small yard, high fence' and indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions to disrupt the global production and supply chains, which will ultimately lead to a situation of no winners, whether bilaterally or multilaterally. We must resolutely resist such erroneous practices," he said.Fu said China believes that to build a more just and equitable international order, the focus should be on six areas: upholding sovereign equality in a multipolar system; respecting each nation's development path without interference; building common security through dialogue; promoting inclusive economic globalization; upholding fairness and justice by strengthening the UN and developing countries' voices; and fostering openness, dialogue and shared human values.The Security Council meeting was chaired by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said the US "has long declared its own exceptionalism".He said the United States requires "unquestionable obedience" from its allies, "even to the detriment of their national interests".Lavrov said that Rule America, "the essence of the notorious rules-based order", is a "direct threat to multilateralism and international law", adding that the UN Charter and the Security Council's decisions are "perversely interpreted by the collective West".LOS ANGELES -- American billionaire Elon Musk announced Tuesday that he would move the headquarters of SpaceX and X out of California, one day after the state's Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill that bans school rules requiring staff to disclose children's gender identity changes to their parents."This is the final straw," Musk wrote on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter. "Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas."Soon after making the SpaceX announcement, Musk wrote another statement announcing that X would also be moved out of the Golden State, from San Francisco to Austin, Texas."I did make it clear to Governor Newsom about a year ago that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children," Musk complained.The new law makes California the first US state to bar school districts from requiring staff to notify families about a student's gender identity or sexual orientation without the child's permission.UNITED NATIONS -- A Chinese envoy on Tuesday called on countries to uphold sovereign equality and promote a multipolar world in an equal and orderly manner."First, we must uphold sovereign equality. Every country should be able to find its own place and play its role in the multipolar system. We must work jointly to promote a multipolar world in an equal and orderly manner," stated Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, during the UN Security Council open debate on multilateral cooperation in the interest of a more just, democratic, and sustainable world order.Fu emphasized the importance of sovereign equality and international cooperation. He highlighted that building "a just, democratic, and sustainable international order is the joint pursuit of humanity."He praised the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 as a means to "save succeeding generations from the scourge of war" and uphold the spirit of multilateralism.The UN Charter, he noted, is "the cornerstone of the modern international order" and embodies the "noble ideal of working towards a just and equitable international order."Reflecting on historical context, Fu mentioned that the principles of peaceful coexistence, proposed by Chinese leaders 70 years ago, continue to guide international relations. These principles include "mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefits, and peaceful coexistence."Addressing security, Fu called for "common security based on the objective law of indivisibility of security," advocating for the resolution of disputes through dialogue and consultation to build a more balanced, effective, and sustainable security architecture.He underscored the importance of promoting common development by accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and striving to "leave no country and no one behind."Fu highlighted the need to uphold fairness and justice, safeguard the authority of the United Nations and international law, and promote global governance characterized by "extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit," enhancing the representation and voice of developing countries.He also called for embracing openness and inclusiveness, promoting equal dialogue and exchanges among different civilizations, and fostering mutual understanding and friendship among peoples to promote the common values of humanity.Addressing the so-called "rules-based international order" advocated by some countries, Fu questioned the nature and origin of these rules.He emphasized that "there is only one order in the world, that is the international order based on international law," and that "there is only one set of rules," which are based on the UN Charter.Criticizing NATO, Fu accused the alliance of seeking to "expand its sphere of influence," creating "false narratives," and stirring up "confrontation between camps."He asserted, "History has amply proved that wherever NATO's hand extends, turmoil and chaos will ensue."Fu urged NATO and certain countries to "stop being the troublemakers who jeopardize common security at the expense of others."Fu concluded by stressing the interdependence of common development and common security as the foundation of a sound international order.He called for substantive progress in reforming the international financial architecture and governing artificial intelligence to help developing countries catch up.The ambassador urged the international community to resist practices that disrupt global production and supply chains, as these lead to "no winners."Looking ahead, Fu expressed hope for the upcoming Summit of the Future and the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, emphasizing the need to "practice true multilateralism" and build a "just, democratic, and sustainable international order."WASHINGTON -- US Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, who was accused of receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, including cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz, was found guilty on all counts Tuesday in his federal corruption trial.Federal prosecutors in New York alleged the New Jersey senator, formerly the head of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accepted bribes in exchange for helping foreign governments.A jury convicted Menendez of 16 federal charges including bribery, fraud, acting as a foreign agent and obstruction after more than 12 hours of deliberation over three days.Prosecutors said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) discovered gold bars and over 400,000 US dollars in cash hidden in various locations such as jackets and shoes within his residence.Prosecutors alleged that in return for the bribes, Menendez assisted in securing millions of dollars in US aid for Egypt.Two businessmen are facing trial for allegedly seeking the senator's assistance illegally to benefit the Egyptian government and secure millions of dollars from a Qatari investment fund. A third businessman pleaded guilty."This wasn't politics as usual; this was politics for profit," US Attorney Damian Williams, whose office prosecuted the case, said in a statement, citing "shocking levels of corruption."Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the upper chamber, immediately called on Menendez to resign from the Senate after the conviction."In light of this guilty verdict, Sen. Menendez must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate, and our country, and resign," Schumer said in a statement.In September 2023, Menendez willingly decided to step down from his position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after prosecutors revealed the charges against him.Menendez's conviction came as one of the piling up scandals in Congress. In December 2023, the US House of Representatives voted to expel New York Republican George Santos from Congress over the lies, scandals and alleged campaign finance crimes.NEW YORK - Four in five Americans are concerned about increasing political violence following an assassination attempt on former US president Donald Trump, and fear that the United States "is spiraling out of control", a Reuters/Ipsos poll found on Tuesday.Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. The shooting became an alarming headline of news and social media forms, and sent political shocks across the country, with only over three months away from the presidential election.Some 84 percent of voters in the poll said they were concerned that extremists will commit acts of violence after the November election, an increase from the 74 percent of the previous result in May.Around 80 percent of US voters, including Democrats and Republicans, agreed that "the country is spiraling out of the control".Only 5 percent of respondents said it was acceptable for someone in their political party to commit violence to achieve a political goal, down from 12 percent in a Reuters/Ipsos poll from June 2023.According to the poll, Republican presidential candidate Trump leads a margin over Democratic President Joe Biden, with 43 percent to 41 percent.It suggested that the attempt on Trump's life had not sparked a major shift in voter sentiment, Reuters said after the poll.The poll, which was conducted online, surveyed 1,202 US adults nationwide, including 992 registered voters. LIMA -- At least 21 people were killed and nearly 20 others injured in a passenger bus accident in the southern Peruvian region of Ayacucho on Tuesday, local authorities said.The interprovincial bus went off the road in the district of Paras, Cangallo province, Ayacucho region, and fell into a ravine about 200 meters deep, said Jhonny Rolando Valderrama, head of the National Police Road Protection Division, as reported by the state news agency Andina."Unofficially, there would be 21 deceased people," Valderrama said, adding that about 40 passengers were on the bus.The accident occurred around 05:00 am local time, very close to the town of Rumichaca, on the Los Libertadores national highway that crosses the border of the Huancavelica and Ayacucho regions, when the bus was traveling on the Lima-Ayacucho route.The regional health director of Ayacucho, John Tinco, said on RPP Radio that so far 15 injured had been counted, and were taken to the hospital.In May, 17 people were killed in a bus crash in the Ayacucho region, including Edgar Alarcon Tejada, the country's former comptroller general and a former congressman.If you live in Oklahoma or Alabama, you can now pick up baby formula along with a cartridge or two of bullets from your neighborhood grocery store.Instead of selling drinks, candy and chips usually found in vending machines, Texas-based American Rounds is putting machines selling ammunition in grocery stores.Included are various firearm calibers and ammo for rifles, shotguns and handguns, according to American Rounds.A video posted on the company's website, Grand Magers, CEO at American Rounds, said the first such machine was installed last November in Pell City, Alabama.The website showed that six such vending machines have been installed at supermarkets in Alabama and Oklahoma. Two others are planned soon for stores in North Texas and Colorado.A camera in the machine scans the customer's face to verify the buyer is 21 or older and matches the ID. The machine then dispenses the cartridge.Magers says in the video that the company is changing the landscape of ammunition sales to "make it more available" by moving them to grocery and convenience stores. He said the approach is safer because at a traditional sporting goods store, ammunition "sits on the shelf, it's very accessible, and there is a high rate of theft".The innovative technology has sparked fear in gun control advocates, FOX 7, a TV station in Central Texas, reported."In a country where guns are the leading cause of death for children and teens, Texas included, and in a state that has experienced some of the most high-profile mass shootings in recent years, expanding gun access and, in this case, ammunition access is the wrong direction," the report quoted Texas Gun Sense Executive Director Nicole Golden as saying.Joshua Horwitz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, told The New York Times that there were too many unknowns about how the machines could affect public safety to be installing them in stores without input from stakeholders, including legislators, law enforcement and Second Amendment supporters.Nick Suplina, senior vice-president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety, told The Associated Press that ammunition doesn't belong in a grocery store."Innovations that make ammunition sales more secure via facial recognition, age verification and the tracking of serial sales are promising safety measures that belong in gun stores, not in the place where you buy your kids milk," he said. "In a country awash in guns and ammo, where guns are the leading cause of deaths for kids, we don't need to further normalize the sale and promotion of these products."A Houston gun owner self-identified as Nancy B. said she would try the vending machine at least out of curiosity if it were available near her.She said that she normally buys ammunition from either local dealers or online. However, she has some misgivings. Nancy B. said that a customer needs to know what ammunition to buy because the machine shows only pictures.She also had a more serious concern: "What if some bad actors break the machine and rob all the ammo?"Whether selling ammunition in a grocery store is legal has been questioned. A grocery store in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, home to the University of Alabama, recently removed such a machine after the City Council questioned it, according to a local media report."I got some calls about ammunition being sold in grocery stores, the vending machines," Tuscaloosa Councilman Kip Tyner said before a council meeting, according to a local media report. "I thought it was a lie. I thought it was a joke but it's not."The local grocery manager said the removal was due to low sales.Federal law requires a buyer to be at least 18 or 21 years old, depending on the type of ammunition, and American Rounds limits sales to those 21 or older.So far, interest in the vending machines has come mostly from rural communities with small populations, Magers told the AP. For example, one vending machine was installed in Lindsay, Oklahoma, where the population is around 3,000."Someone in that community might have to drive an hour or an hour and a half to get supplied if they want to go hunting, for instance," he told AP. "Our grocery stores, they wanted to be able to offer their customer another category that they felt like would be popular."Agencies contributed to this story.Former US president Donald Trump announced Monday that he has chosen Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio as his running mate.Trump made the announcement on Truth Social as delegates were formally voting to name him the GOP presidential nominee in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the four-day Republican National Convention started on Monday."After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of vice-president of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio," Trump wrote.In the post, Trump pointed to Vance's potential appeal to voters in the Midwest."J.D. has had a very successful business career in Technology and Finance, and now, during the campaign, will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American workers and farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond", Trump wrote in his post.Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania helped propel US President Joe Biden to victory in 2020.Vance, who will turn 40 (Trump is 78, Biden 81) in August, was once a strong critic of Trump. In 2016, he suggested Trump could be "America's Hitler''.But as he began his 2022 Senate run, Vance deleted critical comments about Trump, said he was wrong, and credited Trump for the work he did in office as president. Trump then endorsed him in the Republican US Senate primary in Ohio.Vance has been one of Trump's most vocal supporters, appearing outside the New York City courthouse during Trump's criminal trial this year and on cable TV.Biden posted a fundraising appeal on social media about the Vance selection, saying that the Ohio senator "talks a big game about working people" but wants to raise taxes on the middle class while cutting them for the rich. "Protect democracy. Defeat Trump-Vance," it says.The convention started just two days after Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was struck by a bullet in the ear, and one attendee died after being shot by the gunman, who was killed by Secret Service snipers.There were widespread calls for unity from Republicans and Democrats after the assassination attempt.Two hours after shots were fired during the rally, Vance wrote on X that he believed the Biden campaign's rhetoric directly contributed to the shooting attempt."Today is not just some isolated incident," Vance wrote. "The central premise of the Biden campaign is that president Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to president Trump's attempted assassination."Vance is an investor, venture capitalist and best-selling author of his 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, in which he chronicled growing up in a family beset by drug addiction and poverty.Vance was born in Middleton, Ohio. He served in the US Marine Corps for four years, including a six-month deployment to Iraq, before studying political science and philosophy at Ohio State University and going on to graduate from Yale Law School. He went on to work at a large corporate law firm and then as a principal at an investment firm in San Francisco.Vance and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, have three children. His wife is the daughter of Indian immigrants and grew up in the San Francisco area. They met as students at Yale Law School and got married in 2014, one year after they graduated. She also has a master's degree in philosophy from the University of Cambridge.She was a corporate litigator at a San Francisco law firm and has clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he was an appeals court judge.J.D. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 after defeating former Democratic representative Tim Ryan for an open seat in Ohio.Vance has opposed US aid to Ukraine and opposes abortion, saying the government should find ways to encourage people to have children.Vance changed how he discussed abortion after Ohio and other states voted in favor of abortion access last year. In a December CNN interview, he said Republicans must "accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans". He recently said that he supports access to the abortion drug mifepristone.In the Senate, Vance has pushed both bipartisan and conservative legislation. He introduced a rail safety bill with Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, Ohio's senior senator, after the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Vance also worked with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on legislation to hold executives accountable for failed banks.Vance's other bills reflect conservative views. He introduced legislation to ban gender-affirming care for minors and a bill to eliminate government diversity programs.Before the V-P announcement, Trump learned that a judge had thrown out a federal classified documents case filed against him by special counsel Jack Smith.A federal judge in Florida dismissed the case, siding with defense lawyers who said the special counsel who filed the charges was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.Hours later, Smith's office said it would appeal the order.Agencies contributed to this story.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday that a gunman — one of whose volley of shots hit former US president Donald Trump in the ear — never should have reached his rooftop position."We are speaking of a failure," Mayorkas told CNN. "We are going to analyze through an independent review how that occurred, why it occurred, and make recommendations and findings to make sure it doesn't happen again."Mayorkas said that he still has "full confidence" in Secret Service's leadership.The top of Trump's right ear was torn by a bullet in the shooting at a rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which one of his supporters was killed and two others wounded before Secret Service agents shot dead the 20-year-old suspect, Thomas Crooks.Trump had turned his head slightly clockwise to look at a chart just before the bullet struck, which likely saved his life.At the rally, police had received a report of a suspicious man pacing near magnetometers. Witnesses pointed and shouted at an armed man on a nearby roof.When a Butler Township police officer climbed up to the roof to investigate, the gunman turned and pointed his rifle at him. But the officer did not — or could not — fire a single shot.Investigators are trying to determine how an armed man with no military background managed to reach high ground and get the jump on Secret Service agents.At least a dozen police officers and sheriff's deputies were assisting the Secret Service and Pennsylvania State Police with rally security.The Butler Township officer was hoisted by another officer so he could grab the edge of the roof, local officials said.The officer dropped back down to safety when the gunman turned and pointed his rifle at him, according to Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe.Slupe, who did not witness the encounter, said the officer could not have wielded his own gun under the circumstances."I think all law enforcement on site did everything that they could, especially the local law enforcement," Slupe told The Associated Press on Monday. "I hope they're not made a scapegoat, because they did their job to the best of their abilities."Butler Township Manager Tom Knights said the officer lost his grip and was not retreating when he fell 8 feet to the ground."He was literally dangling from the edge of a building and took the defensive position he needed to at that time. He couldn't hold himself up," Knights said.The officer, who was not identified, severely injured an ankle in the fall, Knights said.A former fire chief, 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, was killed in the shooting. A GoFundMe campaign for the man's family has raised more than $1 million.A law enforcement official told AP on condition of anonymity that investigators believe Crooks purchased 50 rounds of ammunition on the day of the shooting.Authorities said they believe the gunman's AR-style rifle was purchased by his father.Kevin Rojek, FBI special agent in charge in Pittsburgh, said investigators do not yet know if Crooks took the gun without his father's permission.The FBI believes Crooks, who had bomb-making materials in the car he drove to the rally, acted alone.The roof where Crooks lay was less than 150 meters (164 yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. That is a distance at which US Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M-16 rifle.The FBI said on Monday it had gained access to Crooks' phone as it searched for a motive."FBI technical specialists successfully gained access to Thomas Matthew Crooks' phone, and they continue to analyze his electronic devices," the bureau said in a statement. "The search of the subject's residence and vehicle are complete."The AR-style 556 rifle used by the shooter was legally purchased by his father and officials said there was no indication that the suspect suffered from any mental health issues.They added that a preliminary review of Crooks' calls and texts did not shed any light on his motive.In the aftermath of the shooting, President Joe Biden directed the Secret Service to protect independent presidential Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mayorkas said Monday.Kennedy's campaign has been urging the president to provide him with the protection for months and has sent multiple requests.Kennedy's uncle, President John F. Kennedy, and his father, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, were both assassinated less than five years apart in the 1960s.On Monday, Trump urged the government to provide the Secret Service detail to Kennedy, who had repeatedly been denied the protection."Given the history of the Kennedy Family, this is the obvious right thing to do!" Trump wrote on Truth Social."Thank you, President Biden, for extending me Secret Service protection," Kennedy said in a statement.In October, a man was arrested after trespassing twice in one day at Kennedy's Los Angeles home, and a month earlier, an armed man accused of impersonating a federal officer was taken into custody outside a Kennedy campaign event.Kennedy also thanked his private security firm, Gavin de Becker & Associates, "for keeping me safe for the past 15 months of my presidential campaign".Though Kennedy is a long shot to win Electoral College votes, much less the presidency, his campaign events have drawn large crowds people interested in his message.Amid calls for a toning down of political rhetoric in the US, Biden said in an interview Monday that it was "a mistake" to say that he wanted to put Trump back in "a bullseye", but also stood by his depictions that the former president is "a threat to democracy"."How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says?" Biden said to NBC's Lester Holt in an excerpt from the interview."Do you just not say anything because it may incite somebody?" he said."He talks about there'll be a blood bath if he loses," Biden said. Trump has maintained that he was referring to the economy.Just last week, Biden faced intense scrutiny and calls for him to step aside as the Democratic candidate from within his own party. The pressure began following Biden's listless performance in a debate against Trump on June 27.But Biden has dismissed the uproar and has vociferously maintained that he would continue as the candidate. Saturday's shooting has refocused media coverage.Ai Heping in New York and agencies contributed to this story.Krista Chan, a San Francisco Bay Area resident, often contemplated the striking contrast between the region's affluence and the persistence of homelessness. That led her to seek answers in the documentary Voices from the Frontline: China's War on Poverty, now a focal point in a censorship controversy."How can we learn from what they did?" Chan asked. "After watching this documentary, I can tell you it took a lot of innovative business models, anti-corruption efforts, planned relocation, and incredible sacrifice and hard work on the part of the Chinese people."Produced by PBS in 2019, the film, a collaboration between investment banker and China expert Robert Kuhn and Emmy-winning director Peter Getzels, documented China's methods to lift 800 million people out of extreme poverty in the past 40 years.The film crew traversed China, engaging with locals for in-depth discussions and exploring bottom-up poverty-alleviation programs that played a crucial role in eradicating poverty for the final 100 million people impoverished.However, after its initial release, the documentary faced harsh criticism from anti-China politicians, who accused it of portraying China in an overly positive light. Their pressure led to PBS taking down the film after a single showing.PBS didn't respond to a request for comment from China Daily."I have seen this documentary and also traveled to China since I was a young child, witnessing firsthand how China has modernized and uplifted the poorest," said Chan, a volunteer with the "China is not our enemy" campaign of the anti-war group CodePink.She cited the World Bank's 2022 report, which revealed that China contributed "close to three quarters of the global reduction" in extreme poverty over the past 40 years. "That's pretty incredible," she added.One of the key takeaways for Chan from the film was the unwavering political will demonstrated by the Chinese government.From young cadre in small villages to Chinese President Xi Jinping himself, "this has been their priority — to dedicate themselves to serving people through poverty alleviation," she explained. "Maybe that's the little secret PBS doesn't want us to know. They don't want us to know that China is working hard to meet people's needs while Americans grapple with student debt and a soaring cost of living."The censorship of the documentary has sparked growing concern among peace and human rights activists. CodePink has been actively raising awareness of the film, hoping to encourage broader discussion among Americans.The group stressed that the documentary provides not only insights into successful poverty alleviation but also a deeper understanding of China, a country often demonized in the public eye in the US."Censoring the documentary only serves those wanting to escalate divisions between the US and China," warned CodePink on its website. "By censoring Voices from the Frontline: China's War on Poverty, they also deprive the public of the opportunity to learn about poverty-alleviation policies that have changed millions of lives. Right now, amidst an increasingly dangerous climate crisis and high poverty rates, we need understanding and cooperation instead of censorship and fear."The organization encourages the public to contact it for access to the full film. Last month, they delivered a petition with more than 5,800 signatures to PBS national headquarters in Virginia, demanding the release of the documentary. Similar petitions have been delivered to local PBS stations across the country, including in Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Maine and New Hampshire.In San Francisco, peace groups, including CodePink, Pivot to Peace, ANSWER Coalition, and Veterans for Peace, rallied on Saturday in front of KQED, a PBS affiliate, demanding the airing of the documentary."People deserve to see the positive things that are going on in China," said CodePink San Francisco organizer Cynthia Papermaster at the rally. "PBS is supposed to be an educational broadcasting company. So, show the film and have discussion."Richard Becker, West Coast coordinator of the ANSWER Coalition, noted that poverty, once a prominent topic in US presidential campaigns, has been sidelined."Maybe there's a fear of the elite that if they showed something about how this miraculous transformation has happened in China — alleviating poverty for 800 million people — that you might have to start talking about poverty in the United States," he said.Julie Tang, a retired San Francisco Superior Court judge and co-founder of Pivot to Peace, recounted her own experience witnessing China's transformation. When she visited China 20 years ago, she saw people living in shabby houses next to mountains in a dangerous environment. "Today, those things are no more. We see beautiful houses lined up," she said."People are prevented from seeing the truth of what's happening in China. It is a shame because a documentary like this can help ameliorate a lot of the tensions that are going on in the US-China relationship right now," said Tang.WASHINGTON - Former US president Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, received enough delegate votes on Monday to officially become the party's nominee and announced that he has chosen Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate in the Nov 5 presidential election.The former president garnered a majority of votes from delegates at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He reached the required threshold with votes from Florida, which were announced by his son, Eric Trump.Trump is scheduled to formally accept the party's nomination in a prime-time speech on Thursday. He will lead the Republican Party through a third consecutive election, following his victory against Hillary Clinton in 2016 and his defeat to current President Joe Biden in 2020.The four-day convention commenced in downtown Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum two days after Trump barely survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and hours after he secured a significant legal victory when a federal judge dismissed one of his criminal prosecutions.The assassination attempt, which killed one bystander and left Trump with a bloodied ear, immediately shifted the focus of the presidential campaign.US District Judge Aileen Cannon ruled on Monday to dismiss federal charges against Trump for retaining classified documents after leaving the White House, which effectively removed a major legal threat against the former president, who faces other criminal cases that he says should also be thrown out."This dismissal of the lawless indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of all the witch hunts," Trump said on Truth Social on Monday, also referring to the prosecution of hundreds of his supporters who stormed the US Capitol on Jan 6, 2021.Earlier Monday, Trump announced via his social media platform Truth Social that he had chosen Vance as his running mate, ending months of speculation on his vice president pick.Vance, 39, was elected to the US Senate in 2022 and sworn into office in January 2023. He was a fierce Trump critic in 2016 but has since become a prominent supporter of the former president's "Make America Great Again" agenda, particularly on trade, foreign policy and immigration.He first achieved recognition with the 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy", a bestseller which detailed his Appalachian family background and Rust Belt upbringing. The book gave a voice to rural, working-class resentment in left-behind America.Analysts say Vance's selection will boost Trump's support in the Nov 5 election, especially in some Rust Belt states where the election is likely to be decided, but it offers less opportunity to win over more moderate voters and women.Earlier in the day, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the other two finalists, were told they would not be selected.Following the assassination attempt on former United States president Donald Trump during a campaign rally on Saturday, there was much commentary as to whether the US Secret Service had provided adequate security.The Secret Service is facing scrutiny after a 20-year-old man, identified by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was armed with an AR-style rifle, was able to go unnoticed by security as he scaled a building less than 150 meters away.Bomb-making materials were found inside Crooks' vehicle and at his home, officials said.The FBI has taken the lead role in the investigation, the bureau said. On Sunday, the FBI said that the shooter likely acted alone. His motives remain unclear.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose department oversees the Secret Service, said that officials were engaged with President Joe Biden's and Trump's campaigns, and were "taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security".Bill Pickle, a former deputy assistant Secret Service director, told The Wall Street Journal that how the agency communicated with local law enforcement and used technology such as drones will be investigated."The reality is there's just no excuse for the Secret Service to be unable to provide sufficient resources to cover an open rooftop 100 yards away from the site," Pickle said. "And there's no way he should've got those shots off."House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer said in a statement that he has "already contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and is also calling on Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing".The Secret Service said at a news conference on Sunday that it was confident in its existing security plan and hadn't made any changes following the shooting.Both Trump and Biden sought calm and unity on Sunday in the wake of the shooting.Trump arrived in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Sunday evening for the Republican National Convention, which began on Monday.Trump told the Washington Examiner that he had rewritten his speech for the event to focus more on national unity than on Biden's policies. "This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would've been two days ago," he said.Trump is due to receive his party's formal nomination at the convention on Thursday.In the third time that Biden addressed the shooting, the president said from the Oval Office on Sunday night that it was time to "lower the temperature" in US politics."All of us now face a time of testing as the election approaches," he said.Biden, who is running against Trump in a rematch of 2020, said the two men had a "short but good "conversation on Saturday night.Crooks, the shooter, was a registered Republican, but had also given $15 to a progressive group on Biden's Inauguration Day more than three years ago, The New York Times reported.Saturday's shooting has increased calls for independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to receive Secret Service protection.Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story.hengweili@chinadailyusa.com Large swathes of Central Europe continue to brace against floods, the worst in at least two decades, prompting officials to warn that such extreme weather events could become the norm due to climate change.Heavy flooding this week has affected Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, with at least 21 fatalities reported across the countries as of Wednesday.While some areas have seen waters recede, others prepared for river overflows, as the floods moved through different zones, forcing residents and authorities to respond to rapidly changing conditions.Torrential rains brought by Storm Boris on the weekend have destroyed infrastructure, submerged vehicles, and caused billions of euros in damages.Areas along the Czech Republic-Poland border have suffered the worst damage, reported Reuters, as debris-filled rivers destroyed historic towns, bridges, and houses, leaving tens of thousands without power or fresh water.Cities including Wroclaw, Poland's third-largest and situated on the Oder River, and Budapest, the Hungarian capital on the Danube River, were braced for flooding from rising water levels.The European Union's executive branch issued a stark warning on Wednesday, citing the catastrophic floods across Central Europe and lethal wildfires in Portugal as combined evidence of climate collapse, predicting such events will become commonplace without immediate and decisive action."Make no mistake. This tragedy is not an anomaly. This is fast becoming the norm for our shared future," said EU Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic.Storm Boris brought record rainfall in areas including Lower Austria on the weekend, when cold northern air met moisture from the Mediterranean Sea, which had reached unprecedented summer temperatures.Rampant wildfires in northern Portugal during the last week have killed at least seven people. More than 5,000 firefighters have been deployed to combat the blazes that Portugal's Prime Minister Luis Montenegro described as "raging across the country".Researchers say fossil fuel emissions have exacerbated global heatwaves, making them longer, more frequent, and more intense, which in turn raises the likelihood of wildfires."Europe is the fastest-warming continent globally and is particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events like the one we are discussing today. We could not return to a safer past," Lenarcic told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France.Countries are also struggling with escalating financial costs of both emergency repairs and the process of post-disaster recovery, said Lenarcic."The average cost of disasters in the 1980s was 8 billion euros ($8.9 billion) per year. More recently, in 2021 and in 2022, the damage is surpassed 50 billion euros per year, meaning the cost of inaction is far greater than the cost of action," he said.According to Terry Reintke, who leads the Greens group in the European Parliament, the financial burden on the EU resulting from these climate events has been calculated at approximately 650 billion euros since the 1980s."Our success will depend on how determined we are to combat climate change together in order to reduce emissions," Reintke said. BUDAPEST -- Hungary has entered the most challenging phase of dealing with the current wave of flooding, Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced on Wednesday.Orban told a press conference in Budapest that the peak of the flood wave hit Hungary from Tuesday night to dawn on Wednesday. Defense efforts are projected to last for around a week, with the floodwaters expected to leave the southern border to Serbia by next Thursday.The flood wave on the Danube is expected to peak at Budapest on Saturday, between afternoon and evening, at 40-50 cm lower than the 846 cm historic high in 2013, Orban said.He told journalists that this phase of flood defense, involving water management officials, disaster management, the military, and volunteers, would be the most difficult.However, the Prime Minister added that the country's flood defenses have successfully withstood the strain so far. He characterized this year's defense as "preparing for known and anticipated events," emphasizing that previous experience from 2013 has equipped authorities to handle the situation.Around 4,400 workers have been dispatched by the water and disaster management authorities, Orban said. Police and prison services are currently participating in flood defense efforts across 544 km of river in Hungary.The government has invested 435 billion forints ($1.22 billion) in flood protection since 2013, resulting in better infrastructure, Orban underlined.Hungary has not reported any casualties so far but continuous rainfalls in other Central and Eastern European countries over the last few days has claimed lives, triggered evacuations, and caused widespread damage and disruption. BRUSSELS -- US technology firm Qualcomm will have to pay a fine of 238.7 million euros ($265 million) for abusing its dominant position, the European Union's General Court ruled on Wednesday.The European Commission originally imposed a fine of 242 million euros on Qualcomm in July 2019, saying it held a dominant position on the market of chipsets at a worldwide level at least from the start of 2009 till the end of 2011.The Commission said that Qualcomm had abused its dominant position in those years by supplying some of its Universal Mobile Telecommunications System chipsets to Chinese Huawei and ZTE at below-cost prices with an intention of eliminating Icera, its main rival at the time.Qualcomm sought to have the fine annulled or significantly reduced, citing procedural issues, including the excessive length of the investigation. However, the court dismissed all of Qualcomm's arguments except one concerning the fine's calculation, which resulted in a slight reduction.The court pointed out that the Commission substantiated Qualcomm's intention to eliminate Icera from the market "by providing both direct and indirect evidence." MOSCOW -- Two people have been killed and seven have been injured in a shooting near the office of Russia's online retailer Wildberries, local media reported Wednesday citing the Russian Investigative Committee.The BRICS Media Summit has started in Moscow. The event gathered leading experts from over 60 media outlets from 45 countries. The main theme of the meeting is "The Role of Media in a Multipolar World".The Media Summit is attended by high-ranking officials and media representatives not only from the BRICS countries but also from nations interested in expanding cooperation with the union. The guests were welcomed by the photo exhibition "BRICS Family," which showcases the works of photojournalists from Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Ethiopia, South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.At the opening ceremony, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov greeted the participants of the summit in the format of a video message. He noted the role of the media in interstate communication development, strengthening the atmosphere of friendship, trust, and mutual understanding between peoples."I hope that the summit will become a platform for establishing business contacts and sharing experience and will contribute to the emergence of a constructive news and information agenda based on truth and verified facts," Lavrov said.Fu Hua, executive chairman of the BRICS Media Forum and President of China's Xinhua News Agency, also addressed the event. He emphasised that the media have a special mission, being active participants in the construction of the BRICS cooperation mechanism."We (the media. - Ed.) will continue working to make our voice heard, to bring progress, and to establish a multipolar world. We want the BRICS story to be globally recognised and the influence of the union to grow," Fu Hua said.The meeting includes a plenary session on "The role of the BRICS media community in bolstering stability in a multipolar world".Speakers will include representatives of TV BRICS media partners, including Jose Juan Sanchez, CMA Group President, Yu Zijun, Secretary General of the Chinese newspaper People's Daily, Yohannes Wondirad, Director of Public Relations and Strategic Partnerships of the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA), and Luis Enrique Gonzalez Acosta, President of Prensa Latina News Agency.In an exclusive commentary for TV BRICS, Yohannes Wondirad said the ongoing summit in Moscow will help the media to build partnerships, exchange ideas, and deepen cooperation."The main purpose of the BRICS Media Summit is to share experience. We can, for instance, learn something new from TV BRICS. Ethiopian news agencies in Africa will, in turn, pass on their experience to this international media network and other Russian media or media from the group's countries. So this is a good opportunity," he explained.Furthermore, during the panel discussion, the Chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Leonid Slutsky, noted the efficient work of TV BRICS."In 2017 in China at the IX BRICS summit on the proposal of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the TV BRICS International Media Network was created. Today, this network has united more than 70 media outlets from around the world; it has 1.5 billion users and content in five languages: Russian, English, Chinese, Portuguese, and Spanish. I am confident that the BRICS information space will expand in the near future," he said.On Sunday, experts will discuss the technological transformation of BRICS media at a plenary session. Mohammad Sarfi, editor-in-chief of Tehran Times, will participate in the roundtable.The BRICS Media Summit takes place from Sept 13 to 17 in the year of Russia's chairmanship in the group. The event was established in 2015 as a non-governmental platform for dialogue between the leading media outlets of the group's countries.This is the seventh time the meeting has been held, but now it is in a summit format.TV BRICSEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Tuesday her new team of commissioners during her second five-year term, just a day after Thierry Breton, France's European commissioner for internal market, abruptly resigned by accusing his boss of "questionable governance".The new team includes six executive vice-presidents, four women and two men. The previous third layer of vice-presidents has been dropped.Stephane Sejourne, the 39-year-old outgoing French foreign minister, whom French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Monday as the new candidate to replace Breton, will be the executive vice-president for prosperity and industrial strategy.The other executive vice-presidents are: Teresa Ribera of Spain for the clean, just and competitive transition; Henna Virkkunen of Finland for tech sovereignty, security and democracy; Roxana Minzatu of Romania for people, skills and preparedness, and Raffaele Fitto of Italy for cohesion and reforms, while Kaja Kallas of Estonia was named the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy.The new commission is not gender-balanced as von der Leyen had wished. Of the 26 nominees, only 11, or 40 percent, are women. But von der Leyen argued that when she received the first set of nominations, only 22 percent were women."That was unacceptable. So I worked with the member states and we were able to improve the balance to 40 percent women and 60 percent men. And it shows that, as much as we have achieved, there is still so much more work to do," she told a news conference on Tuesday in Strasbourg during the European Parliament plenary session.She also announced on Monday night on social media platform X that executive vice-president Margrethe Vestager of Denmark will take over Breton's portfolio during the remaining period of the mandate.Anger voicedIn an open letter on X on Monday morning, Breton said he was standing down from his role effectively immediately, expressing his anger that von der Leyen has tried to stop him from reappointment in the next European Commission.Breton, 69, is widely regarded as an influential commissioner with his portfolio covering digital market regulations, critical raw materials, COVID-19 vaccines and boosting the EU's defense and space industries since 2019. Many had thought he would be promoted to be a commission vice-president for the next five years."In the very final stretch of negotiations on the composition of the future College (of Commissioners), you asked France to withdraw my name," Breton wrote in a scathing letter to von der Leyen, also posted on X.Breton said von der Leyen had "offered, as a political trade-off, an allegedly more influential portfolio for France in the future College"."In light of the latest developments — further testimony to questionable governance — I have to conclude that I can no longer exercise my duties in the College," he wrote.At the Monday daily news briefings, European Commission deputy chief spokeswoman Arianna Podesta was bombarded with some 40 minutes of questions on the subject, but she would not comment on Breton's accusations.Breton angered von der Leyen in March by publicly questioning the support for her in the June reelection from her center-right European People's Party.He was also one of the four commissioners who challenged von der Leyen's "transparency and impartiality" in April over the appointment of Markus Pieper, a political ally, to a well-paid job as European Union's envoy for small and medium-sized enterprises.The other three — foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and commissioners Nicolas Schmit from Luxembourg and Paolo Gentiloni from Italy, are also not in von der Leyen's team in the second term.Breton triggered a storm in August when he warned X owner Elon Musk of possible harmful content ahead of his interview with former US president Donald Trump on X. But von der Leyen's commission distanced itself from Breton's message, which was criticized as an assault on freedom of expression."It's a good day for free speech," Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, posted a comment on Monday on Breton's open letter on X.Germany has reintroduced border checks scrapped decades ago as part of its membership of the European Union, in a move aimed at reducing cross-border crime and the flow of immigrants into the country.The checks — reintroduced in the west and north of the country on Monday along borders with Belgium, France, Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands — increased tension between Germany and its neighbors and seemed to signal the end of the EU ideal of borderless, visa-free travel.The country reintroduced similar checks last year, along its borders with Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Switzerland.Berlin said it had no choice, after successive years in which irregular arrivals from the Middle East and Africa have placed a strain on its infrastructure and the influx has led to the rise of the far right.The border checks will be carried out during the coming six months while the government decides whether to make them permanent. It means all of Germany's land crossings are now subject to controls.Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the reintroduction of checks in some areas last year ensured more than 30,000 unauthorized entries were blocked."That is why we will expand our temporary border control to include all of Germany's land borders," Faeser said. "My order is also intended to protect against the acute threat of Islamist extremist terrorism and serious cross-border crime."The checks will be carried out by police officers on a random basis, with most people still likely to flow through freely. Officers will target their checks based on information and the security situation, she said.The Interior Ministry said travelers, even those from EU countries, should have valid identification and people from outside the EU will also need valid entry documents.With a federal election due next year and the far right polling well, Svenja Niederfranke, an immigration expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations, told Euronews: "The German government wants to show that they are doing something… this is very important political signaling … that we take back control of our borders."Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk criticized the move, saying more immigrants will settle in neighboring countries as a result. And Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer said it means his country will likely now also have to reintroduce checks, sending the EU's border-free ideal into tatters.And as a potential row between Germany and the EU over the issue brews, the cost of the new checks has also been questioned, with one police union saying an additional 5,000 officers will be needed.ATHENS -- A fire broke out on Tuesday at the Motor Oil refineries complex near the city of Corinth, about 70 kilometers west of Athens, local authorities said.No injuries have been reported, according to the local fire brigade.Greece's civil protection officials have advised residents in the area to evacuate as a precaution, following an explosion at the facilities, as firefighting forces have been deployed.A plume of thick black smoke has covered the area, and roads near the complex have been closed.Motor Oil (Hellas) Corinth Refineries S.A. is a petroleum industry group based in Greece. It is a leading supplier and trader of fuels in southeastern Europe, and manages a network of fuelling stations in Greece, Cyprus, and the Western Balkans, according to Greek national news agency AMNA.PARIS -- A fire broke out in the 13th arrondissement of Paris on Tuesday afternoon, leaving two people injured, according to local media reports.The blaze started around 5 pm local time (1500 GMT) on a rooftop under renovation, as reported by the French news channel BFMTV.Two gas bottles exploded as a result of the fire, further intensifying the situation. Fortunately, workers on site and nearby residents were evacuated promptly before the explosions occurred.Emergency services quickly responded to the scene, with firefighters battling the flames. A firefighter and a worker were injured during the response, though no further details about their condition have been provided at this time.As a precaution, an elementary school located nearby was also evacuated, according to Jerome Coumet, the mayor of Paris's 13th arrondissement, who spoke to BFMTV. The fire was brought under control around 7 pm local time (1700 GMT), Coumet confirmed.The police have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the fire.As part of the Mid-Autumn Festival hosted by the London Chinatown Chinese Association on Sunday, China's mesmerizing face-changing performance drew the attention of many local residents and visitors alike.Video by Han Jing.China won 36 gold, nine silver, and four bronze medals at the 47th WorldSkills Competition in Lyon, France.

"They cannot cut with scissors. They cannot climb a tree. They cannot walk backward because they are sitting with their cell phones."A lack of physical activity linked to excessive screen time was even resulting in youngsters developing physical ailments more usually associated with the elderly, he added, and disrupted sleep patterns linked to mobile phone use are contributing to increased anxiety and depression, especially among girls.Currently, there are voluntary restrictions on access to personal digital devices in school in the country, but this could now be made the law, and, if so, it would follow a growing trend across Europe for limiting young people's screen time.Earlier this month, France became the latest country to introduce a trial ban on phones, which must be handed over at the start of the school day, in an effort to give youngsters what has been called "a digital pause".A report by a commission set up by President Emmanuel Macron made similar observations about the damage done by phones to those noted in Sweden, including "a very clear consensus on the direct and indirect negative effects of digital devices on sleep, on being sedentary, a lack of physical activity, and the risk of being overweight and even obese … as well as on sight".Servane Mouton, a neurologist who served on the commission, said it was not just down to young people, however, adding "we have to teach parents once again how to play with their children".Italy banned phones for all school-age groups in 2007, before reversing the decision in 2017, only to impose it again in 2022.Portugal has designated phone-free school days. And there are regional bans in Spain and limitations and guidelines aimed at curbing use of phones in Germany and the United Kingdom."For far too long, we have allowed screens and apps to steal time and attention at the cost of what we know is needed to feel well," added Forssmed. "Children's health is paying the price for tech companies' profits."Dominique Pelicot, the 71-year-old French man accused of drugging his then-wife and inviting dozens of men to rape her over a period of nearly a decade, confessed in court on Tuesday to his guilt for the various criminal charges he faces.The white-haired grandfather appeared in the dock at the Vaucluse Criminal Court in Avignon, where he is on trial alongside 50 other men, all accused of the "aggravated rape" of his former wife, Gisele Pelicot, who is 72.Dominique Pelicot also faces charges in the mass trial that began on Sept 2 and that is due to run until mid-December relating to various privacy breaches because of his alleged recording and disseminating of sexual images.According to prosecutors, Pelicot, who was first arrested in 2020 after trying to film up a woman's skirt in a supermarket, offered sex with his wife online and filmed the subsequent abuse.He is said to have sedated his wife by putting crushed sleeping tablets and Temesta – a powerful anti-anxiety drug – into her meals and drinks, reported news agencies."I admit to the charges in their entirety," Pelicot, told the court, adding: "I am a rapist just like all the others in this room."He said his co-defendants "all knew" he was inviting them to rape her and added "she did not deserve this"."I ask my wife, my children, my grandchildren to accept my apologies," he said. "I regret what I did. I ask for your forgiveness, even if it is not forgivable."Pelicot's testimony in the case, which has stunned France, was originally scheduled for last week but was postponed due to health concerns.Gisele Pelicot, who was present during his testimony, was given permission to react immediately to her ex-husband's confession.She said: "It is difficult to hear from the mouth of Mr Pelicot what he has just said. For 50 years, I lived with a man who I would never have imagined for a single second that he could do these acts. I had complete confidence in this man."Fourteen other defendants have admitted rape, while the rest deny any wrongdoing. If found guilty, they face up to 20 years in jail.Gisele Pelicot insisted on a public trial to expose the accused and shed light on sexual violence, her lawyers said. She has become a symbol of the struggle against sexual violence in France, said Reuters news agency, with hundreds of supporters, mostly women, demonstrating across the country.In a separate case, Dominique Pelicot faces additional charges for the alleged 1991 rape and murder of Sophie Narme, a 23-year-old estate agent in Paris. In a similar attack, a 19-year-old estate agent escaped after resisting. Police have said that DNA from blood at the scene matches Pelicot's profile. Greece is urging its citizens to have more babies, in the hope that a growing population will get its economy moving again.The Mediterranean nation of 10.5 million people has had economic woes since 2008, when the global economic crash hit it especially hard because of its high debt load.Now, the government has unveiled a package of incentives — including vouchers, childcare support, and tax breaks — aimed at persuading people to procreate."It is a given that the demographic problem ... cannot simply be solved by benefits and cash incentives," Deputy Finance Minister Thanos Petralias said during a news conference last week, while also promising improvements to the country's education system and its healthcare provisions. In addition, Petralias said Greece will try to bolster people's incomes and help parents find a better work-life balance.Greece has one of Europe's lowest fertility rates — with around 1.3 babies born for every woman — which is something experts attribute to the economic crisis and to the emigration of many young people to countries with stronger economies.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has described the falling birth rate as a "ticking time bomb" that could have a devastating impact on the country's pension system, as fewer workers, and especially a workforce hit by an exodus of high-earning skilled workers, falls short of being able to support the country's retired citizens.The new batch of incentives aimed at boosting the birth rate came on top of the around 1 billion euros a year ($1.11 billion) the government is already spending on supporting families.Despite all the efforts, in 2022 Greece recorded its smallest number of births since records began nearly a century ago.The Reuters news agency said Greece, which is the European Union's second-poorest nation, is planning to unveil an additional set of measures later this year aimed at increasing its birthrate. They are expected to include additional affordable housing for young families, financial incentives for new parents, and ways to incorporate migrants into the country's workforce. There is also likely to be financial support for people needing in-vitro fertilization and egg donation services.Although Greece's economy did finally grow a little last year, expanding by a welcome 2 percent, it is still much smaller than it was in 2007, prompting experts to ask whether the country can afford such incentives in the longer term.While Greece has a particularly big problem, low birth rates have become an issue all over Europe, with France, Italy, Norway, and Spain all having recently unveiled incentives to try to reverse the trend. Among these, Hungary said recently it will offer loans of 30,000 euros to people thinking of starting or growing a family. United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer says he is "interested" in finding out more about Italy's migration control plans, including one for the temporary holding of migrants in Albania, ahead of a visit to Rome to meet his Italian counterpart, Giorgia Meloni.Because of its proximity to North Africa, the route used by many migrants to enter the European Union, Italy receives more migrants than any other EU member state, but according to figures from Frontex, the EU's border force, this year, there has been a 64 percent drop in attempted entries.The UK's departure from the EU has led to a surge in people trying to make the dangerous crossing of the English Channel from France, because there is currently no legislative facility to return them, frequently resulting in tragedy.The previous Conservative Party government devoted much effort and money to a plan to send would-be migrants to Rwanda, which yielded no results whatsoever.When the Labour Party won the general election in July, one of its first acts was to abandon this, but so far it has not come up with an alternative."I've long believed that prevention and stopping people traveling in the first place is one of the best ways to deal with this particular issue," said Starmer.Italy has taken steps to deal with the challenge of migration both as part of a wider EU approach and independently.The EU has paid significant money to Tunisia to improve border security and coastguard facilities, and Italy has supplied patrol vessels and also made arrangements with nearby Libya.But there has been concern about this because of fears over human rights abuses in some of the countries the EU has been dealing with."It seems that we are bankrolling dictators across the region," said Mounir Satouri, a French member of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee. "That is not the Europe that we want to see. That is not the place which the EU should be holding in the world".In November 2023, Meloni signed a deal with the government of Albania for it to build two migration centers, funded and managed by Italy, in Albania, where up to 36,000 people could be held while their asylum claims are assessed.Although the Albanian authorities have said they only have such a deal with Italy, it has clearly caught the eye of the UK government.In a BBC interview on Sunday, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the two prime ministers would discuss Italy's approach to migration, "particularly with Albania".When quizzed on the topic by Sky News, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper also hinted that it was something of interest.The arrangement, she said, is "effectively around having a fast track for those who have arrived from predominantly safe countries and is also a scheme that is monitored by the UNHCR (the United Nations' refugee agency) as well to make sure that proper standards are in place and we will see how it develops." Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed the possibility of delivering long-range precision weapons to Ukraine, even if NATO allies decide differently.Scholz reaffirmed his opposition to supplying Taurus cruise missiles with comments made in response to questions at a public forum in the town of Prenzlau, in Germany's eastern state of Brandenburg, on the weekend.He stated that such an action would involve "a great risk of escalation" in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.The 500-kilometer range of Taurus cruise missiles would extend Ukraine's potential attack radius to include Moscow, reported the DPA news agency."I said no to that," Scholz said. "And of course that also applies to other weapons, if we had supplied them, which could reach this long distance."Scholz said his decision "remains the case … even if other countries decide differently".Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been calling for long-range weaponry to enable Ukrainian military forces to strike Russian supply lines and air bases situated beyond the immediate combat zone.DPA noted that while Germany's longest-range weapon supplied to Ukraine has a range of 84 kilometers, some NATO allies have supplied missiles that are able to reach up to 300 km, sparking debate about potentially authorizing strikes on Russian soil.Scholz's remarks follow recent comments from United States President Joe Biden on potentially lifting restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range Western weapons to strike targets within Russian territory.United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with Biden at the White House last week, and despite holding talks on weapons for Ukraine, the leaders gave no clear indication of their intentions.During his address in Prenzlau on Saturday, Scholz also emphasized Berlin's commitment to bringing those responsible for the 2022 Nord Stream gas pipelines attack to justice."That was a terroristic act," Scholz declared, noting that his administration had instructed security agencies and prosecutors to pursue the investigation. "We want to bring those who did this, if we can get a hold of them, to court in Germany."He added that there would be "no leniency" with the case.On Monday, Russian officials said Scholz was correct to seek a comprehensive inquiry into the explosions that ruptured the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines that were built to carry Russian gas to Europe under the Baltic Sea, reported Reuters.The Kremlin suggested that certain Western nations were attempting to suppress the true circumstances of the incident.No one has ever claimed responsibility for the explosions, which took place seven months after the outbreak of conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Scholz noted that prior to the blasts, Russia had already ceased pumping gas through the pipelines. He added that replacing Russian gas supplies with alternative supplies had brought Germany costs exceeding 100 billion euros ($111 billion). Storm Boris has wreaked havoc across Central and Eastern Europe, causing record rainfall and flash floods that have claimed at least five lives in Poland and Romania, forced hundreds of people to evacuate, and left many stranded as of Sunday.A slow-moving low-pressure system that arrived on Friday and is expected to linger for days has unleashed a month's worth of rain in just 24 hours across Poland, Romania, Austria, the Czech Republic and Hungary, news agencies reported.Rising floodwaters have overwhelmed emergency services in the Czech Republic, Poland and Austria, while Romania faced tragedy with four flood-related fatalities on Saturday, amid unprecedented downpours.Rescue services in Romania battled severe flooding in eastern counties, particularly Galati and Vaslui, where the four deaths were reported.Romania's President Klaus Iohannis addressed the flood crisis on social media."Severe floods that have affected a large part of the country have led to loss of lives and significant damage," he said."We are again dealing with the effects of climate change, which are increasingly present throughout the European continent, with dramatic consequences on people. We must continue to strengthen our capacity to anticipate extreme weather phenomena," he added.In the Czech Republic, river waters swelled to alarming levels in many areas, with authorities evacuating hundreds, including hospital patients in the southeastern city of Brno.More than 70 areas received the highest flood warnings, with officials from the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute stating such "extreme floods" occur only once a century in these regions.In Austria, 24 villages in the northeast province of Lower Austria were declared "disaster zones" and evacuated. A firefighter battling flooding in Lower Austria was killed, Austrian Vice-Chancellor Werner Kogler said on social media."We are experiencing difficult and dramatic hours in Lower Austria," stated the governor of the province, Johanna Mikl-Leitner."For many people in Lower Austria, these will be the hardest hours of their lives," she added.In Poland's second-largest city, Krakow, which lies on the Vistula River that has reached extreme low water levels in recent months due to record-breaking heat waves, severe flooding forced resident evacuations and disrupted public transportation.In southwestern Poland's Klodzko district, one person drowned and 1,600 residents were evacuated.After meeting with a crisis management team in Klodzko town on Sunday, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk emphasized the gravity of the situation."The situation is very dramatic, it's most dramatic in Klodzko county," Tusk said.In Slovakia and Hungary, heavy rain is making flooding worse along the Danube River, keeping rescue workers busy.Slovakia declared a state of emergency in its capital, Bratislava, due to severe flooding. In Germany, rising water levels have affected southern and eastern regions, with authorities issuing flood warnings for rivers in Saxony.The floods in Central and Eastern Europe follow an unusually hot early September in the region and Earth's hottest summer on record. Climate change is intensifying rainfall patterns, reported Euronews. French officials say at least eight people died on Saturday night when a boat sank off the coast of the Pas-de-Calais region in the north of France, attempting to cross the English Channel to the United Kingdom.The incident comes less than two weeks after another boat of migrants attempting the trip sank, claiming at least 12 lives in the deadliest incident in the seaway so far this year.The boat in the latest incident had around 60 people on board, from countries including Eritrea, Iran, Sudan and Syria. Coast guard officials said it was reported to be in difficulty near the French coastal town of Ambleteuse, in a position where they could not offer assistance from the sea.It came apart after being driven onto rocks, and emergency services tended to 53 people and confirmed eight deaths.Since leaving the European Union, the UK has no arrangement to return migrants to France, from where so many of them make their crossing, as it is the closest point between the UK and mainland Europe.Since this year, it is estimated that more than 21,000 people have tried to cross in small, often dangerously overcrowded and unseaworthy boats, and there have been more than 30 deaths.In the 24 hours from Friday to Saturday night, French coast guards recovered 200 people off the coast of Calais, with the highest number in a single incident being 61. On Saturday alone, 18 attempted boat launches were observed.British Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC that he had seen the "awful sort of rubber dinghies that people are coming across the Channel with, many of them, of course, not able to make it in these contraptions".The government has said the focus of its efforts to get to grips with the issue will be to target the people-smuggling gangs who run the boats. Lammy added that it had been "discussing how we go after those gangs, in cooperation upstream with other European partners".On Monday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to be in Italy, the country that has the most migrant arrivals in the EU. Lammy said Italy's handling of the crisis, which includes an agreement with Albania for the temporarily housing of asylum claimants, would be on the agenda when Starmer met Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.But a Home Office source later said that Britain exploring a similar setup involving another country "is not something we are working on", to avoid any confusion over government policy.Enver Solomon, CEO of London-based charity Refugee Council, said it was a mistake to think that rule enforcement was the only solution to the ongoing crisis that has led to so many deaths."People are being forced into the arms of smugglers because they are desperate, fleeing violence and persecution in countries like Afghanistan, Syria and Sudan in search of safety," he told The Guardian newspaper."Smugglers will respond to tougher policing by making these refugees take bigger risks, with more perilous crossing points and more crowded boats." PARIS -- Eight migrants died while attempting to cross the English Channel from France between Saturday night and Sunday morning, France's Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea said on Sunday.Besides the 8 deaths, six other people were found in relative critical conditions, the French news channel BFMTV reported, citing Jacques Billant, prefect of France's northern department of Pas-de-Calais.According to Billant, a boat carrying 59 migrants was seen shortly before midnight near the town of Ambleteuse, Pas-de-Calais.France's Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea said on Saturday that they had rescued some 200 people who were tempted to cross the English Channel Friday night.On Sept 3, at least 12 people died while attempting to cross the English Channel from France.The region around Calais in northern France is the starting point for the shortest sea crossing to the United Kingdom (UK).According to British government figures, between Sept 7 and 13 this year, a total of 412 irregular migrants attempted to cross the English Channel in small boats without permission to enter the UK.During a visit to France last month by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the two countries affirmed their desire to boost cooperation on illegal migration in the Channel, particularly in relation to human trafficking rings.MOSCOW - Russia's patience regarding a nuclear response to Western actions in Ukraine is wearing thin, warned Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's security council, in a message posted on his Telegram channel on Saturday.Medvedev said while "a nuclear conflict is in no one's interest," Russia has thus far exercised restraint in utilizing its nuclear capabilities in response to Western involvement, particularly concerning high-precision strikes deep into Russian territory. However, he cautioned that "even the greatest patience has its limits."This warning came following recent US discussions regarding the provision of Army Tactical Missile Systems to Ukraine, which could enable strikes deeper into Russian territory.The Kremlin has also signaled its awareness of the escalating threat, with the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov noting that Russia is preparing countermeasures.This week in Lyon, France, China has 68 competitors in the World Skills Competition, the world’s largest vocational skills competition, which this year has brought together 1,400 participants from 69 countries and regions.Reporter: Wang MingjieVideo: Brian ChangMOSCOW -- Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Thursday that by providing Ukraine with long-range weapons, Western countries risk involving directly in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.In such circumstances, Russia would be forced to make "appropriate decisions" based on the new threats, Putin was quoted by Russian media as saying.Ukraine has been pleading with its Western allies for it to use their missiles, including long-range ones, to fire deep into Russian territory, according to Western media reports."In fact, only service people from NATO countries can make flight assignments to these missile systems. Ukrainian service people cannot do that," Putin told Russian state TV."So this is not a question of allowing the Ukrainian regime to attack Russia with these weapons or not. It is a question of deciding whether NATO countries are directly involved in a military conflict or not.""If this decision is taken, it will mean nothing else than direct participation of NATO countries -- the USA and European countries -- in the war in Ukraine," he said.According to a report by Politico, the White House is finalizing a plan to ease restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S.-donated weapons in battles against Russia, including the use of British long-range missiles that contain American parts to strike targets inside Russia.MOSCOW -- The Federal Security Service of Russia (FSB) has revoked the accreditation of six employees of the British Embassy in Russia, citing their involvement in intelligence and subversive activities, local media reported on Friday.The FSB said that it had obtained documents confirming that London was coordinating efforts to escalate the international military and political situation, according to a report by RIA Novosti.The FSB named the Directorate for Eastern Europe and Central Asia of Britain's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office as the primary entity orchestrating subversive activities against Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).The directorate, established to focus on Russia and CIS affairs, has effectively functioned as a special intelligence service since the beginning of the special military operation in Ukraine, said the FSB."The facts revealed provide grounds to consider the activities of British diplomats sent to Moscow by the directorate as a threat to the security of the Russian Federation," it said, noting that the directorate's main objective has been to strategically undermine Russia.In cooperation with other relevant agencies, the Russian foreign ministry has terminated the accreditation of six employees from the political section of the British Embassy in Moscow, said the report.The FSB also warned that it would demand the immediate termination of the mission of any British diplomatic staff found to be involved in similar activities in the future.ST. PETERSBURG - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday voiced willingness to work together with China to advance multipolarity and build an international order based on justice and international law.Putin made the remarks during talks with Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, in St. Petersburg.Putin asked Wang to convey his sincere greetings and best wishes to Chinese President Xi Jinping, expecting China's attendance at the BRICS leaders' summit in Kazan next month.Russia and China, acting on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, have been deepening their comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era. Interactions at all levels maintain a strong momentum, and cooperation in various fields is progressing smoothly, he said.Russia is willing to take the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries this year as an opportunity to follow through on the important consensus reached by the heads of state, strengthen the alignment of development strategies, and lift the Russia-China relationship to a new level, said Putin.Putin thanks China for its support for Russia as the rotating chair of BRICS, stressing that the BRICS security council meeting has achieved positive results, and the successful dialogue with the Global South countries fully demonstrates the influence and strength of BRICS.The Russian president applauded China's diplomacy based on the long-term and the common future of humanity, and voiced willingness to strengthen coordination with China to unite more Global South countries and jointly push for a multipolar world so as to build an international order based on justice and international law.For his part, Wang conveyed Xi's warm greetings to Putin.China and Russia have solid mutual trust and a profound friendship, he said, adding that under the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries, the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era has achieved sound and steady growth.The two sides have strengthened strategic cooperation, rejected unilateral bullying, and resist bloc confrontation, which is in line with the trend of the times and the common aspirations of the vast number of the countries of the South, said Wang, adding that China is willing to maintain strategic communication with Russia, unite more like-minded countries, and promote world multipolarity.He said that with the joint efforts of all parties, the BRICS Plus cooperation has got off to a good start.At the upcoming Kazan Summit, the first meeting of leaders after the expansion of BRICS, China will continue to offer full support for Russia in fulfilling its responsibilities as the chair, and strive to make the summit a full success.China is ready to work with BRICS partners to push for an equal and orderly multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization so as to make contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind, he added.The two sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine issue.Putin appreciated the "six-point consensus" made by China and Brazil, reiterating Russia's openness to negotiations.Wang said that China is committed to promoting a political solution to the crisis and is willing to work with all parties to foster an objective, rational, and balanced voice in the international community.Before their meeting, Putin met with the heads of delegations attending the meeting of the BRICS high-ranking officials responsible for security matters and national security advisors.Norway will not impose sanctions on Chinese electric vehicles, and is eyeing further cooperation with China in areas of common interest such as shipping, seafood and green transition, said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store on Wednesday in Shanghai.Store made the remarks as he concluded a three-day official visit to China in connection with the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries."Norway has no car production. We are not a member of the European Union, so we don't have a common trade policy and will not impose sanctions unilaterally in this regard," he said.Norway is aiming to become the world's first country to end the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2025. The Norwegian market has seen a rapid increase in the number of Chinese EVs, which have made a notable contribution to the country's green efforts.According to the sales database of the Norwegian Road Federation, Chinese brands, including Volvo, increased their EV market share from 14 percent in 2023 to 23 percent in August this year.Green transition is an area in which both countries share a common interest. On Tuesday, Store first visited Beijing and signed a joint statement with Chinese Premier Li Qiang to establish a dialogue on green transition."My visit to Beijing confirmed with the Chinese leadership that Norway and China (as two nations), different in size and geographic locations, see strategic opportunities to work together in areas of common interest. We can do more in trade cooperation, especially in the maritime area," he said, noting he has seen China more "confident, relaxed and open" during this visit.China is a critical market for the Norwegian maritime industry, with about one-third of Norwegian companies present in China in the sector. China is also the world's largest shipbuilding country, where 55 ships are being built for Norway.Largest carrierEarlier on Wednesday, Store visited a shipyard in Nantong, Jiangsu province, where he attended the naming ceremony of one of the most environmentally friendly car carriers, which has been built jointly by Norway and China. Hoegh Borealis, which was delivered on the occasion, can carry 9,100 cars, and is the largest car carrier in the world.Tomra, a Norwegian recycling solutions provider, which has been present in China for 14 years, expressed optimism over the outlook of the country's circular economy as well as the prime minister's visit.Store's visit has been fruitful and sent positive signals, said Jet Chang, vice-president of public affairs at Tomra Asia."As Norway gains 15-day visa-free access to China, it would be much easier for senior business management to make a visit and communicate with the people here. The business section on both sides can expect positive and further bilateral cooperation," he said.Chang spoke highly of the two nations' joint statement on green transition, which highlighted the development of the circular economy."We have seen steady and continuous growth of our business in China with the nation's improving business environment and particularly its efforts in garbage classification in recent years. We are very pleased to see the joint statement, which would benefit us a lot," said Chang.Chang pointed out that developing a circular economy can better secure resources, reduce carbon emissions and environmental risks, as well as provide opportunities for investment and economic development.Wrapping up a four-day visit to China, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez emphasized on Wednesday that his country will be constructive and try to find a solution between China and the European Commission to avoid a potential trade war over electric vehicles and other issues."I have emphasized we do not want a trade war, as it would benefit no one," Sanchez said at a news conference in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, pledging Spain's efforts to "build bridges" and find compromises through negotiation amid existing tensions.Sanchez reiterated Spain's advocacy for open trade between Europe and China based on multilateral norms provided by the World Trade Organization for trade conflicts, with negotiated resolutions to conflicts that address the legitimate interests of both parties."I must say (Chinese EV) is truly advanced," Sanchez remarked, saying he had an opportunity to sit in and drive a Chinese EV during his visit. "I believe the major European brands have a lot to learn from the technology and advancements made by Chinese brands in EVs.""One of my main objectives during this visit was also to attract Chinese investment to Spain so that this Chinese investment can also establish itself in the form of a value chain in our country," he added.Sanchez said his second visit to China in less than two years demonstrated the two countries' shared commitment to maintaining regular high-level dialogue."I believe this visit has helped bring us closer to a key partner, opening doors for stronger cooperation in areas of mutual interest," Sanchez stated.During his stay, Spain and China inked eight agreements spanning trade, investment, culture, education, science and green development. Sanchez said this spirit of cooperation transcends the bilateral relationship between Spain and China and extends to the European Union.Economic tiesEconomic and commercial ties were the central focus. Sanchez met with Spanish companies operating in China and conveyed Spain's aim to consolidate trade and investment growth, especially in innovative and eco-friendly industries.He cited the example of the newly signed deal with Chinese green technology company Envision Group for building a zero-carbon hydrogen industrial park in Spain through an investment of nearly 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), creating about 1,000 jobs, both direct and indirect.However, the prime minister acknowledged that Spain and the EU's trade deficits with China were a concern. To that end, Sanchez said Spain and China have agreed to establish a permanent mechanism for cooperation and dialogue on trade and investment issues.He also prioritized bolstering cultural, educational and scientific ties during his visit, areas he considers vital given both countries have a rich heritage and excellent prospects.Sanchez said Spain considers China as a key partner in addressing major international issues such as climate change and development financing."China and the EU play a central role in addressing these challenges, and while differences may arise between us as naturally can happen between friendly partners, I believe that the common points are more important and far outweigh the divergences," Sanchez remarked. "Therefore, we must continue to cooperate."Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeated his defense of his government's migration policy and stressed the need for the country to continue to attract skilled overseas workers, as the topic becomes an increasingly dominant issue in the country's political discourse.A stabbing attack by a failed asylum seeker from Syria at the end of August that left three people dead raised public concern about immigration. And the far-right Alternative for Deutschland party, or AfD, is continuing to make political ground by campaigning heavily on the issue of migration control.Scholz's three-party coalition government comprising the Social Democrats, Greens, and Free Democrats recently held talks with political opponents to try and find common ground over the topic, but the opposition Christian Democrats, or CDU, said it would not take part in any more meetings."There is no country in the world with a shrinking working population that has economic growth. That is the truth we are confronted with," Scholz told members of the country's parliament, the Bundestag.But while continuing to stress the importance of welcoming outsiders, he also made it clear that there must be tighter controls than those employed by previous governments."We are a country that offers protection to those who are politically persecuted, who are running for their lives, who have to save their lives, and that is in our Constitution and we are not putting that up for debate," he said. "Openness to the world is, therefore, necessary. But openness to the world does not mean that anyone who wants to can come. We must be able to choose who comes to Germany. I say that quite explicitly here."Scholz accused opposition groups, including the CDU, of "sloganeering, not getting anything done", and he said the party was seeking to make publicity out of the issue without trying to resolve it.CDU leader Friedrich Merz said Scholz's proposals lacked substance, "and that is why we are not entering into an endless loop of talks with you".But Scholz replied: "We will never slam a door, you can always come back (to discussions)."At the same time as calling for tougher measures, however, Merz did concede that Germany needs to welcome outsiders for its economic and social health."Germany must remain an open and foreign-friendly country," he said, and, wary of the rise of the AfD, he added that the CDU stands "clearly and unequivocally against all forms of xenophobia".Recently, Germany has introduced more controls at its frontiers with fellow European Union member states Poland and Czechia, and also non-EU country Switzerland, in addition to controls that have long been in place at the frontier with Austria.Next week, more frequent checks will also be introduced for people arriving on land from neighboring Belgium, France, Denmark, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, and the country's Interior Ministry reported that the new measures have already seen more than 30,000 people refused entry.Europe's record-breaking heat wave has had a major impact on water bodies, with the continent's lakes and rivers experiencing severe depletion, particularly in Poland where water levels have reached critically low levels.The European Union's climate monitoring service, Copernicus, reported recently that the world has just experienced its hottest northern hemisphere summer on record, surpassing last year's temperatures as global warming intensifies.This unprecedented heat, particularly evident in the June-to-August period, significantly increases the probability that 2024 will surpass 2023 as the warmest year in recorded history, it said.The Vistula River, Poland's longest and most important waterway, has dropped to a fraction of its normal depth, with Warsaw recording just 20 centimeters on Wednesday, below the 2015 record low of 26 cm.This drastic reduction, far from the usual 105-250 cm range, was confirmed by Poland's Institute of Meteorology and Water Management, or IMGW, highlighting the severe impact of the heat wave on vital waterways.The extreme low water levels in the Vistula have forced tour operators to alter their routes. Andrzej Stanski, who runs a river cruise company, explained the challenges they face."We're sailing off the route, because here and there you can simply hit a stone," he told Reuters. "The engines cost quite a lot, and it's about the safety of both the passengers and ourselves."Warsaw University hydrologist Jaroslaw Suchozebrski warned that Poland is experiencing a hydrological drought with far-reaching consequences."We have less and less water at our disposal, which means that water recipients have to approach it a little more rationally ... mainly the energy industry," he told Reuters. "Our energy production is based on cooling processes using water. The second concern is the water quality, as lower river fl ow reduces the dilution of pollutants."Hydrological data paints a concerning picture, with nearly three-quarters of Poland's monitoring stations reporting diminished water levels, while the count of locations exhibiting signs of hydrological drought has surged to 295, said Euronews.The serious environmental consequences of the drought were highlighted in a report from Poland's Radio RMF, which revealed that numerous dead fish had been found in the Vistula River's southern sections.Suchozebrski noted that weather forecasts indicate heavy rainfall in the coming days, which could lead to a swift increase in river levels, potentially shifting the crisis from drought to fl ash fl oods.Other Central and Eastern European countries, including Hungary, are experiencing similar issues that threaten agricultural productivity, noted Reuters."During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record," said Copernicus Climate Change Service deputy director, Samantha Burgess.Without immediate and significant reductions of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions by nations worldwide, extreme weather "will only become more intense," added Burgess.The United Kingdom's publicly funded healthcare system, the National Health Service, or NHS, is "broken" but can be fixed, the country's prime minister insisted on Thursday.Keir Starmer said in a speech made in response to a damning report about the NHS that the service is, indeed, far below the level it should be operating at, but he said his government will turn things around.Starmer said the report released on Thursday by former Cabinet minister and surgeon Ara Darzi, which details "ballooning" wait times and gridlock in accident and emergency, or A&E, departments was accurate.But he said more investment is not the answer."We have to fix the plumbing before turning on the taps," he said. "No more money without reform."Speaking at a gathering organized by the King's Fund, a healthcare think tank that has called for "change" and "bold action", Starmer said the NHS failings are a matter of "life or death".Blaming mismanagement by the Conservative Party administration that ran the country before his government took over on July 4, Starmer said: "People have the right to be angry".Calling Darzi's report a "raw and honest assessment" of the state of the NHS, he said the inefficiency and shortcomings of the service, which keeps almost a tenth of A&E patients waiting at least 12 hours, is "devastating, heart-breaking, infuriating" and a cause of avoidable deaths.Starmer conceded more than 100,000 sick infants waited at A&E departments for six hours or more last year, and said many people with mental health issues do not get help for at least a year. But he said the NHS "may be broken, but it's not beaten".Earlier, Health Secretary Wes Streeting had also responded to the report, saying the government will oversee three "big shifts" in how the NHS operates.Streeting said it will, in future, prioritize care in the community over hospital stays; migrate the way it works, from analogue to digital systems; and focus on preventing illness, instead of treating it.Starmer picked up on those ideas in his speech, saying the NHS, which was stretched to its limits before the novel coronavirus pandemic began, must "reform or die". But he insisted that, no matter how it changes, treatment will be free at the point of delivery."When you fall ill, you should never have to worry about the bill," he said.Starmer explained that the NHS overhaul will involve a move away from massive hospitals in population centers toward smaller neighborhood hubs, and more digital consultations.The government will detail its plans in the coming months, but Starmer said they will take 10 years to complete. And he did not mention how much they will cost. FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday announced it would cut key interest rates again, marking its second rate reduction this year following a move in June, with no indication of the future rate path.In a press release, the ECB announced that it has decided to reduce the deposit facility rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent due to declining inflation. This decision follows the bank's June rate cut, which marked its first reduction in five years.The market expects this move would further ease financing conditions for households and businesses in the eurozone."Based on the Governing Council's updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to take another step in moderating the degree of monetary policy restriction," the bank said.According to the spread established by the ECB between the three key interest rates, the rates for the main refinancing operations and the marginal lending facility will be reduced to 3.65 percent and 3.90 percent, respectively, following the cut to the deposit facility rate.The latest staff projections released by the central bank maintain the inflation forecasts unchanged from its June estimates. The ECB staff anticipate that inflation will average 2.5 percent in 2024, 2.2 percent in 2025, and 1.9 percent in 2026.The core inflation projections have been revised upward for both 2024 and 2025.Projections for economic growth in the euro area have been revised downward compared to June. The ECB staff forecast that the economy will grow by 0.8 percent in 2024, 1.3 percent in 2025, and 1.5 percent in 2026.The ECB reiterated its commitment to reducing inflation in the euro area in a timely manner, stating, "It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim."It marks the second time the ECB has cut key interest rates since June, when the rates were lowered by 25 basis points.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez reiterated Spain's advocacy for open trade based on multilateral World Trade Organization norms, with negotiated resolutions to conflicts that address the legitimate interests of both parties during his visit to China, which concluded on Wednesday."I have emphasized we do not want a trade war, as it would benefit no one," he said, pledging Spain's efforts to "build bridges" and find compromises through negotiation amid existing tensions between China and the EU.Sánchez said Spain considers China as a key partner in addressing major international issues such as climate change and development financing."China and the EU play a central role in addressing these challenges, and while differences may arise between us, as naturally can happen between friendly partners, I believe that the common points are more important and far outweigh the divergences," Sánchez said. "Therefore, we must continue to cooperate."German automaker BMW Group expects to spend up to $1 billion on fixing a problem with the braking systems of around 1.5 million vehicles it sold during the past two years.The company said the vehicles have been distributed globally, with around 370,000 in China, 270,000 in the United States, 150,000 in Germany, 70,000 in South Korea, and 60,000 in France.It detailed the size of the problem on Tuesday, triggered a sizable fall in its share price.The company had made people aware of the issue in April, but investors seemed to have been surprised by its scale.BMW said the potential defect has also been identified in around 320,000 vehicles that have not yet been shipped to customers, which will slow up their delivery by around a month.The company said it has set aside a "high three-digit million amount" to pay for the work, which will be done under warranty.The Munich-based automaker also said it has been experiencing weak demand for its products in China.The recalls and the disappointing sales figures led it to cut its full-year earnings forecast, with earnings likely to drop significantly below last year's $18.9 billion.BMW said its full-year operating margin will now likely be in the 6 percent to 7 percent range, instead of the previously expected 8 percent to 10 percent range."The one-off technical action and China market development is definitely challenging," the Financial Times newspaper quoted BMW as saying.The company said cars produced between June 2022 and August 2024 are affected by the glitch, with models being recalled including the BMW X1, the Mini Cooper, and the Rolls-Royce Spectre.BMW said the defect is likely to affect between 3 percent and 5 percent of vehicles produced during the time window.The company said the fault is related to the vehicles' braking support system, although it said impacted autos will still be within the legal requirements for braking, in spite of the fault.BMW Group said the faulty components were supplied by a third-party vendor, a German parts supplier called Continental AG.A spokesperson for BMW said the company "has developed a diagnostic software to detect the brake fault before it occurs", with the software able to warn drivers and tell them to visit a dealership as soon as possible.The business news agency Bloomberg said BMW's difficulties following hot on the heels of VW Group announcing layoffs and possible factory closures points to a crisis among German automakers.It said "the one-two punch "dealt a blow to Germany's economy, which has been struggling with expensive energy prices, high inflation and interest rates, and industrial action.BMW's shares closed 8.7 percent lower in Frankfurt on Tuesday, with the company's market valuation down by around $5.53 billion.The family of the Eiffel Tower's architect has pushed back against the Paris mayor's proposal to permanently install the Olympic rings on the iconic structure.Gustave Eiffel's descendants have stated they "oppose any alteration that negatively impacts respect for the work" of their ancestor and added that they have already sought legal counsel to potentially block the plans proposed by Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo.Hidalgo wants to retain the giant Olympic rings on the Eiffel Tower, which Parisians affectionately call the "Iron Lady", until at least the 2028 Games in Los Angeles."As mayor of Paris, the decision is mine," Hidalgo said in an interview with the Ouest-France regional newspaper on the weekend." I want the spirit of celebration to remain. I'm delighted that the French have fallen in love with Paris again, after 10 years of bashing and telling us that (the Olympic Games) was going to be hell."The massive ring structure, weighing 30 metric tons and measuring 29 meters by 13 meters, is too heavy to remain permanently on the Eiffel Tower, and Hidalgo's plan is to replace it with a more lightweight steel copy "as soon as possible", reported Agence France-Presse.The descendants of Eiffel contend that the Olympic emblem is "colorful, large in size, placed on the main avenue of approach to the tower" and claimed it "creates a strong imbalance" in the structure's silhouette.They argue that this addition significantly alters "the very pure forms of the monument".Retaining the rings on the tower would go against "the neutrality and meaning acquired over the years by the Eiffel Tower, which has become the symbol of the city of Paris and even all of France across the world", the Association of Descendants of Gustave Eiffel, or AGDE, said in a statement on Sunday.Hidalgo's comment that it was her decision alone was "incomprehensible", said Olivier Berthelot-Eiffel, Gustave's great-great grandson, who is president of the AGDE."Let the rings remain for a little longer than the Paralympic Games, why not? We have no problem with that," he said on Monday. "But the Eiffel Tower is not intended as an advertising platform. Anne Hidalgo should surely have said that she wanted to keep the Olympic rings and asked for the opinion of the Paris city council and other competent people, not that she had decided to do so."Another of Eiffel's descendants, Savin Yeatman-Eiffel, suggested that keeping the rings in place would limit the tower's ability to support various causes and events, as it has done previously.He told BFMTV: "The Eiffel Tower, which is a symbol of Paris and France, has a much broader vocation than being associated with an organization or concept like the Olympic Games."KYIV - Visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Wednesday announced new aid packages for Ukraine, local media reported.Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv, Blinken said that the United States would provide more than 700 million US dollars for Ukraine in fresh assistance, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported.Of the sum, 325 million dollars will be directed for the restoration of energy and electric networks, 290 million dollars for humanitarian aid and 102 million dollars for humanitarian demining.Blinken also informed that he had discussed with Ukrainian officials the use of long-range weapons.For his part, Lammy announced that Britain will provide more than 600 million pounds (about 783 million US dollars) worth of support for Ukraine, the Ukrinform news agency reported.The funding will be used to finance Ukraine's urgent humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs, and provide credit guarantees for Kyiv.Blinken and Lammy arrived in Kyiv earlier in the day for a joint visit. The diplomats met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and senior government officials. They also took part in the fourth Crimea Platform Summit.BRUSSELS - Germany's recent decision to reinstate passport checks at all land borders to combat irregular migration, terrorism threats, and cross-border organized crime has sparked reactions from neighboring countries and the broader European Union (EU).The move, following a series of violent crimes, including a deadly stabbing in Solingen last month, has raised concerns about its impact on the Schengen Area's principle of free movement.The reinstatement of border checks, which applies to all of Germany's nine neighboring countries, has drawn particular concern from its Schengen partners, many of whom fear disruptions to trade, travel, and European unity.Transport and Logistics Netherlands (TLN), a Dutch transport industry organization, has expressed alarm over the potential impact on trade, citing past experiences of long border delays during similar measures, such as during the pandemic and major events like the European Football Championship."Germany is undermining the Schengen Agreement and the free movement of goods," TLN said, warning that delays could lead to severe consequences for supply chains.Dutch Asylum and Migration Minister Marjolein Faber said while she understood Germany's decision but emphasized the need for clear enforcement measures to ensure smooth trade and traffic flow.Poland has reacted strongly, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk calling Germany's move "a de facto suspension of the Schengen Area" and labeling it "unacceptable" for Poland."I have no doubt that the tightening of these measures is driven by internal political factors in Germany, not our policies regarding illegal migration at our borders," he said."In the coming hours, we will reach out to other countries impacted by these decisions from Berlin for urgent consultations on actions to be taken within the European Union, particularly with all of Germany's neighboring states," Tusk added.In addition to Germany, which recently took this measure, other EU member states have also strengthened border controls in recent years, basically on the grounds of cracking down on illegal immigration, causing friction with neighboring countries.Austria, for example, has maintained border controls with Slovakia and extended checks along its border with Slovenia, citing efforts to combat illegal migration. Slovakia, which shares a significant cross-border commuting population with Austria, has voiced concerns about the disruptions these measures cause.Slovenia, too, has protested repeatedly to EU authorities regarding Austria's ongoing border controls, which have been extended multiple times since 2015.Italy has also reintroduced controls at its border with Slovenia, while Latvia recently extended a reinforced border protection regime with Belarus until the end of the year, citing a surge in attempts to illegally cross the border.Meanwhile, the European Commission is engaging in discussions with Germany over its border control decision.A spokesperson for the commission, Anitta Hipper, confirmed that Germany had informed the commission of the decision and noted that under Schengen rules, "member states have the authority to reintroduce internal border controls if necessary and proportionate to address significant threats to public policy or internal security.""The EU Commission is coordinating with Schengen authorities, who are in close contact with German authorities as well as other member states currently enforcing internal border controls," Hipper added.The 47th WorldSkills Competition officially kicked off in Lyon, France, on Tuesday, bringing together 1,400 competitors from 69 countries and regions. French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the event, which is expected to draw 250,000 participants, including those attending the competition, ceremonies, and city-wide activities for WorldSkills Lyon 2024.One of the most eagerly anticipated moments, the Parade of Nations, set a vibrant and inspiring tone for the evening. Teams from every country and region marched with pride, greeted by rapturous applause from the audience. As the final team took its place, the diversity and strength of the WorldSkills community were fully on display.China, a regular participant in the biennial competition, is making its seventh appearance this year, fielding 68 competitors with an average age of 22. China has the highest number of competition categories among all participating countries.The Chinese team will compete in all 59 skill areas, spanning six major categories: information and communication technology, transportation and logistics, manufacturing and engineering technology, construction and building technology, creative arts and fashion, and social and personal services.Max Roche, president of WorldSkills Lyon 2024, highlighted the four core values of WorldSkills —excellence, generosity, openness, and unity. He said: "We believe that everything is possible with skills. This competition is all about sharing — sharing skills, knowledge, happiness, and success. We want to welcome everyone, no matter where they come from."WorldSkills President Chris Humphries and WorldSkills Champions Trust representative for Asia Shweta Ratanpura delivered a joint opening speech. Ratanpura competed at WorldSkills Kazan 2019 in Graphic Design Technology and became the first Indian woman to win a WorldSkills medal.She encouraged competitors to seize the moment. "I ask you to make a commitment right now to pay it forward," she said. "Take all the advantages you've been given and make the WorldSkills movement even stronger. Make your mark and pursue excellence in everything you do."Humphries echoed her sentiments, saying, "Whatever country we come from and however different our journeys have been, each of you shares the ambition to imagine a better way forward and the determination to lead us toward a more secure, equitable, and sustainable planet."The spotlight then turned to President Macron, who officially declared the 47th WorldSkills Competition open.Running through Sept 15, this event, often referred to as the "Olympics of Skills", is the world's largest vocational education and skills competition, showcasing excellence across a wide range of trades.WARSAW - Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday that he plans to seek urgent consultations with neighboring countries affected by Germany's decision to tighten border controls.The head of the Polish government called Germany's actions "a de facto suspension of the Schengen area" and added that this was unacceptable for Poland.German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said on Monday that the controls, set to start on Sept 16, will be initially imposed for six months, aiming to curb illegal immigration and protect German citizens from terrorism and crime."I have no doubt that the tightening of these measures is driven by internal political factors in Germany, not our policies regarding illegal migration at our borders," Tusk said."In the coming hours, we will reach out to other countries impacted by these decisions from Berlin for urgent consultations on actions to be taken within the European Union (EU), particularly with all of Germany's neighboring states," he added.The new measures will affect Germany's borders with France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Poland.Germany's government has announced a new six-month tightening of border checks will come in from the start of next week, in the aftermath of an attack in the town of Solingen in August that left three people dead, for which the Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility.The suspect detained is a Syrian national who had failed in his asylum application and was awaiting deportation from Germany.Shortly after the incident, the far-right Alternative for Deutschland party, or AfD, enjoyed its biggest success yet in local elections.Germany shares more than 3,700 kilometers of land borders with Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland, all of which are members of the Schengen Zone, within which free movement is usually permitted, with no restrictions.An increase in first-time asylum requests last year meant that Germany had already imposed some level of checks at the frontiers with Austria, Czech Republic, Poland and Switzerland, but these are now being extended nationwide.Interior Minister Nancy Faeser insisted the government was "taking a hard line" against irregular migration to reduce cross-border crime. "We are doing everything in our power to protect the people of our country against these threats," she added.Public concernIn recent years, Germany has welcomed huge numbers of people fleeing conflict, but the AfD campaigned heavily on the issue in the recent election and had success, so politicians are aware it is becoming an increasingly significant public concern.Members of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government have already held talks with center-right opposition groups about a new approach to the issue of migration in the aftermath of the Solingen attacks, and Friedrich Merz, leader of the mainstream conservative Christian Democratic Union party, said migration in general needed to be tightened up."If the coalition wants to talk to us about the solution, then item one on the agenda must be limiting migration," he said.Marcus Engler, a researcher from the German Center for Integration and Migration Research, told the Reuters news agency that "the intention of the government seems to be to show symbolically to Germans and potential migrants that the latter are no longer wanted here". United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in London for a two-day visit that includes talks with United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy.The US State Department stated that the visit aims to launch a "US-UK strategic dialogue", reinforcing the "special relationship" between the two nations.Blinken was set to "discuss a range of critical issues, including the Indo-Pacific, AUKUS partnership, the Middle East, and our collective efforts to support Ukraine", the department said in a statement ahead of the visit.Blinken and Lammy previously met during Starmer's visit to Washington for a NATO summit in July, where they "reaffirmed the importance of ensuring Ukraine has the economic, security, and humanitarian assistance it needs to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity".They also "discussed the need to reach a ceasefire in Gaza that secures the release of hostages and lays the groundwork for durable peace".Blinken has made frequent visits to Israel since the Hamas attacks on Oct 7, and recently claimed to have secured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's acceptance of Washington's "bridging proposal", which is aimed at bringing Israel and Hamas closer to a deal.The US diplomat's London visit comes amid growing pressure on Netanyahu to finalize a deal, following widespread protests in Israel.His visit follows the UK's recent suspension of certain arms export licenses to Israel for equipment that could be used in the conflict in Gaza.US President Joe Biden's administration faces pressure to limit arms deliveries to Israel, its key Middle East ally, amid criticism of the ongoing conflict.During the visit, Blinken and Lammy are expected to initiate discussions on the so-called UK-US Strategic Dialogue, which aims to enhance bilateral relations in various areas, the UK government said.The UK stated that the dialogue would address "key elements of the UK-US relationship, including defense and security, Europe, Ukraine, the Middle East, the Indo-Pacific, and other global priorities"."In a more volatile and insecure world, it is even more important that we are highly aligned nations," Lammy said in a statement before the meeting.The White House announced that a second bilateral meeting between Starmer and Biden is scheduled for Friday in Washington.Starmer previously described his July talks with Biden as a chance to "recommit" to NATO and the UK-US "special relationship".White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated that the upcoming meeting will involve "an in-depth discussion on a range of global issues of mutual interest".Chronic overcrowding in prisons in England and Wales forced the United Kingdom government to release 1,700 inmates on Tuesday, in a move that has been criticized by victims' advocates and opposition lawmakers.The mass release, which was made in addition to the usual weekly release of around 1,000 inmates, came as the UK's prison population passed 88,000, and as institutions hit breaking point.The prison population, which is the largest it has ever been, grew by more than 1,100 during August, as people were sentenced following anti-immigrant riots that swept the country.The ruling Labour Party, which swept to power in the general election on July 4, said the previous Conservative Party administration was to blame for the lack of prison space following years of underinvestment.Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the system was at "crisis point".Jonathan Reynolds, the UK's minister for business, explained on the BBC's Breakfast program that victims were being told about prisoners' early release "where it's relevant"."Most British people would say it should never get to this point and I understand those concerns," he said.Reynolds said the authorities had put "many safeguards" in place to protect the public. He said domestic abusers, sex offenders, terrorists, and other violent offenders were not eligible for early release under the policy that calls for non-violent prisoners sentenced to less than five years to be freed after serving 40 percent of their term, instead of the previous 50 percent.The government says the change will free up 5,500 spaces.But Helen Newlove, the victim's commissioner for England and Wales, told the BBC she was "concerned about the impact of these early releases on victims' confidence in our justice system"."Victim safety must remain the absolute priority," she said.The Conservative Party said the government had mismanaged the situation and created "serious public concern" as a result.Mel Stride, the party's spokesperson on work and pensions, said he was concerned some prisoners would be freed without a home to go to."We're not getting satisfactory answers as to whether appropriate accommodation is actually being provided for those prisoners that are being released," he said. "And in the event it is not, we know the chances of reoffending increase very significantly."Chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor agreed, telling the Associated Press: "It's inevitable that some of these prisoners will get recalled to custody and it's inevitable that some of them will go out homeless."He said in his annual report on the state of UK prisons that the number of people in custody will grow by 27,000 by 2028, but that construction is unlikely to keep up.The Prison Reform Trust said the UK's overcrowded prisons now mean inmates are simply being "warehoused" and do not have adequate access to education, training, and work. BRUSSELS -- Google lost its final court appeal on Tuesday against a European Union (EU) fine of 2.4 billion euros ($2.65 billion), for abuse of its dominant position by favoring its own comparison shopping service.In 2017, the Commission determined that in 13 countries within the European Economic Area, Google prioritized its own comparison shopping service by displaying it at the top of its general search results. Meanwhile, competing comparison shopping services appeared only as standard generic search results.The Commission therefore concluded that Google had abused its dominant position in the markets for online general searches and for specialized product searches, and imposed the fine.Following a lower court's ruling to uphold the Commission's decision and maintain that fine, Google and its parent firm Alphabet appealed to the Court of Justice."By today's judgment, the Court of Justice dismisses the appeal and thus upholds the judgment of the General Court," the court said in a press release.The Court of Justice said that EU law does not sanction the existence of a dominant position, but only its abusive exploitation."In essence, the Google Shopping case was a catalyst for change, inspiring a more vigilant and proactive approach to regulating big tech and ensuring a fairer digital marketplace," said Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the European Commission for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age, following Tuesday's court ruling.  BRUSSELS -- The European Union (EU)'s Court of Justice on Tuesday delivered its final judgment on Apple's appeal, confirming that the company must repay illegal tax benefits to Ireland.In 2016, the European Commission ruled that companies within the Apple Group had received unlawful tax advantages worth 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in the form of State aid provided by Ireland from 1991 to 2014.The General Court annulled the Commission's decision in 2020, saying the Commission had not sufficiently proven that the companies involved had received a selective advantage.Tuesday's ruling by the Court of Justice overturned the earlier decision. "The Court of Justice gives final judgment in the matter and confirms the European Commission's 2016 decision: Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid which Ireland is required to recover," the court said in a press release.Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the European Commission for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age, hailed Tuesday's court ruling as "a big win for European citizens and for tax justice.""This means that the recovered taxes, which have been in an escrow account for quite some years in Ireland during the ongoing court proceedings, now must be released to the Irish State," she said.She also noted that the investigations have contributed to a shift in mindset among member states, encouraging them to initiate or accelerate regulatory and legislative reforms. MOSCOW -- Russian forces have intercepted and destroyed 144 Ukrainian drones across nine of the country's regions on Tuesday, the Russian defense ministry said.Seventy-two drones were destroyed over the Bryansk region, 20 over the Moscow region, and 14 over Russia's Kursk region, said the defense ministry.Overnight, apartment buildings in the Ramenskoye district of the Moscow region had been damaged as a result of a drone attack, according to Moscow region governor Andrey Vorobyev.According to preliminary information, one woman has died, three people have been hospitalized, and 43 people have been placed in temporary housing centers following the attack.The defense ministry added that 13 drones were destroyed over the Tula region, eight over the Belgorod region, seven over the Kaluga region, five over the Voronezh region, four over the Lipetsk region, and one over the Oryol region.  (AP VIDEO, Source: PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES / WILL WARR)LONDON -- The United Kingdom's (UK) Princess of Wales said on Monday that she has completed her chemotherapy treatment for cancer."As the summer comes to an end, I cannot tell you what a relief it is to have finally completed my chemotherapy treatment," 42-year-old Princess Kate said in a video where she was seen spending time with her family in Norfolk, east of England."Doing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus. Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes," she said.The princess said she's looking forward to being back at work and undertaking a few more public engagements in the coming months.Kate revealed her cancer diagnosis in March and her chemotherapy began in late February.An expert in the United Kingdom specializing in China-Africa relations has praised the series of partnership actions announced at the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing, saying the event showcased the depth and breadth of bilateral ties."FOCAC remains the most prominent platform for China-Africa cooperation, especially in terms of its scale and longevity," said Linda Calabrese, a senior research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute, a global affairs think tank headquartered in London."The forum is well attended by many African leaders, and it has been running for many years, providing a crucial platform for high-level government dialogues but also for other discussions for strengthening economic, political and cultural ties. This showcases the depth and breadth of China-Africa relations."During the opening ceremony of the summit on Thursday, Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled 10 partnership actions for modernization to deepen cooperation in the next three years, pledging support for Africa in trade, agriculture, infrastructure connectivity, green development and other sectors."The first thing to note about the speech is the financial pledges that were made to support Africa," Calabrese said, referring to the 360 billion yuan ($50.6 billion) of financial support promised for implementing the actions. "It reaffirms China's ongoing support for Africa's development aspirations, even amid global economic challenges."The new financing represents a substantial investment, demonstrating China's confidence in Africa's future and the importance it attaches to its partnership with Africa, she said.Calabrese also praised the efforts to promote trade, highlighting China's unilateral opening of its market to the continent. Notable measures outlined in the speech include giving all least-developed countries that have diplomatic relations with China, including 33 countries in Africa, zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines."China is committed to improving Africa's market access," she said. "This (the zero-tariff action plan) coupled with trade facilitation initiatives such as the 'green lanes', presents a significant opportunity for diversifying and growing African exports to the Chinese market, particularly in the agriculture sector."Additionally, Calabrese found it particularly "encouraging" to see China backing the development of the African Continental Free Trade Area, a project that aims to create a single market for goods and services across the continent and other related infrastructure needs."This is a much-needed support. China's continued investment in the infrastructure area will play a vital role in driving economic growth."Regarding the China-Africa industrial chain cooperation proposed in the speech, she expressed hope that greater emphasis could be placed on automotive, pharmaceuticals, agro-processing and transport and logistics.zhengwanyin@mail.chinadailyuk.com The newly appointed chief of Ferrovie dello Stato, Italy's national railway company, has announced that the organization will explore options for attracting external investment, including the possibility of listing the company on the stock exchange, a move that would align with the Italian government's broader privatization efforts.Last September, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government unveiled a plan to manage Italy's public debt, including a privatization initiative to generate approximately 20 billion euros ($21.6 billion) between 2024 and 2026.The country's public debt is the second-highest in the eurozone relative to its gross domestic product and is projected to reach about 140 percent of GDP by 2026.In an interview with Reuters on the weekend, the railway company's CEO Stefano Donnarumma indicated listing on the Borsa Italiana stock exchange was one option under consideration as the business seeks to attract new capital and fund future investments."I am ready to consider opening up the company's capital to investors ... a bourse listing is usually a consequence of such a process. I wouldn't speak of flotation per se, but of opening up the capital," he said from the sidelines of the TEHA business forum.Reflecting on his tenure as CEO of power grid operator Terna Group, Donnarumma highlighted the advantages of private investment in a regulated infrastructure.He noted that his experience had shown him the value of having private shareholders, particularly in their ability to contribute to funding for new investments."It's not an obligation, the decision is the state's to take. And it's not like I've been brought in to oversee a privatization," he said. "It was studied before my arrival, and I plan to go over that study in the coming weeks, as we work on our strategy and see how it fits with them. The management's job is to come up with strategies and propose them. The shareholder will decide."Donnarumma said he expects to have more clarity about the group's direction toward the end of the year, but he added that the process of incorporating private investors would likely take two years.In November, the Italian Treasury generated 920 million euros by divesting a 25-percent share in Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank.Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti has previously indicated that portions of state-owned railway and motorway networks might also be put up for sale, said Reuters.In December, Meloni said the Italian government's privatization plans would not result in state assets being sold off cheaply."We have launched a privatization plan, but let's be clear: with this government, these will never become sell-offs," Meloni said. The chief executive officer of Volkswagen Group, or VW, has defended the German multinational automaker's decision to lay off workers and potentially close factories.Oliver Blume said the company that sells vehicles under the Audi, Bentley, Cupra, Jetta, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, Skoda, and Volkswagen brands has no alternative to considering painful options."Fewer cars are being sold in Europe and new competitors from Asia are pushing aggressively into the market," he told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday. "The cake has got smaller and we have more guests at the table."After seeing the value of VW's shares fall by around a third during the past five years, the 90-year-old automotive giant has said it needs to save 4 billion euros ($4.25 billion) through compulsory job cuts. And Blume has said the economic situation the company is facing is now "so serious that we can't simply continue as we were", and that factory closures in Germany are also on the table.Unions and left-wing politicians have responded by pointing out that the company paid out billions of euros in shareholder dividends last year, which they say suggests VW is in better financial shape than Blume has claimed.They also say VW is so important to Germany, Europe's largest economy, that downsizing must be avoided at all costs.Janine Wissler, chairwoman of the Left Party, told the Rheinische Post newspaper: "It is incredibly sleazy that Volkswagen could pay out 4.5 billion euros and now claims that it can't raise 5 billion euros to prevent plant closures and job losses."But the Federation of German Industries, or BDI, which represents more than 100,000 German companies that employ 8 million people, said the challenges VW is facing are being experienced throughout the country's manufacturing sector.BDI President Siegfried Russwurm told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper German companies are encountering difficulties because of soaring energy prices, high taxes, layers of bureaucracy, and "unreliable public infrastructure"."The problems in Germany are obvious," he said while urging the government to intervene.Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been keeping a close eye on the situation and says he has spoken with union representatives.He told the Tagesspiegel newspaper his government wants an outcome in which the company manages to "secure jobs and plants".The company, which was the world's largest automaker by sales volume in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 and the world's largest automaker by revenue in 2022, was seventh in the 2020 Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.VW has three joint ventures in China — FAW-Volkswagen, SAIC Volkswagen, and Volkswagen Anhui — and also has production facilities in at least 26 other countries, employing a global workforce of around 676,000 people.There are many opportunities for both China and Spain, and the two countries "should be brave enough to seize them," said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.Sanchez, on an official visit to China from Sunday to Wednesday, made these remarks at the opening ceremony of the 9th China-Spain Forum held in Beijing on Monday morning.In his speech, the Spanish leader invited various parties to strengthen cooperation and promote mutual understanding between the two countries through this high-end forum.He added that Spain and China have close exchanges and last year the two countries jointly celebrated the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic relations.Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership, and Spain will further strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various aspects, he said."Although we still have differences on some issues between the two sides, there is a shared willingness to engage in further dialogue and consultation. We are committed to working together to find agreed solutions based on mutual benefits and win-win situations," he said.Speaking about the exchange of visits between the two countries, he thanked China for granting Spanish citizens visa exemptions."Our aim and vision is also to have more Chinese citizens visit our country," he said.He noted that tourism between the two countries has fully recovered in the first half of this year and will exceed projected levels by the end of the year.Chinese tech companies are making a strong impression at this year's IFA Berlin, Europe's largest consumer electronics trade show, with prominent exhibition spaces and ads from leading home appliance brands greeting attendees at the trade fair entrance.This year marks IFA Berlin's centennial celebration, featuring over 420 Chinese firms and underscoring China's vital role in the global consumer technology market. Among the 1,800 exhibitors, major Chinese brands such as Haier, Hisense, Midea, and TCL command some of the largest exhibit spaces, showcasing a wide range of smart home appliances. The event, expected to draw over 182,000 visitors from 139 countries, runs until Sept 10, with artificial intelligence being one of its key themes.Leif Lindner, CEO of IFA Berlin, emphasized the lasting appeal of the trade show, pointing to the strong demand from exhibitors. "IFA has always been, and will continue to be, at the forefront of change and disruption, showcasing real-world innovations, with consumers engaging with new technologies in real time," Lindner said.Haier, along with its subsidiary brands Candy, Hoover, and Casarte, continued to showcase their cutting-edge technology at the expo. "Haier not only demonstrated the technological leadership of Chinese companies through innovative solutions and scenarios but also illustrated the global rise of Chinese brands by achieving the fastest growth in the European market for eight consecutive years," said Neil Tunstall, CEO of Haier Europe.Midea, a leading Chinese air conditioner manufacturer, has made a significant investment at IFA Berlin this year, evident in its massive ad space at the trade show entrance. Zhu Zhou, the Europe sales director of Chinese electrical appliance manufacturer Midea, said: "We've recognized that single products alone can no longer meet the diverse and sophisticated demands of today's consumers. Therefore, we are focusing on a unified, scenario-based approach enhanced by AI technology to better address these varied needs."Hisense, a leading Chinese appliance and electronics manufacturer, unveiled its AI-driven applications, green intelligence solutions, and innovations in emerging industries, providing visitors with an immersive experience at their booth. Notably, the Hisense U7 TV was showcased alongside the game Black Myth: Wukong, demonstrating its user-centric technology and smooth performance, which significantly enhances the gaming experience.Honor introduced several new devices in the global markets, including the MagicBook Art 14 and the MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon PC.In addition to major Chinese industry names, the trade show has also attracted smaller Chinese companies. Liu Yuegui, sales director of Shenzhen-based Aukey Technology, a producer of consumer electronics, said: "We've been attending the fair for the past three years. After seeing the benefits of increased customer engagement last year, it made perfect sense for us to return to the expo this year."Jeffrey Towson, founder of TechMoat Consulting and an expert on Chinese tech companies, observed, "China's domestic market is highly competitive, so companies are already well-prepared before they go international. However, participating in exhibitions helps Chinese leaders better understand foreign markets and their customers."Lorenzo Coruzzi, director at Brand Finance, a London-based brand valuation consultancy, said: "Global trade show presence for Chinese companies is critical, not optional. IFA Berlin offers unparalleled exposure to European markets, media, and competitors. It's a vital platform for relationship-building, trend-spotting, and asserting market position."Louis Brennan, a professor of business studies at Trinity Business School in Ireland, said Chinese companies can significantly influence future trends in consumer electronics and home appliances."Chinese companies will reinforce existing trends such as intense price competition and the digitization of consumer electronics and home appliances. They have an opportunity to meet the consumer demand for ease and simplicity of use while providing excellent customer service," Brennan added.Six Serbian police officers have arrived in China to carry out a one-month joint patrol mission, marking the first time that China and Serbia have conducted joint patrols in China, the Ministry of Public Security announced on Saturday.This joint patrol will help Serbia gain a deeper understanding of Chinese public security work, further enhancing law enforcement cooperation between the two countries, and creating a safer environment to help forge people-to-people exchanges between the two nations, the MPS said.During the joint patrol, Serbian officers will wear Serbian police uniforms and patrol in mixed teams with Chinese police officers at tourist attractions in the provinces of Hainan, Zhejiang and other locations. Serbian officers will not carry any weapons or equipment but will provide policing advice to assist Chinese officers in addressing the safety concerns of Serbian citizens in China, thereby creating a safe tourism environment together, according to the MPS.In 2019 and 2023, in response to invitations from Serbia, the MPS dispatched teams to Serbia to carry out China-Serbia joint patrol missions twice.France's new Prime Minister Michel Barnier, 73, the former EU Brexit negotiator, now faces the challenge of uniting a deeply divided National Assembly, which is split into three main blocs, to create a functional government.Barnier is also a former foreign minister from the center-right Les Republicains party, or LR.President Emmanuel Macron is relying on the experience of the former European Commissioner and his negotiation skills to maintain stability in the government.Barnier's political career has spanned several decades, beginning in the mid-1990s under the late president Jacques Chirac. His appointment comes nearly three months after snap legislative elections left France in political deadlock, with no party winning an outright majority. The New Popular Front, or NFP, a left-wing alliance, won the most seats, with Macron's coalition finishing second, ahead of the far-right National Rally, or RN.Following Thursday's decision, the left-wing NFP alliance expressed its anger and vowed to back no-confidence motions against Barnier in the National Assembly."He starts with many strengths. It's up to him to show that he knows how to adapt to the national terrain. He is not a novice," said Pascale Joannin, general manager of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a think tank specializing in European issues, on Friday on the French TV channel France Info.However, as the oldest prime minister in the history of the Fifth Republic, Barnier's challenge will be to remain in office as long as possible and avoid being overthrown. He is expected to win 235 seats with support from Macron's coalition (166 seats), the LR (47 seats) and the centrist LIOT group (22 seats). This total still falls short of the absolute majority of 289 seats required.He faces a difficult path as several MPs from Macron's camp have already set conditions for their support. Agnes Pannier-Runacher, a former minister and MP from Macron's party, warned their MPs would not give the new government "a blank check or censure it in principle", but would be "vigilant about the line that will be taken". She made these comments in an interview with French daily Le Monde published on Friday.Meanwhile, the RN and its allies hold 142 seats and the left-wing NFP alliance has 193 seats. With the left-wing MPs already announcing a censure motion, the abstention of the far right will be essential for Barnier's government to survive.Barnier's appointment has been welcomed by several European leaders due to his previous role as a European Commissioner. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have all expressed their support.Far right reactionMarine Le Pen, a prominent figure in the discussions over the new prime minister, was closely involved in this week's negotiations. "This news was not warmly welcomed by RN supporters," said Christelle Craplet, director of BVA Opinion, on the French Public TV channel Public Senat on Thursday.RN lawmaker Sebastien Chenu told the French private news channel BFM TV on Thursday that the party would wait to hear what Barnier has to say about immigration and reforms to France's voting system.Macron's negotiations with the National Rally have caused unease in his camp. After dissolving parliament following the far right's strong performance in June's European election, Macron has campaigned to prevent extremist parties from gaining power in Paris."The constitution is primarily focused on the prime minister, making the president of the republic more of an arbitrator," explained Bertrand-Leo Combrade, a professor of public law at the University of Poitiers, on Thursday on Public Senat.There is no legal deadline for a new prime minister to form a government. However, the current political context in the Assembly is unstable, with no bloc holding an absolute majority, meaning it could take several days or even weeks for Barnier to establish a coalition government.Time is running out on the parliamentary front. The government must present its budget to the Assembly by Oct 1, when the ordinary parliamentary session resumes, adding urgency to Barnier's task.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily. The Canadian government announced it will refuse applications for low-wage temporary foreign workers in regions with an unemployment rate of 6 percent or higher.The policy, announced on Aug 26, will go into effect on Sept 26.A UN report issued July 22 called the program a "breeding ground for contemporary slavery" and said workers experienced a wide range of abuses because they had insufficient access to legal remedies.Employers will be permitted to hire a maximum of 10 percent of their workforces from the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP), down from 20 percent.The TFWP was designed to help employers fill temporary labor shortages when qualified Canadian citizens or permanent residents aren't available.In 2023, the highest number of work permit holders were from Mexico (45,500), followed by India, with 26,495, according to Canadian government data. There were 2,930 workers from China.Speaking to reporters at the Liberal Party cabinet retreat in Halifax last Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government had relaxed the program's rules to help businesses facing labor shortages recover from the pandemic.But the economic situation is different now, he said, and Canada "no longer needs as many temporary foreign workers''.According to public data from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, there were 135,818 temporary foreign worker permits issued in 2022, up from 84,004 in 2018.Mario Seccareccia, a professor in the economics department at the University of Ottawa, told China Daily: "I would rather describe this as a somewhat hybrid form of indentured labor, where workers are brought over and are taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers by abusing them and not respecting their contractual obligations and not fully paying them."He said that existing regulatory mechanisms didn't protect the workers' rights. The key issue is the power imbalance created by the system, in which foreign workers are tied to a single employer, he said. That creates a dependency that can lead to potential abuse, as workers fear losing their jobs and being forced to return to their home countries if the employer no longer wants them, Seccareccia said."A simple solution is to allow the foreign workers during the period of their work permit in Canada to find another job, for example, in agriculture or the services industry. Removing that bondage to one employer would clearly reduce this abuse," he said.He said the program can easily lead to abuse because it doesn't allow foreign workers to leave abusive employers and to stay in Canada during the full term of their permits.But the federal and provincial governments should have more closely monitored the situation, he said.The UN report called for an end to closed work permit systems and for all workers to be given the right to change employers. The report also emphasized the need for governments to work proactively to inform workers of their rights, rather than deferring to the demands of employers.Mathis Denis, a spokesman for Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, told China Daily: "The health and safety of temporary foreign workers in Canada is paramount. It is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure that employers are complying with the program and to hold those who are not to account.''Denis noted that in the last fiscal year, the government completed 2,122 inspections under the TFWP. During that period, $2.1 million in fines were issued to noncompliant employers for violating program rules, an increase of approximately 36 percent from the prior fiscal year. Twelve employers were banned from the program, compared with the previous fiscal year, when seven were banned.The employment minister's office said that last year, the government conducted a survey of more than 1,600 workers in the TFW program; 76 percent of respondents said they knew about their rights and responsibilities; and 80 percent reported increased knowledge of their rights and the resources and services available to them.gaoyang@chinadailyusa.comBRUSSELS -- August 2024 has tied with August 2023 as the hottest August on record globally, with the average surface air temperature hitting 16.82 degrees Celsius, 0.71 degrees Celsius above the average August temperature from 1991 to 2020, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).The data also showed that August 2024 was 1.51 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels, marking the 13th time in the past 14 months that the global average surface air temperature has surpassed 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a critical threshold set by the Paris Agreement.Meanwhile, year-to-date data indicates 2024 is on course to become the hottest year on record, as the global average temperature for January to August was 0.7 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, the highest on record for this period.C3S stressed that the average temperature anomaly for the remainder of the year would need to drop by at least 0.3 degrees Celsius to avoid surpassing 2023 as the hottest year -- a highly unlikely scenario based on historical data."During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record," said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of C3S.Burgess emphasized that the temperature-related extreme events seen this summer foreshadow more severe and destructive climate impacts unless urgent measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.French state-owned energy company EDF has begun producing energy at the country's first newly-built nuclear power plant in a quarter of a century.On Monday night, the company announced that 12 years behind schedule, the reactor known as Flamanville 3 on the northern coast of Normandy was due to experience its first chain reactions overnight. If the plant, the country's 57th so far, operates as hoped, it could be connected to the national grid by the end of the year.The news will be welcomed by President Emmanuel Macron, who in early 2022 said he wanted to see as many as 14 new reactors built to make the country carbon neutral by 2050 and end its reliance on fossil fuels."What our country needs ... is the rebirth of France's nuclear industry," he said, calling the decision to commit to nuclear power a "choice of progress, a choice of confidence in science and technology".Although Macron won a second term of office as president a few months after making that announcement, he has since lost control of the national assembly, a situation which was not resolved by an election this summer, which could mean that the proposed new projects take even longer to be made reality.Various factors contributed to the delay of the new reactor, including design complexity and a skills shortage caused by a global downturn of the nuclear industry meaning that many specialist workers moved away from the sector, and in addition to the delays, Flamanville ended up costing more than four times its initial budget.Regis Clement, co-head of EDF's nuclear production division, called its belatedly coming into operation "a historic step in this project… our teams are on the starting blocks".The company has also revised its estimate for the country's nuclear power output this year, after faster than expected maintenance work in the absence of significant weather events in the summer.From an initial figure of 315 to 345 terawatt hours, EDF now revised France's nuclear power generation for 2024 to reach somewhere between 340 and 360 TWh.France has been one of Europe's most pro-nuclear energy countries since the early 1970s, when the global oil crisis highlighted the country's dwindling coal supplies and lack of oil or gas reserves.Having developed the nuclear technology, EDF has been keen to export it and already has contracts to build new reactors in England.In the mid-1980s, EDF was a major partner in China's first large-scale nuclear power project and was actively involved in the construction of Daya Bay nuclear power station.The United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom were set to sign the first legally binding international artificial intelligence treaty on Thursday that prioritizes human rights and democracy in regulating both public and private AI systems.The new framework agreed by the Council of Europe binds signatories to collaborative efforts in overseeing AI technologies and safeguarding citizens from their possible abuse.Distinct from the recently enacted EU AI Act, the AI Convention primarily emphasizes safeguarding the human rights of individuals impacted by artificial intelligence systems, reported Reuters.The AI Convention, developed through extensive negotiations among 57 nations over several years and officially adopted in May, aims to address the potential risks associated with AI technologies, while simultaneously promoting responsible innovation across various sectors and applications.In contrast, the EU's AI Act encompasses wide-ranging rules governing the creation, implementation, and application of AI technologies across the EU's internal marketplace.Established in 1949, the Council of Europe is a separate entity from the EU, dedicated to protecting human rights, and comprises 47 member nations, encompassing all 27 EU countries. Although the UK left the EU in 2020, it remains a member of the council, while Australia, the US and Israel are among countries outside the EU invited to sign the AI treaty.Council of Europe Secretary General Marija Pejcinovic Buric said: "We must ensure that the rise of AI upholds our standards, rather than undermining them."The Framework Convention is designed to ensure just that. It is a strong and balanced text — the result of the open and inclusive approach by which it was drafted and which ensured that it benefits from multiple and expert perspectives."Pejcinovic Buric said the convention is an "open treaty with a potentially global reach"."I hope that these will be the first of many signatures and that they will be followed quickly by ratifications, so that the treaty can enter into force as soon as possible," she added.In a news release, the UK government noted that while artificial intelligence promises advantages, such as enhancing productivity and improving cancer diagnosis, this newly established convention incorporates crucial protections against potential drawbacks, including the proliferation of false information and the use of prejudiced data that could lead to biased decision-making."This Convention is a major step to ensuring that these new technologies can be harnessed without eroding our oldest values, like human rights and the rule of law," stated UK Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood. KIEV -- The Ukrainian parliament voted on Thursday to appoint Andrii Sybiha as the country's new foreign minister, replacing Dmytro Kuleba, according to lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko.Sybiha won the support of 258 of 315 lawmakers present, Honcharenko said on Telegram.Earlier in the day, the parliament voted to dismiss Kuleba, who tendered his resignation on Wednesday.Sybiha, 49, previously served as deputy head of the President's Office and became Kuleba's deputy in April.The VI International Municipal Forum of BRICS countries (IMBRICS) has ended in Moscow. The event is included in the calendar of Russia's presidency in the union. TV BRICS International Media Network is a member of the organising committee of the BRICS International Municipal Forum and acted as an international media partner of the event.Over the two days, the participants discussed various aspects of the development of modern cities as well as formats of cooperation between megacities of the BRICS countries and their partners.Alexey Shaposhnikov, Chairman of the Moscow City Duma, noted that the Russian capital plays an active role in the course of Russia's presidency in BRICS."Dozens of international events have already been held, and dozens more are planned. They are aimed at the widest audience and involve the exchange of best practices on key issues of urban and agglomeration development. For residents of many other megacities around the world, our city has also become one of the most popular communication platforms," Alexey Shaposhnikov said.Furthermore, the IMBRICS has become a platform for building real business partnerships between cities. In an exclusive commentary for TV BRICS, Mehdi Chamran, Chairman of the Islamic City Council of Tehran, spoke about the cooperation agreement between the capitals of Russia and Iran."We have concluded a memorandum between the municipalities of Moscow and Tehran. An additional meeting was held to discuss the content of the document. It was a very productive work," said Mehdi Chamran.In his opinion, the IMBRICS and similar events are very much in demand, as they allow the BRICS nations to get closer to each other.At the same time, for other participants at this stage, the forum in Moscow has become a platform for finding partners.Bruno de Queiroz Costa, Head of International Relations of the Executive Office of the State of Rio de Janeiro, in a comment for TV BRICS, noted the value of the Moscow venue in building new ties due to the geographical distance of many BRICS members from each other."The State of Rio de Janeiro is interested in applying the experience of other cities and regions in adapting to climate change and using information technology in state and municipal government," said Bruno de Queiroz Costa.The forum in Moscow attracted not only representatives of the BRICS countries. It was also attended by delegations from states interested in developing economic cooperation with the members of the union.Najiba Djilali, Chairwoman of the People's Assembly of the Algiers Province, told TV BRICS about the development of bilateral ties between the country's capital and BRICS megacities. According to her, Algeria is adopting the best practices of partner cities and is actively developing economic and investment cooperation with them.Humanitarian and inter-parliamentary ties were also in the center of attention of the forum participants. Lev Zakirov, Deputy Chairman of the Chamber of Young Legislators under the Federation Council, informed TV BRICS about the initiative to establish the BRICS+ Youth Assembly."Youth parliamentary diplomacy has great potential for development. This is especially relevant for the period of the Russian Chairmanship. We want to promote a positive image of Russia, including through the establishment of inter-parliamentary ties," said Lev Zakirov.VI International Municipal Forum of the BRICS countries was held from August 27 to 28, 2024. The event was attended by about 700 speakers and 5 thousand delegates from more than 120 countries. More than 50 thousand viewers followed the events of the IMBRICS in the online format.The Forum was supported by the Russian Presidential Administration, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federation Council, and the Roscongress Foundation. The Moscow City Government was the general partner.TV BRICSFrench President Emmanuel Macron has nominated Michel Barnier as France's new prime minister, the Elysee said on Thursday.Macron has tasked Barnier with forming a unified government to serve the country and the French people, the Elysee said in a press release.According to Elysee, Barnier's nomination came after an unprecedented cycle of consultations. Macron ensured that the future government led by Barnier would meet the conditions of being "as stable as possible and give themselves the chance to unite as broadly as possible," the press release added.On July 16, Macron accepted Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's resignation but asked him to remain in charge of a caretaker government until a new cabinet is formed.In the two rounds of legislative elections held on June 30 and July 7, Macron's centrist coalition finished second with 163 seats, trailing the left-wing parties' alliance, the New Popular Front (NFP). The NFP secured a relative majority with 182 seats in the 577-member National Assembly.Macron's nomination of Barnier from the right-wing party The Republicans (LR) was criticized by the left-wing parties, who expected an NFP candidate in line with the election results.Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of the far-left party La France Insoumise (LFI), said that the nomination shows Macron has decided to "officially deny" the results of the snap legislative elections. The prime minister should come from the NFP alliance, he added.Meanwhile, the First Secretary of the Socialist Party Olivier Faure said that Barnier's nomination brings "democratic denial to its peak," emphasizing that the LR only came fourth in the legislative elections.As a pro-European politician, Barnier's nomination has not met with opposition from the French far-right party National Rally (RN).The RN's ex-President Marine Le Pen said on her X account that she and her party members would be "attentive" to the project that the new prime minister would implement.Along with Le Pen, the current RN President Jordan Bardella said that the new prime minister should "respect" the 11 million voters who chose the RN in the legislative elections."We reserve all political means of action," Bardella said on his X account, urging Barnier to address issues such as purchasing power, security, and immigration.Former French President Francois Hollande, who is now a Socialist Party deputy, said on X platform that the RN has given a form of "approval" for Barnier's nomination.Born in 1951, Michel Barnier was elected to the French National Assembly in 1978, becoming the youngest deputy at that time in France. Elected as president of the departmental council of Savoie, he led the city of Albertville to win the hosting of the 1992 Winter Olympic Games.During his political career, he has served as French environment minister, minister delegate for Europe, foreign affairs minister, and agriculture minister. He also served as the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator.Barnier's first urgent mission is to form a government capable of completing a draft budget for 2025 before Oct 1 and submit it for voting in a National Assembly that has so far been hostile towards the right-wing prime minister.The handover ceremony for the Fifth Republic's youngest Prime Minister Attal, to its oldest Prime Minister Barnier, is scheduled for 6 pm local time (16h00 GMT). BERLIN -- An armed man was shot dead by police near the Israeli Consulate General in central Munich, Germany, local police confirmed on Thursday.Police said in a statement on social media platform X that the individual was deemed "suspicious" and was involved in an exchange of fire with the police.Authorities have not yet clarified the identity of the man.According to local media, the incident occurred after officers saw a man "apparently carrying a firearm" near Karolinenplatz in the city center. Police have confirmed that no other suspects are involved and that the area was cordoned off as a precaution. No other injuries have been reported so far.German Press Agency DPA said that Interior Minister Nancy Faeser described the shooting as a "serious incident."The shooting took place on the anniversary of the 1972 Munich Olympics terrorist attack, in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed.BERLIN - Germany's migration commissioner proposed deporting to Rwanda migrants who arrive illegally to the European Union through its borders with Belarus, as Berlin contemplates measures to restrict refugees arriving in the bloc.The proposal comes amid rising pressure on Germany's ruling coalition government to restrict irregular migration following a fatal stabbing linked to Islamic State at a city festival last month that fuelled far-right opposition and criticism of Berlin's migration policies.Joachim Stamp, Germany's Special Representative for Migration Agreements, said the EU could utilize existing asylum facilities in Rwanda, which were initially intended for Britain's 2022 plan to send unauthorized migrants to the East African nation. The British plan was scrapped by Keir Starmer's new government in July.Under Stamp's proposal, the asylum procedures in Rwanda would be conducted under the supervision of the United Nations."We currently have no third country that has come forward, with the exception of Rwanda," Stamp said in a podcast by Table Media published on Thursday.Stamp, a member of the junior coalition FDP party and whose position sits in Germany's Interior Ministry, said this model would specifically target refugees crossing the EU's eastern borders."My suggestion would be that we concentrate on this group. It's about 10,000 people a year," he said, dismissing broader proposals from the conservative opposition to apply such a model to all refugees.He said Rwanda has publicly expressed its willingness to continue implementing this model.In addition, Stamp suggested removing the so-called "connecting element" in the new Common European Asylum System (CEAS), which currently requires external asylum procedures to be conducted in countries where the asylum seeker has a social connection.The European Union agreed in December on new rules to handle irregular arrivals of asylum seekers and migrants, a deal hailed as a breakthrough after almost a decade of bitter feuds on the issue. It could take until the end of 2025 for the pact to take full effect.ReutersExperts said China's efforts in promoting high-quality economic development and fostering new quality productive forces could further boost the nation's green transition.Their comments came after the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China which concluded in July. The plenum's resolution described high-quality development as a "primary task "in building China into a modern socialist country in all respects, and identified fostering new quality productive forces as one of the key guidelines in achieving the goal.Some detailed measures in the resolution include further developing new energy sectors soundly and orderly; encouraging companies to apply digital, intelligent, and green technologies to transform traditional industries; and imposing tighter institutional constraints for environmental protection, among others.Following the closing of the plenum, China has also introduced a series of policies to accelerate the green transition, including the establishment of a dual control system that now prioritizes carbon emission reductions over the previous focus on energy consumption intensity and total energy consumption.Muyi Yang, senior electricity policy analyst for China at Ember, an energy think tank headquartered in the United Kingdom, praised this trajectory for being "sustainable"."By focusing on high-quality development, China aims to build an economy that is not only larger but also more sophisticated, efficient, and adaptable to future challenges, including climate change. This philosophy emphasizes the need to upgrade industries, foster technological innovation, and enhance productivity while minimizing environmental impact, thereby ensuring long-term prosperity and social well-being," he said.Belinda Schaepe, China policy analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, which is based in Helsinki, Finland, noted that China's continuous push for its new development path has already led to a boom in clean technologies."Clean energy was already the top driver of China's economic growth in 2023, contributing 40 percent of the GDP expansion," she said, quoting a research paper published by the center in January this year. "The heightened focus by the Chinese government on fostering new quality productive forces, including green technologies, will likely further drive production in this sector."She said the growing volumes of affordable clean products in China could also help the global energy transition and the supply chains that need to be expanded worldwide."China's investment and production of green technologies were key drivers in bringing down international prices, accelerating the uptake worldwide," Schaepe said. "Chinese companies are already setting up new production facilities in other countries. They can contribute to diversifying supply chains and offering technology transfer, particularly with countries in the Global South."Sustained focusMeanwhile, China's sustained focus on green transformation has also driven some traditional energy-intensive industries to become cleaner, both experts pointed out.Yang found out that both China's central and local state-owned enterprises in the electricity sector, while owning the majority of coal power assets in the country, have actively diversified into renewable energy, which significantly contributed to controlling the emissions by limiting coal consumption increase.The steel sector saw no new permits for coal-based steel plants in the first half of 2024, signaling a shift toward cleaner production methods such as electric arc furnaces, Schaepe said."The record expansion of renewables capacity, coupled with saturation in the real estate sector and emission reductions from heavy industry, signals that China may already have seen a carbon emissions peak in 2023," she said.Despite that, China's path to carbon neutrality can still be "long and winding", she admitted.Schaepe called for ambitious, staged carbon reduction targets leading from peak to carbon neutrality, a clearer coal phase-down plan, and stronger support for grid flexibility and power market reform to integrate renewables.Yang expressed hope that policy support for clean industries would remain on course, emphasizing the need for continued investment in research and development, creating new supply chains to deliver essential materials and components, and cultivating a new generation of skilled workers to support a decarbonized economy.A 17-year-old who allegedly stabbed his parents and 12-year-old brother to death on Sunday after feeling "extraneous" and wanting to break "free" is in custody in the Italian city of Milan.The triple killing, which the youth is thought to have carried out after obsessively listening to the melancholic Beatles ballad The Long and Winding Road, has shocked the nation and led to claims that the tragedy is a symptom of the changing role of the family in modern Italy.Police say the suspect planned the attacks in advance and carried them out after the family had celebrated the father's 51st birthday at their home in Paderno Dugnano, near Milan.Investigators said the suspect, who they are calling Riccardo, was from an apparently stable family and had not shown signs of distress or mental illness before the incident, prompting massive speculation in Italy about how such a thing could happen.A school friend told the Italian daily newspaper Corriere della Sera that Riccardo was a kind boy from a "very normal" family.Police believe he waited until everyone was asleep before starting his assault.Local media reported that the boy has since confessed to the killings, and said he carried them out because he wanted to be "free".Reports said the boy told officers: "I thought one stab would be enough to kill, then I realized it wasn't like that."Luigi Ruzza, a spokesman for the local police department, said Riccardo was waiting for officers outside his home following the incident, after telephoning police to report the crime.Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni described the killings as "beyond imagination", while Matteo Lancini, a psychologist, was quoted by The Times newspaper as saying: "Italian parents are asking the question: 'What if it happens to us?'"Meloni offered one theory as to why Riccardo carried out the killings, saying: "I don't think we have understood what is happening to new generations", with issues created by isolation experienced during the novel coronavirus pandemic lockdown combining with "digital dependency".The Italian news agency ANSA said the boy told police on Tuesday he had planned the attack but never thought he would go through with it."I experienced this unease, this existential angst but I never thought I would go as far as killing anyone, I can't explain what happened that night, unfortunately it did," ANSA quoted him as saying.The youth, who is being detained in Milan's Beccaria juvenile prison, met his lawyer, Amedeo Rizza, on Tuesday, who later described him as deeply affected by what he had done."He is becoming aware of what he has done, even if he can't explain it," Rizza told reporters.Edouard Philippe, a prominent centrist figure and former prime minister of France under President Emmanuel Macron, has declared his intention to run in the country's 2027 presidential race.Since stepping down from his role as Macron's first prime minister in 2020, Philippe has maintained his popularity among the French public, having established Horizons, a new center-right political party of his own."I will be a candidate in the next presidential election," Philippe told news magazine Le Point. "I'm preparing to propose things to the French. What I propose will be massive. The French will decide."Philippe's announcement has added another layer of complexity to France's already turbulent political landscape, which was recently shaken by unexpected parliamentary elections called by Macron.The president's attempt to strengthen his party's position through the early elections in July failed to yield the desired results, leaving him in a precarious situation.Macron's centrist bloc is now sandwiched between a dominant left-wing alliance and the far right in a fragmented National Assembly, complicating his search for a new prime minister.Amid ongoing negotiations to resolve the political gridlock, Philippe has officially announced his long-anticipated bid to replace Macron, who is ineligible for a third term in the 2027 presidential race due to constitutional term limits.In his interview, Philippe expressed his commitment to his presidential ambitions, emphasizing his readiness to pursue the office regardless of potential political upheavals."It's often said that in a presidential election, you have to want nothing else. I agree," he said.Philippe also emphasized he is prepared to be president in the unlikely event Macron surprised the country again by announcing his resignation.Macron is attempting to reinvigorate discussions about forming a new French government. This effort comes in the wake of the leftist alliance's refusal to participate after Macron declined their proposed candidate for prime minister.In response to the deadlock, Macron has widened his approach, stating on Tuesday that he is engaging with "anyone who wants to come and work for the overriding national interest".The statement follows a series of unsuccessful negotiations held during the weekend and into Monday, which failed to yield any significant progress in resolving the political impasse.Regarding the political negotiations, Philippe conveyed a willingness to back a broad spectrum of potential prime minister candidates in the interest of forming a functional government.He stated his support for "any prime minister picked from a political space ranging from the conservative right to social-democracy"."All governing parties should have as their main objective the stabilization of political life," he added.In a pointed message to the conservative Les Republicains party, Philippe said: "The right must become engaged. By refusing to participate in this central bloc, it is pushing everything to the left." French officials have confirmed a pregnant woman and six children were among 12 people who died on Tuesday attempting to cross the English Channel.A boat carrying migrants from Cap Gris-Nez in France, around 34 kilometers from the English port of Dover, "ripped open" according to French coastguards. More than 60 people were rescued, but 12 were confirmed dead and others remain unaccounted for.France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin called it a "terrible shipwreck", adding the "provisional toll stands at 12 dead, two missing and several injured … all government services are mobilized to find the missing and take care of the victims".It is believed that those on board were mainly from Eritrea, with a large number of them women.The issue of boatloads of migrants trying to cross the English Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, from mainland Europe to the United Kingdom, often in dangerously ill-equipped or overloaded boats, has become a major humanitarian and political concern on both sides.Since its exit from the European Union, the UK has no facility to send people who make the crossing back to the continent, which has led to a huge rise in the number of people willing to take the risk, and also provoked an often angry political debate.The recently-elected UK government promised to adopt a new strategy toward the problem, targeting the organized groups who send people across.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the latest incident was "horrifying and deeply tragic", and added that there must be "vital" efforts made soon to dismantle "dangerous and criminal smuggler gangs".According to the BBC's Paris correspondent Andrew Harding, there is a perception in France that the issue is mainly a problem of Britain's making.When Darmanin spoke in the aftermath of the latest tragedy, he talked about "what he views as Britain's loosely regulated job market, that acts like a magnet, drawing young Eritreans, determined Sudanese, Afghans, Syrians and Iraqis to this (French) coastline, convinced that they if they can just make it across this last, short stretch of water — or even half way across — they'll end up in a country where they can find work, even without the right paperwork".The International Organization for Migration keeps records of fatalities among people crossing the English Channel as part of its Missing Migrant Project. It estimates that so far this year, 226 people, including 35 children, have died or are missing after attempting the crossing.Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, called the toll "shockingly high" and repeated calls for the government to open up more safe and legal routes for asylum seekers, so they do not need to take such perilous risks, rather than just impose tougher penalties."Enforcement alone is not the solution," he said. "This devastating trend shows the urgent need for a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach to reduce dangerous crossings."julian@mail.chinadailyuk.comBERLIN -- The first complete German version of the first volume of the Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica) has been published in Germany recently.A herbology and nature masterpiece, the Bencao Gangmu compiled by Li Shizhen in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) was the first book in the world that scientifically categorized medicinal herbs. It was a pioneering work that advanced traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pharmaceutical theory.The publication of the book has filled a gap in the knowledge of German students of traditional Chinese medicine and has further promoted cultural exchanges between China and Germany.The Bencao Gangmu has been translated into multiple language versions.Chinese scholar Zhou Hengxiang said that the book introduces the basic theory of TCM and other TCM classics and figures mentioned in the first volume of Bencao Gangmu are also introduced in the form of appendix. HELSINKI -- Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom is leaving office and parliament, according to Swedish media reports on Wednesday.Newspaper Dagens Nyheter and Swedish Television News have quoted Billstrom saying in the social media service X that he would be leaving the cabinet when Swedish parliament opens next Tuesday. He would also leave his parliamentary seat.Moderate conservative MP Billstrom has held the foreign minister portfolio since 2022. He said he has informed the prime minister about the decision he had been considered for some time.He wrote in X that he is leaving the political life with a mixture of sadness and pride. He said he would be pulling out politics altogether.The worlds of dance and martial arts may not have the most obvious crossover, but lovers of both art forms will head to Sadler's Wells dance theater in north London this week to see the Shenzhen Opera and Dance Theater put on a show combining them to spectacular effect, Wing Chun.The show's two-stranded storyline tells the tale of legendary martial arts master Ip Man, who has also inspired a film being made about his life.There are set to be 12 performances in London, running until Sept 7, and then in October the company will perform four shows in Paris.Wing Chun made its domestic debut in December 2022, before its first overseas visit to Singapore in September 2023 and its 200th performance will take place during the London run.Before the London premiere on Friday, China's Ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Zeguang praised the show and its cast for increasing cultural understanding."I am sure (the performances) will help the UK audience better understand both Chinese martial arts and the philosophy and value championed by the practitioners," he said, while also praising Shenzhen for its growing role as a cultural hub. "Shenzhen is at the forefront of China's reform and opening-up and technological innovation. Nowadays, the city is also building itself into a leader of culture."Zheng highlighted the city's role by mentioning how the Shenzhen Symphony Orchestra had toured the UK this year and also highlighted a recent visit to the city by the United Kingdom's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Zeng Xianglai, executive vice-president of the Shenzhen International Cultural Exchange Association, also praised the show as a cultural ambassador for the region and a traditional product showcased within it."Wing Chun showcases the allure of exquisite traditional Chinese culture through the harmonious fusion of two Chinese intangible cultural heritages: Wing Chun and gambiered Guangdong gauze," he said. "This innovative fusion not only bridges ancient Chinese kung fu and contemporary dance but also promotes mutual exchange, learning and communication, transcending cultural boundaries."Positive reviewsThe show has been well received, with The Guardian newspaper praising its "smart staging, sleek designs, awesome revolving sets, tricks of the light, a pulse-quickening soundtrack, uplifting storytainment, and above all, exceptional dance, acrobatics and martial arts".At a public question and answer session, the show's creative team and performers gave some insight into the lengths they went to put it together."The biggest challenge was combining martial arts with dance," said Zhou Liya, who for the sixth time shares a joint choreography credit with collaborator Han Zhen. "Most dancers have foundation-level knowledge of martial arts, but that's not enough for a production like this, so they spent over a year learning different martial arts styles from the masters, so they were familiar with what was required."In the main role of Ip Man, dancer Chang Hongji is the central character in a uniformly top-class cast, and he revealed the extreme level of study that went into the demanding role."I spent a lot of time researching my character and my moves, so when it looks like we are taking hard falls, we don't get injured. We spent many hours finding the right level of force to make the required impact without hurting ourselves," he said.With a castmate, he gave audience members a close-up view of the intricate moves used in fight scenes, which require hundreds of repetitions to look authentic.julian@mail.chinadailyuk.comUnited States-based technology company Hewlett Packard Enterprises, also known as HPE, has confirmed it plans to continue legal action against the estate of British entrepreneur Mike Lynch, despite his death in a yachting accident last month.Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter, and five others died after his boat, the Bayesian, went down in freak nighttime weather conditions off the coast of Sicily.Investigations remain at an early stage, but local prosecutors have said that potentially, charges including manslaughter could be brought.In June, Lynch, who was a scientific advisor to former United Kingdom prime minister David Cameron and who was described as "a titanic figure in the British tech industry" and an artificial intelligence pioneer, was cleared of fraud charges over the $11 billion sale of his software company Autonomy to HPE in 2011.Reuters reported that shortly after the purchase was completed, a major internal accounting scandal was uncovered, and in 2022, HPE won a civil case against Lynch related to it.When Lynch was cleared of the charges in June, he said: "I am elated with today's verdict and grateful to the jury for their attention to the facts over the last 10 weeks."I am looking forward to returning to the United Kingdom and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field."HPE has declined to discuss its plans in detail, other than to issue a statement saying: "In 2022, an English high court judge ruled that HPE had substantially succeeded in its civil fraud claims against Dr Lynch and Mr (former company finance chief Sushovan) Hussain."A damages hearing was held in February 2024 and the judge's decision regarding damages due to HPE will arrive in due course. It is HPE's intention to follow the proceedings through to their conclusion."It is understood Lynch's yachting trip was a thank you to friends who had stood by him during the trial, with some of them believed to have been on board when the yacht went down.Chris Morvillo, a lawyer at Clifford Chance, the firm that represented Lynch in his trial, was among the dead, as was his wife Neda Morvillo, and another senior partner from the company was rescued as the boat sank.Jonathan Bloomer, the chairman of Morgan Stanley International bank, who was a defense witness in the trial, also died, along with his wife Judy.In an interview he gave to The Times newspaper shortly after his acquittal and weeks before his death, Lynch said how the court's decision had given him "a second life: the question is: what do you want to do with it?".By coincidence, Lynch's boat sank two days after Stephen Chamberlain, the Autonomy finance executive who was his co-defendant in the trial, also died, after being hit by a car while out jogging near his home in England.Automaker Volkswagen, or VW, which sells vehicles under the Audi, Bentley, Cupra, Jetta, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, Skoda, and Volkswagen brands, has put shrinking sales in China among the reasons it is considering closing factories in Germany.The 87-year-old German giant has seen its market share contract in China as rival car companies have taken bites out of its previously dominant position, prompting Oliver Blume, its chief executive officer, to warn this week that his company is now mulling something that was previously thought impossible."The economic environment became even tougher, and new competitors are entering the European market. In this environment, we as a company must now act decisively," Blume said in a statement.He added that "Germany in particular as a manufacturing location is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness" with rivals, especially electric vehicle makers from China, able to undercut its performance.Describing the European automotive industry as being in a "very… serious situation", Blume said the company's plan to save 10 billion euros ($11.03 billion) of costs by 2026 was already several billion euros behind target.VW has been attempting to bring down costs by reducing the size of its workforce through offers of early retirement and voluntary redundancy packages. But the company said relying on not replacing retiring workers will be "insufficient to achieve the urgently needed structural adjustments for greater competitiveness in the short term "and that it is now expecting to make compulsory job cuts, something it had previously said would not happen before 2029.VW also said its financial situation means "even plant closures at vehicle production and component sites can no longer be ruled out".The German state of Lower Saxony, where VW is headquartered, owns 20 percent of the company and has traditionally blocked proposed job cuts, but even it admitted on Monday layoffs now appear inevitable.Stephan Weil, the prime minister of Lower Saxony, said it was "undisputed that VW needs to take action", although he said the state government will fight hard to avoid factory closures."We expect that (closures) will simply not happen," he said, promising the state government will "pay particular attention to this".VW, which employs around 600,000 people worldwide of which 300,000 are in Germany, has been especially disappointed with lower than expected demand for its electric vehicles.The Guardian newspaper said the company is considering closing two German factories, and that its works council, which represents employees, has been informed.The company said in July it was considering closing an Audi factory in Belgium, which would be the group's first global factory closure for 40 years.VW's difficulties come as Germany's economy has been teetering on the edge of a technical recession for around two years.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who will start her second five-year term, was dealt a heavy blow when most of the 27 member states of the European Union defied her instruction to nominate two candidates — a woman and a man — in order to form a gender balanced leadership.Bulgaria is the only member state which nominated a woman and a man as instructed, while 17 states have submitted a male candidate only. Nine countries — Belgium, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden — nominated a woman only. Von der Leyen herself represents Germany, while Kaja Kallas, the former Estonian prime minister, will become the bloc's foreign policy chief.The nominating by Belgium of its federal minister for foreign affairs and trade, Hadja Lahbib, announced on Monday, and Romania's swap on Monday of Roxana Minzatu, an MEP and former minister of European Funds, to replace MEP Victor Negrescu, a male candidate submitted earlier, have made the situation slightly better.Von der Leyen earned big applause in 2019 by forming a commission with 13 women including herself and 14 men. It was the most gender balanced commission in the EU's history. She was also the first woman to become the commission president.Interviews and hearingsIn the coming weeks, von der Leyen will start to interview those candidates and assign them various policy portfolios. After that, the European Parliament will hold hearings for the candidates. It has been the case in the past that a few candidates will fail to win approval.News media reported that von der Leyen is still trying to pressure member states which nominated male candidates to make the switch like Romania.European Commission deputy chief spokesperson Arianna Podesta told a news conference on Monday that von der Leyen "has been very clear in what her ambition is, which is a gender balance college".Outgoing European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, from Denmark, vented her outrage on Monday at the gender imbalance."Unfortunately it's a demasking of the lack of efforts when it comes to equal opportunities and gender balance," she told the press.Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU Law at HEC Paris, a business school, said on X that "the next European Commission could be the most gender-imbalanced in two decades".Augmented reality displays blend onscreen images and data with the real world and the technology has the potential to make driving much safer, with holograms on windscreens that can highlight hazards and additional environmental context for journeys likely in the near future.Head-up displays, or HUDs, are augmented reality displays that can be fitted to cars and work similarly to virtual reality headsets, except they provide visual feedback for the real world instead.Two dimensional HUDs are actually established technology that have been commonly used in aerospace and the military since as early as the 1980s. Three dimensional holographic versions however, provide a stronger more visible physical presence, which can integrate with the depth of field view of the driver.The human brain is not designed for prolonged attention to detail. The mind fatigues, and distractions become more commonplace and intense the longer time passes. When this happens, a driver can lose awareness of the road and react too slowly to upcoming hazards. HUDs can help highlight sudden changes in road conditions or preempt them.The technology would solve a major issue in road safety psychology called the "look but fail to see phenomenon". This is when a user does not register something right in front of their eyes. Having a secondary display system highlights problems, making them harder to miss. Studies show that visual cues draw human attention to details in situations extremely effectively, saving mental energy on prolonged trips.Able to assist with navigation, performance, and hazards, the promise of efficient and distraction-free driving is attractive to the consumer car industry, which has been silently developing the technology for many years.Miniature lasers powered by a graphics card processing chip produce 3D holograms that are powerful enough to create visible images, even when bathed in intense sunlight.Such advancements may also make driving more accessible to those with poorer vision. Current driving tests universally rely upon strict eyesight requirements. It is hoped that HUDs may increase accessibility for the differently abled or the elderly in the near future.Naturally, each brand or model of car will vary in the type of displays they choose to utilize and the type of holographic images on show. Sports vehicles could prioritize velocity and physics of the ride, perhaps showing the G force the driver is sustaining under each turn. Urban drivers on the other hand may prefer displays that warn about pedestrians ahead or potholes in the road. Whatever the requirements of the driver, an increased offering of visual information and context could allow them to stay alert.A key contemporary issue in a future that could include self-driving vehicles will be how best to balance road safety with a driver's desire to relax on a trip, while still remaining fully aware of hazards and taking action when necessary. Here, HUDs could also come into play, popping up with attention-grabbing colors and symbols to warn drivers, even while they are relaxing. Much like the way in which inflight entertainment halts when instructions are given for passengers to fasten their seat belts or prepare for landing, it is hoped HUDs will be able to alert drivers in the future by cutting into their relaxation.It is important however that they will be designed in a way that notifies people at critical times without causing alarm or confusion.Augmented reality displays are likely to become a mainstream optional consumer choice in the near future. Customers may opt to have the feature built into new car models, and also purchase HUDs as installable separate add-on extras. This element of choice is equally as important when it comes to customizing HUDs to fit driver requirements. Warning messages are of course a mandatory component of the HUD experience, however extras such as telephone call information and music choices must be carefully managed by drivers and offered with caution by the manufacturer to prevent further distractions.Barry He is a London-based columnist for China Daily.The United Kingdom government has announced it will suspend some arms export licenses to Israel due to humanitarian law concerns, a move Israel has criticized as rewarding Hamas.Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated it will not be a full arms embargo, but affect around 30 of 350 existing licenses following a two-month review.The decision stems from concerns about the treatment of Palestinian detainees and restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza, amid ongoing conflict in the region.Lammy said the review, commissioned immediately after the Labour Party's landslide election victory in July, found a "clear risk" the arms might be used to commit "a serious violation of international humanitarian law".In his statement to the House of Commons on Monday, Lammy emphasized the government's legal duty to review arms export licenses amid the Gaza conflict.He clarified this was a suspension of 30 licenses for components of military aircraft, helicopters, and drones. Lammy noted that the review conducted by the UK government could not "arbitrate on whether or not Israel has breached international humanitarian law" in Gaza."This is a forward-looking evaluation, not a determination of innocence or guilt, and it does not prejudge any future determinations by the competent courts," he said.The suspension excludes components for multinational F-35 fighter jets, raising concerns among opposition politicians and human rights organizations, reported Sky News.He said: "It is with regret that I inform the House today the assessment I have received leaves me unable to conclude anything other than that for certain UK arms exports to Israel, there does exist a clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law."Lammy added that the decision remains under review, and affirmed that "the UK continues to support Israel's right to self-defense in accordance with international law".Some opposition Conservative Party lawmakers accused the government of having made the decision in response to demands from pro-Palestinian activists, reported the Telegraph newspaper.Andrew Mitchell, the shadow foreign secretary, claimed the move had "all the appearance of something designed to satisfy Labour's backbenchers, while at the same time not offending Israel, an ally in the Middle East. I fear it will fail on both counts".Conservative Party leadership candidate Robert Jenrick called it "shameful gesture politics to appease the hard left".Jewish community leaders in the UK expressed strong opposition to the government's decision.The Jewish Leadership Council stated Lammy's decision "could place in jeopardy the long-standing defense and intelligence partnership between the UK and Israel, which is key to the UK's own security".A senior Israeli official told the Telegraph the UK decision was a "reward for Hamas". Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also criticized the UK's decision.An estimated 350,000 Israelis protested in Tel Aviv on Sunday after it became known that Hamas had executed six hostages. The protestors blamed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for rejecting potential deals that could have saved the hostages.As the spotlight shifted from the Olympic Games to the Paralympic events in Paris, the stories of Chinese volunteers who made their mark during the Games are emerging as a testament to international camaraderie and cultural exchange. Among them, Zheng Jiaxin and Liu Xinyi stand out for their dedication and the unique perspectives they brought to the grand event.With a remarkable 45,000 volunteers contributing to the Paris 2024 Games, Zheng, a 29-year-old Chinese expatriate who works at the Postal Bank in France, took two weeks off to volunteer during the Paris 2024 Olympics.Having lived in Paris for seven years after moving from China to study big data and finance, Zheng found volunteering at the Olympics a deeply personal and meaningful endeavor."Volunteering for the Paris Olympics was a way for me to give back to the city that has welcomed me with open arms," she said. "It was also an opportunity to celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and France."Zheng's role was crucial in helping manage the influx of spectators and ensuring a smooth experience for everyone involved. Her decision to dedicate part of her annual leave to volunteer highlighted her commitment."Even though I sacrificed 10 days of my vacation time, it was worth every moment," she said. "I wanted to repay the kindness I received when I first arrived in Paris. It felt like a way to contribute to a major event in the city I now call my second home."For Zheng, the Olympics were more than just a series of events, they were a symbol of global unity and cultural exchange."We came together with a shared purpose — to showcase the friendly and united spirit of Chinese volunteers," she said. "Being a part of this global celebration and helping others was incredibly fulfilling. It was a chance to promote not only my own culture but also the values of cooperation and respect."Zheng's sentiments were echoed by Liu Xinyi, a 25-year-old master's degree student in sociology at Sciences Po Paris, who contributed as a volunteer at the Paris Media Center during the Games.Liu, who arrived in Paris in August 2021, had been inspired by the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a child."I grew up in Beijing and the 2008 Beijing Olympics left a deep impression on me when I was 9 years old. It was the first time I encountered other cultures and foreigners and the first time I was involved in an international event. I remember the openness and inclusiveness of Beijing during that time, so I truly cherish this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," she said.At the Paris Media Center, Liu's role involved assisting journalists from around the world and ensuring they had a smooth experience covering the Olympics."I was responsible for greeting journalists, helping them navigate the center, and coordinating events," she explained. "The opportunity to use my multilingual skills and interact with media professionals was incredibly rewarding. It also allowed me to see the inner workings of international media coverage up close."Liu's work came with its challenges, including early mornings and a demanding schedule."Waking up at 6 am every day was tough," she admitted. "But the chance to attend news conferences and meet renowned figures, like French historian Patrick Boucheron, made it all worthwhile. The most valuable lesson I gained from being part of the Olympics and Paralympics volunteer team was the importance of maintaining curiosity and showing respect and enthusiasm for other cultures. This diversity greatly aided us in providing tailored services to journalists from different countries."As the Paralympics began, the stories of Zheng and Liu highlighted the significant impact volunteers have had on the Paris 2024 Games. Their contributions embody a broader spirit of international collaboration and mutual respect, reflecting the values that the Olympics and Paralympics aim to promote.For both, the memories of their volunteer work will remain a cherished part of their time in Paris and a symbol of their commitment to fostering international understanding.Germany's far right has achieved its most significant regional electoral triumph since World War II, as the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party won a major victory in the eastern state of Thuringia, a result it has hailed as a "historic success".The victory on Sunday for the anti-immigrant AfD represents a setback for Germany's political center, particularly for Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling coalition of three parties, which suffered losses in the vote."The results for the AfD in Saxony and Thuringia are worrying," Scholz said in a statement to Reuters."Our country cannot and must not get used to this. The AfD is damaging Germany. It is weakening the economy, dividing society and ruining our country's reputation."The AfD, founded in 2013, won 32.8 percent of the vote in Thuringia, outperforming the mainstream center-right Christian Democratic Union, which secured 23.6 percent.In the neighboring state of Saxony, the AfD finished a close second, by just half a percentage point, to the Christian Democratic Union, which leads the national opposition.A new populist-left party, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, secured third position in both states.Dealing a blow to ScholzThe far right's success deals a blow to Scholz's coalition just a year before the federal election, with his Social Democratic Party and coalition partners, the Greens and liberal Free Democrats, all performing poorly in Sunday's vote.Despite the AfD achieving a historic first by becoming the strongest party in a state election, it is almost certain to be excluded from power as all other rival parties have so far ruled out any direct cooperation with it, Deutsche Welle reported.The AfD is led in Thuringia by Bjorn Hocke, regarded as one of the party's most extreme figures.Hocke has faced legal consequences twice this year alone for employing prohibited Nazi slogans during his campaign events and is known for his frequent use of Nazilike rhetoric.Speaking after the vote, Hocke said he felt "a great, great deal of pride" and told public broadcaster ARD that his party would analyze the results before approaching potential coalition partners.When questioned about his party's classification as extremist, he said: "Please stop stigmatizing me. We are the number one party in Thuringia ...You don't want to classify one-third of the voters in Thuringia as right-wing extremists."The AfD, campaigning on a central demand for drastic changes in immigration policy, ran on a platform calling for the mass deportation of refugees from Germany.Tourists visiting Italy could soon be paying taxes of up to 25 euros ($27.70) a night after the government said it wants to discourage over-tourism while allowing cash-strapped municipalities to raise extra cash.Many Italian cities already collect taxes of up to a maximum of 5 euros on overnight stays, but the government is considering changing those patchwork taxes into a blanket tax based on the cost of the hotel room the tourist is using, with the most expensive rooms qualifying for the highest level of the new tax.The proposal calls for local governments to collect the money, which they could then use for local services, such as garbage collection.Marina Lalli, from Federturismo, an advocacy organization for tourism companies, told the Financial Times newspaper municipalities are currently supposed to spend taxes collected from tourists on products and services that support the tourism industry. But she said many local governments are actually spending the money on everyday services that should be funded by the Italian taxpayer, and that the proposed change would formalize that situation."When you go and fix your streets that are full of holes — and you pay with money you collect from tourist tax — is this really for tourists, or is this a normal, ordinary thing that you should do in your city?" she told the paper.The proposed change to the tourism tax is being championed by Daniela Santanche, Italy's tourism minister, who wrote on the X social media platform that it would be a win-win situation because it would generate income for cash-strapped cities and municipalities while also reducing visitor numbers and taking pressure of overcrowded tourism sites."In times of over-tourism, we are debating this so that it really helps improve services and make tourists who pay it more responsible," wrote Santanche.The proposed tax would start at 5 euros a night for economy rooms priced at 100 euros or less. Regular rooms rented out for between 100 euros and 400 euros a night would elicit a 10 euro a night tax. And high-end rooms billed out for between 400 euros a night and 750 euros would be taxed at the rate of 15 euros a night. Luxury rooms charged at more than 750 euros a night would be taxed at 25 euros a night.The problem of over-tourism has been widely debated across Europe in recent months, with the Italian city of Venice introducing a 5 euro admission charge for visitors, the English city of Cambridge considering limiting the size and number of tourism groups, and the Spanish city of Barcelona mulling a prohibition on apartments being rented out to non-locals.The issue has also prompted anti-tourist protests in tourism hotspots across Europe, including in the Netherlands, Greece, and Spain.earle@mail.chinadailyuk.com BERLIN -- German automotive giant Volkswagen is considering closing its production plants in Germany to cope with rising costs, said the company on Monday.Vehicle plant and component factory closures can no longer be ruled out in the current situation, barring rapid countermeasures, German Press Agency quoted the carmaker as saying.Alongside these potential closures, the company has also hinted at possible layoffs. Volkswagen said it had to cancel a long-standing agreement with labor unions in Germany, which has been in place since 1994 and aimed to prevent compulsory redundancies until 2029. The step has not yet been agreed with the employee side. BRUSSELS -- Belgium's King Philippe has reappointed Bart De Wever, leader of the Flemish nationalist N-VA party, to lead talks on the formation of a new government.The Royal Palace announced the decision on Monday after King Philippe met with royal mediator Maxime Prevot, who has been mediating since Aug 23.Prevot, leader of Les Engages party, has reported that the five involved parties -- the French-speaking Reformist Movement (MR), Les Engages, the N-VA, the Flemish Christian Democrats (CD&V), and Vooruit -- are now ready to resume negotiations.De Wever is now tasked with restarting coalition talks as soon as possible.De Wever resigned on Aug 22 due to major disagreements, which had arisen over a proposed capital gains tax aimed at raising 500 million euros ($553 million) annually.The worlds of dance and martial arts may not have the most obvious crossover but lovers of both art forms will head to Sadler's Wells dance theater in north London this week to see the Shenzhen Opera and Dance Theater company put on a show combining them to spectacular effect, Wing Chun.The show's two-stranded storyline tells the tale of legendary martial arts master Yip Man, and also a film being made about his life.The first half is mainly dance, with brief flashes of martial arts, which take center stage in the second half, showcasing the skills of China's unique cultural calling card that is so instantly recognized and widely admired around the world.There are also passing references to the enduring influence of kung fu on popular culture in movies such as The Matrix.There are set to be 12 performances in London, running until Sept 7, and then in October the company will perform four shows in Paris.Wing Chun made its domestic debut in December 2022, before its first overseas visit, to Singapore in September 2023, and its 200th performance will take place during the London run.Before the London premiere, China's Ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Zeguang praised the show and its cast for increasing cultural understanding."I am sure (the performances) will help the UK audience better understand both Chinese martial arts and the philosophy and value championed by the practitioners," he said, while also praising Shenzhen for its growing role as a cultural hub. "Shenzhen is at the forefront of China's reform and opening-up and technological innovation. Nowadays, the city is also building itself into a leader of culture."Zheng highlighted the city's role by mentioning how the Shenzhen Symphony Orchestra had toured the UK this year, and he also drew attention to a recent visit to the city by the United Kingdom's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Zeng Xianglai, executive vice-president of the Shenzhen International Cultural Exchange Association, also praised the show as a cultural ambassador for the region and a traditional product showcased within it."Wing Chun showcases the allure of exquisite traditional Chinese culture through the harmonious fusion of two Chinese intangible cultural heritages: wing chun and gambiered Guangdong gauze," he said. "This innovative fusion not only bridges ancient Chinese kung fu and contemporary dance but also promotes mutual exchange, learning, and communication, transcending cultural boundaries."The show has been well received, with The Guardian newspaper praising its "smart staging, sleek designs, awesome revolving sets, tricks of the light, a pulse-quickening soundtrack, uplifting storytainment, and above all exceptional dance, acrobatics and martial arts".Hong Kong-born choreographer and opera director Caroline Chao called it "stunning ... beautiful, fluid, seamlessly combining dance with martial arts into one brilliant whole".At a public question and answer session, the show's creative team and performers gave some insight into the lengths they went to putting it together."The biggest challenge was combining martial arts with dance," said Zhou Liya, who for the sixth time shares a joint choreography credit with collaborator Han Zhen. "Most dancers have foundation-level knowledge of martial arts, but that's not enough for a production like this, so they spent over a year learning different martial arts styles from the masters, so they were familiar with what was required."In the main role of Yip Man, Chang Hongji is the central character in a uniformly top-class cast, and he revealed the extreme level of study that went into the demanding role."Wing chun says we must be diligent and practice, and that has informed my involvement in this production," he said. "I spent a lot of time researching my character and my moves, so when it looks like we are taking hard falls, we don't get injured. We spent many hours finding the right level of force to make the required impact without hurting ourselves."With a cast-mate, he gave audience members a close-up view of the intricate moves used in fight scenes, which require hundreds of repetitions to look authentic, and Zhou Liya revealed "this needs so much practice that even in lunch breaks and at the start of the day when they greet each other, this is how they do it".Wing Chun runs at the Sadler's Wells theater in London until Sept 7.julian@mail.chinadailyuk.comVILNIUS/RIGA -- Several schools in Lithuania and Latvia received bomb threats via email on Monday, the first day of the new school year, according to police reports.As of 9 am local time, the police in Lithuania had received 26 reports of threats to blow up educational institutions in the capital city of Vilnius, as confirmed by Revita Janaviciute, a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian police, to the Baltic News Service (BNS).Currently, there is no information on any school evacuations. The Police Department, through its social media, advised schools not to panic and to maintain normal operations, emphasizing that evacuations should only occur if a suspicious item is found.In a related development, over 200 emails containing bomb threats were received by several schools across Latvia on Monday morning, as confirmed by Latvia's state police chief Armands Ruks. He described these emails as "low-risk threats," adding that there was no need for evacuation.The incidents follow a series of hoax bomb threats in October 2023, when thousands of schools, kindergartens, and municipal buildings across Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were targeted with similar emails.HELSINKI -- Children under two years old should avoid digital screens entirely, while teenagers should limit their daily screen time to a maximum of three hours, according to the latest recommendations published by the Swedish public health agency on Monday.The agency recommended a maximum daily screen time of one hour for children aged 2-5, one to two hours for children aged 6-12, and two to three hours for teenagers aged 13-18. Additionally, cell phones and tablets should be kept out of children's bedrooms during the night.Olivia Wigzell, the agency's acting director-general, said the recommendations aim to support parents and caregivers, as well as children and young people, highlighting that reducing screen time is essential for ensuring children get adequate exercise and sleep.Helena Frielingsdorf, a physician and researcher at the agency, noted that their research indicates young people experience both positive and negative effects from digital media. Many are concerned about the impact of screens and are seeking ways to change their habits. She added that the guidelines aim to provide the assistance they need.A report released in Sweden in June highlighted the consequences of excessive screen time, including poor sleep, depressive symptoms, and body dissatisfaction. It cautioned that children and adolescents can become easily engrossed in digital activities, often at the expense of sleep, relationships, and physical activity.Sweden's public health agency has urged tech companies to take greater responsibility in mitigating health risks for children and adolescents.The guidelines address the use of digital media during leisure time, including social media, video streaming, TV, video games, and other forms of digital entertainment. Their drafting involved consultations with children, parents, experts, and agencies from Denmark and Norway, as well as the World Health Organization (WHO). The prospect of a eurozone interest rate cut has excited investors, with many predicting the European Central Bank, or ECB, will now slash borrowing costs by a quarter of a point.The optimism followed news that inflation fell during August within the 20-member bloc that uses the euro for currency, to a three-year low of 2.2 percent, after having edged up in July to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent in June.Bert Colijn, an economist at ING, told the Financial Times newspaper the fact that Eurostat, the European Union's official statistics agency, declared the eurozone's inflation rate to be within a whisker of the ECB's target of 2 percent means rate cuts will be likely when the bank discusses the issue on Sept 12."The inflation environment is slowly getting more benign," Colijn said. "The ECB has arrived on a long home straight."Eurostat said Germany and Spain reported bigger than expected falls in consumer price rises in August, while France also did well, recording inflation at 2.2 percent in spite of cost pressures associated with hosting the Olympic Games.If the ECB does reduce its key interest rate by a quarter-point to 3.5 percent, it will follow on from a quarter-point cut in June and could lead to more cuts, with the Financial Times saying traders are now hoping for two or three additional quarter-point reductions before the end of the year.However, within the overall inflation rate, there was a worrying uptick in the cost of services, something that Jack Allen-Reynolds, from Capital Economics, told the Financial Times may cause concern at the bank."However, we doubt that August's unexpected increase in services inflation will stop the ECB from cutting interest rates at its next meeting in September," he told the paper.A 3 percent fall in the cost of energy during August more than offset the increase in the cost of services.Core inflation, which ignores price changes in volatile commodities including alcohol, energy, food, and tobacco, stood at 2.8 percent in August, according to Eurostat, down slightly from 2.9 percent in July.French newspaper Le Monde said the ECB is likely to look closely at the core inflation rate when setting its interest rate, and this could mean interest rate cuts are far from certain.The ECB started its campaign of aggressive interest rate hikes in July 2022, when the eurozone's inflation rate was rocketing up to 10.6 percent in October, largely because of fast-rising energy and food costs attributed to the Ukraine conflict.Sam Miley, from the London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research, told Le Monde that interest rate cuts are more likely now than they were a few weeks ago, but are not guaranteed."The … rate of core inflation and continually tight labor market will present risk factors to implementing looser monetary policy," Miley said. The ongoing political wrangling over who will form the next government in France has taken a new twist after the radical left-wing La France Insoumise party, also known as LFI, tried to rally other groups to bring impeachment proceedings against President Emmanuel Macron, for what it regards as serious failings in his constitutional duties.Earlier in the summer, Macron announced a surprise election for seats in the National Assembly, in a bid to call the bluff of the electorate over rising support from the far-right National Rally party, or RN.Although the two-round vote saw RN relegated to being the third-largest bloc in the parliament, a loose coalition of left-wing parties emerged as the largest grouping, ahead of Macron's own centrists, but, crucially, without an overall majority.After a temporary lull in political activity during the Paris Olympic Games, talks have resumed over who should be the next prime minister and what the make-up of the next Cabinet should be, but so far there has been little progress.Macron has already rejected one name put forward by some left-wing parties to be prime minister, economist Lucie Castets, saying he had a duty to ensure "institutional stability" and that she is regarded as someone who would not gain wider support and approval, leading to constitutional deadlock.This has prompted LFI to take action, saying it is not up to the president to do "political horse trading".Mathilde Panot, the parliamentary leader of LFI, said a draft impeachment document has been sent to assembly members from other parties in a bid to gain their support."The Assemblee Nationale (lower house) and Senat (upper house) can and must defend democracy against the president's authoritarian leanings," the document said.The impeachment bid looks to be largely symbolic rather than meaningful, however, with two-thirds of the combined members of the 577-seat national assembly and 349-seat Senate needing to support any action for it to be successful.Article 68 of the French Constitution says a presidential mandate can be terminated early "in the event of a breach of duty manifestly incompatible with the exercise of his mandate".Macron won a second five-year term in 2022, but National Assembly elections shortly after saddled him with a parliament that was of a different political make-up, a situation that has not been cleared up by this summer's election results.Political observers have noted that the Constitution lacks clear guidelines on how a hung parliament, which is one with no overall majority as is the current situation, should be managed, as it seems to have been written on the assumption that there would always be a clear majority group or party.VLADIVOSTOK - The bodies of all 22 victims in a Mi-8 helicopter crash in Russia's Kamchatka region have been found, local officials said on Monday."The bodies of the deceased have been found and handed over to forensic authorities. The search and rescue operation has been completed," Minister for Emergency Situations of the Kamchatka region Sergei Lebedev said on social media."The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations helicopter will pick up the rescuers from the crash site of the Mi-8 operated by Vityaz-Aero in half an hour," he wrote.The wreckage of the Mi-8 helicopter, which disappeared from radar on Saturday, was found on Sunday in the Vachkazhets mountain range area in Kamchatka. There were three crew members and 19 passengers on board.Authorities have declared Tuesday a day of mourning in Kamchatka.It's been two months since snap elections were held in France, yet the country is still to elect a new prime minister.Amid this political instability, the country successfully hosted the Paris Olympics and opened the Paralympic Games on Wednesday.According to experts, the ongoing political deadlock is putting President Emmanuel Macron to the test as he struggles to form a new government.It was hoped that hosting the Olympics would lift the morale of the country and ease political tensions. However, the temporary "political truce" for the Games is now over and there is no end to the impasse in sight.In a surprise move, Macron dissolved the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, and called for snap polls after a setback in the June European Parliament elections, in which the far-right National Rally party gained major ground.Two rounds of voting, on June 30 and July 7, produced no clear winner in the 577-seat National Assembly.Macron has "won and failed", Zhang Jinling, a senior research fellow on French studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of European Studies, told China Daily."He succeeded in blocking the far-right momentum, particularly through political maneuvers with the left-wing bloc after the first round," Zhang said. "However, Macron ultimately failed, as his Ensemble coalition lost its relative majority."The French team performed well in the Olympics but "the morale gained from the games failed to smooth the political process", Dai Zhixin, vice-dean of the Institute of French and Francophone Studies and research fellow at the Institute of Area Studies of Renmin University of China, told China Daily."The current political deadlock is rooted mainly in party divisions and conflicting interests. Resolving the situation will require political wisdom and compromise," Dai said.More efforts were underway as Macron launched a new round of talks to end the stalemate. Macron said he would not name a government led by the left-wing New Popular Front coalition, which emerged as the largest bloc but fell short of an absolute majority."France has traditionally been governed alternatively by the left or right," Zhang said. "Macron's rise to power in 2017, positioning himself as a centrist, foreshadowed the tripartite political landscape."The parliamentary structure indicates a "deepening polarization" in French politics, which makes the formation of a new administration particularly challenging, Dai said."France's political stability could be at risk if no compromise is reached, and the government's decision-making efficiency will be significantly impaired," Dai added.He also noted that Macron faces the risk of becoming a "lame-duck" president, with "passing bills becoming nearly impossible"."Some might suggest invoking Article 49.3 of the Constitution to bypass a vote, like last year's retirement reform. But it would be no longer feasible as the current situation makes it easy for the opposition to overturn such actions through a vote of no confidence," Zhang said."Due to significant disagreements among parties on key issues such as immigration and taxation, major reforms in France over the next three years are unlikely," he added.The New Popular Front had proposed economist and civil servant Lucie Castets, 37, as prime minister, but was turned down by Macron, who said the left-wing government would be a "threat to institutional stability", drawing strong criticism from the opposition.Macron's office has not provided any timeline for naming a prime minister, but the clock is ticking toward the Oct 1 deadline when the government must present a draft budget law for 2025, Agence France-Presse reported."If the new government leans toward a more conservative stance, it may lead to divergences with other European Union countries on issues like immigration and economic policy, potentially weakening EU cohesion," Dai said.Macron held a meeting with the United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Paris on Thursday, in which the two leaders agreed to deepen relations over security and migration. That day Macron began a two-day visit to Serbia, where Rafale jets deal and energy topped the agenda."The new government's foreign policy will be crucial in finding the optimal balance between France's national interests and the EU's collective interests, which will impact the EU's position on the global stage," Zhang said.PARIS -- Though described by European leaders as a "friend and partner", Keir Starmer, who assumed the British premiership in July, has given no indication of reversing Brexit or rejoining the European single market.However, eight years after Brexit strained Britain's relations with the EU, Starmer's choice of Germany and France for his first visits signals a desire to recalibrate relations, particularly in trade with EU members.At the 4th meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) held in Britain in July, Starmer indicated readiness to reset Britain's strained post-Brexit relations with Europe, especially as the region confronts "generational challenges".Following the long tradition of viewing Germany as key to improving relations with Europe, Starmer kicked off his EU visit in Germany where he met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.During the meeting, Scholz said that he was "pleased" with the Starmer's announcement that he would seek a "fresh start" in relations with the EU."Given the common challenges our two countries face, we are convinced that the time has come to take our bilateral relations to the next level," said a joint declaration on deepening and enhancing UK-Germany relations issued during Starmer's visit.Both permanent members of the UN Security Council with nuclear weapons, Britain and France maintained frosty relations during the years of Brexit negotiations.It was not until 2023 that French President Emmanuel Macron and then British PM Rishi Sunak broke the ice with a financial deal on the illegal migration, followed by Britain's King Charles III's first-ever state visit to France.After Starmer's meeting with Macron on Thursday, the British foreign ministry said that the two leaders "agreed on the importance of further strengthening and broadening the close relationship between the UK and France in the coming months"."The reset so far is on atmosphere rather than substance," Peter Ricketts, chairman of the House of Lords European Affairs Committee, told European news website Euractiv. "It's focused on goodwill and good intentions, a commitment to working together, and shared interests."It's the right thing for Britain to have good relations with the EU in defense and immigration cooperation and there has to be a renegotiation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, Professor Iain Begg from the London School of Economics and Political Science, told Xinhua.Amid high government debt and sluggish economic growth, it is believed that Starmer was chosen by the British people to "fix" the country's economic foundation.A major study by the Resolution Foundation, a leading British think tank, revealed that the British economy has been stagnating for 15 years, leaving low- and middle-income households "much poorer" than their counterparts in advanced economies such as France and Germany.The British economic outlook remains bleak, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting a GDP growth of just 0.7 percent in 2024 and 1.5 percent in 2025.According to the British government figures, Germany was Britain's second-largest trading partner in the four quarters to the end of the first quarter of 2024, accounting for 8.5 percent of its total.Germany and Britain were looking to "place their relations on a completely new footing" by concluding a treaty on bilateral cooperation, Scholz said at a joint news conference with Starmer.For his part, Starmer said that the upcoming new bilateral cooperation treaty would reflect "our status as the closest of partners in Europe" and closer links in science, technology and business would strengthen trade ties with Germany while creating jobs both in Germany and Britain.Describing economic growth as his government's top priority, Starmer said, "building relationships with our partners here in Germany and across Europe is vital to achieving it."During his short stay in France, Starmer also met with business leaders. "My Labour government will provide the economic stability needed for international business to invest in the UK. When business thrives, we all do," he said on X, formerly Twitter.Before the bilateral summit held in 2023 that fixed the frosty relations, Britain and France had clashed over issues including French fishermen's fishing licenses, illegal migration through the English Channel, and Australia's decision to cancel the submarine contract with France for British nuclear-powered alternatives.Although economic growth has been declared as a priority of his government, Starmer seemed to focus on another more urgent issue in discussions with Macron -- illegal migration.Following his visit to France, the two sides reaffirmed their desire to deepen cooperation on illegal migration in the English Channel, not least in the face of human trafficking rings.During the 2023 bilateral summit, France and Britain reached a controversial new deal to combat illegal migration across the channel, under which London would pay Paris millions of euros from 2023 to 2026, and a detention center should be built in northern France.British government statistics showed that between Aug 25 to 31, 2024, 1,758 irregular migrants attempted to cross the channel in small boats without permission to enter Britain.According to British journalist Philip Turle, the France-Britain relationship has been strained for years over the crossing of illegal migrants through the channel."Those who voted for Brexit believed that it would allow better control of immigration. They saw clearly that it had no effect," Turle told news channel France24. "The challenge for the British as well as for the Europeans is to work better with the countries of origin to reduce these migratory flows."Turle noted that Starmer's visits were also a way of expressing his worries over the rise of the far right in Europe, especially after riots on home soil, the French far-right wing party's win of more seats in the National Assembly, and rocking support for right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party after recent attacks.But for Begg, Starmer's trips to Germany and France were not just visits to Berlin and Paris.They aim to establish stronger relations with a big neighbor, a key trading partner, and an important source of potential cooperation on critical issues, including illegal migration and direct investment into their countries, he told Xinhua. BERLIN - The conservative CDU would not enter a coalition with the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), its general secretary Carsten Linnemann said Sunday after regional elections in two states."Voters know that we do not form coalitions with the AfD," Linnemann told broadcaster ZDF. The AfD topped exit polls in Thuringia, with the CDU in second, while the CDU had its nose in front in a narrow race for first in Saxony.AFPMOSCOW -- Seventeen bodies have been found after a Russian Mi-8 helicopter crashed in the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said Sunday.The helicopter went missing on Saturday with 19 tourists and three crew members on board, according to preliminary data from the Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency.Earlier in the day, the Ministry of Emergency Situations confirmed the crash of the helicopter and said that the search continues at the site.MOSCOW - Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency said that a Mi-8 helicopter went missing on Saturday over the Kamchatka Peninsula, with 22 people on board.According to preliminary data, those on board include 19 tourists and 3 crew members, the agency said on Telegram.Searching operation is going on, it said.David Bencsik, executive Editor-in-Chief of Magyar Demokrata Media Group of Hungary, highlighted at the 2024 Media Cooperation Forum on Belt and Road in Chengdu, Sichuan on Aug 28, that European media are constrained from opposing the US government under Western capital influence. MOSCOW - Pavel Popov, a former Russian deputy defense minister, has been arrested on charges of large-scale fraud and is being held in a pre-trial detention center, the TASS news agency reported on Thursday.The report said a Russian court has ordered Popov to remain in detention until Oct 29.Investigators said that Popov and Vyacheslav Akhmedov, director of the Patriot military-patriotic park, and Vladimir Shesterov, a deputy head of the Main Directorate for Innovative Development of the Russian Defense Ministry, misappropriated funds between 2021 and 2024.Popov was accused of abusing his position to divert resources from the park for personal benefit, including the construction, renovation, and furnishing of his private estate in the Krasnogorsk district of the Moscow region.The former deputy defense minister was also accused of coercing companies contracted by the park into constructing his private property for free, and continuing to use park resources for its maintenance and upkeep.Popov had served as the deputy minister of emergency situations from 2008 to 2013 before joining the Ministry of Defense in 2013 as an aide to Minister Sergei Shoigu. He was appointed deputy defense minister on Nov 7, 2013, overseeing scientific research, technological development, information systems, and robotics testing. His military service was terminated by presidential decree in June of this year.BELGRADE - Serbia and France on Thursday signed a series of preliminary agreements on nuclear energy, strategic raw materials, as well as a deal on acquisition of French Rafale fighter jets.French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Serbia for a two-day visit on Thursday afternoon. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic held talks with him, and they witnessed the signing of over a dozen agreements between governments and enterprises of the two nations.At a subsequent press conference, Vucic emphasized the depth of the discussions, which covered bilateral relations, Serbia's European Union (EU) accession process, and broader European and global issues."The agreements we signed today touch every aspect of our social and economic life," Vucic said. He also emphasized the importance of Serbia's purchase of 12 Rafale fighter jets from France.Macron said the agreements signed reflect France's support for Serbia's EU integration through enhanced ties. "We must reform the European Union and expand it," Macron said.In addition to letters of intent on nuclear energy and strategic raw materials, as well as the purchase agreement for Rafale fighter jets, the two countries also secured letters of intent on environmental protection, healthcare, agricultural and food industry, tourism, and infrastructure projects.VIENNA - The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Thursday that he will visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) next week as nuclear safety situation there "remains precarious."IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said in a statement that he will hold high-level talks and assess developments at the ZNPP during his visit.Grossi's visit comes after what he called "recent deeply concerning incidents" at the ZNPP, including a fire that broke out at the plant's cooling tower and a drone strike close to the facility earlier this month."A nuclear accident must be avoided at all costs, and a nuclear power plant must never be attacked. The consequences could be disastrous, and no one stands to benefit from it," Grossi warned, adding that he remains determined to protect nuclear safety.According to Thursday's statement, IAEA experts stationed at the ZNPP have "continued to hear explosions and other indications of military activities, at times near the plant itself."Grossi also expressed increasing concerns over the growing vulnerability of Ukraine's energy infrastructure and its potential impact on the safety of the country's operating nuclear power plants.Teenagers in the United Kingdom are falling victim to a so-called happiness recession after new research by the charity The Children's Society revealed British youngsters have the lowest life satisfaction levels in Europe.The study, called the Good Childhood Report, looked at youngsters in 27 countries and highlighted how girls are particularly badly affected, and also those from poorer backgrounds, with poverty a significant contributory factor."Children and young people deserve better," the report observed. "Decisive action and national leadership are needed to overturn the decline in children's wellbeing. We know that these experiences are not lived in a vacuum… The pandemic, rising levels of poverty, concerns over young people's safety, the climate emergency and other stresses have put a strain on young people's lives and can prevent the experience of a happy and fulfilled childhood."In 2021/22, children aged between 10 and 15 were asked to score levels of satisfaction with their quality of life in general, and also their school, schoolwork, friends, and appearance.Lower levels of satisfaction were found to be at least twice as high among UK teenagers as they were among youngsters of the same ages in Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Romania, and Portugal.Of those questioned in the UK, 41 percent of children and young people were "very" or "quite" worried about the cost of living, and, ranked against their peers in Europe, the UK was found to have the fourth-highest rate of food deprivation, the fifth-highest rate of physical inactivity outside school hours, and the second-highest level of bullying.The report comes in the same week that it was revealed that each day more than 500 children in England are being referred to the National Health Service's mental health support teams because of anxiety, figures that are more than twice those from before the pandemic.In 2023/24 there were 204,526 new referrals of patients aged 17 or younger, compared to 98,953 in 2019/20, before the pandemic began. There is an even sharper contrast with the year 2016/17, where the number was just 3,879.Andy Bell, chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health, told The Guardian newspaper there were many factors at play, including poverty and school concerns."Our research indicates that academic pressures, particularly those related to exams, have intensified in the last decade. Evidence also suggests that online harms, such as cyberbullying and pressures around appearance, are relentless and can fuel anxiety in children," he said."The pandemic has amplified these pressures on children and young people by disrupting their routines and increasing feelings of isolation and uncertainty about the world and their futures."Judges in France have placed Pavel Durov, the billionaire founder and chief executive of the Telegram messaging app, under formal investigation over the platform's alleged misuse by organized crime gangs.Durov was put under judicial supervision and ordered to pay a 5-million-euro ($5.6 million) bail bond, but has not been remanded in custody.The Russian-born tech leader, who also has French citizenship, must report to a French police station twice a week while the probe is ongoing and must not leave France.The development follows his detention on Saturday at an airport north of Paris and four days of questioning over alleged offenses related to the Telegram app.Prosecutors said on Wednesday that Durov is being investigated over potentially having been complicit in the administration of an online platform to enable illicit transactions by an organized gang, and for allegedly refusing to communicate with the authorities. He is also being probed for possible complicity in the organized criminal distribution of sexual images of children.Being placed under formal investigation does not mean that the authorities believe Durov is guilty, but they think there is a good reason to proceed with a probe.Durov's lawyer, David-Olivier Kaminski, said Telegram, which was founded in 2013, has consistently complied with European digital laws and regulations and is overseen in the same way as all other social media networks.He said his client had not been involved "in criminal acts that don't concern him either directly or indirectly", the BBC reported.Telegram, which is headquartered in Dubai, allows groups of up to 200,000 people to share information and comment on it, which is a far larger scale than those of its rivals such as WhatsApp, which tend to be limited to around 1,000.Some Telegram users choose to send encrypted messages that can only be seen by the sender and recipient. The app has around 950 million registered users, and it is popular in Russia and Ukraine.Act of intimidationTelegram said the company and its founder have "nothing to hide", while the Russian government said the investigation could be seen as an act of "intimidation" against the enterprise for political purposes.The BBC quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying: "Given (Durov's) Russian citizenship, we are ready to provide all necessary help and assistance. But here the situation is complicated by the fact that he is also a French citizen."Durov left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with the government's demand that the app block groups opposed to it. He subsequently obtained French citizenship in 2021 and has also become a citizen of the Caribbean nation Saint Kitts and Nevis and of the United Arab Emirates.His arrest prompted a protest near France's embassy in Moscow over the weekend.earle@mail.chinadailyuk.com LONDON -- The number of suicides in England and Wales has reached its highest level in 25 years, according to statistics released Thursday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The ONS reported a total of 6,069 suicides in England and Wales in 2023, or 11.4 suicide deaths per 100,000 people, compared to 10.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2022.The data revealed that while the suicide rate among males was higher than that of females, the rate for females rose to 5.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2023, the highest rate since 1994. Suicides were most common among males aged 45 to 49, and females aged 50 to 54.Meanwhile, the suicide rates in North-West and North-East England were reported to be twice as high as those in London.Keith Baker, a social scientist at Glasgow Caledonian University, told Xinhua that the cost of living crisis is one of the contributing factors."It's still the same underlying problems: the cost of living, the difficulty in finding work, not just any work, but work that provides a sense of pride and purpose," Baker said. "Part of the issue is that men often avoid discussing health issues, especially mental health. This problem is pervasive, and we haven't truly addressed it."Baker added that he was not surprised that the highest rates were in Northern England, which includes traditionally poorer and working-class areas."These regions haven't been well-supported by the government in terms of social services and support networks," he explained, noting that the closure of traditional working men's clubs has cut off a vital source of support for men facing challenges.Baker underlined the need for political action to address the issue of suicide. "I don't think the complete cut to the winter fuel payment is a good example of support," he said."We have long waiting times in the NHS for mental health services. It can take months to get help, yet providing immediate support and reassurance to someone in crisis can make all the difference," Baker added, emphasizing the importance of timely intervention.Vahe Nafilyan, head of data and analysis for social care and health at the ONS, said: "Suicide leaves a devastating impact on individuals, families, and communities, and we will continue to monitor suicide registrations closely."He added: "Many people feel they've been discarded by the time they reach 40 or 45, with very few opportunities to retrain. The decline of lifelong learning and the disappearance of adult education colleges have only worsened this situation."WARSAW - The Polish government has approved its 2025 budget, allocating nearly PLN 190 billion ($49.3 billion) for defense, a historic high.The spending represents 4.7 percent of Poland's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025 with a robust increase in defense spending and key investments in infrastructure.During a press conference held on Wednesday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk outlined the major aspects of the budget, highlighting the government's commitment to national defense and security.The budget also includes provisions for a real increase in the minimum wage and the initiation of critical infrastructure projects, particularly in the energy and railway sectors.In addition, the budget allocates PLN 222 billion ($57.6 billion) to healthcare, representing a significant increase from the previous year.Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski, who also spoke at the press conference, noted that the budget was formulated amid accelerating economic growth. He projected a GDP growth rate of 3.1 percent for 2024 and 3.9 percent for 2025.He further outlined expectations for increased public and private investments, along with a state budget deficit of PLN 289 billion ($74.9 billion) in 2025.France is to try out a ban on mobile phones at school for students aged 15 and under in an effort to give youngsters a "digital pause".The restriction will be tried out in 200 schools and could go nationwide next year and involves students handing over phones at the start of the day.The initiative goes one step further than a previous limitation introduced in 2018, which saw students allowed to keep their phones on them at school, but not allowed to use them.A report published earlier this year by a commission set up by President Emmanuel Macron expressed concern at the negative impacts of overexposure to screens, which it said was causing damage, not just to the children in question but society as a whole."All the experts say that screen addiction is the breeding ground for all kinds of problems — harassment, violence, dropping out of school," said Macron.The report noted what it said was "a very clear consensus on the direct and indirect negative effects of digital devices on sleep, on being sedentary, a lack of physical activity, and the risk of being overweight and even obese … as well as on sight", and said children under the age of 11 should not have phones at all."Parents, teachers, content creators, administrations — it is the whole of society that must get involved," the report added.Servane Mouton, a neurologist who served on the commission, said the phone "must (be) put … in its place," especially when it comes to how very young children are first made aware of the device."We have to teach parents once again how to play with their children," she added.But some groups have raised questions over the organizational practicalities of hundreds of children handing in and collecting phones each day, and David Lelong, from the teachers' union SE-UNSA, questioned its effectiveness when speaking to television news channel BFM TV."We are not convinced that cyber bullying between students will decrease with this measure, as we know that the majority of cyber bullying happens after class," he said.Bans on phones in schools have long been mooted in countries across Europe, but never fully imposed, with varying limitations put in place instead.In Germany, the use of mobile phones and digital devices in classrooms is confined only to educational purposes, and in the United Kingdom the previous government issued guidance, but said the imposition of rules should be a matter for individual schools and teachers. Spain too has resisted a full ban, but there are some regional restrictions in place, while schools in Portugal have specific phone-free days.Italy was one of the first countries to ban phones for all school age groups in 2007, only to reverse the ruling in 2017, then reimpose it five years later. The United Kingdom's prime minister began a two-day visit to Germany and France on Wednesday with high hopes of resetting his country's difficult relationship with some of its nearest neighbors.Keir Starmer started his trip by meeting President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany's head of state, before holding key talks with Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The UK leader was set to move on to France for talks with President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday.Starmer, who became the UK's prime minister in July after the Labour Party swept to power in a general election, described his visit as a "once-in-a-generation opportunity to reset our relationship with Europe"."We must turn a corner on Brexit and fix the broken relationships left behind by the previous government," he said, in reference to the UK's 2020 exit from the European Union.He added that he hoped the UK would be able to achieve "genuine, ambitious partnerships" with Germany and France "that deliver for the British people".And he noted that strengthening the UK's relationship with Germany and France would be "crucial, not only in tackling the global problem of illegal migration, but also in boosting economic growth across the continent and, crucially, in the UK".New deal proposedA proposed partnership with Germany was the major issue on the table on Wednesday.The deal, which is likely to be finalized next year, would call for more cooperation in trade, defense, and illegal migration, and could go some way toward restoring the close cooperation the countries enjoyed when the UK was a member of the EU.A spokesperson for the UK government told the BBC the deal would also cover other areas where increased collaboration would be beneficial, including market access for companies, cooperation in science and technology, and partnerships in clean energy, supply-chain resilience, and biodiversity.Nils Schmid, a foreign affairs spokesman for Scholz's Social Democratic Party, said on BBC Radio 4's Today program that the two leaders are in broad agreement on how UK-EU relations should look in the years ahead."There is a constant push by the German government to bring the UK closer to Europe and to facilitate cooperation between Great Britain and the European Union in as many fields as possible, ranging from trade to student mobility rights to defense," Schmid told the broadcaster."And then, of course, there's also the idea of not only preparing the ground for an EU-UK agreement, but also to strengthen the bilateral ties between Germany and Great Britain."One part of a future deal between the countries could include easier cross-border access for young people, Schmid added.Starmer and Scholz have met several times since Starmer came to power, including at a NATO summit in the United States and at the European Political Community summit in England, both in July.After leaving Germany, Starmer was expected to attend the opening ceremony of the Paris Paralympics on Wednesday evening.He was also expected to meet representatives from Siemens Energy and Rheinmetall and investors from Thales, Eutelsat, Mistral AI and Sanofi during the trip.PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games open on Wednesday evening at Place de la Concorde.About 4,400 athletes from a record 168 delegations will participate in the 11-day Games across 22 sports, with Eritrea, Kiribati and Kosovo making their Paralympic debuts.China has sent 284 athletes - 126 males and 158 females - to compete in 302 events over 19 sports, with 95 being first-time Paralympians.  PARIS - The CEO of Telegram Pavel Durov was charged on Wednesday by the French judiciary with a litany of violations related to the messaging app but allowed to go free while being banned from leaving the country.Durov was granted conditional release against a bail of five million euros on the condition he must report to a police station twice a week as well as remain in France, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement following an hours-long hearing with two investigating magistrates.AFPBERLIN -- The latest economic barometer fell to 83.4 points in August, marking a nearly four-point decline from July and moving further away from the neutral 100-point mark that measures average economic growth, the Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) said on Wednesday.The latest indicators, complied regularly by DIW Berlin to assess the current economic trend in Germany, suggest that German economic outlook for the third quarter remains bleak, with little to no expected increase in economic output."The bumpy global economic development, continues to slow the German export economy, which in turn makes companies hesitant to invest," said Geraldine Dany-Knedlik, head of the Forecasting and Economic Policy Department at DIW Berlin,Despite an initiated interest rate turnaround, interest rates remain high. "Only private consumption might contribute somewhat to stabilizing economic output this quarter, thanks to stable inflation rates and continued rising incomes," Dany-Knedlik added.The German industrial sector remains under significant pressure, with production stagnating at a low level. According to ifo economic surveys, industrial companies have barely increased production this quarter, with shrinking order backlogs and a deteriorating business climate in the manufacturing sector for the third consecutive month."The German industrial economy is still not doing well," noted Laura Pagenhardt, a DIW economic expert. "Companies in Germany are currently unable to benefit from the European Central Bank's interest rate turnaround; demand is stagnating, and investment remains weak."The services sector, while performing better than industry, also saw a decline in sentiment in August, particularly regarding future business expectations. Despite stable inflation and rising incomes, stagnating economic development is dampening consumer confidence. Many households are opting to save rather than spend, leading to a contraction in private consumption in the second quarter.The labor market is also feeling the strain of the weak economy, with seasonally adjusted unemployment rising and the number of job vacancies falling. Overall, employment growth is slowing, further complicating the economic situation in Germany.LONDON -- Three people were killed on Wednesday in a road collision at a seaside town in Wales, the United Kingdom, local police confirmed.North Wales Police said it responded to the accident in the town of Beaumaris, Anglesey, in the early afternoon. Beaumaris, located on the island of Anglesey off the northwest coast of Wales, is a popular holiday destination."Sadly, three people were pronounced deceased at the scene," the police said, adding that an investigation into the accident is underway.Chief Inspector Caroline Mullen-Hurst said, "We are appealing to anybody who witnessed the incident that hasn't already spoken to officers or anybody who might have dashcam footage, to please get in touch."The highway of the accident is closed for some time, therefore people are advised to avoid the area.BRUSSELS - Two environmental Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have taken the European Commission to court on Tuesday, urging the Commission to revise its greenhouse gas emissions targets for the bloc's member states from now until 2030.CAN Europe and the Global Legal Action Network said the annual emissions limits through 2030 for each European Union (EU) country in the buildings, agriculture, waste, small industry, and transport sectors were unlawful, according to a press release issued by CAN Europe.These sectors account for about 57 percent of the total 27-country bloc's greenhouse gas emissions.The EU set a 40 percent aggregate emissions reduction target, compared to 1990 levels, for these sectors and an economy-wide target of 55 percent less emissions for the EU as a whole.The NGOs argued that the EU's overall climate ambition remains alarmingly off-track from the 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming limit set out by the Paris Agreement.To address this, the EU must enable more ambitious emission cuts in the near term and achieve at least a 65 percent reduction in gross emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, the NGOs said.The case was initially presented in February 2024, following the European Commission's refusal to reassess annual emissions allocations for its member states until 2030.A hearing at the EU General Court could potentially be held in the second half of 2025 and a judgment released in early 2026, the release said.French President Emmanuel Macron said the arrest of Russian-born Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was part of an ongoing judicial investigation rather than a political move after the French action triggered a heated debate about free speech and protests from Russia.The first French official confirmation on Monday came two days after the 39-year-old Durov was detained on Saturday night after his private jet landed at Paris-Le Bourget Airport.French authorities extended Durov's detention on Sunday for allegedly not curbing offenses such as fraud, sexual exploitation, crimes against minors, drug trafficking, organized crime and promotion of terrorism on the Telegram messaging platform, French media reported.The billionaire, who holds multiple citizenships, including from France, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, could be detained up to a maximum of 96 hours for questioning and then the judge can decide to press charges or set him free.Telegram said in a statement on Sunday that its CEO "has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe".It said Telegram "abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act, or DSA — its moderation is within industry standards and constantly improving". The DSA is a regulation adopted in the European Union in 2022 to address illegal content, transparent advertising and disinformation."It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for abuse of that platform," the statement said.Durov backedRussia has come to Durov's defense by criticizing France for free speech double standards and said Durov should be accorded his rights. The Russian embassy in Paris said it had demanded access to Durov but "the French side is refusing to cooperate".Telegram is popular among Russian speakers.On her personal Telegram account, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said 26 NGOs "condemned the Russian court's decision to block Telegram" in 2018."Do you think this time they'll appeal to Paris and demand Durov's release?" she asked.Macron, who faces domestic political chaos following his party's defeat in the July parliamentary election, said France is "deeply committed to freedom of expression and communication", but such freedoms are "upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life".Macron has been a user of Telegram since the early days of his 2017 presidential campaign. The encrypted messaging app is popular among his supporters.The European Commission has distanced itself from the case with a spokesperson telling the media on Monday that Durov's arrest on suspicion of allowing criminal activity on his platform has nothing to do with Telegram's obligations under the DSA.Telegram has more than 900 million active monthly users globally, but its claim in February of 41 million monthly average users in the EU means it has not passed the 45 million threshold for a Very Large Online Platform under DSA and is subject to the strictest transparency rules.Ron Paul, former US Congressman from Texas, said on Monday that the arrest is "a huge blow to free speech across the globe".Agencies contributed to this story. Ride-hailing app Uber says it will appeal against what it called an "unjustified" fine by data protection authorities in the Netherlands, the third such punishment since 2018, over the transfer of driver data from European servers to the United States.On Monday, the Dutch Data Protection Authority, or DPA, called the transfer of information including identity documents, license and location information, and even criminal and medical records over a two-year period a "serious violation" of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, also known as GDPR.The company was fined 290 million euros ($323 million), which comes on the heels of previous data-related fines of 600,000 euros in 2018, and 10 million euros last year.The investigation began after a complaint by French drivers, and under EU rules, any such investigation of a company operating in multiple EU countries must be conducted in the country where its main office is situated, which in the case of Uber in Europe, is the Netherlands."In Europe, the GDPR protects the fundamental rights of people, by requiring businesses and governments to handle personal data with due care", said Aleid Wolfsen, chairman of the DPA."But sadly, this is not self-evident outside Europe. Think of governments that can tap data on a large scale. That is why businesses are usually obliged to take additional measures if they store personal data of Europeans outside the EU."Uber did not meet the requirements of the GDPR to ensure the level of protection to the data with regard to transfers to the US. That is very serious."The DPA also found that the company's process to allow drivers to access personal data was "unnecessarily complicated."Uber spokesperson Caspar Nixon told Reuters that the decision was "flawed" and the financial penalty was "extraordinary"."Uber's cross-border data transfer process was compliant with GDPR during a 3-year period of immense uncertainty between the EU and US," he added, saying that the company was confident "common sense will prevail" in its appeal against the punishment.Uber has been involved in several high-profile data breaches over the years, and in May 2023 the company's former chief security officer was sentenced to three years' probation for attempting to covering up a breach involving millions of customer records that occurred in 2014.In 2016, hackers again breached the company's system, and in September 2022 there was what the company called "a cybersecurity incident".PARIS - The United Arab Emirates and Russia have submitted requests for consular access to Telegram messenger CEO Pavel Durov, who was arrested Sunday in Paris over his alleged refusal to cooperate in the investigation of crimes related to the app.The UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said early on Tuesday that it was "closely following" Durov's case and had "submitted a request to the French government to provide him with all consular services urgently".Russia's embassy in Paris had earlier referred a note to the French foreign ministry demanding consular access to Durov, the TASS news agency quoted Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying.The Associated Press reported that Durov, who was born in Russia, is a citizen of France, Russia, the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, and the United Arab Emirates.Paris Public Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Monday that Durov was arrested in connection with a judicial investigation of 12 criminal counts, including one related to cybercrime."Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act -- its moderation is within industry standards and constantly improving," Telegram said in a statement Sunday evening."Telegram's CEO Pavel Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe," it said. "It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for abuse of that platform."After the arrest of the Telegram CEO, the owner of the US social media platform X, Elon Musk, and former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden both condemned his arrest on Sunday.Under French law, Durov can be held for 96 hours until Wednesday evening.Seven weeks after a surprise snap election, French President Emmanuel Macron has begun consultations at the Elysee Palace to resolve the ensuing political crisis and to appoint a new prime minister.In the July elections, no party won an outright majority in the National Assembly, resulting in a hung parliament. Outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has been leading a caretaker government that managed the country through the Paris Olympics.The next prime minister will face significant challenges, including securing parliamentary approval for the 2025 budget, especially as France faces pressure from the European Commission and bond markets to reduce its deficit.Opposition figures have strongly criticized Macron for the delay, with some describing his approach as "a denial of democracy".After extensive discussions, the left-wing New Popular Front, or NFP, the largest group after the election — announced they want 37-year-old economist Lucie Castets as the new prime minister.The meeting between Macron and the NFP on Friday morning lasted about an hour and a half, French media reported. On arrival at the Elysee Palace, Castets stressed the importance of respecting the election results and proposed a solution based on stability.After the meeting, Olivier Faure, the leader of the Socialist Party and part of the left alliance, said Macron had not provided a "specific date "for appointing a government but assured that it would happen soon.He also said there would be no division within the NFP. It is up to the leading coalition to form a government and find compromises.Later on Friday, Macron met with representatives from his centrist Ensemble alliance, the conservative Republicans, or LR. After the meeting, Annie Genevard from the LR rejected the idea of a coalition with any other parties.Macron also discussed with the Liot group, which includes members of parliament from the center-left, center and center-right, as well as the radical Left group. However, none of these groups made any public statements after their consultations with Macron.Meeting with Le PenOn Monday, the president hosted far-right figurehead Marine Le Pen for rare talks, AFP reported. The three-time National Rally, or RN, presidential candidate called after the meeting for an extraordinary session of parliament so MPs would be able to immediately depose any new government in a confidence vote."I don't want a prime minister to have a month to implement by decree a toxic policy that would be dangerous for the French people," Le Pen said.Laurent Jacobelli, an MP and spokesman for the RN, has told French TV BFM that his party would censure any government that includes hard-left France Unbowed or Green ministers. "Those who abuse democracy have no place at Matignon or in any ministry," he said on Friday. Matignon refers to the official residence of the French prime minister.Another RN lawmaker, Julien Odoul, told Radio Monte Carlo on Friday that he believes it is impossible to govern France "without the National Rally" and the "11 million French people" who voted for the RN, emphasizing they "are not second-class citizens".Beyond the RN, Macron's alliance and the LR also threatened to censure any government that includes ministers from France Unbowed.Meanwhile, Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Unbowed, has been playing a strategic game. Speaking on French national TV TF1 on Saturday, he challenged "the leaders of the three Macronist parties and the right", asking whether they would renounce censure of a Castets government if it did not include any France Unbowed ministers."If you say no, we'll know the real issue isn't the presence of (France Unbowed) ministers but the NFP program itself," he added.Faure said Melenchon is setting the stage for France Unbowed to support a Castets government without participating directly. "The excuse of (France Unbowed) ministers' presence no longer holds."The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.Prosecutors in Italy say the sinking of the superyacht Bayesian off the coast of Sicily, that left seven people dead, could results in charges of manslaughter and negligent shipwreck.Speaking to journalists, Ambrogio Cartosio, public prosecutor in the town of Termini Imerese, where the 56-meter long yacht owned by British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch went down, said "persons unknown" were being looked at, and names could soon be made public."It could be that we add someone to the list of people being investigated even way before the recovery of the boat," he said."It seems to me likely that offences of negligent shipwreck and manslaughter have been committed. It's about establishing who they can be ascribed to."The yacht had 22 people on board when it was caught up in extremely violent winds during the early hours of August 19, and 15 people, including all but one of the crew, managed to escape. The other seven people on board, including Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter Hannah, and Jonathan Bloomer, the chairman of Morgan Stanley international bank, died.The Financial Times newspaper reports that the boat went down rear first, suggesting that compartments at the back of the boat may have become flooded.Deputy prosecutor Raffaele Cammarano said the boat had been caught up in a "truly rapid, sudden" storm, and there are reports that the wind reached force 12 on the Beaufort scale, which is hurricane strength. In his only public comment so far, the ship's captain James Cutfield said "we didn't see it coming" when talking about the change of weather, but the chief of the company that built the boat, Giovanni Costantino, told the BBC human error must be a factor in what had happened."At the back of the boat, a hatch must have been left open," he said, "but also perhaps a side entrance for water to have poured inside."Before the storm, the captain should have closed every opening, lifted anchor, turned on the engine, pointed into the wind and lowered the keel."The Bayesian was a model for many other vessels because of its stability and exceptionally high performance… there was absolutely no problem with it. If water hadn't surged in, it was unsinkable."The vessel, whose tanks are still full of fuel, is now lying 49 meters below the surface and to avoid damage to the boat caused by the water that has built up inside it, the recovery process could take as long as two months and cost up to 15 million euros ($16.7 million)."This is the most delicate part of the operation and needs to be done very, very slowly, because the Bayesian is full of water," marine salvage engineer Nick Sloane told the Daily Telegraph newspaper, adding that around said 40 expert divers would be needed."The important thing is that when the yacht reaches the surface the sea must be calm. So they'll have to carefully check the weather forecasts. The yacht should be recovered exactly as it is, in one piece, with the aim of maintaining it as intact as possible." GENEVA - The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday launched a global drive to tackle human-to-human transmission of mpox.The Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan will run from September 2024 to February 2025, requiring 135 million US dollars in funding. By coordinating global, regional, and national efforts, it aims to enhance surveillance and response strategies, ensure equitable access to diagnostics and vaccines, reduce animal-to-human transmission, and empower communities in outbreak control.The vaccination plan targets those most at risk, such as close contacts of cases and healthcare workers, to break transmission chains. It will focus on providing strategic leadership and guidance, and ensuring access to medical treatment for vulnerable groups in affected regions."The mpox outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries can be controlled, and can be stopped," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.According to a WHO statement, a funding appeal will be launched shortly.LONDON -- Hundreds of firefighters tackled two fires in high-rise tower blocks in London on Monday, the London Fire Brigade (LFB) said.According to LFB, a fire at a block of flats in Dagenham, east London, was reported at 2:44 am and the whole building was affected by the fire.More than 80 people were evacuated. Two people were taken to hospital.The fire was under control by 11:13 am."We will now begin a full investigation into the fire and its cause," said Andy Roe, the commissioner of LFB. "This was a very dynamic and challenging incident, and we know there will undoubtedly be concerns around the fire safety issues present within the building and this will form part of our report."In a second high-rise fire on the same day, ten fire engines and around 70 firefighters tackled a flat fire in a building in Blackwall, east London.The fire was first reported at 1:28 p.m. and was brought under control by 2:50 pm, with no reports of any injuries.Due to the large amount of smoke produced in the Blackwall fire, LFB has advised those in the local area to keep windows and doors closed and avoid the incident location if possible. PARIS - Paris public prosecutor on Monday announced the charges on which the Telegram founder Pavel Durov was arrested in Paris a day before, in a global first for a messaging service.According to Paris Public Prosecutor Laure Beccuau, the Telegram founder and chief executive officer (CEO) is accused of 12 criminal offenses, including failing to take action against Telegram users involved in cyberbullying, sharing pedophilic content, and the glorification of terrorism.Durov can now be detained for up to 96 hours until Aug 28, Beccuau said. He is subject to the criminal procedure for organized crime offenses, including illegal transactions in an organized group, possessing pornographic images of minors, and offering or making available pornographic images of minors.Beccuau said the arrest "comes in the context of a judicial investigation opened on July 8, 2024". It also concerns "refusal to communicate, at the request of competent authorities, information or documents necessary for carrying out and operating interceptions allowed by law," the Paris prosecutor added.The Russian Embassy in Paris has begun working on the case, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Sunday, adding that it is Russian diplomats' duty to respond to cases involving the detention of Russian citizens abroad.Responding to the arrest, the Telegram group said on its X account that the company "abides by European Union (EU) laws, including the Digital Services Act". "It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for abuse of that platform," it added.Tech giant and owner of the US social media platform X Elon Musk, along with former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, condemned this arrest on Sunday, citing a violation of the freedom of speech.Following a tweet with the tag #FreePavel on X, Musk wrote several other posts stressing the importance of protecting free speech and democracy.Meanwhile, Snowden said on X that the arrest of Durov is "an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association"."I am surprised and deeply saddened that (French President Emmanuel) Macron has descended to the level of taking hostages as a means for gaining access to private communications. It lowers not only France, but the world," he said.However, French President Macron said on X on Monday that the arrest of Durov is "in no way a political decision", calling it "part of an ongoing judicial investigation".The French head of state stressed that his country is "deeply" committed to freedom of expression."In a state governed by the rule of law, freedoms are upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life, to protect citizens and respect their fundamental rights," he added.According to the French daily Le Figaro, Durov's arrest warrant was issued by a special unit within the French Interior Minister tasked with combating crimes against minors, in coordination with various investigative services.Durov, also holding French citizenship, founded Telegram in 2013. The messaging app allows up to 200,000 members per chat group and claims not to collect users' information or censor content.With approximately 900 million subscribers, it is now one of the world's leading messaging platforms and influential in Russia. It has become a critical source of information during the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) will be held in Vladivostok from September 3 to 6. The event is organised by the Roscongress Foundation. TV BRICS International Media Network is a media partner for the event.This year, the main theme of the forum is "Far East 2030". The guests and participants will focus on the development of the Russian Far East and its integration into the economic space of the Asia-Pacific region."Forum guests will have to discuss the image of the Far East's future and outline new directions for its development. The EEF-2024 programme includes about 100 business events on the widest range of topics formulated taking into account the development of technology and the changing structure of the global economy, " said Anton Kobyakov, adviser to the President of the Russian Federation.Yury Trutnev, Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District, notes the role of the EEF as a platform for developing support measures for the Far East, such as advanced development territories, the Free Port of Vladivostok (FPV), the Far Eastern Hectare programme and many others."The EEF has become one of the tools for the development of the Far Eastern macro-region. Politicians and representatives of business circles in Russia and dozens of other countries are already well aware that the most important issues of development of the Far Eastern Federal District and the entire Asia-Pacific region are discussed at the EEF. Today, the world is going through a complex stage of development, and a new structure of international relations is being formed. The Forum is becoming a platform for strengthening international ties, " Yury Trutnev said.In his opinion, the growing role of the EEF also corresponds to the priorities of Russia's foreign policy, for which the Asia-Pacific region is becoming one of the key areas.The forum's business programme is divided into thematic blocks corresponding to the main socio-economic trends relevant both for Russia and its partners in the Asia-Pacific Region and other regions of the world.The events of the New Contours of International Cooperation block will discuss multilateral partnerships within the framework of such associations as BRICS, SCO, and EAEU. Among the main topics are energy transition, the development of digital currency, and the modernisation of infrastructure. Innovations will be the topic of a separate section, "Technologies to Ensure Independence". Discussions are planned on cyber security, robotics, and the and the new materials industry. Another important track, "Financial Value System," is devoted to intellectual property protection and commercial arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region.Other parts of the forum are devoted mainly to domestic Russian topics. The Far Eastern Russia block will discuss the development of the Far Eastern Federal District, including agriculture, tourism, small business, and fisheries. Youth support and human capital development are included in the programme "People, Education, and Patriotism". In its turn, the "Master Plans: From Architecture to Economy" direction is devoted to the tools of integrated territorial development. Modernisation of the infrastructure framework of the Far East will be discussed at the "Transport and Logistics: New Routes" block. Special attention will be paid to the development of the Northern Sea Route and regional aviation.EEF-2024 will be not only a discussion platform but also a space for business meetings between Russian entrepreneurs and their counterparts from China, India, and ASEAN countries. In addition, events dedicated to cooperation through international organisations and associations are planned. Among them are the BRICS Creative Business Forum and the APEC International Conference on Cooperation in Higher Education.EEF participants and guests will also enjoy a cultural and sports programme presented by the Falcon Day International Forum, the Far East Street Exhibition, and the EEF Sport Games.The Eastern Economic Forum has been held regularly since 2015. In 2023, 2,400 business representatives from 62 countries took part in the EEF.TV BRICSGerman police have arrested a suspect for Friday's knife rampage in the western city of Solingen, an attack that killed three people and injured eight others.The three people who were stabbed to death were identified as two men aged 67 and 56 and a woman aged 56. Police said the attacker appeared to have deliberately aimed at the victims' throats.Early on Sunday, Dusseldorf police said in a joint statement with the prosecutor's office that the man arrested "stated that he was responsible for the attack". The statement said he had been arrested before, but gave no details."This person's involvement in the crime is currently being intensively investigated," the statement said.The Islamic State group claimed responsibility on Saturday, saying on Telegram that the attack was "in revenge for Muslims in Palestine and everywhere" and described the man who carried out the attack as a "soldier of the Islamic State".Germany is Israel's second-largest weapons supplier and the German government is regarded as deeply biased toward Israel in the current conflict between Israel and Palestine.Officials had earlier said a 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion he knew about the planned attack and failed to inform authorities, but that he was not the attacker. Later police made a second arrest of a man at a refugee center close to the site of the attack.The indiscriminate attack took place on Friday evening in the Fronhof market square in Solingen where live bands were playing during the Festival of Diversity to mark the city's 650th anniversary.The Bild newspaper reported that the man arrested was covered in blood when he approached officers just after 11 pm and said, "I'm the one you are looking for." Bild and news magazine Spiegel reported that the suspect had given himself up to the officers.He had reportedly been hiding in a backyard since the crime took place. Spiegel reported the suspect as a 26-year-old Syrian national who came to Germany in 2022 and applied for asylum in Bielefeld, about 150 kilometers northeast of Solingen."We are full of shock and grief," Solingen Mayor Tim-Oliver Kurzbach told reporters.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the attack "a terrible event that has shocked me greatly". "We must not accept something like this in our society … The full force of the law must be applied here," he said.In another development, French police said they have arrested a man suspected of starting fires and causing an explosion outside a synagogue early on Saturday in the southwest of the country.French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said "the alleged perpetrator" has been detained.French President Emmanuel Macron said on X that the attack was a "terrorist act".Agencies contributed to this story.BRUSSELS -- Several major airlines in European countries announced the suspension of flights to and from Israel and Lebanon Sunday following escalating hostilities between the two Mideast countries.According to French news channel BFMTV, Air France has decided to suspend its flights to Israel's Tel Aviv and Lebanon's Beirut until at least Monday due to growing tensions in the region."Today's and tomorrow's flights are canceled," an Air France spokesperson said, noting that the suspension could be extended after the company conducts a new assessment on Monday.Similarly, British Airways announced a suspension of flights to and from Israel's Tel Aviv until Wednesday."Due to the escalating situation in the region, Wizz Air is temporarily suspending flights to and from Israel on the 25th of August," Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air also posted on its website.Greek flag carrier Aegean Airlines canceled several flights to Israel and Beirut on Sunday. Its official website listed three flights to Tel Aviv and two flights to Beirut, including one scheduled for Monday, as canceled.German airline giant Lufthansa extended its suspension of flights to Beirut until Sept. 30, and to Tel Aviv and Tehran until Sept. 2.Israeli and Hezbollah forces engaged in extensive exchanges of fire early Sunday morning along the Israel-Lebanon border, marking a significant escalation in their longstanding conflict.Hezbollah claimed that it had launched hundreds of missiles into Israel in retaliation for the killing of its commander, Fouad Shokor, in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut last month. In response, Israel reported conducting numerous preemptive airstrikes targeting Hezbollah's rocket launchers in southern Lebanon.Following the most severe exchange of fire between the two sides in the Middle East, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defense Secretary John Healey both called their respective counterparts in Israel on Sunday, urging for an immediate ceasefire in the region, according to their posts on X, formerly known as Twitter.In early August, as tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border began to mount, many European countries urged their citizens to leave Lebanon. Meanwhile, some European carriers, including Air France and Romania's national airline TAROM, suspended their flights, although they later resumed services before this latest escalation.The Russia-born giant panda Katyusha celebrated her first birthday on Saturday with special cakes, a cheerful party and best wishes from Moscow citizens.Her keepers at the Moscow Zoo offered special desserts that took the shape of a large multitier cake made from her favorite bamboo and leaves. At the top of a cake, zoo staff members placed one bamboo shoot denoting the cub's age.Katyusha was also offered some desserts made from carrots, fruits and steamed cornbread.An improvised bamboo TV was also made in Katyusha's enclosure with a painted panda "leading" a news program.Katyusha was born at the Moscow Zoo in the late summer of last year, the first panda to be born in Russia. Her parents, Ru Yi and Ding Ding, giant pandas from China, met in the spring and immediately fell in love with each other, said Svetlana Akulova, director of Moscow Zoo.Ru Yi and Ding Ding arrived in Moscow in 2019.According to an agreement, two specialists from China will stay in the zoo for at least 120 days a year for 15 years, supervising and training Russian employees.Series of eventsIn order to celebrate the big event, the first birthday of the giant panda born in Russia, the zoo will be holding panda-themed workshops, excursions, quests, lectures, film screenings and traditional Chinese performances, in which everyone can take part, Akulova said."For example, guests could learn Chinese dance, try Chinese calligraphy and even take photos with a large Chinese dragon," she said, adding the Moscow Zoo has been decorated in Chinese style for the whole week with red lanterns and other Chinese elements.On Tuesday, there will be a lecture called Giant pandas — Mysterious guests from the East.Meanwhile, the film Katyusha — the first in Russia will be screened in the Moscow Zoo library, Akulova said.Chinese Ambassador to Russia Zhang Hanhui thanked the Moscow Zoo as well as experts from both countries for taking good care of the panda family.Zhang took part in a stamp-release ceremony on Saturday at the zoo. The postage stamp, dedicated to Katyusha and her parents, shows the healthy development of the panda family at the Moscow Zoo and reflects the friendship between China and Russia, he said.Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin called Katyusha the national favorite panda. At birth she weighed only 150 grams. Now, she is a 38-kilogram cub. Katyusha deftly climbs the logs, slides down the slide, and tries to repeat everything after her mother Ding Ding, Sobyanin said on his social media account.He noted that people come to the Moscow Zoo from all over the country to see the panda. About 15,000 people visit the Chinese Fauna Pavilion every day.MOSCOW -- Russia's defense ministry said Saturday that 115 Russian servicemen captured in the Kursk region were returned from the territory controlled by Ukraine as part of an exchange deal."In exchange, 115 prisoners of war of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were transferred," the ministry said, adding that the United Arab Emirates provided mediation efforts during the swap.All the exchanged Russian military personnel are currently in Belarus and will be sent to Russia for treatment and rehabilitation in medical institutions of the ministry, it said.MOSCOW/KYIV — Russia and Ukraine both reported new battlefield gains on Thursday, with Moscow saying that the Ukrainian drone attack on a nuclear power station was "an act of nuclear terrorism".The Ukrainian defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the development.The nuclear plant is located in the Kursk region of western Russia, where fierce fighting has raged since Ukrainian forces launched a surprise incursion on Aug 6.TASS quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying that it was an "act of nuclear terrorism" that required an immediate response from the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA.The head of the IAEA said on Thursday he will visit the Kursk power plant next week to assess the situation after Russia informed the agency of attempted attacks on the facility earlier in the day.IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said in a statement that he will assess the situation on-site and will discuss modalities for further activities needed to evaluate the nuclear safety and security conditions of the plant during his upcoming visit.Authorities in Kursk said they had begun installing concrete shelters to help protect civilians.In another development, Moscow said its troops had taken control of the village of Mezhove in the Donetsk region, and that they had beaten back an attempt by a Ukrainian force to infiltrate its border in a different region to Kyiv's Aug 6 incursion.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the seizure of a new village that he did not name, and said the incursion had helped reduce Russian shelling of the northeastern Sumy region.Also in Kyiv, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in the capital city on Friday, where he was due to meet with Zelensky. Officials in India and Ukraine said the visit was expected to focus on boosting economic ties and cooperation in defense, science and technology.Ukrainian media reported that Modi met with representatives of the Indian diaspora after arriving.Meanwhile in the United States, President Joe Biden's administration will send about $125 million in new military aid to Ukraine, officials said on Thursday.US officials said the latest package of aid includes air defense missiles, munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Javelins and an array of other anti-armor missiles.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid has not been publicly announced. The formal announcement could come as soon as Friday, which is the eve of Ukraine's Independence Day.The weapons are being provided through presidential drawdown authority, which means they are taken from Pentagon stockpiles and can be delivered more quickly.Agencies - XinhuaBERLIN -- At least three people were killed and several others injured in a knife attack in the western German city of Solingen on Friday evening, German media reported.The attack took place as a festival was underway to mark the 650th anniversary of the city's founding.At present, rescue workers are working on those injured.Some 80,000 people were reportedly present for the celebration. At about 10 p.m. local time, a man with a knife attacked people attending the event.Police then issued a major alert and a shooting alert. The celebration was immediately cancelled, and visitors were asked to leave.Police sources said no arrests have been made yet.BERLIN - Meng Meng, an 11-year-old female giant panda at Zoo Berlin, has given birth to twins, zoo authorities announced on Friday."The eagerly awaited second offspring of Meng Meng was born at 13:03 and 14:19 on Thursday in Zoo Berlin's Panda Garden," said the zoo in a press release.Both cubs are doing well and are lovingly cared for by their mum and the experienced panda team around the clock. The cubs weigh 169 g and 136 g and are about 14 cm long."Like other giant bears, giant pandas are born almost naked, deaf, blind and pink. The typical black and white panda markings only develop later. The sexes have not yet been determined with certainty," it said.As giant pandas usually only raise one cub when they give birth to twins, Zoo Berlin has decided to actively assist Meng Meng in raising her cubs in close cooperation with the experts at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding."We are delighted to have two experienced colleagues from the Chengdu Panda Base at our side to look after the cubs. With around 20 births a year, they have much more experience and are better able to assess the cubs' development," said biologist and panda curator Florian Sicks.Meng Meng arrived from China in 2017. In August 2019, she gave birth to the first-ever twin panda cubs, Meng Xiang and Meng Yuan, in Germany. The twins were sent back to China last December.Meng Meng was artificially inseminated on March 26 following intensive observation and careful preparation by an international team of experts.The first signs of a successful pregnancy emerged on Aug 11 when an ultrasound detected two heartbeats. Just 11 days later, the twins were born, following a gestation period of 149 days.The zoo said the now-experienced mother knew what to do immediately after the birth. "I am relieved that the two were born healthy. The little ones seem lively and mum Meng Meng takes great care of her offspring," said Zoo and Tierpark Director Andreas Knieriem.VIENNA - The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Thursday that he will visit the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) next week to assess the situation after Russia informed the agency of attempted attacks on the facility earlier in the day.IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said in a statement that he will assess the situation on site and discuss modalities for further activities needed to evaluate the nuclear safety and security conditions of the Kursk NPP during his upcoming visit.According to the statement, the United Nations nuclear watchdog was informed by Russia earlier on Thursday that "the remains of a drone were found within the territory of the Kursk NPP" and that "the drone was suppressed in the early morning" of that day."The drone fragments were reported to have been located roughly 100 meters from the plant's spent fuel nuclear storage facility," the statement read.Grossi warned that military activities near a nuclear power plant pose a serious risk to nuclear safety and security.With the end of the summer holiday in sight and the Paris Olympic Games having passed, French politicians are once again turning their attention to the business of trying to resolve the issue of who runs the country following the recent snap legislative election.The vote, across two rounds in June and July, was called by President Emmanuel Macron to see off the threat from the far-right National Rally party, or RN.But it was only partly successful as although his own centrist Ensemble coalition won more seats than RN in the National Assembly, the left-wing alliance, known as the New Popular Front, or NFP, ended up with the largest number of seats, but still no overall majority.This means the parliament is divided into three large blocs with major ideological differences, and six weeks since voting finished and the result became clear, the country still has the same cabinet and same prime minister, Gabriel Attal, in a caretaker capacity until a new government can be formed.Macron now faces the challenge of breaking the political logjam, and will start talks, initially with the NFP, on Friday."The appointment of a prime minister will follow on from these consultations and their conclusions," said a statement from the Elysee Palace. Macron, it continued, hoped "to continue to move toward the constitution of the broadest and most stable majority possible in the service of the country".NFP's leading prime ministerial candidate is left-wing economist Lucie Castets, but Macron has made it clear he would prefer someone with a wider base of support who is less likely to prompt a vote of no confidence in the government in the National Assembly.Other contenders include the Socialist Party's Bernard Cazeneuve, who previously served as prime minister from 2016-17 and has significant top-level ministerial experience, or if a more right-wing option is preferred, Xavier Bertrand of the Republicans party.Marine Le Pen and her protege Jordan Bardella, whose far-right National Rally came third in the second round of the legislative elections, will be taking their turn to speak with Macron on Monday, reported the France 24 news website.David Todd, a professor of modern history at Sciences Po University in Paris, told the website that the country is in uncharted political waters, and there is no clear way ahead."There's no precedent in the (post-1958) Fifth Republic to the situation we're in," he said."The current situation can only be provisional — everyone's just getting ready for the next election, whether that's a general or a presidential election. It's not really about running a government, but about running an electoral campaign."BERLIN - A significant increase in illegal migration to Europe was again observed in 2023, with Germany proving to be the main destination country in the European Union (EU), according to a report released Wednesday by the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA).The BKA said that the European Border and Coast Guard Agency reported approximately 380,200 unauthorized border crossings at EU/Schengen external borders last year, which represents the highest annual figure since 2016 and underscores growing pressures on Europe's borders.Within this EU-wide trend, Germany saw a particularly sharp increase. The BKA reported that 266,224 individuals were suspected of unauthorized entry and residence in Germany in 2023, marking a 33.4 percent increase compared to the previous year.A majority of these migrants entering Germany originated from Syria, with 54,207 arrivals, followed by 35,732 from Turkey and 35,370 from Afghanistan. "Many of these individuals depended on smugglers to facilitate their journey into Germany," the report said, adding that around 39,700 people suspected of being smuggled were checked at German borders last year.It also pointed to a disturbing rise in container smuggling. The number of cases doubled to about 1,200, while the number of individuals smuggled in this manner surged nearly fivefold to approximately 17,500."These operations often involved the use of easily rentable vans, which do not require special licenses, making them a preferred choice for smugglers," the BKA said.According to German public broadcaster ZDF, more than 200 escape attempts were reported across the country in 2023 in connection with so-called container smuggling, and one in four resulted in an accident.The increase in smuggling activities has been accompanied by a 26.6 percent rise in the number of registered smuggling suspects in the country and a 60.5 percent increase in the number of smuggling cases.The smuggling groups acted in a way that was increasingly risk-taking, and "ruthless towards the smuggled persons, uninvolved third parties and deployed police forces in order to evade control and thus prosecution," the report said.Messenger services like Telegram and WhatsApp were predominantly used for communication within smuggling networks, the BKA noted. ZDF also reported that smuggling organizations used social media platforms to market their services. Short videos promoting smuggling routes to Germany were actively shared on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. These platforms were also used to recruit drivers for smuggling operations.In light of the growing challenges posed by smuggling crimes, the BKA emphasized the need for enhanced cross-border cooperation among law enforcement authorities in countries of origin, transit, and destination, saying that such collaboration "remains crucial".BELGRADE -- The bodies of ten migrants were recovered after their boat capsized on the Drina River, according to Serbia's Interior Ministry and local media reports on Thursday.The incident occured late Wednesday night when around 30 migrants were taking a boat crossing from Serbia to Bosnia and Herzegovina. 18 people survived the incident, of whom 10 are minors, Serbian police confirmed.The search for the missing is still underway. Serbian police and the emergency situations sector responded promptly after being alerted early Thursday morning.The European Border and Coast Guard Agency, Frontex, reported a significant decrease in illegal border crossings in the Western Balkans during the first half of 2024. The illegal crossings towards EU borders reached 12,407 between January and July 2024, a 75 percent drop compared to the same period last year.Ukraine attacked Moscow on Wednesday with at least 11 drones that were shot down by air defenses in what Russian officials called one of the biggest drone strikes on the capital since its special military operation in Ukraine began in February 2022.The conflict, largely a grinding artillery and drone battle across the fields, forests and villages of eastern Ukraine, escalated on August 6 when Ukraine sent thousands of soldiers over the border into Russia's western Kursk region.For months, Ukraine has also fought an increasingly damaging drone war against the refineries and airfields of Russia, the world's second largest oil exporter, though major drone attacks on the Moscow region - with a population of over 21 million - have been rarer.Russia's defense ministry said its air defenses destroyed a total of 45 drones over Russian territory, including 11 over the Moscow region, 23 over the border region of Bryansk, six over the Belgorod region, three over the Kaluga region and two over the Kursk region.Some of the drones were shot down over the city of Podolsk, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said. The city, located in the Moscow region, is some 38 km south of the Kremlin."This is one of the largest attempts to attack Moscow using drones ever," Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app in the early hours of Wednesday. "The layered defense of Moscow that was created made it possible to successfully repel all the attacks from the enemy UAVs."Along Moscow's boulevards, cafes, restaurants and shops of the capital - which has been carefully insulated from the conflict - were crowded with little signs of concern.Moscow's airports, Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky, limited flights for four hours but restarted normal operations early in the morning, Russia's aviation watchdog said.Sobyanin said that according to preliminary information, there were no injuries or damage reported in the aftermath of the attacks. There were also no casualties or damage reported following the attack on Bryansk in Russia's southwest, the governor of the region, Alexander Bogomaz, wrote on Telegram.Ukrainian military's General Staff said in a statement that it struck an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system based in Russia's southern Rostov region overnight.Rostov governor Vasily Golubev said air defense forces had destroyed a Ukraine-launched missile over his region, but Russia's defense ministry made no mention of the incident in its daily statement on destroyed air weapons.In Russia's north Murmansk region, local authorities issued a drone attack warning on Wednesday, as local airports imposed flight restrictions following unverified reports of an unmanned aircraft being shot down.Shortly before the announcement, civil aviation authorities introduced flight restrictions at airports in the regional capital, Murmansk, and the town of Apatity.No drone attacks have previously been reported in the Murmansk region before. If confirmed, Wednesday's reported drone downing would mark the furthest a Ukrainian drone has flown into Russian territory.Russia meanwhile is advancing in eastern Ukraine, where it controls about 18 percent of the territory, and battling to repel Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region, the biggest foreign attack on Russian territory since World War II.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday Ukraine had not consulted Berlin about its August 6 shock incursion into Russia and that he expected that military operation to be limited in time and territory."Ukraine has prepared its military operation in the Kursk region very secretly and without feedback, which is certainly due to the situation," Scholz said. "This is a very limited operation in terms of space and probably also in terms of time."Separately, Scholz said Germany would continue to be what he said was Ukraine's biggest supporter in Europe after controversy in recent days over what some have called wavering German support for Kyiv over domestic politicking.MOSCOW -- Russia thwarted an attempted incursion by a Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group in the Klimovsky district of the Bryansk region Wednesday, regional governor Alexander Bogomaz said on his Telegram channel.Bogomaz confirmed that the breach was successfully prevented by the forces of the country's Federal Security Service and units of the Russian armed forces. The Ukrainian group sustained fire damage during the encounter, he said."The situation at the clash site has now been stabilized and is under the control of the regional operational headquarters," said Bogomaz.Citizens of the United Kingdom between the ages of 18 and 70 traveling to the European Union next year will have to pay a 7-euro ($7.80) visa-waiver fee, after the bloc finally announced May as the introduction date for its long-delayed new entry and exit system.The system, originally supposed to have been introduced in 2022, includes checks such as fingerprints and facial scans as security measures to reduce the risk of people traveling on fake passports.The European Travel Information and Authorisation System, or ETIAS, which comes into effect in November, requires citizens from visa-exempt countries including the UK, the United States, Australia and Canada to pay the permit fee before entering the 27-member bloc.The permit will be valid for three years or until the passport runs out, whichever comes first, and will cover travel to the whole of the 29-state Schengen Area free travel zone, which includes all EU states except Ireland and Cyprus, and in addition the non-EU states of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.After the ETIAS is introduced, there will be a six-month transition period, during which travelers will be expected to apply for the waiver, but will not necessarily be denied entry at the border if they have not done so, but it will kick in properly from May.Geographical proximityIt is a particular issue for British travelers because of their geographical proximity to the continent making frequent visits more likely, and because they have been used to free entry before the country left the EU.As part of the online application process, which could feasibly take up to 72 hours, British citizens must supply personal information, including their address, details of their job title and employer, or educational establishment for students, as well as any criminal convictions in the previous 20 years.With more than 700 million tourists having entered Europe last year, The Times newspaper quoted EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson as saying the entry and exit system would mean every single airport, harbor or road into Europe would have strict digital border controls, and as a result, European citizens could "sleep safer".But there is concern that longer and repetitive process could cause delays and missed flights for travelers."Turn up without (a permit) and, like the US, you won't be allowed in," an unnamed travel industry source told The Times. "It's going to catch people out, I am sure."Searches resumed for a third day on Wednesday on the wreck of a luxury yacht that sank off Sicily, with hope fading that the six missing passengers would be found alive.The search operation, which involves specialist divers aided by an underwater drone, continued until late on Tuesday and resumed at first light on Wednesday morning, firefighters said.Six people, including Jonathan Bloomer, chairman of Morgan Stanley International bank, British technology mogul Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah, and Chris Morvillo, a lawyer from Clifford Chance, remain missing following the sinking of the yacht about 700 meters from the Sicilian coast on Monday, according to Sicily's Civil Protection Agency.The Bayesian, a 56-meter yacht, was carrying a total of 22 people — 12 passengers and 10 crew members — comprising British, United States and Canadian nationals.The luxury yacht went down at about 5 am local time, after a heavy storm caused waterspouts, or rotating columns of air and mist, reported the BBC.Fifteen individuals were rescued, among them a 1-year-old British girl.Italian news agency ANSA cited witnesses saying the Bayesian had dropped anchor when the storm hit, resulting in the mast snapping and the vessel capsizing before sinking.Specialized fire and rescue divers, experts in confined-space operations, were flown in from Rome and Sardinia on Monday, said the BBC.Firefighters said on Tuesday evening that divers had entered the inside of the wreck, but that it was a "long and complex" operation.The yacht is largely intact, resting on the seabed some 50 meters down.Bodies foundOn Wednesday, divers found two bodies in the shipwreck, said a source close to the search. It was not immediately clear who had been found.The discovery brings the confirmed death toll to three.Previously, Sicily's Civil Protection Agency confirmed the body of the ship's cook, a Canadian who had been residing in Antigua, had been recovered, according to Italian newspaper la Repubblica.Lynch, dubbed "the British Bill Gates" in media reports, is a technology entrepreneur, who recently celebrated his acquittal in a high-profile fraud case related to the $11 billion sale of his company, Autonomy, to US computing giant Hewlett-Packard. He had reportedly been facing two decades in jail and invited his legal team aboard the yacht to celebrate the result of the case.The incident in Sicily coincides with the death of Lynch's co-defendant in the fraud case, Stephen Chamberlain, after an accident in Cambridgeshire in the United Kingdom on Saturday. Chamberlain was hit by a car while jogging.Morvillo, a prominent lawyer, worked on Lynch's trial and the investigation into the 9/11 New York terror attacks in 2001. Bloomer is the 70-year-old British chairman of Morgan Stanley International and of insurance company Hiscox. Both their wives are among the six missing individuals.A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley said the company was "deeply shocked and saddened" and added, "Our thoughts are with all those affected, in particular the Bloomer family, as we all wait for further news from this terrible situation."Agencies contributed to this story.PRAGUE -- Czech police on Wednesday evacuated 582 people from the vicinity of a chemical plant in the country's Northwest region due to "a high risk of explosion" after the discovery of an unexploded bomb."An unexploded aerial bomb from World War II" was found during excavation work in a remote part of the Orlen Unipetrol plant near Litvinov, Most District, the Czech refining and petrochemical company said in a statement on its website.Experts from the police and the regional fire rescue department intervened, and a partial evacuation was ordered in the refinery part of the plant."The bomb weighing 250 kg will remain in place until Aug 27. A crisis team is now meeting to decide on the next course of action," said the police.Unexploded munitions from World War II have been found repeatedly in the Most District in the past, according to the Czech News Agency. In May 2021, 5,400 people had to be evacuated after an aerial bomb was found on the premises of a chemical plant.LONDON -- A woman and three children died on Wednesday in a house fire in Bradford, the United Kingdom (UK). Police believe the fire was "started deliberately."Emergency services arriving at the scene of the fire in the early hours of Wednesday found a 29-year-old woman who had already died. Three children - two girls and a boy - were taken to hospital, but later died from injuries sustained in the fire.A 39-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder, and taken to hospital with critical injuries."Whilst inquiries are at their early stages, we believe that the fire was started deliberately and this incident was domestic-related," Superintendent Lucy Leadbeater of West Yorkshire Police told reporters.She said a murder investigation has been launched. PARIS -- The European Space Agency (ESA)'s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) has successfully completed the world's first lunar-Earth flyby, using the gravity of Earth to send it Venus-bound, on a shortcut to Jupiter through the inner Solar System, ESA said on Wednesday.The flyby, which took place on Monday and Tuesday, was to reroute Juice's path through space, using the gravity of first the Moon and then Earth to change the spacecraft's speed and direction, according to ESA.The flyby of the Moon increased Juice's speed by 0.9 km/s relative to the Sun, guiding Juice toward Earth. The flyby of Earth reduced Juice's speed by 4.8 km/s relative to the Sun, guiding Juice onto a new trajectory towards Venus. Overall, the lunar-Earth flyby deflected Juice by an angle of 100 degrees compared to its pre-flyby path.Jupiter is on average 800 million km away from Earth. Without an enormous rocket, sending Juice straight to the giant planet would require an impossible 60,000 kg of onboard propellant. And then Juice would need to be carrying an enormous additional amount of propellant to slow itself down enough to go into orbit around Jupiter once it arrives.Launched on an Ariane 5 from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou in April 2023, Juice has an eight-year cruise with flybys of Earth and Venus to slingshot it to Jupiter. The spacecraft will make detailed observations of gas giant Jupiter and its three large ocean-bearing moons-Ganymede, Callisto and Europa-to discover more about these destinations as potential habitats for past or present life. OSLO -- Denmark and Sweden have announced plans to strengthen their cooperation in response to a recent surge in violent crimes, which have involved Swedish teenagers being used as mercenaries in Denmark. The justice ministers from both countries made the announcement during a joint press conference in Copenhagen on Wednesday."The gangs' willingness to resort to violence knows no bounds. Therefore, our response must be strong and coordinated," said Danish Minister of Justice Peter Hummelgaard. He emphasized the importance of the two countries working together to apply pressure on nations where the masterminds behind these gang conflicts are believed to be hiding.As part of this agreement, Denmark and Sweden will enhance their cooperation, particularly through the exchange of information. The two Nordic countries also plan to intensify efforts to prevent the recruitment of children and young people into gangs via social media and other digital platforms.Swedish Minister of Justice Gunnar Strommer highlighted the need for Sweden to fundamentally overhaul its policies in the fight against gang-related crimes. He announced that the Swedish government intends to increase penalties for gang crimes to align more closely with those in Denmark.Hummelgaard said earlier this month that the Danish authorities knew of 25 cases where criminal groups in Denmark have hired Swedes to commit crimes in Denmark. ROME -- Five bodies were recovered Wednesday from the hull of the striken Bayesian yacht that sank in a freak storm on Monday, though searches are ongoing with one last passenger unaccounted for.The 56-meter ship was anchored near the shore of Porticello on the southern Italian island of Sicily when it was hit by a severe storm. Authorities said a powerful waterspout snapped the ship's main mast and flipped the yacht before it quickly sank beneath the waves.Fifteen of 22 passengers and crew members were immediately rescued, with eight of them rushed to local hospitals. The body of one crew member was quickly found near the spot where the boat went down.Hindered by severe weather and the unusual positioning of the sunken yacht, a team of divers working in 12-minute shifts, with the help of a remote-controlled undersea search robot, had trouble accessing the inside of the ship before Wednesday. That was when divers first found two bodies and then, later, two more, and according to news reports, a fifth body later in the day. In an effort to stimulate its slow-moving economy, Sweden's central bank has again lowered interest rates and suggested the possibility of several more rate reductions this year.The Riksbank decreased its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.5 percent on Tuesday, which is the second time this year it has lowered borrowing costs.Major central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have been maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation, although the European Central Bank and the Bank of England made their first cuts in several years this summer, signaling a potential shift in global monetary policy.Being outside the eurozone enables Sweden to have its own central bank and set its own monetary policy, allowing it to adjust interest rates based on its specific economic conditions."If the inflation outlook remains the same, the policy rate can be cut two or three more times this year, which is somewhat faster than the executive board assessed in June," the Swedish central bank said in a statement.Recent months have seen Sweden's inflation rate drop below its 2 percent target, coupled with the economic slowdown. The bank justified its decision by citing sluggish economic growth both domestically and internationally.Cited by Euronews, Lars Jonung, professor emeritus at the Knut Wicksell Centre for Financial Studies at Lund University, said: "The prime driver of the reduction is the decline of the Swedish inflation rate … which is close to the inflation target of the Riksbank of 2 percent."A secondary reason is that the Swedish economy is not booming, but rather Sweden is in a recession with a high rate of unemployment, one of the highest in the EU."Euronews noted that Sweden's economy, which is characterized by its heavy reliance on international trade and high household debt, is particularly vulnerable to monetary policy fluctuations. Changes in rates directly impact mortgage payments, consequently suppressing consumer spending.The largest Nordic economy has seen housing prices plummet, partly due to the prevalence of short-term fixed-rate mortgages, reported the Financial Times newspaper.Sweden's economy has been among the weakest in Europe this year, with the country's statistics agency recently warning that multiple indicators suggest the nation is experiencing a "clear recession", said the paper.The FT cited economists at Nordea, the region's largest bank, as saying "there are simply few arguments to keep the policy rate at restrictive levels as inflation is under control, the labor market is weakening, and global rates have come down, reducing the depreciation pressure on the krona exchange rates".The Riksbank began its rate-cutting cycle in May, being among the first central banks to do so in nearly eight years. It maintained its key rate at 3.75 percent in June, hinting at potential future cuts due to decreasing price pressures.Sweden's rate move comes as financial experts anticipate potential interest rate reductions from the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve during their upcoming September meetings, said the FT. The United Kingdom is planning to increase its inventory of government-owned subsidized homes, so it can help more people keep a roof over their head.The expansion of the government's property portfolio will be funded, in part, by an increase in rents charged on properties it already owns, unnamed government sources told the Financial Times newspaper.They said the country's finance minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, who took over when the Labour Party came to power after the general election on July 4, will raise social housing rents by 1 percent more than inflation in each of the coming 10 years.She is expected to introduce the plan in her annual budget in October.The move will ensure not-for-profit housing associations and local governments have the confidence to build more affordable homes, the paper said.Gavin Smart, chief executive of professional housing body the Chartered Institute of Housing, told the paper the affordable housing sector craves certainty."It is clear that ministers and officials understand that a rent settlement needs to be one that landlords and investors can rely on for a long period," he said.Around 4 million UK households live in subsidized accommodation but 109,000 other families are in temporary accommodation because there are not enough homes to meet demand.The Daily Mail newspaper said Reeves will likely also need to increase government income through tax hikes — likely inheritance tax and capital gains tax — in her Oct 30 budget, because of the 22-billion-pound ($28.7-billion) "black hole" in public finances she says her government inherited from the previous Conservative Party administration.Additionally, the government has been accruing more debt, with the Office for National Statistics saying on Wednesday public-sector net borrowing had risen to 3.1 billion pounds in July, from 1.8 billion pounds during the same period last year.The desired expansion of the UK's subsidized housing portfolio against the backdrop of shrinking government coffers comes as the nation's private-sector rental market has left many people in a so-called "price trap".Online property portal Zoopla says 17 people are currently chasing every available rental home, and that rents are rising faster than average earnings, which means many people cannot afford to move.Zoopla said rents rose by 5.7 percent in the private-sector market in the year ending June 2024, which was an improvement on the situation in the previous year, when rents went up by 12.3 percent. In the year before that, when 30 to 35 prospective tenants chased every available property, rents rose by 20 percent.Richard Donnell, Zoopla's executive director, told the BBC: "We have moved from a red-hot market over the last couple of years, to one which is still hot, but cooling."2024 CHINA FOCUS has been officially launched at the Edinburgh Festivals, showcasing eight outstanding Chinese theater productions. Launched in 2017, CHINA FOCUS serves as an artistic and dynamic platform for fostering innovation in the Sino-UK creative industries.Video by Han Jing.MOSCOW - Russia destroyed 45 Ukrainian drones overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, including 11 over the Moscow region, the Russian Ministry of Defense said on Wednesday.There were 11 drones shot down over the territory of the Moscow region, one of the largest drone attacks on Moscow ever, Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.Another 23 drones were destroyed over the Bryansk region, six were shot down over the Belgorod region, three over the Kaluga region and two over the Kursk region, the defense ministry said.Meanwhile, three counterattacks of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Avdeyevka direction were disrupted overnight, the ministry said.London City Airport has been given permission to increase its passenger numbers by more than one-third, as part of the new British government's program of projects to boost growth.The airport is located in the Royal Docks, a short distance from the capital's two main commerce hubs, the City of London and Canary Wharf, which makes it particularly popular with business travelers.The Labour Party put measures to increase growth at the heart of its manifesto for the general election that it won in July, restoring it to government after 14 years, and the newly expanded services will see passenger numbers rise from 6.5 million to 9 million by 2031.London City Airport serves a variety of short-haul destinations across Europe, including winter sports locations when there is seasonal demand.In 2009, it began offering a business class service to JFK Airport in New York, but this was suspended at the start of the pandemic, and scrapped altogether in August 2020.Despite being so close to business hubs, the airport is also surrounded by residential areas in the Borough of Newham, whose council had initially blocked plans for increased services.The airport appealed to the government, which overturned the council's decision, but as a concession to local residents, refused a bid for additional flights on Saturday afternoons, and also ruled that quieter craft must be used for any early morning flights.News of the expansion has provoked a mixed response, with environmental campaigners saying many of the journeys made by users of the airport could be done by train instead, and that the decision undermines the government's ambition to be a world leader in climate change and net-zero initiatives.London City Airport chief executive Alison Fitzgerald welcomed the expansion to service, but said the limits on weekend flight could cause delays to quieter and greener craft being introduced by airlines."Local residents would have had the added benefit of these aircraft operating at the airport throughout the week, not just in the extended operating hours," she said.Newham mayor Rokhsana Fiaz called the weekend flight restrictions a "victory" for local residents, but told Sky News she had worries about an increase in early morning flights from six to nine, which she called "deeply" concerning."We will be studying the decision notice carefully and considering all options as we remain concerned about the detrimental impacts on the health and quality of life of our residents," she added. BRUSSELS -- The European Union (EU) has approved a 5-billion-euro ($5.56 billion) state subsidy from Germany to support the construction and operation of a new microchip manufacturing plant, the European Commission announced on Tuesday.The facility, known as the European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, will be located in the city of Dresden in eastern Germany. It is expected to reach full operational capacity by 2029, with an annual production of 480,000 silicon wafers.According to the European Commission, the plant will produce chips using 300 mm silicon wafers, with node sizes ranging from 28/22 to 16/12 nanometers, primarily targeting automotive and industrial applications.The project aligns with the EU's plan of doubling its global market share in semiconductors to 20 percent by 2030, as outlined in the European Chips Act.Europe has traditionally been reliant on the import of chips and wafers. The European automotive sector has been hard hit in recent years by a lack of semiconductors, severely limiting the industry's capacity.Aiming to mobilize more than 43 billion euros from public and private investments, the European Commission introduced the EU Chips Act in 2022 to achieve its strategic independence from semiconductor imports, enabling it to react faster to supply chain issues. PRAGUE -- A bus and a lorry collided Tuesday in western Slovakia, leaving seven people injured, local media reported.The accident occurred near the village of Turna in the Kosice region Tuesday afternoon. All the injured were conscious, the News Agency of the Slovak Republic reported, adding that six ambulances and a helicopter were sent to the site.The road was closed in both directions and a mother with two children was among the injured, local police said on Facebook. It's not yet known how many people were on the bus. An investigation is underway.The United Kingdom's newest spaceport, on the tiny Scottish island of Unst, has been rocked by a massive explosion after a rocket engine failed during testing by the German company Rocket Factory Augsburg, or RFA.The enterprise hopes to eventually launch the UK's first vertical-takeoff rocket and was moving forward with the project on the island, which is part of the Shetland Islands, by conducting trials.RFA said no one was injured in the incident at the SaxaVord Spaceport on Monday night. It also said the launch pad itself was not damaged.The BBC said the explosion at the former Royal Air Force base was preceded by large flames and smoke "shooting horizontally from the bottom of the rocket" before the entire structure was engulfed in flames.The spaceport, which only opened three months ago, has received approval from the UK's Civil Aviation Authority to start launching spaceships this year and is the first facility in Western Europe to be licensed to launch vessels vertically. It has approval to carry out 30 such operations a year and is expected to become a major part of the UK's participation in the space industry.In addition to RFA, the German rocket-maker HyImpulse has expressed an interest in using the spaceport, as has United States aviation giant Lockheed Martin, and Edinburgh-based Skyrora.However, the site has not yet completed a successful launch.A spokesman for SaxaVord Spaceport said: "This was a test, and test campaigns are designed to identify issues prior to the next stage. We will work with RFA to understand and learn from the causes and support them as they move forward to the next phase of their preparations."RFA has high hopes of building a European rocket company that might, one day, be capable of challenging Elon Musk's SpaceX and wants to use the 30-meter rocket it is developing to carry payloads into a low-Earth-orbit.If Monday's test had been successful, all nine of the rocket's engines would have been fired up while the rocket itself would have remained on the ground.The spaceport said its employees and those of RFA were never in any danger because everyone had been evacuated from the site before testing began. The spaceport added that it will fully cooperate with any official investigation into the failure.The UK currently has lofty ambitions to become a leader in the global space industry and already has almost 50,000 people working in the sector at more than 2,000 companies worth a collective 17.5 billion pounds ($22.8 billion).The UK's only other spaceport, in the county of Cornwall in southwest England, was the first to become operational but is not licensed to launch vessels vertically and instead puts them into orbit piggy-backed on an aircraft. The country also has several other spaceports under construction. Six individuals, including Jonathan Bloomer, chairman of Morgan Stanley International bank, and Chris Morvillo, a lawyer from Clifford Chance, remain missing following the sinking of a luxury yacht off the Sicilian coast during a storm on Monday, according to Sicily's Civil Protection agency.British technology mogul Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah were initially reported missing after the incident about 700 meters from the Mediterranean island's shore.The Bayesian, a 56-meter yacht, was carrying a total of 22 people – 12 passengers and 10 crew members – comprising British, United States, and Canadian nationals.The luxury yacht went down near Palermo's coast at around 5 am local time, after a heavy storm caused waterspouts, or rotating columns of air and mist, reported the BBC.Fifteen individuals were rescued, among them a 1-year-old British girl.Sicily's Civil Protection Agency confirmed that the body of the ship's cook, a Canadian who had been residing in Antigua, had been recovered, according to Italian newspaper la Repubblica.Italian news agency Ansa cited witnesses saying the Bayesian had its anchor down when the storm hit, resulting in the mast snapping and the vessel capsizing before sinking.According to local media, Salvo Cocina of Sicily's Civil Protection Agency said: "They were in the wrong place at the wrong time."Specialized fire and rescue divers, experts in confined-space operations, were flown in from Rome and Sardinia on Monday, said the BBC.However, their initial exploration of the sunken vessel, located approximately 50 meters beneath the surface, proved unsuccessful."Access was limited only to the bridge, with difficulty due to the presence of furniture obstructing passage," the Italian fire department stated in a social media post.Mike Lynch, dubbed "the British Bill Gates" in media reports, is a technology entrepreneur, who recently celebrated his acquittal in a high-profile fraud case related to the $11 billion sale of his company, Autonomy, to US computing giant Hewlett-Packard, or HP. He had reportedly been facing two decades in jail, and invited his legal team aboard the yacht to celebrate the result of the case.The incident in Sicily coincides with the death of Lynch's co-defendant in the fraud case, Stephen Chamberlain, after an accident in Cambridgeshire, in the United Kingdom on Saturday. Chamberlain was hit by a car while jogging.Morvillo, a prominent lawyer, worked on Lynch's trial and the investigation into the 2001 9/11 New York terror attacks. Bloomer is the 70-year-old British chairman of Morgan Stanley International and of insurance company Hiscox. Both their wives are among the six missing individuals.Lynch's wife, Angela Bacares, was rescued along with 14 others, including a mother who held her 1-year-old baby above the waves, reported Sky News.A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley said the company was "deeply shocked and saddened" and added: "Our thoughts are with all those affected, in particular the Bloomer family, as we all wait for further news from this terrible situation."KYIV - The Ukrainian army has taken control of 92 settlements in western Russia's Kursk region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday.Ukrainian troops have seized more than 1,250 square kilometers of Russian territory, Zelensky said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter."The Russian border area opposite our Sumy region has been mostly cleared of Russian military presence," Zelensky said.The Ukrainian army continues its military operation in the designated areas of the Kursk region, he added.Ukraine started a military operation in the Kursk region on Aug 6. On Aug 15, Oleksandr Syrsky, commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said that his army had captured 82 settlements in the region.BAKU - President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Russia's commitment to supporting the normalization of relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia during a state visit to Baku on Monday.Speaking after talks with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, Putin emphasized Russia's role in facilitating a peace agreement based on the trilateral accords reached in 2020 and 2022 by the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia."We are prepared to assist in the delimitation and demarcation of the border, utilizing relevant Soviet-era documents, as well as in unblocking cross-border routes and establishing humanitarian contacts," Putin stated.Despite ongoing crises, including the situation in Ukraine, Putin underscored Russia's historical involvement in the South Caucasus and its commitment to participating in these efforts. He noted that any initiative must be primarily driven by the parties involved."If we can contribute to reaching a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia, achieve delimitation and demarcation of the border, and unblock necessary logistics and economic routes, we would be very pleased," Putin added.The European Union's decision to levy additional tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles could be counterproductive, as it puts the bloc's decarbonization goals at risk, experts said.Stephen Perry, honorary president of the 48 Group Club, a London-based nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Sino-British trade cooperation, said the tariffs could slow down the EU's transition from petrol cars to electric vehicles."It is a good time for European carmakers to make the transition. They are not prepared for this. China will enter joint ventures in Europe if the approach of the EU is friendly. Otherwise, the situation may deteriorate," he said."Sharing is the way forward, not battles. Everyone needs to remember that we are all supposed to be cooperating to help reduce carbon emissions. China is sharing its progress.""Now is not the time for the EU to compete with the United States for the tough-man title," Perry added, alluding to the general perception that the imposition of additional tariffs mirror the US strategy of pushing for de-risking and decoupling from China.The European Commission on June 12 announced temporary countervailing duties on battery electric vehicles imported from China, based on its anti-subsidy probe launched last October.The commission's primary executive arm provisionally concluded that the BEV value chain in China benefits from what it called "unfair" subsidization, which it claimed posed a threat to European BEV manufacturers.Different manufacturers will be taxed differently. The initial decision imposes a 17.4 percent tariff on BYD, 19.9 percent on Geely, and 37.6 percent on SAIC. These are in addition to the existing 10 percent import tariff the EU imposes on all non-EU electric vehicle manufacturers.While it is right for the EU to value its homemade goods, Chris Aylett, a research associate at the Environment and Society Centre at Chatham House, a London-based independent policy institute, highlighted in an analysis that the restrictions on Chinese BEVs jeopardize the union's legally binding climate targets of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and at least a 55 percent reduction by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.This is especially concerning given that clean products manufactured in Europe remain expensive, and EU-level investment in the industry falls "far short" with no signs of improvement, Aylett said, suggesting that the union will need to rely on China's imports."These targets are ambitious," he said. "With 2022 marking a reduction of 32.5 percent, accelerated and sustained action will be needed. This implies deploying mass-market clean technology products like solar panels and electric vehicles in very large numbers.""And when it comes to cheap, clean technology, China is the undisputed world leader. Two decades of consistent and targeted industrial policy, combined with the benefits of a huge domestic market, mean that China today produces extremely competitively priced, high-quality, low-carbon goods," he added."All else being equal, anything which stems the flow of the cheapest low-carbon products will increase the cost of the transition and slow it down," he concluded.Zulkafil Hassan Khan, president of the Society of International Relations & Law at the Institute of Legal Studies in Pakistan and director of the Pak-China Corridor of Knowledge, said in an op-ed for China Daily that the tariffs make the EU an "obvious loser", as it could fall behind other countries in realizing a green future."It would result in increasing the prices of the (EU) EVs because of which domestic automobile producers would face less competition," he said. "Simultaneously, the tariffs would open new markets for Chinese EV manufacturers."He added that Chinese firms have started picking up shares in countries with small domestic auto industries, such as Australia and New Zealand, which shows that the EU is the obvious loser in this case.Stephan Ossenkopp, a senior researcher at the Germany-based think tank Schiller Institute, pointed out in his op-ed piece for China Daily that "the real challenge for the European electric vehicle industry comes from developments within Europe, not imports from China."PORTICELLO, Sicily — British tech magnate Mike Lynch and five other people were missing after their luxury superyacht sank during a freak storm off Sicily early Monday, Italy's civil protection and authorities said. Lynch's wife and 14 other people survived.Lynch, who was acquitted in June in a big US fraud trial, was among six people who remain unaccounted for after their chartered sailboat sank off Porticello, near Palermo, sometime after 4 am. A tornado over the water known as a waterspout had struck the area overnight, said Salvo Cocina of Sicily's civil protection agency.One body was recovered, and police divers spent the day trying to reach the hull of the ship, which was resting at a depth of 50 meters (163 feet) off Porticello where it had been anchored, rescue authorities said. They returned to the site after 10 pm to see if it would be possible to search through the night, when weather conditions were expected to worsen, said Luca Cari, spokesman of the fire rescue service.The ship had a crew of 10 people and 12 passengers, the Italian coast guard said. A sudden fierce storm had battered the area overnight, and a waterspout struck precisely where the 56-meter (184-foot) British-flagged Bayesian had been moored."They were in the wrong place at the wrong time," said Cocina, noting that another big ship nearby, the Sir Robert Baden Powell, wasn't as badly damaged and helped rescue the 15 survivors — including Lynch's wife, Angela Bacares.The Bayesian was notable for its single 75-meter (246-feet) mast — one of the world's tallest made of aluminum and which was lit up at night, just hours before it sank. Online charter sites listed it for rent for up to 195,000 euros (about $215,000) a week.One of the survivors, identified as Charlotte Golunski, said she momentarily lost hold of her 1-year-old daughter Sofia in the water, but then managed to hold her up over the waves until a lifeboat inflated and they were both pulled to safety, Italian news agency ANSA reported. The father, identified by ANSA as James Emslie, also survived, said Cocina.Karsten Borner, the captain of the Sir Robert Baden Powell, said he had noticed the Bayesian nearby during the storm but after it calmed he saw a red flare and realized the ship had simply disappeared, ANSA and the Giornale di Sicilia newspaper reported. Borner said he and a crew member boarded their tender and found a lifeboat with 15 people, some of them injured, who they then took aboard and alerted the coast guard.Eight of those rescued were hospitalized while the others were taken to a hotel. One body believed to be the cook was found near the wreck, but six others were unaccounted for and believed inside the hull, said Cari, the fire rescue spokesperson. The rescue operations, which were visible from shore, involved helicopters and rescue boats from the coast guard, fire rescue and civil protection service.Cocina said the crew and passengers hailed from a variety of countries: In addition to Britain and the United States, passengers and crew were from Antigua, France, Germany, Ireland, Myanmar, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain, he said.The UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch is deploying a team of four inspectors to Italy to conduct a preliminary assessment. The Foreign Commonwealth and Development office said it was "providing consular support to a number of British nationals and their families."Dutch foreign ministry spokesperson Casper Soetekouw said the lone Dutch citizen on board, a man, had been rescued and was not in life-threatening condition. Lynch, once hailed as Britain's king of technology, was cleared in June of fraud and conspiracy charges related to Hewlett Packard's $11 billion takeover of his company, Autonomy Corp.The not guilty verdicts followed an 11-week criminal trial in San Francisco that delved into the history of HP's 2011 acquisition of Autonomy, a business software firm founded by Lynch.The fraud accusations represented a dramatic turn in the fortunes of an entrepreneur once described as the Bill Gates of Britain — a title he seemed to live up to when he netted an $800 million from the Autonomy sale.The acquittal vindicated Lynch, who had vehemently denied wrong doing and portrayed HP as a technological train wreck."I'm looking forward to returning the UK and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field," Lynch said in a statement released after the verdict.The yacht, built in 2008 by the Italian firm Perini Navi, can accommodate 12 passengers in four double cabins, a triple and the master suite, plus crew accommodations, according to Charter World and Yacht Charters.The vessel, which previously was named Salute when it flew under a Dutch flag, featured a sleek, minimalist interior of light wood with Japanese accents designed by the French designer Remi Tessier, according to descriptions and photos on the charter sites.AP A record surge in irregular migrant arrivals from Africa is impacting regions of Spain, with the Canary Islands experiencing a 126 percent increase and the autonomous city of Ceuta on the southern side of the Strait of Gibraltar seeing a 143 percent rise in the first two weeks of August compared to the same period last year.According to the Spanish Interior Ministry, 31,155 irregular migrants entered Spain between January and August, a 66.2 percent increase from the previous year, with the majority arriving by small boat.The influx primarily originates from Mauritania and the Sahel region, where escalating violence is forcing thousands to flee, reported Euractiv news website.Spain serves as a key entry point into the European Union for migrants, with routes including the perilous Atlantic journey from West Africa to the Canary Islands and crossings, including to Ceuta, at the Spanish-Moroccan border.Experts often describe the Spain-Morocco border as one of the world's most economically unequal. World Bank data underscores this disparity, revealing a stark contrast in GDP per capita between the two nations. While Spain boasts a figure of nearly $32,677, Morocco's GDP stands at a much lower $3,672.The migration issue has become a contentious political topic in Spain, with far-right parties including VOX using it to criticize Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's progressive socialist government.Regional authorities are struggling to cope with the influx of illegal migrants, with the Canary Islands facing the additional challenge of accommodating almost 6,000 unaccompanied minors after receiving 22,304 migrants between January and mid-August, while Ceuta confronts what its local government describes as an "unsustainable" situation due to the arrival of hundreds of children.In response to the crisis, regional political party Coalicion Canaria has urged immediate action from the government, calling on Sanchez to take "two hours out of his holidays to address the migration emergency".The situation has escalated to the point where opposition leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo, head of the Spanish People's Party, has called on the government to declare a "migratory emergency", and another of the party's politicians last month suggested deploying the army to manage the crisis.While the Western African route records unprecedented numbers, data from Frontex, the EU's external border agency, shows a 64 percent decrease in irregular journeys on the Central Mediterranean migration route to Europe during the first seven months of the year, highlighting the varying migration trends across Europe, reported Italian news agency ANSA.Frontex said the decline in migration on this route can be linked to proactive steps taken by Libya and Tunisia, following agreements with the EU and individual governments. "Arrivals from those two countries account for 95 percent of all migrants reported on the Central Mediterranean route," it noted.On the English Channel route to the United Kingdom, the number of detections in the first seven months of this year has increased by 22 percent, Frontex said. The United Kingdom may be complicit in Gaza war crimes, according to a British diplomat who has resigned over the issue.Mark Smith, who was second secretary at the UK's embassy in Ireland, said in his resignation letter: "Each day, we witness clear and unquestionable examples of war crimes and breaches of international humanitarian law in Gaza perpetuated by the state of Israel."He said the fact that the UK has supplied weapons to Israel while "senior members of the Israeli government and military have expressed open genocidal intent" means the British government could be held legally responsible."I can no longer carry out my duties in the knowledge that this department may be complicit in war crimes," he added.As examples of potential crimes, he highlighted Israeli soldiers taking videos of colleagues "deliberately burning, destroying and looting civilian property".Israel has insisted its activities in Gaza are legal and in measured response to an Oct 7 attack in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed.The authorities in Gaza have said at least 40,000 people in the territory have been killed in the nine months that have followed, prompting the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes.Smith said he used to oversee arms export licenses while working in the British government's Middle East and North African Department, and that arms exports to Israel must stop immediately."There is no justification for the UK's continued arms sales to Israel and yet somehow it continues," he wrote. "I have raised this at every level in the organization, including through an official whistleblowing investigation, and received nothing more than 'thank you we have noted your concern'."He said UK ministers' claims that the UK carefully controls arms exports "is the opposite of the truth".Smith later told the BBC: "When you look at what constitutes a war crime, it's actually quite clear — even from what you see in open source on the TV — that the state of Israel is perpetrating war crimes in plain sight."Sky News quoted a Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson as saying the UK fully complies with international law."We have made clear that we will not export items if they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law," the spokesperson said.Analysis by the Campaign Against Arms Trade claims the UK has exported more than 576 million pounds ($747 million) of weapons to Israel since 2008.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy ordered a review of those arms sales after the Labour Party was elected to govern the country on July 4. The review is ongoing.THE HAGUE -- The Dutch public health authority, RIVM, said on Monday that healthcare providers are on high alert for potential infections from a new variant of the mpox virus."If a case is detected, the Municipal Health Service will conduct source and contact tracing and provide guidance to prevent further transmission," the RIVM said. "Vaccination is available for close contacts. The Netherlands has sufficient vaccines in stock."RIVM virologist Chantal Reusken told local media that it is probably only a matter of time before a new variant of mpox appears in the Netherlands. But the risk is low and the disease is manageable due to the country's robust healthcare system, said Reusken.Mpox, caused by an orthopoxvirus, was prevalent in West and Central Africa. However, in the spring of 2022, cases began emerging in Europe without direct links to those regions. Following a peak in summer 2022, the number of cases sharply declined by autumn. There were a total of 1,316 confirmed cases to date in the Netherlands.In 2024, a more deadly variant, Clade 1b, emerged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries. On Aug 14, the World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern, activating its highest level of global alert for mpox for the second time in two years.On Aug 15, Sweden reported the first case of the new variant outside Africa.MOSCOW - Russia has officially requested Germany to investigate the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said Monday.Russia is pushing for negotiations to ensure Germany meets its international obligations in the fight against terrorism, said Oleg Tyapkin, director of the Third European Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry, in an interview with Russia's RIA Novosti news agency.Expressing dissatisfaction with the progress of the German investigation, Tyapkin said that German authorities have recently issued an arrest warrant for one of the suspected perpetrators, a Ukrainian national.He noted that German media have been promoting the narrative that these individuals acted independently and were not connected to any state, but warned that this could lead to the investigation being closed without identifying the true masterminds behind the sabotage."Russia will not accept this state of affairs," Tyapkin said, adding that Moscow has formally lodged complaints with Germany and other affected countries, urging them to fulfill their obligations under United Nations anti-terrorism conventions."We are seeking negotiations in accordance with existing international protocols. Our future actions will depend on the West's response," he added.German media recently reported that the German prosecution has issued an arrest warrant for Ukrainian citizen in connection with the pipeline explosions. Reports identified this suspect as diver Vladimir Zhuravlev from Kyiv, who was allegedly assisted by a Ukrainian couple.In September 2022, the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipelines exploded and sustained severe damage in the territorial waters of Sweden and Denmark. Prior to the explosions, Russia used the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to transport natural gas from Siberia to Germany and other European countries.Due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Nord Stream 2 was never put into operation, and Germany halted imports of Russian natural gas, leading to a sharp increase in domestic energy prices.The Russian Prosecutor General's Office has launched an investigation into the incident as an act of international terrorism. Russia has repeatedly requested information on the explosions but has not received any response, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Germany will stop new military aid to Ukraine in order to cut government spending, German media reported, just days after German prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian man suspected of being part of a team that blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines.The moratorium on new assistance has already taken effect and will impact new requests for funding, but not aid approved earlier, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported on Saturday.The newspaper quoted German Finance Minister Christian Lindner, of the Free Democratic Party, as saying in a letter to the German Federal Ministry of Defense that future funding would no longer come from Germany's federal budget but from proceeds of frozen Russian assets.Despite strong warnings of retaliation from Moscow, Germany and other G7 member states reached a preliminary deal in June to use the proceeds of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine. The European Commission transferred 1.5 billion euros ($1.65 billion) of profits from frozen Russian assets in late July to buy weapons for Ukraine.Germany is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine among 27 EU member states and the second largest in the world after the United States. But Berlin indicated last month when the coalition government adopted a preliminary deal on its 2025 draft budget that its future assistance to Ukraine will be slashed by half to 4 billion euros ($4.41 billion) to cater to other spending priorities.Lindner said last month that Ukraine would have to rely more on funds from "European sources" as well as the frozen Russian assets.Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi has stated that claims that the German government is halting military aid to Ukraine are incorrect and manipulative, Ukrainian news media quoted him as saying on Sunday.The three parties of the German coalition government all fared poorly in the European election in early June and their internal tensions have grown especially after Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Economic Affairs Robert Habeck, of the Greens, expressed last week his intention to run for chancellor in the 2025 federal election."It's quite obvious that this coalition has major problems finding common ground," he said regarding the recent disputes over a number of issues. "The ideas are falling apart."The latest news coincides with the arrest warrant issued last Wednesday by German authorities over the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines on Sept 26, 2022.Germany, Denmark and Sweden conducted investigations into the explosions but the Danish and Swedish authorities concluded their probes without pointing at any suspect.In a probe published by ARD and two other German news outlets, the suspect is a 44-year-old Ukrainian diving instructor, named only as Volodymyr Z. for privacy reasons.But the Swedish newspaper Expression identified the man as Volodymyr Zhuravlov.He was accused of attacking the pipeline with at least two others, also believed to be Ukrainian citizens.The suspect was believed to last be living in Poland, but Polish authorities said they could not act on the warrant because he had left for his native country when they tried to arrest him in a town near Warsaw in July.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has earlier denied Kyiv's involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, which were built to carry cheap Russian natural gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Saturday said the initiators of the gas pipeline project should "apologize and keep quiet". It came after one of his deputies denied a claim that Warsaw was partly responsible for its damage.Agencies contributed to the story.VIENNA -- Heavy rains and storms hit Austria over the weekend, leading to widespread flooding, mudslides and disruptions to transportation in various regions of the country.In the ski resort town of St. Anton in western Austria's state of Tyrol, heavy downpours on Friday evening flooded streets, damaged buildings and swept away cars, Austrian broadcaster ORF reported. Cleanup efforts are now in full swing, local authorities said on Sunday.Heavy rains also hit the capital city of Vienna on Saturday. The capital city recorded a staggering 110 liters of rain per square meter, a record-breaking figure for summer rainfall, the Austrian newspaper Kurier reported. A woman was swept under a bus by floodwater in Vienna's Doebling district on Saturday and sustained severe injuries, according to ORF.ORF also reported major delays of flights at the Vienna Airport over the weekend. In addition, rain-triggered mudslides forced closure of the Arlberg Pass, a key road connecting the western states of Tyrol and Vorarlberg, and it remained closed to traffic on Sunday afternoon, the broadcaster added.PARIS - French film star Alain Delon has died at the age of 88 at home in France, French media reported on Sunday.Delon "passed away peacefully in his home in Douchy, surrounded by his three children and his family," said a statement issued by Delon's children.Born in 1935, Delon had been in poor health since suffering a stroke in 2019. Best known in China for his performance in the film "Zorro," he has won a César for Best Actor, an Honorary Golden Bear in Berlin, and an Honorary Palme d'Or in Cannes. LONDON - A large blaze that ripped through the roof of central London's historic Somerset House, which houses a large collection of priceless artwork, has been put under control, according to the London Fire Brigade (LFB).No one was injured in the fire which broke out around midday on Saturday.Twenty fire engines and 125 firefighters were deployed to tackle the fire, according to the LFB.Keeley Foster, assistant commissioner of the LFB said the fire was located in part of the building's roof space. The Brigade was called at 11:59 a.m. local time and the fire was under control by 6:51 p.m. Firefighting crews from Soho, Dowgate, Islington, and surrounding fire stations attended the scene.Foster also said the LFB crews will remain on the scene into tomorrow to carry out further operations.Jonathan Reekie, director of Somerset House Trust, said the fire broke out in the west wing of the building, which is mainly comprised of offices and "back-of-house" facilities, and there are "no artworks in that area."Multiple priceless artworks were preserved in the building, including Vincent van Gogh's iconic Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear. LONDON — A fire broke out Saturday at Somerset House, a large arts venue on the River Thames in central London.Smoke billowed from the building and flames could be seen coming from the roof as firefighters on tall ladders showered it with water.The cause of the fire was not yet known, the London Fire Brigade said. Fifteen engines and about 100 firefighters were deployed.Somerset House said all staff and the public were safe and the site was closed. The venue had been scheduled to host a breakdancing event.The neoclassical building, which is nearly 250 years old, houses the Courtauld Gallery that features works by Van Gogh, Manet and Cezanne.APMOSCOW -- Ukrainian troops launched their first strike using Western-made missiles on civilian targets in Russia's Kursk region Friday, said Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova."Notably, this is the first time that civilian objects in the Kursk Region have been struck by Western-made rockets, likely American HIMARS," Zakharova said.She said a bridge over the Seym River in the Glushkovsky District of Kursk was destroyed and "volunteers helping civilians were killed in the strike."She said all those responsible for such acts would face severe punishment from Russia.MOSCOW - Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said Friday that Washington is implicitly legitimizing terrorism by remaining silent on the bombing of Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 pipelines."They want everyone to forget the inconvenient statements made by US leaders about the importance of destroying the pipelines," Antonov said, as quoted by Russia's TASS News Agency. "They aim to shift the blame entirely onto their Ukrainian puppets, although they are fully aware that Kiev will not take a single step without a go-ahead from Washington."Antonov noted that the refusal of US officials to comment on the high-profile topic is "quite telling," and that they are "taking a favorable position for themselves as outside observers.""The functionaries have not lifted a finger to ensure that the truth about the events from almost two years ago comes to light," Antonov added. "America is giving carte blanche for similar crimes in the future."Antonov's comment followed an early arrest warrant issued by Germany's federal prosecutor general for a Ukrainian suspect believed to be involved in the bombing of the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea.In September 2022, the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipelines exploded and sustained severe damage in the territorial waters of Sweden and Denmark. Prior to the explosions, Russia used the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to transport natural gas from Siberia to Germany and other European countries.PARIS — A central stone of the famous Stonehenge monument in southwest England came from 750 kilometers away in northeast Scotland, surprised scientists said Wednesday, solving one mystery but raising another: how did its prehistoric builders move the huge slab so far?The Neolithic circle of giant stones has been a source of wonder and mystery for nearly 5,000 years — in the Middle Ages, the wizard Merlin of Arthurian legend was said to have stolen the monument from Ireland.More recently, scientists have determined that the site's upright sandstones came from relatively nearby Marlborough, while the bluestones arrayed near its center came from Wales.But the origin of the Altar Stone, a unique 6-metric-ton slab lying on its side at the heart of the circle, remained elusive.It was long thought to have also come from Wales, but tests along those lines always "drew a blank", said Richard Bevins, a professor from Aberystwyth University in Wales, and co-author of a new study.This prompted a team of British and Australian researchers to broaden their horizons — and in turn discover something "quite sensational", he told AFP.Using chemical analysis, they determined that the Altar Stone came from Scotland's Orcadian Basin, which is at least 750 kilometers from Stonehenge, according to the study in the journal Nature.The researchers were stunned."This is a genuinely shocking result," study co-author Robert Ixer of University College London said in a statement.The "astonishing" distance was the longest recorded journey for any stone at the time, said fellow co-author Nick Pearce of Aberystwyth University.Whether people about 2,500 BC, were capable of transporting such huge stones from Wales had already been a matter of heated debate among archaeologists and historians.That a 5-by-1-meter stone made the trip across much of the length of the United Kingdom suggests the British Isles were home to a highly organized and well-connected society at the time, the researchers said.They called for further research to find out exactly where in Scotland the stone came from — and how it made its way to Stonehenge.Explaining theoriesOne theory is that the stone was brought to southern England not by humans but by naturally moving ice flows.However, research has shown that ice would actually have carried such stones "northward, away from Stonehenge", lead study author Anthony Clarke from Australia's Curtin University told a news conference.Another option was that the Neolithic builders moved the stones over land — though this would have been extraordinarily difficult.Dense forests, marshy bogs and mountains all formed "formidable barriers" for prehistoric movers, Clarke said.Another option is that the stone was transported by sea.There is evidence of an "extensive network of Neolithic shipping", which moved pottery and gems around the region, Clarke said.To work out where it came from, the researchers fired laser beams into the crystals of a thin slice of the Altar Stone.The ratio of uranium and lead in these crystals act as "miniature clocks" for rocks, providing their age, said study co-author Chris Kirkland of Curtin University.The team then compared the stone's age with other rocks across the UK and found "with a high degree of certainty" that it came from the Orcadian Basin, Kirkland said.Susan Greaney, an archaeologist at the UK's University of Exeter not involved in the study, said it established the first "direct link "between southern England and northern Scotland during this time."The placement of this stone at the heart of the monument, on the solstice axis, shows that they thought this stone, and by implication, the connection with the area to the north, was incredibly important," she told AFP.Agencies via XinhuaThe World Health Organization called for a coordinated global response against the mpox outbreak on Wednesday after declaring it a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, the agency's highest alarm at the moment.The announcement was made on the advice of an International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of independent experts who met earlier in the day and also a day after Africa's CDC declared a public health emergency on the continent."The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the reporting of cases in several neighboring countries are very worrying," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in declaring the PHEIC on Wednesday."On top of outbreaks of other mpox clades in DRC and other countries in Africa, it's clear that a coordinated international response is needed to stop these outbreaks and save lives."Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, has been endemic in West and Central Africa for decades, but DR Congo has become the epicenter of a dangerous new strain that emerged last year and is spreading through sexual and close personal contact. The strain is an offshoot of the clade I virus, which has a case fatality rate of about 10 percent.Mpox is an infectious disease that can cause a rash and skin lesions. Other symptoms include fever, headache and swollen lymph nodes. People with compromised immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness or death if they get mpox. Pregnant women and children are also at higher risk.According to WHO, mpox has been reported in DR Congo for more than a decade, and the number of cases reported each year has increased steadily over that period. Last year, reported cases increased significantly, and already the number of cases reported so far this year has exceeded last year's total, with more than 15,600 cases and 537 deaths.WHO said it needs $15 million to support Africa's mpox response, and it has already released $1.45 million from its emergency reserves. Tedros said the WHO plans to allocate more funding in the coming days."The current upsurge of mpox in parts of Africa, along with the spread of a new sexually transmissible strain of the monkeypox virus, is an emergency, not only for Africa, but for the entire globe," said Dimie Ogoina, WHO's mpox emergency committee chair.He said mpox, originating in Africa, was neglected there, and later caused a global outbreak in 2022.Decisive moment"It is time to act decisively to prevent history from repeating itself," he said.WHO declared a PHEIC over mpox in July 2022 when infections, mainly among gay and bisexual men, spread worldwide. By the time WHO's declaration ended in May 2023, about 87,000 mpox cases had been reported in 118 countries. The virus has remained a serious problem in Africa ever since.The 2022 outbreak was driven by clade II, which generally causes less severe illness, in comparison to clade I, a more dangerous one now spreading in Central and Eastern Africa.The European Commission announced on Wednesday that it will send more than 175,000 vaccines to Africa CDC for distribution, after Africa CDC called on the global community to mobilize 2 million doses.Some European scientists have warned that Europe should also be "very concerned" because countries no longer protect citizens against mpox through smallpox vaccination.Agencies contributed to this story.German companies are determined to ramp up investment in China, motivated by the country's heightened focus on expanding market openness and fast-growing industries, said business executives and market watchers.They said that in the context of a rapidly changing global economy, China's ongoing opening-up measures, flourishing high-end manufacturing and green industries are set to accelerate the emergence of new economic growth drivers and foster innovation. These advancements will present decent opportunities for German businesses.German direct investment in China reached 7.3 billion euros ($8.04 billion) in the first half of the year, compared with 6.5 billion euros for the whole of 2023, according to data from the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, shared with the Financial Times newspaper early this week.Maximilian Butek, executive director and board member of the German Chamber of Commerce in China — East China, said that in the long run, China is viewed as an important innovation market, leading to more research and development investment by German companies.Regarding supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, Butek said that German firms are addressing these challenges by diversifying their suppliers and developing local partnerships in China."Overall, German companies see the benefits of investing in China's growing market and are taking steps to minimize potential risks and overcome challenges," he added.According to the results of the chamber's latest survey, more than half of German companies plan to increase their investments in China, particularly big corporates, automakers and manufacturers of electronic products.Sharing similar views, Xu Daquan, president of Bosch (China) Investment Ltd, a country branch of German industrial conglomerate Bosch Group, said the Chinese market is evolving rapidly, and the vehicle industry holds great potential.Highlighting that China is Bosch's largest single overseas market with an average annual investment of 5 billion yuan ($700 million), Xu said the company's spending in this category will continue to rise."It is possible that going forward, the innovative technologies invented in the Chinese market could be applied in other foreign markets," he added.Following that trend, Volkswagen AG announced in May that it had started building the third phase of the group's mega R&D center in Hefei, Anhui province. The project is scheduled to be operational in 2027.BMW AG also announced in April an additional investment of 20 billion yuan in its production base in Shenyang, Liaoning province, to localize the manufacture of a new generation of BMW models by 2026.Wang Xiaohong, a researcher specializing in cross-border investment at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, said China's strengths will substantially enrich Sino-German economic and trade relations in the years ahead.With China introducing several policies this year to promote high-standard opening-up and explore new growth areas, including support for large-scale equipment renewals and trade-in programs for consumer goods, the Munich-headquartered BSH Home Appliances Group said it will continue to expand its investment in both sales network expansion and innovation within the country.Russia began evacuating thousands more people from its border regions on Thursday after Ukraine said it was advancing deeper into the country in a lightning incursion aimed at forcing Moscow to slow its advance along the rest of the front.The biggest foreign attack on sovereign Russian territory since World War II unfurled on Aug 6 when thousands of Ukrainian troops smashed through Russia's western border.Supported by swarms of drones, heavy artillery and tanks, Ukrainian units have since carved out a sliver of Russia and battles were continuing along a front about 18 kilometers inside Russian territory on Thursday.Authorities in the Kursk region have decided to evacuate its Glushkov district, acting Governor Alexey Smirnov said late on Wednesday.The district directly borders Ukraine and has a population of about 20,000 people. Smirnov said on Telegram that police and other state bodies would coordinate the evacuation process.Russian officials said at least 200,000 people have been evacuated from the border regions following the attack.The Ministry for Emergency Situations said more than 8,000 residents of Kursk, including more than 2,500 children, currently stay in temporary accommodation centers.The work to temporarily resettle people and provide them with everything they need continues, the ministry said.Most residents of Kursk districts bordering Ukraine have been evacuated to safety, the ministry added.Russia's Defense Ministry said on Thursday its forces had recaptured a village in Kursk after it was seized by Ukraine in its cross-border incursion.In the first such claim since the start of the Ukrainian offensive more than a week ago, the ministry said the army had "completed destruction of the enemy and restored control of the settlement of Krupets".Russian forces were continuing to "repel the attempted incursion of the Ukrainian armed forces", it said.Moscow said that using aircraft, artillery and drones, its forces had "foiled the latest enemy attacks", including attempts to break through deeper into Russian territory using mobile groups.As for the neighboring region of Belgorod, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said on Thursday that Russia will send additional forces to defend the border region.The Russian army has prepared "concrete actions" to defend Belgorod from Ukrainian attacks, including "the allocation of additional forces", Belousov was quoted by the ministry as saying.In a video published on Thursday by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's top commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said Kyiv had set up a military commandant's office in the occupied part of the Kursk region, where he said his forces were still advancing and had taken up to 1.5 kilometers in the past 24 hours.Kyiv's forces had advanced 35 km into Kursk since launching the incursion, Syrskyi added.'Buffer zone'Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said Ukraine would create a "buffer zone" in the region to prevent Russian cross-border strikes."The creation of a buffer zone in the Kursk region is a step to protect our border communities from daily hostile shelling," he said.In his nightly address on Wednesday, Zelensky referred to the growing number of Russian prisoners of war taken in Kursk who could be exchanged for Ukrainian fighters."Our advance in Kursk is going well today — we are reaching our strategic goal," he said. "The 'exchange fund' for our state has also been significantly replenished."Ukraine's surprise attack on Kursk has been seen by military analysts as an attempt to force Russia to divert forces from the eastern front, where Russian forces have taken control of a village that is just 16 kilometers from the city of Pokrovsk, which sits abreast of major roads that supply Ukrainian forces in the area.In a daily briefing, the Russian Defense Ministry said its army units "liberated the village of Ivanovka "in the Donetsk region.Russian forces have been inching toward Pokrovsk for months, taking a string of tiny villages in recent months as they seek to reach the outskirts of the city.A Ukrainian official told AFP over the weekend, on condition of anonymity, that the incursion had little effect on fighting in the east but that the "intensity of Russian attacks" had decreased slightly.Agencies contributed to this story.Environmental activists breached airfields at four German airports on Thursday, causing temporary flight suspensions at some of them, marking the latest in a series of similar protests.The Last Generation campaign group said in a statement that eight activists had participated in coordinated protests at Berlin, Cologne Bonn, Nuremberg and Stuttgart airports, demanding that the German government negotiate and commit to a global phase-out of oil, gas, and coal by 2030.German news agency dpa reported that flights were briefly suspended at Nuremberg and Cologne Bonn airports after protesters glued themselves to the ground, while at Berlin Brandenburg Airport, two activists were removed and detained.Nuremberg Airport reported on social media that activist disruptions had led to a brief suspension of flights lasting more than an hour, resulting in six delays, one cancellation, and one rerouted flight.Cologne Bonn Airport halted operations temporarily due to a security breach, with police reporting that intruders cut a hole in the perimeter fence.Stuttgart Airport reported that air traffic remained unaffected after police promptly apprehended two protesters who had attempted to block a taxiway.Last Generation previously announced its plans for disruptive action across various nations in Europe and North America, reported Reuters.Formed in 2021, the group derives its name from activists who view themselves as the final generation before climate collapse."What is at stake right now are billions of human lives," one of the group's activists stated in a video from an airfield, shared on social media on Thursday. "Climate collapse is already a reality for many people. We still have the privilege of being able to do something about it here."German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser condemned the protests on social media network X."These criminal actions are dangerous and stupid," she wrote, warning that the activists "are not just risking their own lives but also endangering others".German politicians have been calling for enhanced airport security since climate activist breaches disrupted air traffic, including two consecutive days of interference at Frankfurt Airport, the nation's busiest airport, last month.Faeser highlighted recent legislation approved by the German Cabinet, designed to strengthen penalties for those breaching airport security perimeters.The proposed bill, still pending parliamentary approval, envisions punishments of up to two years' imprisonment for individuals who deliberately enter restricted airport areas like taxiways or runways, pose a threat to civil aviation, or facilitate such actions by others. This would mark a change from the current system, where such intrusions typically result only in fines.Opponents of a plan to build Europe's largest solar energy project in the English county of Lincolnshire have formed a protest group to urge the government to block the idea.The Meridian Action Group, which claims to have more than 400 members, is angry that decisions about major energy projects are now made by the central government and not by local governments, which handled such issues until recently.All solar energy projects capable of generating more than 50 megawatts are now known as "nationally significant infrastructure projects", or NSIPs, and considered too significant to the United Kingdom's energy needs to be decided at the local level.Councilor Colin Davie, who is on the executive of Lincolnshire County Council's economic development, environment, and planning committee, told the BBC: "I have repeatedly said that these enormous infrastructure projects should not be dumped in our county and ruin the quality of life of our residents. Our agricultural land should be protected."The Meridian Solar Farm, if approved, would generate 750 megawatts of energy, which is enough to power more than 200,000 homes. Currently, Europe's largest solar project is in Germany, south of Leipzig, and can generate 650 megawatts.The Lincolnshire project is also set to include a battery storage facility and 12 kilometers of above-ground cabling to carry power to the nearest spur of the national grid network.The company behind the proposed project, Meridian Solar, has said it would help the UK meet "the urgent need for cleaner forms of generation to replace fossil fuels" and "make a significant contribution to energy security" while playing "a key role in accelerating the country's transition to net-zero".The Meridian Solar Farm would cover 1,012 hectares of farmland, which is the equivalent of 2,800 soccer pitches, south of the town of Spalding and would be the largest, but by no means only, solar power project in the rural county.Two other NSIP solar energy projects have already been approved recently, at Mallard Pass, near Stamford, and Gate Burton, near Gainsborough. And there are at least 10 other large solar projects on the way for Lincolnshire, which is seen as especially suitable because of its fl at topography and undeveloped farmland. But campaigners say it plays a vital role in the production of the UK's food and should not be compromised.Professor Janet Bellamy, an expert in food processing at the University of Lincoln, said at a recent packed public meeting about the project that the industrialization of Lincolnshire's fertile farmland could turn it into a "death valley", with a severely damaged ability to produce fresh vegetables and a limited contribution to national food security as a result. HELSINKI -- Swedish health authorities confirmed on Thursday that they have identified the first case of the more infectious Clade I variant of mpox in the country.The Public Health Agency of Sweden said this is also the first confirmed case of this variant outside Africa.Magnus Gisslen, the state epidemiologist at the health agency, said in a press release that the patient contracted the infection during a visit to the region in Africa where mpox Clade I is spreading.The news came a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern.The Swedish health agency noted that, unlike the previous variant which mainly spread through sexual contact, Clade I is now spreading primarily through household contacts and frequently infects children. Though it causes a similar illness to the Clade IIb variant that spread internationally in 2022, Clade I is considered capable of causing a more severe condition and higher mortality.The agency said that Sweden is prepared for the diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of Clade I patients. It had previously indicated that isolated cases of the variant might be expected in the country.Sweden reported around 300 mpox Clade IIb cases in the previous wave of infection.MOSCOW -- A mandatory evacuation has been ordered for all residents of the Glushkovsky district in Russia's Kursk region, Acting Governor Alexei Smirnov announced on his official Telegram channel Wednesday."The regional operational headquarters has decided to mandate the evacuation of the entire Glushkovsky district," Smirnov said.The Glushkovsky district, which borders Ukraine, comprises two towns and 11 villages.This comes after an earlier announcement of a mandatory evacuation in the settlement of Glushkovo within the district.Law enforcement agencies, local authorities, and volunteers from the Kursk Patriot Center will coordinate the evacuation process.Italy has witnessed a dramatic decline in seaborne illegal migration so far this year, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, reporting a significant decrease in asylum-seeker arrivals compared to last year.New UNHCR figures revealed this week show a 62 percent drop in potential refugee arrivals to Italy this year, with about 35,700 people reaching the country as of Sunday, compared to more than 94,000 during the same period last year.Italy had previously seen a consistent rise in arrivals since 2020, with numbers climbing from more than 67,000 in 2021 to more than 105,000 in 2022, peaking at nearly 158,000 last year — the highest yearly total since 2016.The trend toward decline has been attributed to deterrent policies implemented by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government, according to the Italian newspaper Il Giornale.Meloni, who was elected Italian prime minister two years ago, campaigned on a promise to curb the influx of migrants into the country.Last year, the southern Italian island of Lampedusa was the hardest hit of all landing sites, with about 120 boats carrying between 6,000 and 7,000 migrants arriving on the island on a single day in September.Top destinationBut even with this year's decrease, Italy continues to be the primary destination for migrants, with Spain receiving more than 30,000 arrivals and Greece more than 28,000, placing them second and third respectively, UNHCR data show.Tackling the migrant crisis is a politically divisive issue for the European Union's 27 member states ever since more than a million people reached European shores in 2015.The New Pact on Migration and Asylum, set to take effect in 2026, outlines EU-wide rules for handling unauthorized entries, including screening and deportation procedures.However, this reform does not offer an immediate solution to the ongoing crisis that has deeply divided EU nations over migrant responsibility and burden-sharing obligations.While the bloc attempts to address the issue, critics argue that measures taken, such as the EU's deal with Tunisia that includes assistance to better police the border and prevent migrants without papers from reaching Europe, have negatively impacted tens of thousands of migrants trapped in Tunisia, Sky News reported.On Sunday, the United Kingdom saw a record-breaking influx of more than 700 migrants crossing the Channel seaway to Britain in small vessels, marking the highest single-day arrival since Prime Minister Keir Starmer assumed office with a pledge to combat human trafficking.The Berlin Zoo has announced that its 11-year-old female giant panda Meng Meng is pregnant again with twins and, if everything goes well, could give birth by the end of the month.The announcement was made on Monday after zoo authorities conducted an ultrasound examination over the weekend that showed the developing fetuses. Giant panda experts from China arrived in Berlin on Sunday to assist with preparations for the ultrasound.Meng Meng was artificially inseminated in March. According to the zoo, female giant pandas are only fertile for approximately 72 hours each year."One heartbeat could initially be made out on the ultrasound equipment, and shortly thereafter a second as well," the zoo announcement said, adding that the fetuses are now 2.5 centimeters long, but will grow significantly by the end of the month.Gestation generally takes three to six months, but the zoo said that dormancy — a period of up to several months in giant pandas during which an egg remains suspended in the mother's uterus and does not continue to develop — was the reason for the delay in confirming Meng Meng's pregnancy.Zoo veterinarian Franziska Sutter told media that the pregnancy was still at a risky phase."Amid all the enthusiasm, we have to realize that this is a very early stage of the pregnancy and that a so-called resorption, or death, of the embryo is still possible at this stage," she said.If everything goes smoothly, the cubs will be the first in five years to be born at the Berlin Zoo after Meng Meng gave birth to twin cubs, Pit and Paule, in August 2019. They were the first giant pandas born in Germany and became stars at the zoo.Both Pit and Paule, whose Chinese names are Meng Xiang and Meng Yuan, returned to China in December to join the breeding program under an agreement with the Chinese government.Their parents, Meng Meng and Jiao Qing, arrived at the Berlin Zoo in 2017.In early July, Ouwehands Dierenpark, a zoo in the Netherlands, announced that its giant panda Wu Wen gave birth to a cub. A second cub that was born about an hour later died shortly after birth.The surviving cub is the second born at the Dutch zoo after Fan Xing was born in 2020. Fan Xing, a female, returned to China in September last year to join the breeding program.In Spain, the Madrid Zoo Aquarium formally introduced a new pair of giant pandas, Jin Xi and Zhu Yu, in May in a ceremony attended by Queen Sofia, who has been a giant panda advocate since the 1970s.The arrival came after panda couple Bing Xing and Hua Zui Ba, accompanied by their three Madridborn cubs Chulina, You You and Jiu Jiu, returned to China on Feb 29.In Austria, the Schonbrunn Zoo in Vienna is expecting the arrival of a pair of giant pandas from China under a 10-year cooperation agreement on giant panda conservation that was signed in June.The giant pandas Yuan Yuan and Yang Yang, who are now in Vienna, will return to China after the expiration of an agreement this year.The two sides have applauded their successful cooperation in giant panda breeding, scientific research, technical exchanges, personnel training and public education.Yang Yang, a female, and Long Hui, a male, have had four litters in Vienna totaling five cubs through natural mating, which is a European record.On Aug 8, giant panda twins Bao Di and Bao Mei in Belgium's Pairi Daiza zoo celebrated their fifth birthday in a ceremony attended by new Chinese Ambassador to Belgium Fei Shengchao.The twins and their elder brother Tian Bao, born in 2016, will leave for China this autumn to join the breeding program.Agencies contributed to this story.GENEVA -- The World Health Organization (WHO) declared on Wednesday mpox a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), sounding the alarm over its potential for further international transmission."Today, the emergency committee met and advised me that, in its view, the situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. I have accepted that advice," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference in Geneva.A PHEIC is the highest level of alarm under international health law, Tedros said. "This is something that should concern us all ... The potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying."Mpox cases reported so far this year have exceeded last year's total, with more than 14,000 cases and 524 deaths, according to WHO data. Investigators in Germany believe three Ukrainians sabotaged the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea in September 2022, according to news outlets including broadcaster ARD and newspapers Die Zeit and Suddeutsche Zeitung.The main suspect, a man named as Volodymyr Z, was living in Poland and working as a diving instructor when the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines were destroyed, the reports said, citing unnamed security sources. The sabotage, at a depth of 70 to 80 meters, severed three of the four undersea pipelines that carried Russian gas into Europe, seven months after the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The reports said the German authorities issued a Europe-wide arrest warrant for the 44-year-old, who Der Spiegel news magazine said had since left Poland. The two other suspects, a married Ukrainian couple who also worked as diving instructors, have not been named and do not have arrest warrants against them.Germany's prosecutor general has refused to officially comment on the reports.Germany, Denmark, and Sweden all have territorial waters that the Nord Stream pipelines passed through and all opened investigations into the sabotage. The investigations in Denmark and Sweden both closed without police pinpointing a suspect, although the Swedish investigation did find traces of explosives on objects recovered from the seabed that established the blasts were deliberate acts.Russia and the West blamed each other in the aftermath of the explosions, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has consistently denied his country was involved.According to the reports, police now believe Volodymyr Z and the two other suspects got the skipper of a German-flagged yacht docked off the northern island of Rugen to take them to the vicinity of the pipelines, where they put on wet suits and went under the water.The skipper later identified Volodymyr Z from photographs.Police reportedly also believe they have a photo of the suspect, captured by a traffic camera while he apparently drove a white van containing the diving equipment.Sky News said Poland has confirmed it received a request to arrest the Ukrainian suspect, but that he left the country in early July. The Reuters news agency said Poland complained Germany had failed to include the suspect's name on a database that would have alerted them of his status.Anna Adamiak, a spokesperson for Poland's National Public Prosecutor's Office, told Reuters: "Ultimately, Volodymyr Z was not detained, because, at the beginning of July, he left Polish territory, crossing the Polish-Ukrainian border. Free crossing of the Polish-Ukrainian border by the above-mentioned person was possible because German authorities ... did not include him in the database of wanted persons, which meant that the Polish border guard had no knowledge and no grounds to detain Volodymyr Z."earle@mail.chinadailyuk.comMOSCOW - The Belgorod region has declared a regional state of emergency due to the escalating situation, with authorities considering elevating the emergency status to the federal level, the region's governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on his Telegram channel on Wednesday."The situation in the Belgorod region remains extremely challenging and tense. Daily shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine has led to the destruction of homes, as well as injuries and fatalities among civilians," Gladkov said in a video address."Therefore, we have decided to declare a state of emergency across the entire Belgorod region starting today to provide additional protection to the population and offer further support to those affected," he said.The governor also indicated that the regional government would soon appeal to the federal commission to request declaring a federal-level state of emergency.German companies are increasing their direct investments in China this year, despite their government urging them to diversify.According to data from Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, shared with the Financial Times newspaper, German direct investments in China reached 2.48 billion euros ($2.71 billion) in the first quarter of 2024, increasing to 4.8 billion euros in the second quarter.The total investment in the first six months of 2024 amounts to 7.3 billion euros, surpassing the 6.5 billion euros invested throughout all of 2023.The surge in investment, largely fueled by major German automotive companies, continues despite warnings from Chancellor Olaf Scholz's administration about increasing geopolitical risks linked to the Chinese market and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urging businesses across the European Union to reduce their exposure to Asia's biggest economy.Major companies, particularly automakers, appear to be disregarding Berlin's warnings, continuing to concentrate their investments in the Chinese market.Audi launched an electric vehicle production base in January, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, in a joint venture, plan 1,000 supercharging stations by 2026, and optoelectronics manufacturer Zeiss has opened its largest quality center in Guangdong province.German companies are reinvesting a significant portion of their Chinese profits back into China, with the Cologne Institute for Economic Research reporting that more than half of last year's 19 billion euro earnings were reinvested there.The FT said the trend reflects a new "In China, for China" strategy adopted by companies like Volkswagen, which are increasing production in China to serve one of their largest markets directly."Companies saw a lot of bottlenecks forming during the pandemic and the blockade of the Suez Canal," Friedolin Strack, a China expert at Germany's main business lobby BDI, told the paper."They are determined to reduce all risks in their supply chains by reorganizing them on a regional basis, through localization. That is happening a lot in China, especially."Strong tiesThere was evidence that Germany's economic relations to China might remain strong when top executives from Siemens and Mercedes-Benz joined Scholz on a visit to the world's second-largest economy in April.A German Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey released in June revealed German companies have been increasingly optimistic about China's economy, with half of them planning to boost investments there.The survey showed that 53 percent of German companies intend to increase their investments in China over the next two years, with respondents representing diverse sectors, including 30 percent in machinery and industrial equipment, and others across automotive, mobility, business services, electronics, and chemical industries.A report from the American Chamber of Commerce in China in February revealed growing optimism among US investors, with most maintaining their operations in China.Analysts cited in the report noted that beyond China's vast market, its resilient supply chains and improving innovation capabilities continue to attract foreign investment.Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Ukraine's biggest attack on Russian territory since the start of the conflict was aimed at improving Kyiv's negotiating position ahead of the possible peace talks and at slowing the advance of Russian forces, and ordered his army to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops."One of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord, strife, intimidate people, destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society," Putin told a televised meeting with government officials."The main task is, of course, for the defense ministry to dislodge the enemy from our territories," he said.Kyiv launched a surprise offensive into southwestern Russia's Kursk region last Tuesday, capturing over two dozen settlements in the most significant cross-border attack on Russian soil since World War II.Putin, in his most detailed public remarks on the incursion to date, said Ukraine "with the help of its Western masters" was trying to improve its position ahead of possible talks.He questioned what negotiations there could be with an enemy he accused of firing indiscriminately at Russian civilians and nuclear facilities."The enemy will certainly receive a worthy response," he said, noting that he expected further Ukrainian attempts to destabilize Russia's western border.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine's cross-border assault was a matter of security for Ukraine and that Kyiv had captured areas from where Russia launched strikes.His top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Ukraine controlled 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory, far larger than the figures given by Russian officials.On Tuesday, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Georgiy Tykhy told a news conference that the sooner Russia agreed to a "just peace", the sooner it would stop its cross-border raids.Stretching troopsA Ukrainian official told AFP over the weekend that the operation was aimed at stretching Russian troops and destabilizing the country after months of slow Russian advances across the front line.Authorities in Kursk announced they were widening their evacuation area to include the Belovsky district, home to some 14,000 residents.The acting governor of Kursk, Alexei Smirnov, said Ukraine controlled 28 settlements in the region, and the incursion was about 12 km deep and 40 km wide.In the Kursk region alone, 121,000 people had already left or been evacuated and another 59,000 were in the process of being evacuated.Ukrainian forces in Kursk were trying to encircle Sudzha, where Russian natural gas flows into Ukraine, while major battles were underway near Korenevo, about 22 km from the border, and Martynovka.Video from social media and verified by Reuters showed Ukrainian soldiers raising their flag in the Russian village of Guevo, in Kursk.Smirnov also issued a missile warning, saying people needed to take shelter in rooms without windows and with solid walls.Temporary accommodation has been prepared, he said.As Russia is evacuating residents from a second border region, the Belgorod region which borders Kursk, some 11,000 civilians were evacuated.Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the whole region was under a missile alert, and told people to shelter in their basements.But he added he was "sure that our servicemen will do everything to cope with the threat that has arisen".Some statisticians believe artificial intelligence, or AI, can predict crashes in the economy before they happen and financial forecasting using advanced analytics combined with machine learning could soon identify early red flags in the economy before they lead to disaster.This would offer unprecedented grace periods where interventions could safeguard societies worldwide and systems that increasingly rely upon each other in an international market.By training AI on historical records, it has already been possible to anticipate natural disasters for many years. Whether this be the seismic activity required to spot impending earthquakes or air currents telegraphing a hurricane, AI, despite its infancy, already demonstrates a proven track record in its ability to be trained on large data sets to spot potential impending disasters in the natural world.Spotting a man-made crisis, however, relies upon identifying much more complex and unpredictable factors. Previous attempts to learn from historical patterns, such as the 2008 crisis or the Great Depression, relied on linear events and trends to identify risks. However, today’s complex and interwoven global financial system is even more volatile than its predecessors, meaning that hidden connections and factors can cause ugly surprises for analysts reliant on human brain power and computing alone.Financial crashes come in many forms. A bank may suddenly go under, a nation’s currency can have its value evaporate, war or debt can rear its ugly head to disrupt a previously stable system. These events all have data indicating problems that gradually get worse until an event triggers rapid deterioration. The trigger is relatively straightforward to spot, however it is the undercurrent of societal issues bubbling in the background beforehand making the system vulnerable to a single trigger that is both of interest and harder to spot.This is made all the more difficult when considering all economies tolerate ongoing societal issues as a reality of life.Distinguishing the benign from the insidious is where it is hoped AI can make a difference.AI algorithms can rapidly process such data and spot correlations deeply hidden in vast quantities of numbers. This can enable policies to be preemptively emplaced before a situation deteriorates.Producing AI data is one thing however; understanding it is another.Understanding why an AI algorithm has made its prediction is crucial, and difficulties in doing so will, no doubt, hamper trust in the system as well as lead to difficulties in applying appropriate remedies.It is also feared that inherent biases in data fed into the technology could also lead to inaccurate forecasts, along with errors inputted into the data sets themselves.The widespread implementation of AI in the finance sector means that any attempts to use the technology in a predictive manner must be tightly regulated for these reasons.Governments must ensure that AI systems are implemented transparently and with measures to guarantee accountability in order to protect the general public. The interconnected nature of international financial markets means that any mistakes could have severe knock-on effects for countless people around the world.Humans must be trained in the art of deciphering AI forecasts in a meaningful manner applicable to rapidly changing situations. It takes skill and experience to understand the nuance of exactly which solutions should be applied to safeguard the economy once AI has flagged an alert. Whether this be increasing cash flow to certain financial sectors or reducing interest or borrowing rates, having an independent body made up of experts from cross-discipline fields increases the chances of success.AI holds much promise in protecting us from economic harm. It can aid financial institutions and guide policymakers with greater situational awareness in what is becoming an increasingly volatile financial environment. Its development must, however, be closely scrutinized and applied with care. Poland has unveiled plans to make 48 M903 Patriot missile launchers, in a move it says will greatly strengthen its national security.Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz and representatives from United States defense giant Raytheon and Polish arms maker PGZ Huta Stalowa Wola announced the deal on Monday.The 48 missile launchers will be produced in Poland for the Polish army using technology provided by the US company. The equipment will be sufficient to form at least six Patriot missile batteries, the companies said as the agreement was inked in the town of Sochaczew, at the headquarters of the 3rd Warsaw Air Defense Missile Brigade.The first of the new weapons should be ready for use in 2027.Kosiniak-Kamysz said the agreement between the nations and some of their major defense contractors was the result of "our government betting so strongly on security" and that it was a product of Poland's decision to increase defense spending to around 4 percent of GDP."We are investing in the Polish defense industry, in the armed forces of the republic for the security of us and our allies," the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying. "Today's event is unprecedented in scale, taking place on Polish soil, involving Polish companies, utilizing American technology, and in collaboration with American firms and the US government."The deal was finalized after several Polish politicians, including Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, called for a greatly improved and upgraded military in the wake of the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and in light of its potential to spill over into nearby European countries, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.Reuters quoted US Ambassador to Poland Mark Brzezinski as saying the cooperation highlights the "intrinsic trust between Poland and America" and "enhances not only our ability to protect the skies above NATO territory, but also our military interoperability".The Patriot missile system was designed to intercept missiles and drones in the air and protect cities and critical infrastructure. Brzezinski said it will play a key role along Poland's 230-kilometre border with Russia.The 48 M903 Patriot missile launchers will be part of air defense systems in Poland worth $1.23 billion, Kosiniak-Kamysz added.Polskie Radio said the deal to produce the missile launchers marks the start of the second phase of what is known as the Wisla program, which opens the door to additional defense contracts being signed between 2027 and 2029.Poland and the US have already worked together on other aspects of Patriot missile systems and produced a range of components, including transport and loading vehicles, technical support containers, radar systems, launcher parts, and missile components.The latest phase will be supported by subcontractors including Zaklady Mechaniczne Tarnow and Wojskowe Zaklady Elektroniczne. MADRID -- Three people have died in Spain since Sunday due to heat stroke, as extreme temperatures continue to grip much of the country, emergency services reported on Tuesday.In Madrid, a 76-year-old man was discovered dead at his home by health services on Tuesday. He was found unconscious with a body temperature exceeding 40 degrees Celsius.Another incident in Madrid involved a 44-year-old man, who died on Monday. He was found semi-conscious, with a body temperature above 41 degrees Celsius, as reported by Spanish public television. The man has pre-existing medical conditions, which may have worsened his condition.On the Spanish island of Mallorca, in the Western Mediterranean Sea, a 70-year-old German tourist collapsed on Sunday while hiking in a remote area. His wife alerted emergency services, but despite their efforts, he could not be saved, the Spanish Civil Guard reported.Much of Spain has been on alert recently due to soaring temperatures and extreme or high risk of forest fires, as the fourth heatwave of this summer hit the country. Temperatures in many regions have exceeded 40 degrees Celsius.Spain recorded 608 deaths attributable to high temperatures in the first week starting August, almost double the previous week's total of 335, making it the worst week of the year, according to the Carlos III Health Institute.KYIV - Russia launched 38 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine overnight on Tuesday and the air defense intercepted 30 of them, the Ukrainian Air Force said in a statement.The projectiles were destroyed over eight regions in southern, northern and central Ukraine, the statement said.The Russian forces also fired two Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles at Ukraine from the Voronezh region, the air force said, without giving further details.Infrastructure facilities, including a gas pipeline and a hospital, were damaged. One person was injured in the attack in Ukraine's northeastern city of Sumy, the Sumy Regional Military Administration said in a statement.A nationwide air alert was issued in Ukraine on Tuesday morning after a MIG-31 fighter, a carrier of Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles, took off from an airfield in Russia.MOSCOW - About 11,000 people were evacuated from the Krasnoyaruzhsky district in Russia's Belgorod region due to increased activity by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Tuesday on his Telegram channel.Of the evacuees, approximately 1,000 are currently staying in temporary accommodation centers."Yesterday, residents of the Krasnoyaruzhsky district left their homes due to the operational situation. These evacuees are now provided with food, bedding, and essential supplies. I hope the situation will stabilize soon, allowing them to return home," Gladkov said.Large wildfires raging near the Greek capital Athens have forced thousands to evacuate, with flames reaching heights of 25 meters, as much of Europe contends with extreme heat conditions.Italy endured intense temperatures over the weekend and French authorities issued weather warnings for southern areas of the country.The United Kingdom was bracing for its hottest day of the year so far on Monday, with temperatures in some areas set to reach above 34 C.High temperatures and strong winds fueled a massive wildfire north of Athens, where more than 400 firefighters, supported by aircraft, battled flames that burned trees, houses and cars and sent smoke clouds billowing over the capital, Reuters reported.The fire brigade described attempts to combat the flames as "superhuman". Evacuation orders expanded on Monday, with at least five more communities instructed to leave, adding to the hundreds of people who had already fled from at least eight villages on Sunday, the BBC reported."The situation remains dangerous as the fire is spreading between residences," said fire brigade spokesperson Vassilios Vathrakogiannis, noting that the fire spread "like lightning" because of strong winds.In Varnavas, a village of about 1,800 people that is 35 kilometers north of Athens, flames swallowed up trees and shrub land.Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias cautioned that high temperatures, strong winds and drought conditions had put half of the country at significant risk for wildfires. Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis returned to Athens from his holiday to address the situation.The historic town of Marathon, east of Athens, was among those evacuated on Sunday."Everything is burning," Giorgos Tsevas, a resident of nearby Polydendri village, said. "I have 200 olive trees there, but now they are gone."Climate experts attribute the current extreme temperatures primarily to human-caused global warming.The World Health Organization has cautioned about the serious effects of increasing temperatures on European populations, noting that as the continent warms faster than any other, heat-related causes claim an estimated 175,000 lives annually.Rome has been experiencing a continuing heat wave since the beginning of last month, with temperatures persistently above normal levels.Cited by Euronews, meteorologist Lorenzo Tedici from Italy's Il Meteo weather forecasting service emphasized the link between fossil fuel use since 1850 and planetary heating."These 21st-century anomalous heat waves are unfortunately caused by the anthropogenic greenhouse effect," he said.The United Nations' nuclear watchdog said on Sunday that a fire near the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant had "no impact" on the facility's safety."No impact has been reported for nuclear safety," the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement. Both Kyiv and Moscow said there had been no rise in radiation levels.In a later statement, the IAEA said it had requested that its team get "immediate access to the cooling tower to assess the damage".Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for the blaze at the cooling tower outside the plant's perimeter, and the IAEA chief said the conflict between the two sides continues to imperil the Zaporizhzhia facility, which is one of the 10 biggest nuclear plants in the world."These reckless attacks endanger nuclear safety at the plant and increase the risk of a nuclear accident. They must stop now," IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement, without attributing blame for the attack.The Russian operator of the plant said Ukraine had caused the fire with a military strike but that the reactors were in cold shutdown.Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the plant, said the fire occurred "as a result of shelling of the city of Enerhodar by the Ukrainian Armed Forces".Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Zaporizhzhia administration, said in a Telegram post on Monday the blaze has been "completely extinguished".Russian nuclear corporation Rosatom said in a statement on Monday that the Ukrainian army's attack on the plant can be characterized as an act of nuclear terrorism.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine of "nuclear terror" following the attack and urged the IAEA to respond.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of starting the fire.He posted a video on Telegram on Sunday showing a large plume of smoke coming out of one of the towers on the plant's territory, saying radiation indicators were normal but blamed Russia for using the nuclear plant "to blackmail Ukraine, and all of Europe and the world".'Dislodging' enemyOn Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his army to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops."One of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord, strife, intimidate people, destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society," Putin told a televised meeting with government officials.Ukrainian forces rammed through the Russian border a week ago and swept across some western parts of Russia's Kursk region. Governor Alexei Smirnov said on Monday the civilian toll has risen to 12 dead and 121 injured.In the neighboring Belgorod region to the south, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said evacuations had begun from the Krasnaya Yaruga district because of "enemy activity on the border".Responding to a question on Ukrainian troops crossing into Russian territory, China's Foreign Ministry said it has noted the development."China's position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear," a ministry spokesperson said on Monday. "The Chinese side calls on all parties to observe the three principles for de-escalating the situation, namely no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no fueling the flame by any party."China will continue to maintain communication with the international community to play a constructive role for the political settlement of the crisis, the spokesperson said.Agencies contributed to this story.A 16 percent fall in the number of overseas students at United Kingdom universities has led to them lowering entry requirements in a bid to attract more British students.The drop in the number of overseas students was triggered by changes to the UK's visa rules, which make it harder for people to secure a student visa, and almost impossible for them to bring family members with them.With far fewer overseas students on campus, and with their fees, which are considerably more than the fees paid by local students, no longer fl owing into universities' coffers, the institutions have been looking for other ways to fill their classes. The situation has led to a dip in A-level grades considered acceptable for entry.The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, or Ucas, which handles applications on behalf of UK universities, told The Telegraph newspaper many students are aware of the situation and are holding out for places in elite institutions that they would not ordinarily be qualified to attend.Jo Saxton, chief executive of Ucas, told the paper many more students with firm offers appropriate for their qualifications have turned them down and are "in many cases trading up" to gain access to more exclusive institutions."Some of the vice-chancellors who I've had conversations with about this, they've definitely clocked that behavior, and some of the most selective institutions have talked to me about recognizing that and wanting to keep that option open for students," she told the paper.She said the situation could lead to exclusive universities filling their classes with slightly less qualified students, and lower-level universities losing potential students qualified to study in them, and therefore failing to fill their rosters.The UK government said last week changes to visa rules introduced by the previous Conservative Party government earlier this year has resulted in the number of dependents arriving in the UK alongside international students falling by 80 percent, from 32,900 in the first quarter of 2023 to 6,700 in the same period this year.The number of overseas students applying for visas to study in the UK fell from 39,900 in the first quarter of 2023 to 35,000 in the same period in 2024.Under the new rules, the only international students allowed to bring family members with them to the UK are those studying for a PhD.Additionally, overseas students are no longer allowed to switch a student visa into a work visa upon completion of their studies, which has also deterred many people from choosing the UK as the destination for their studies.The Labour Party government, which replaced the Conservative Party on July 4, has not yet said whether or not it intends to change the visa rules it inherited.MOSCOW -- Ukraine's attack on the Russian border will receive a "worthy response" and the Russian military's main task is to knock the Ukrainian forces out of Russian territories, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday."The enemy will certainly receive a worthy response, and all the goals facing us will undoubtedly be achieved," the Russian leader said at an operational meeting via videoconference on the situation in the border regions.Putin said it is obvious that the Ukrainian army will continue to try to destabilize the situation in the border zone in order to destabilize the internal political situation in Russia.The president called on the Russian Federal Security Service, together with the National Guard, to ensure the regime of the counter-terrorism operation and an effective fight against Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in the border regions.Ukrainian forces crossed the Russian border last Tuesday and broke into parts of Russia's Kursk region. Currently, the Ukrainian military holds 28 settlements in the region, according to Alexei Smirnov, the region's acting governor.The situation in the Kursk region is complicated, Smirnov said, adding that about 120,000 people had been evacuated.In the neighboring Belgorod region to the south, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov also said on Monday the region has begun relocating its residents in the Krasnoyaruzhsky District to safer places amid increased military activity near the Ukrainian border.MOSCOW -- The infrastructure of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has sustained serious damage for the first time since the start of the ongoing shelling and attacks by Ukrainian forces, ZNPP Director of Communications Yevgenia Yashina said on Sunday."The infrastructure of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has for the first time suffered serious damage as a result of a strike by the Armed Forces of Ukraine," Yashina was quoted by Russia's TASS News Agency as saying.She added that the Ukrainian forces carried out the attack using a kamikaze drone. Despite the damage and subsequent fire at the cooling system facilities, Yashina said that the plant's operations have not been affected."The cooling tower is used for cooling, but currently, the reactor units are shut down, so the tower is not in use. The sprinkler pools are sufficient for cooling at this time," she said.Earlier, Yevgeny Balitsky, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, said that the cooling systems of the ZNPP caught fire as a result of the Ukrainian strike. He assured that all six reactor units of the plant are in a cold shutdown, eliminating any risk of a steam explosion.While the Russian side accused Kiev of deliberately attempting to destroy the plant and incite "nuclear terror," Ukraine's state-run nuclear energy operator Energoatom said Russia's "negligence" or arson could have sparked the fire.Energoatom also claimed, without providing evidence, that Russia has been using the plant's cooling towers to store military equipment and explosives.PARIS — The success of the Olympic Games has surpassed the wildest dreams of many in France, but in the next weeks, President Emmanuel Macron still will have to face the reality of the deadlocked politics created by his calling of snap legislative elections.With the Games just around the corner, the polls left France with three major blocs in parliament — the left as the largest followed by Macron's centrist forces and the far right — with none of them close to mustering the numbers for an overall majority.The former government of Macron allies, under Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, has carried on in a caretaker capacity throughout the Games, but five weeks after the elections, the country still does not have a new prime minister.While the Games have lifted what was a morose mood in France, it is far from certain this will give a new impulse to the remaining three years of the president's mandate."The fact that things are going well, that we are seen as beautiful and successful abroad, has struck a chord in a country that was experiencing decline and was no longer capable of doing great things collectively," said political commentator Emmanuel Riviere.'Frustrated' voters"This changes the collective climate but not the political situation: The situation remains blocked, many voters are frustrated ... The French are putting things into perspective and remain very angry with Emmanuel Macron."Macron's approval ratings remain well under 30 percent, with the president keeping a low profile during the election campaign and the Games, spending most of the Olympics ensconced in the Mediterranean holiday residence of the French president.The number one priority for Macron will be naming, and winning approval for, a new prime minister and government, a process that appears to remain as blocked as it was before the Games.As visitors and Parisians gasp in awe for a last time at the Olympic cauldron tethered to a balloon, sources within the executive are playing down the prospects of a rapid breakthrough.Macron, known to use his vacations at the Fort de Bregancon holiday residence for deep reading and reflection, is "still thinking", according to a person close to him.Agencies Via XinhuaBarely a month after taking office, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing his first major challenge with violent protests raging in several cities across the country. Anti-immigration sentiments, fanned by the rise of the far right in the United Kingdom and compounded by the cost of living crisis, can be blamed for the current state of affairs, experts said.After a month-long honeymoon during which he made his international debut at the NATO summit in Washington and attended the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics, Starmer now has the grim task in hand of quelling social unrest at home.Violence broke out in a number of places after rumors circulated online that a Muslim immigrant was behind the July 29 stabbing in Southport, northwest England, which left three young girls dead.Protesters took to the streets and stormed mosques and hotels housing asylum-seekers in major cities, including London, Liverpool, Plymouth and Belfast."The rioting is politically driven," Danny Ewart, a Portsmouth resident, told China Daily. "I am frustrated by the direction this country is headed, but we need to come together and work on our differences. We also need to manage the immigration numbers as it's not sustainable."Starmer has condemned the riots, calling it "far-right thuggery".British monarch King Charles has called for unity and understanding after the riots, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said in a statement on Friday."It is the first major challenge facing Starmer," Xu Ruike, associate professor of British politics and foreign policy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, told China Daily."Although it is a rare event, it reflects the underlying issues in UK society, in particular the rise of the far right," Xu said."Rioting is entirely down to inept Conservative and Labour governments," Billy Bessey, who took part in anti-immigration demonstrations in Portsmouth last weekend, told China Daily.The rioting is wrong but the blood is on the hands of politicians, he added."Anti-immigration sentiment is just the trigger," Huang Fei, associate professor at the School of International Studies and research fellow at the School of Global and Area Studies of Renmin University of China, told China Daily.Huang said the financial burden of households worsened after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, sending inflation to more than 10 percent in 2022. Extra checks and tariffs after Brexit and the uncertainty of the talks on free trade thereafter have added to livelihood woes.The lackluster performance of the British economy in recent years also added to public dissatisfaction with the government. The GDP grew by 0.1 percent year-on-year in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics. The government declared at the end of July the country was "broke and broken".Net migration was unusually high in 2023, at 685,000, driven by an increase in non-European Union citizens coming to the UK, according to the Migration Observatory."The large number of migrants is putting great pressure on the society, leading to reduced social welfare for the general public, especially the ones in the lower income segment," Huang said.An increasing number of people are growing angry with the large number of illegal migrants coming to the country and anti-immigrant sentiment was a major factor in the Brexit referendum vote, Huang added."Reform UK is the only way we will ever get to control our borders," Bessey said.At the election last month, the Reform UK party led by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage won 14 percent of the votes, but only gained five seats."It is underrepresented in parliament as the UK's first-past-the-post voting system favors the bigger parties," Xu of Beijing Foreign Studies University said.The riots come amid a broader right-wing populist surge in European countries. During the European Parliament election in June, far-right parties made major gains. In France, President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the lower house of parliament in a bid to block the far-right National Rally party from coming to power."It reflects the political polarization, further complicating the political landscape, combined with a crisis of trust in government," Huang of Renmin University of China said.Police have blamed peddling of false information online, amplified by social media, for the violence."The misinformation that was widely circulated plays up to the insecurity felt by the public, fostering a willingness among individuals to instinctively believe the social media posts," Xu said.The Online Safety Act, designed to regulate social media companies, was passed in October but is not expected to be enforced until next year.Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas Symonds said on Friday the government would revisit the law's framework."We need to be mindful of what information we share. Otherwise, it sets a very dangerous precedent," Ewart said.Nick Ive contributed to this story.shaoxinying@chinadaily.com.cnOn July 4, the British public voted overwhelmingly to reject the Conservative government of Rishi Sunak and deliver the Labour Party's Keir Starmer to office, thus bringing Labour to power for the first time since 2010. After years of political instability, controversy and chaos that have beset the United Kingdom, as well as economic stagnation and decline, it is hoped that the new government will offer a spell of stability, sensibility and pragmatism in its policies both at home and abroad. With Starmer commanding a massive majority, he is sure to forge his own vision for the country.It is hoped that the UK will be able to earnestly and productively reengage with one of its key economic partners — China. The previous government is guilty of destroying the bilateral relationship with Beijing due to its mismanagement of Britain's foreign policy as a whole.It pursued a highly ideological path with Brexit, paid excessive subservience to the United States, and deliberately whipped up anti-China sentiment domestically to distract attention from its failures. Then there was opposition from certain parliamentary members' groups which were subject to the influence of foreign organizations.The new government, therefore, offers an opportunity for Britain to reset its relations with the world on more sensible terms. Although we should not expect geopolitical realities to change, and while Starmer is by no means a radical, having purged the "anti-war Left "from his party while in opposition, what we can realistically expect is a foreign policy based more on pragmatism, national interests and sensibility, as opposed to one premised on ideology, identity and short-termism.For example, the previous Conservative government was obsessed with pursuing a bilateral trade agreement with the US on the sole premise of Anglophone exceptionalism, as opposed to actual benefits.Even as a protectionist, Washington showed no interest in such a deal, and Downing Street happily sacrificed its other interests on a whim, especially those concerning China. Its routine weaponization of anti-China sentiment for short-term political gain also made it impossible to engage with Beijing even as Sunak professed that he wished to do so in certain areas, becoming a victim of internal party conflict.As a result, what we are likely to see from a Labour government is not a drastic change in policy, but certainly a rebalancing that will make it possible for London to have an amicable relationship with Beijing again and to compartmentalize disagreements and areas of cooperation. Already, Starmer's government is pursuing a "reset" with the European Union that has been described as an "end to the Brexit era"; in other words, an end to the theatrical nationalism and imperial-era nostalgia of the Conservatives and a return of cooperation-focused policies. When the time is right, we are likely to see this happen with China too.While the previous government was subjected to backbench rebellions frequently led by highly ideological anti-China members of Parliament, Starmer's large-scale majority and emphasis on party discipline will mean his agenda will not be disrupted, and therefore, backbench MPs cannot impose "costs" on the government for engaging with Beijing. For example, owing to factional conflict within the Conservative Party, individuals such as Iain Duncan Smith and Liz Truss held disproportionate influence over the government's positions on China and threatened rebellion constantly, which is what produced such jarring inconsistencies.However, Beijing should nonetheless be aware that US-funded groups and organizations, as well as the Taiwan region, will continue to press for influence among the new batch of MPs, as well as a hostile mainstream media, and thus the so-called "golden era" will not return. This, however, is preferable to the Cold War-style conflict that was actively sought by some in the previous administration. Ultimately, the UK continues to have significant interests in a cooperative, open and mature relationship with China, one which can be made to work despite ideological and geopolitical differences. As Britain enters a new era, it is time for a mature "reset "based on national interests.The author is a British political and international-relations analyst. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily. Far-right anti-immigrant riots that flared in several United Kingdom towns and cities earlier this month could ignite again, the country's justice secretary warned on the weekend, as Prime Minister Keir Starmer canceled a vacation in order to focus on overseeing the response.Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood wrote in The Observer newspaper on Sunday that the situation remained tense and that police officers will continue to work hard to identify and arrest rioters and online agitators in a bid to fully restore order."If you stoke fear, or take part in violence, the full force of the law will be brought against you. Justice will be done," she wrote. "The impact of these days of disorder will be felt for months and years to come."A spokesperson for the prime minister said on Thursday he had delayed his vacation in the wake of the riots, which began on July 30 and continued nightly until Aug 7.Starmer's decision followed a YouGov poll that found 70 percent of respondents thought it was not the right time for him to take a break.Starmer said on Friday it was clear many rioters had stopped attacking mosques and asylum seeker accommodation because of the lengthy prison sentences being handed to fellow agitators."We have to stay on high alert going into this weekend," he said. "We absolutely have to make sure that our communities are safe and secure and feel safe and secure."Stephen Parkinson, the UK's director of public prosecutions and head of the Crown Prosecution Service, told the Sunday Times newspaper sentences of up to 10 years could be dispensed to rioters in the coming days.By Saturday, police had arrested 779 people in connection with the unrest and formally charged 349 of them.Parkinson said many more arrests and charges were expected in the coming days."As well as seeing a more significant number of charges coming through the system in the next few days, (prosecutions are) going to include more serious charges with stiffer penalties," he added.The far-right riots began after three young girls were stabbed to death and several others were injured at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the northwestern England seaside town of Southport on July 29.The suspect in that attack was incorrectly identified online as a radical Islamist asylum seeker. Police quickly pointed out that their 17-year-old suspect was not known to have been a Muslim and was born in the UK, but the unrest continued for several more days.The riots seemed to ease last week due to a combination of online misinformation being countered, a huge police presence, counter-demonstrations from anti-fascist groups, and the deterring impact of long prison sentences.As the 2024 Paris Olympics draw to a close, all eyes are on the final medal count. And this year, the Olympic medals hold special significance, paying homage to one of France's most iconic landmarks — the Eiffel Tower.Charles Leung, CEO of French luxury jewelry brand Chaumet, shares the intriguing story behind the medal's striking appearance."The Olympic committee gave us a very special brief — to create a medal that has never been seen before in Olympic history, one that would make France shine on the global stage," Leung told China Daily.Chaumet's storied history with the French royal family made them the natural choice for this prestigious commission. "More than 240 years ago, when Napoleon was crowned, he came to Chaumet for his coronation crowns. We've had the honor of designing tiaras and crowns for the French royal court over the centuries," Leung explained. "So when there was something this important for France, the country turned to us again."Chaumet's opportunity to design the medal for the 2024 Paris Olympics was largely due to its parent company, LVMH Group, a premium partner of the global sporting event.Antoine Arnault, head of image and environment at LVMH, emphasized the significance of the 2024 Paris Olympics. "It's an exceptional event that hasn't been held in France for 100 years, one of the most closely followed in the world, and it's taking place in the city where most of our maisons were born," Arnault said. He added that as the leading French group, being involved in the Paris Olympics "was not only an obvious choice, but also a responsibility".Chaumet's design team set out to integrate the Eiffel Tower into the medal's structure, using recycled steel bars from the iconic landmark itself. "The Eiffel Tower was originally meant to be a temporary structure for the 1889 World's Fair, but it was such a sensation that Paris decided to keep it," Leung said."The issue was that the material was not good enough to last for so long. So what happened was that, over the years, little by little, bar by bar, section by section, the original metal framework has been replaced with stronger steel to ensure the tower's longevity."Chaumet's designers had the idea of cutting the Eiffel Tower steel into a hexagonal shape, as it holds deep symbolic meaning for the French."The hexagon represents the shape of France itself," said Leung, adding that it also evokes the image of the humble but hardworking bee, which the French have long associated with national unity and industriousness.Adding this slice of Parisian history into the medal's core was a delicate process. "We wanted each athlete to be able to bring home a piece of the Eiffel Tower, a tangible connection to the host city that would stay with them forever," Leung explained. The team carefully engineered the setting to showcase the recycled metal, surrounding it with a sunray pattern that radiates outward.Strict specificationsLeung also said the designers had to meticulously adhere to the Olympics' strict specifications. "The weight, thickness and other technical details had to be perfect. This is not just another piece of jewelry — it's a prize that carries immense meaning and prestige," he said.Additionally, the design incorporates France's rich history of world fairs. "The Eiffel Tower was actually built as a temporary structure for the 1889 World's Fair. That was the first time Chinese migrants came to Paris," he said.Leung reflected on the honor of crafting these unique medals. "This is one of the most prestigious orders we've ever received, second only to Napoleon's crown. However, that was for personal use. We believe these medals will become the most beautiful jewels ever crafted by human hands," he said."These medals can't simply be bought. They must be won, earned through an arduous journey filled with sweat, tears, successes and failures. It requires the love and support of an entire community to achieve."wangmingjie@mail.chinadailyuk.comThe newly elected Labour Party could be ushering in a positive new era between the British government and the European Union.Reporter: Julian SheaVideo：Brian ChangMOSCOW -- Russia has declared a state of emergency in the Kursk region due to the tense situation there, Russia's Ministry of Emergencies said on Friday."On August 9, an extraordinary meeting of the government commission for the prevention and elimination of emergencies and ensuring fire safety took place. On the agenda of the discussion was the situation in the territory of the Kursk Region due to the attack by the Ukrainian armed forces. A response at the federal level has been established in the region," the ministry said in a statement.Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry said on Friday that a military operation to defeat the Ukrainian forces in Kursk is ongoing, with the Ukrainian side suffering a loss of 945 troops and 102 military vehicles since their incursion into the region.A Polish woman who was afraid of needles since childhood has now studied acupuncture at the London Academy of Chinese Acupuncture for three years.

Will she be able to graduate successfully?Reporter: Xing YiVideo: Han JingRussian forces were battling Ukrainian troops for a third day on Thursday, after the latter smashed through the Russian border in the Kursk region, which introduced a state of emergency on Wednesday.In one of the biggest Ukrainian attacks on Russia in more than two years of conflict, about 1,000 Ukrainian troops rammed through the Russian border in the early hours of Tuesday with tanks and armored vehicles, covered in the air by swarms of drones and pounding artillery, Russian officials said.Shelling and drone attacks killed five Kursk residents, according to the Russian Health Ministry, and 31 people were injured, including six children.The governor of Kursk announced an "emergency situation" on Wednesday evening, a move that gives authorities the power to restrict movement to bring the situation under control.Russia's National Guard said it had beefed up security around the nearby Kursk nuclear power station and its four reactors.Ukrainian forces have pushed to the northwest of the border town Sudzha, nearly 500 kilometers southwest of Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry said."Attempts by individual units to break through deep into the territory in the Kursk direction are being suppressed," the ministry said.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday described the attack in Kursk as a "large-scale provocation".During a meeting with the heads of the Defense Ministry, General Staff and the Federal Security Service, Putin said, "Kyiv has undertaken another large-scale provocation, firing indiscriminately from different types of weapons, including rockets, at civilian buildings, residential houses and ambulances."Army Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov told Putin during the meeting via video link that Russian forces had halted a thrust by up to 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers — more than three times the figure that the Defense Ministry stated on Tuesday — and would push them back to the border."The enemy's advance deep into territory in the Kursk direction was stopped by the actions of the units covering the state border together with border guards and reinforcement units, with airstrikes, missile and artillery fire," Gerasimov said.Moscow also said its forces had destroyed a US-made Bradley Fighting Vehicle that Ukraine was using in the incursion.Kyiv's objectives remain unclear, with some analysts suggesting that it is an attempt to stretch Russia's army, forcing them to move units away from the eastern Donetsk region where they have been advancing, Agence France-Presse reported.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made no reference to the attack in his nightly video address on Wednesday, and exhorted Kyiv's soldiers to press on and weaken Russian forces.Several Ukrainian brigades stationed along the border region said they could not comment. Ukraine's Defense Ministry and General Staff also said they would not comment.'No violation of policy'In Washington, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the United States was in contact with Ukrainian authorities about their actions in Kursk.Miller said US rules on Ukrainian use of US weapons — authorized in areas over the Russian border — remained in effect, but that Ukraine's actions were "not a violation of our policy".There was fighting around Sudzha, the last transit point for Russian gas heading to Europe via Ukraine. The Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhhorod pipeline carried about 14.65 billion cubic meters of gas last year, about half of Russia's gas exports to Europe.A Russian TV station broadcast images from the city center showing destroyed buildings, debris strewn across the street and large craters in the ground from artillery hits.Russian energy giant Gazprom said on Thursday it would continue shipping gas through the Sudzha metering station.Ukraine's gas transmission operator said Russian natural gas was transiting to European consumers normally. Just 60 kilometers to the northeast lies the Kursk nuclear power station.Agencies contributed to this story.Thousands of people took to the streets across the United Kingdom on Wednesday to protest against anti-immigrant, far-right rioting that had flared throughout the previous week.The counter-demonstrations were peaceful and deterred far-right rioters, giving the country its first quiet night since July 30.Police chiefs said residents had effectively retaken their streets, while cautioning that far-right violence could return.Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley described it as a "very successful night" on which far-right violence had "abated", while Tiffany Lynch, acting chairwoman of the Police Federation, which represents 145,000 officers, said on Radio 4's Today program that officers were optimistic but still experiencing "heightened anxiety".Diana Johnson, UK minister of policing, fire and crime prevention, said on Today that many officers were exhausted after several long days battling rioters."That's why we needed to have a show of strength last night," she said on Thursday.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday vowed no "letup" in moves to prevent further far-right riots across England, after more anticipated street violence failed to materialize overnight."It's important that we don't let up here," Starmer told media outlets as he visited a mosque and met community leaders in Solihull, West Midlands.Wednesday's counter-demonstrations, badged under the slogan "Hope not Hate", took place in communities including Birmingham, Brighton, London, Newcastle, Sheffield and Southend.While they undoubtedly dissuaded far-right rioters, thousands of extra police officers also kept a lid on things, and troublemakers were also likely deterred by prison sentences of up to three years handed to those involved in earlier riots.Troublemakers may also have realized they had been manipulated by online misinformation that wrongly attributed a horrific knife attack in the northwestern town of Southport on July 29 to an Islamic extremist migrant.In the multiday violence that followed that incident, police made more than 400 arrests and charged 140 people.Johnson, the policing minister, said officers will continue to sift through video and online content seeking other participants and organizers of the trouble. Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer stated that a tragedy had been prevented following the cancelation of three Taylor Swift concerts scheduled for this week in Vienna.The performances, originally set for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, were called off after authorities arrested individuals suspected of planning an attack in the area, possibly targeting the concert venue itself.The decision to cancel Swift's three sold-out shows at Ernst Happel Stadium in the Austrian capital was made by government officials on Wednesday."Thanks to the intensive cooperation of our police and the newly established DSN (Austria's security agency) with foreign services, the threat was identified early on, combated, and a tragedy prevented," Nehammer said in a social media post.As many as 170,000 fans had bought tickets for the three concerts, and organizers promised to refund all ticket holders for the canceled shows.Many fans of the performer, who are known as Swifties, had spent thousands of euros on travel and accommodation to attend the shows, reported Associated Press.Swift's promoter, Barracuda Music, announced the cancelations of the three shows, part of Swift's Eras tour, in an Instagram post on Wednesday."With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety," it said.Nehammer emphasized the gravity of the situation in his statement, saying: "The situation surrounding the apparently planned terror attack in Vienna was very serious."Franz Ruf, Austria's general director for public security, announced on Wednesday that two people had been arrested on suspicion of planning attacks inspired by the Islamic State group on large events in the Austrian capital.He said the authorities had apprehended a 19-year-old Austrian citizen on Wednesday morning in Ternitz, Lower Austria, and that a second arrest occurred later in Vienna, but gave no further details."According to the current status of the investigation, the two suspects became radicalized via the internet," Ruf said. He noted that the 19-year-old had made "an oath of allegiance" to Islamic State last month.Police conducted a major operation in Ternitz, focusing on the residence of the 19-year-old suspect, where they said they found chemical substances."During our investigations, we identified preparatory actions and noted that the 19-year-old suspect had a particular focus on the Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna," Ruf said.In 2017, a suicide bomber killed 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena, in the United Kingdom. The attacker, Salman Abedi, detonated a bomb as fans were exiting the venue.In November 2020, an Islamic State sympathizer killed four and wounded 23 in a shooting rampage in central Vienna, before police fatally shot him.BRUSSELS - July 2024 is the second-warmest month worldwide in the data record, trailing slightly behind July 2023, the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service reported on Thursday.The average surface air temperature of July was 16.91 degrees Celsius, 0.04 degrees Celsius lower than a year ago, marking the end of a 13-month period where each month was the hottest on record for that time of year, according to a report released by Copernicus."The streak of record-breaking months has come to an end, but only by a whisker," said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the agency.Although July 2024 has narrowly fallen short of becoming the hottest month, the Earth still experienced two warmest days on record on July 22 and 23, with the global average temperature reaching 17.16 degrees Celsius and 17.15 degrees Celsius, the report said."The overall context hasn't changed, our climate continues to warm," Burgess said, adding that the devastating effects of climate change will continue until global greenhouse gas emissions reach net zero.While the year 2023 has been confirmed as the warmest year on record, the report suggested that the year 2024 is increasingly likely to surpass 2023 and become the new warmest year.From January to July 2024, the global temperature anomaly is 0.27 degrees Celsius higher than the same period in 2023. For 2024 not to surpass 2023 as the warmest year, the average anomaly for the remaining months would need to decrease by at least 0.23 degrees Celsius.This rarely occurred in the entire dataset, increasing the likelihood of 2024 becoming the hottest year, the report added.LONDON -- Thousands of anti-racism protesters took to the streets in many cities and towns of the United Kingdom on Wednesday to counter far-right demonstrations after days of unrest following Southport stabbing.By 11 pm (2200 GMT), most of the planned far-right demonstrations, numbering more than 100, didn't materialize after the British government deployed heavy police force to maintain order and large numbers of anti-racist protesters swarmed streets in cities and towns like London, Bristol, Brighton, Birmingham, Liverpool, Hastings and Walthamstow.Anti-racism protests held placards with words such as "Smash fascism & racism", "Refugees welcome. Stop the far-right" and "Love, not hate." In Brighton, only a small number of far-right protesters turned up and were outnumbered by huge anti-racism crowds.This came as a relief for the UK after days of far-right protests, targeting Muslims and the immigrant population in general, gripped the country, resulting in police officers being injured, stores being looted, hotels housing asylum-seekers being stormed.The unrest was sparked by online disinformation that wrongly claimed the suspect who killed three children in Southport, northwest England, at the end of July was a Muslim immigrant. It was a 17-year-old boy named Axel Rudakubana born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents that was later charged with murder.More than 100 rioters have been charged following the disorder and their cases have been swiftly processed in the court system. On Wednesday, three men were jailed, with one being given three years of prison time.UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was deeply alarmed by reports that a large number of communication devices exploded across Lebanon and in Syria on Tuesday and Wednesday, his spokesman said."The secretary-general is deeply alarmed by reports that a large number of communication devices exploded across Lebanon, as well as in Syria, on Sept. 17 and 18, killing at least eleven people, including children, and injuring thousands," said Stephane Dujarric, the spokesman, in a statement.Dujarric said the UN chief urged all concerned actors to exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation, and urged the parties to recommit to the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities to restore stability."The United Nations supports all diplomatic and political efforts to end the violence that threatens to engulf the region," said the spokesman.Lebanese officials reported that explosions targeting pagers and handheld radios killed at least 26 people, including two children, and injured more than 3,200 others across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday.In Lebanon's neighbor Syria, 14 Hezbollah fighters were injured when their communication devices exploded in the capital, Damascus, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor.BEIRUT - The death toll in explosions of wireless communication devices across Lebanon on Wednesday rose to 14, with injuries up to 450, said the Lebanese Health Ministry.Explosions were heard Wednesday afternoon in Beirut's southern suburb and several regions in southern and eastern Lebanon.Security reports indicated that a wireless communication device exploded in Beirut's southern suburb during the funeral of four Hezbollah members, with similar explosions igniting fires in cars and residential buildings, resulting in several injuries.Local media said the devices involved were identified as ICOM V82 models, walkie-talkie devices reportedly made in Japan. Emergency services were dispatched to the scene to transport the injured to local hospitals.Meanwhile, the Lebanese Army Command issued a statement urging citizens not to gather near the sites of the incidents to allow medical teams to enter.So far Hezbollah has not commented on the incident.The explosions followed an attack a day ago, in which the Israeli military allegedly targeted pager batteries used by Hezbollah members, resulting in the deaths of 12 individuals, including two children, and approximately 2,800 injuries.In a statement on Tuesday, Hezbollah accused Israel of being "fully responsible for the criminal aggression that also targeted civilians", threatening to retaliate. Israel has not yet commented on the explosions.Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border escalated on Oct 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack the day before. Israel then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced that Israel is at "the beginning of a new stage of the war" against Hezbollah.UNITED NATIONS - The UN General Assembly (UNGA) passed a non-binding resolution on Wednesday demanding an end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory within the next 12 months by an overwhelming margin.The resolution was adopted with 124 votes in favor, 14 against and 43 abstentions, during the UNGA's 10th emergency special session considering Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.The resolution demanding that Israel comply with all its legal obligations under international law, including advisory opinions by the International Court of Justice, was introduced by the State of Palestine on Tuesday and was co-sponsored by more than two dozen nations.By the newly adopted resolution, the UNGA "demands that Israel brings to an end without delay its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which constitutes a wrongful act of a continuing character entailing its international responsibility and do so no later than 12 months from the adoption of the present resolution".The UNGA also demands that Israel comply without delay with all its legal obligations under international law, including as stipulated by the International Court of Justice.In remarks before the vote, Mohamed Issa Abushahab, the permanent representative of the United Arab Emirates to the United Nations, said the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza must be addressed through unimpeded access to those in need, a ceasefire deal and the full implementation of all related Security Council resolutions.A credible peace process must be relaunched to work towards a two-State solution to diffuse this conflict, he said, expressing support for the State of Palestine's full statehood and UN membership. "The time has come to end the suffering," he noted.Introducing the draft resolution on Tuesday, Riyad Mansour, the permanent observer of the State of Palestine to the United Nations, called for the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.He said the Palestinian people have been steadfast in the pursuit of their inalienable rights, just like all other citizens worldwide who seek self-determination."The Palestinians want to live, not survive -- they want to be safe in their homes, they want their children to go to school without fear. They want to be free in reality as they are in spirit," said Mansour.BEIRUT -- Nine people were killed and more than 300 others injured in explosions of wireless communication devices across Lebanon on Wednesday, the Lebanese Health Ministry reported.Explosions were heard Wednesday afternoon in Beirut's southern suburb and several regions in southern and eastern Lebanon.Security reports indicated that a wireless communication device exploded in Beirut's southern suburb during the funeral of four Hezbollah members, with similar explosions igniting fires in cars and residential buildings, resulting in several injuries.Local media said the devices involved were identified as ICOM V82 models, walkie-talkie devices reportedly made in Japan.

We saw children and elderly people," Abiad said.AFPUnited Nations human rights experts have criticized Western countries for allowing Israel to go unpunished over its military operations in Gaza, which they said have now reached "alarming levels" as violence intensified in the West Bank to levels "not seen in two decades".They also questioned whether Israel's membership in the UN should be reconsidered, given its attacks on the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, and disregard for UN advisories as a whole.At a news conference on Monday, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese questioned Israel's membership at the UN for its "zero" respect for the organization.Albanese noted that Israel's "genocidal assault" has devastated entire families, razed neighborhoods and destroyed essential infrastructure.She said UNRWA is an "untouchable mechanism" that justifies the permanent responsibility of the UN toward the Palestinian people. According to the UN, at least 220 employees of the subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly have been killed in Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip since Oct 7.Arie Afriansyah, associate professor at the Faculty of Law at Universitas Indonesia, told China Daily there was no precedent to "unseat" a UN member state.He said the only matter now was "the support that mainly comes from the US to Israel".George Katrougalos, special rapporteur on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, said it was "clear now to everybody" that there is an evolving tragedy in Palestine."However, this tragedy is an issue not just for the Palestinians. It is immediately related to the future of multilateralism and the UN system of rules," said Katrougalos.Double standards"I think that it is important for the future of a fair, just, democratic, equitable international order, not with double standards regarding international crimes. But (to) have a uniform position based on principles, values, and the United Nations charter," said Katrougalos as he called for the immediate recognition of the state of Palestine.Tlaleng Mofokeng, special rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, said it was important to note that even before Oct 7, the situation for Palestinians "was already incompatible with the realization of the right to health".Abdalfatah Asqool, an international law lecturer at the University of Palestine in Gaza, said: "There are some countries that are still arming Israeli and also those countries also must face sanctions, as what happened to some other countries that even did not do anything close to what Israel (is doing) in the Gaza Strip," said Asqool."Therefore, if they do not want to spark a regional war, the international community must stop Israel now," he added.Meanwhile, Israel announced the expansion of its aims on Tuesday, widening its nearly yearlong fight against Hamas in Gaza to focus on Hezbollah along its northern border with Lebanon amid reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to replace his defense minister with a hawkish rival.Netanyahu's office said he laid out the aim in an overnight security cabinet meeting.Tens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the border by exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah. Israel has said it prefers a diplomatic solution that would see Hezbollah moved farther back from the border.Agencies contributed to this story.The United Arab Emirates said on Saturday it will not support Israel's "day after" plan in Gaza unless a Palestinian State is established, making its stance clear despite having signed the Abraham Accords in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel.UAE Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan reiterated this position in a post on X.In May, Abdullah also rejected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's suggestion the UAE could participate in the civil administration of the Gaza Strip, with security control under Israel.Abdullah said Netanyahu "lacks legitimate authority to implement this step, or take any similar measures". The UAE "refuses to be involved in any plan aimed at providing cover for the Israeli presence in the Gaza Strip", he added.The Abraham Accords are a series of agreements aimed at normalizing diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab countries."It is an assertion that for the UAE, the Palestinian cause is a critical issue and that was clear through utilizing the relationship with Israel to send humanitarian aid, initiate the vaccination campaign in Gaza, etc," Rasha Al Joundy, a senior researcher at the Dubai Public Policy Research Centre, told China Daily."There is no scenario that the region will enjoy peace without a Palestinian State. Any other temporary solution, the UAE doesn't have an interest to be part of."Signing the Abraham Accords doesn't mean that Israel gets to be arrogant in its proposals for the day after, especially (with) its neighbors."Almost a year into the conflict, Israel has yet to meet its objectives of eliminating Hamas in Gaza and securing the release of about 100 hostages still being held by the militant group, while Palestinian civilians continue to pay a heavy price.The Palestinian death toll has swelled to at least 41,226, while Netanyahu faced criticisms from citizens and the hostages' families over his prolonged efforts to reach a cease-fire deal.Recently, the Israeli military, after months of denial, admitted a high probability that three Israeli captives who died in Gaza in November might have been killed in its own strikes.Israel's military assault has also begun to spill over to other parts of the region, particularly against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthis in Yemen, and more recently Iran.On Sunday, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Houthi group, warned their military actions against Israel would intensify. This warning followed a missile attack launched by the Houthis earlier in the day targeting central Israel."Our operations will continue as long as the aggression and siege on the Gaza Strip continue," al-Houthi said in a televised address, Xinhua News Agency reported.In an interview with the BBC, the United Nations' Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator Sigrid Kaag said the international community is collectively failing innocent civilians in Gaza as it is not meeting the needs or creating prospects and hope for civilians in the besieged enclave. AMMAN -- Jordan's King Abdullah II instructed on Sunday Jafar Hassan to form new cabinet, state media Petra reported. JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday warned Houthi forces in Yemen that Israel would retaliate after a missile they launched struck central Israel, an area typically safe from projectiles."This morning, the Houthis launched a surface-to-surface missile from Yemen into our territory," Netanyahu told his cabinet ministers at the start of their weekly meeting. "Anyone who attacks us will not escape our wrath.""The Houthis should already know that we exact a heavy price for any attempt to harm us," he added, referring to an Israeli airstrike on the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port city of Hodeidah on July 20, which killed at least six people, injured dozens of others, sparked a large fire, and caused extensive damage to the port's infrastructure.Houthi forces claimed responsibility for the missile attack, saying in a statement on Sunday that they had launched a hypersonic missile targeting the area of Jaffa, in southern Tel Aviv. According to their statement, the missile reached "a military target deep" in Israel.The Israeli military reported that the missile was fired from Yemen at 6:21 am local time (0321 GMT). "An initial inquiry indicates the missile most likely fragmented in mid-air," the military said in a statement, adding that the attack triggered air raid sirens across central Israel and sent residents running to shelters."Several interception attempts were made by the Arrow and Iron Dome aerial defense systems, and the results are under review," the military added.Fallen fragments of interceptors were found in open areas and near the Paatei Modi'in railway station, close to Ben Gurion Airport. A fire also erupted in Kfar Daniel, another location in the area. Israeli Fire and Rescue Services were dispatched to extinguish the blaze.No injuries have been reported so far.The missile marked the second time a projectile from Yemen has reached central Israel, following a Houthi drone attack in July that killed one person in Tel Aviv.AMMAN -- The government of Jordan's Prime Minister Bisher Khasawneh submitted its resignation on Sunday after the parliamentary elections, the state-owned Al Mamlaka TV reported.UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations and its partners have vaccinated against polio more than 560,000 children under 10 in the Gaza Strip, UN humanitarians said on Friday.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the first round of the emergency vaccination campaign in the north, central, and southern zones of Gaza wound up on Thursday.OCHA said that during the final phase of the first round in northern Gaza, the United Nations and its partners reached more than 112,000 children with the vaccine over three days.The office said its partners are set to begin the second round of the vaccination campaign in about four weeks.The humanitarians said a new analysis by the WHO found 22,500 people injured in Gaza as of July 23 are estimated to have life-changing injuries that will require rehabilitation services now and for years to come. The injuries represent a quarter of the overall injuries the Ministry of Health reported in that period.OCHA said the report comes amid the decimation of the health system in Gaza, with just 17 of 36 hospitals partially functional, while primary health care and community-level services are often suspended or made inaccessible due to attacks, insecurity and repeated evacuation orders.The office said it has mobilized humanitarian partners to assess the needs of people affected by the latest two-day operation by Israeli forces in Tulkarm and Tubas in the West Bank. That operation concluded on Thursday, with nearly a dozen Palestinians reportedly killed.OCHA said dozens of families were displaced when their homes were damaged on Wednesday and Thursday during the operation, which involved Israeli air and ground troops, with exchanges of fire between Palestinians and Israeli forces."The use of lethal war-like tactics in these areas of the West Bank has raised concerns over excessive use of force which appear to exceed law enforcement standards," OCHA said.Saudi Arabia and China can complement each other by cooperating in R&D as well as in innovation and facilitate Saudi manufacturing and logistics in its vision for a new regional industrial hub, said Bandar Bin Ibrahim Alkhorayef, Saudi minister of Industry and Mineral Resources, in an interview with China Daily. (Reporting by Jan Yumul)UNITED NATIONS - Six staff members of the UN relief agency for Palestinians, known as UNRWA, were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.A school-turned-shelter for around 12,000 people was hit by Israeli airstrikes on Wednesday, and six UNRWA staff members were among those killed, Guterres said on X, formerly Twitter."What's happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable," he said. "These dramatic violations of international humanitarian law need to stop now."At least 18 Palestinians were killed and many others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a UN-run school sheltering displaced people in the central Gaza Strip on Wednesday, according to Palestinian sources.The sources told Xinhua that an Israeli warplane fired at least one missile at the shelter in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said that aid workers were among the victims.ABU DHABI - Premier Li Qiang arrived here Wednesday for an official visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the invitation of the UAE's Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.Upon his arrival, Li said that bilateral ties between China and the UAE have maintained strong growth momentum since the two countries established diplomatic relations 40 years ago, and their friendship has grown stronger and continues to flourish.Li noted that the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in May has drawn a new blueprint for China-UAE ties, charting the course and injecting strong momentum for advancing bilateral relations and cooperation.Li pointed out that under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, China-UAE relations have developed comprehensively, rapidly and in depth with practical cooperation in various fields going deeper and cultural exchanges becoming increasingly active.GAZA - Hamas on Wednesday reiterated its readiness to implement the ceasefire agreement based on the US proposal and rejected any new conditions on this agreement from any party.During a meeting with Qatari and Egyptian mediators in Doha, the Hamas negotiating delegation expressed its "continued positivity and flexibility" in reaching a ceasefire agreement for the Gaza Strip. They emphasized the requirement for the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the entire territory of the Strip, according to a statement released by Hamas.Hamas also emphasized that the management of the Strip is an internal Palestinian affair with an agreed-upon Palestinian vision. The statement noted that Hamas welcomes the holding of a national dialogue with all Palestinian factions and forces to agree on such a national vision.The statement came as negotiations mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States to secure a Gaza ceasefire have stalled. Despite objections from Egypt and Hamas, Israel insists on keeping its forces in the Philadelphi Corridor, a 100-meter-wide and 14-km-long buffer zone along the Egypt-Gaza border.US President Joe Biden revealed a three-phase proposal in late May, hoping it would lead to an end to the ongoing Gaza conflict and the release of all hostages.Hamas has repeatedly expressed its commitment to what was agreed upon during past talks, based on the US proposal and UN Security Council Resolution.GAZA - At least 14 Palestinians were killed and 10 others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a UN-run school sheltering displaced people in the central Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian sources on Wednesday.Palestinian security sources told Xinhua that an Israeli warplane fired at least one missile at the school-converted shelter in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. Medical sources said the strike killed 14 people and wounded 10 more, while the Hamas-run Gaza government media office confirmed that aid workers were among the victims.Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that the Israeli Air Force has conducted a precise strike on militants operating inside a Hamas command and control center in the al-Nuseirat area.It added Hamas militants "plan and execute attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel" using this center embedded inside a compound that previously served as the Al-Jaouni school.The attack came following a previous Israeli bombing of the UN-run school on July 6, which killed at least 16 Palestinians, most of them children and women.Also on Wednesday, the al-Nuseirat refugee camp saw a separate Israeli airstrike targeting a residential house, leaving at least four Palestinians dead, Palestinian security sources told Xinhua.The Israeli army also launched an airstrike on Wednesday on the Al-Qarra family home in the town of Khuza'a, east of the Khan Younis city in southern Gaza, killing at least 13 people from the family, including children and women, according to local sources and eyewitnesses.There has been no comment from the Israeli side on these two airstrikes.Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks in the strip has risen to 41,084, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Wednesday.TEHRAN - Iran would support any peace plan agreed by Russia and Ukraine, a top Iranian security official said on Wednesday, according to Iran's semi-official Fars news agency.Ali Akbar Ahmadian, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, made the remarks at the 14th meeting of the BRICS high-ranking officials responsible for security matters and national security advisors in St. Petersburg, Russia.Ahmadian proposed that BRICS should assign a group to follow up on achieving peace between Russia and Ukraine, Fars reported.He also suggested establishing a "BRICS Security Commission" to address common threats including narcotics, terrorism, and cybersecurity.The BRICS security meeting focused on in-depth exchanges on global security threats, counterterrorism, cybersecurity, global governance and other topics, making necessary preparations for this year's BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan.The BRICS is the acronym for an emerging-market cooperative mechanism that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Iran's full membership in the group took effect on Jan 1, 2024.China's development will provide a broader market and more investment opportunities for enterprises from Saudi Arabia and other countries, amid a sluggish global economic recovery and growing uncertainties around the world in relation to economic and trade cooperation, Premier Li Qiang said on Wednesday.Li arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday for the Fourth Meeting of the High-Level Chinese-Saudi Joint Committee and an official visit to Saudi Arabia. He is also scheduled to visit the United Arab Emirates.Speaking at a meeting on Wednesday with representatives from the Saudi business community, Li said that China welcomes more companies from the country to visit and explore opportunities in China in order to better share in its development dividends.As the country is advancing Chinese modernization on all fronts through high-quality development, China will continue to unleash its vast potential in terms of domestic demand as an ultra-large-scale market with more than 1.4 billion people, he said.China is Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner, and Saudi Arabia is China's largest trading partner in West Asia and North Africa, with bilateral trade exceeding $100 billion for two consecutive years.Noting that China and Saudi Arabia enjoy a stable political relationship and strong momentum in economic and trade cooperation, Li said it is hoped that Saudi enterprises will deepen their involvement in the Chinese market, and invest in and expand their businesses in China with greater confidence.As the country is transforming traditional industries with digital technologies to make them smarter and more eco-friendly, the premier said more new economic growth points and high-growth enterprises will be fostered in areas such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and biomedicine.He called on Saudi companies to expand and strengthen cooperation with their Chinese counterparts in traditional fields such as oil and gas, petrochemicals and infrastructure, while promoting cooperation in emerging and future-oriented industries.Li also reiterated the Chinese government's commitment to building a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based and internationalized.China will further ease market access, implement measures to lift restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector, and accelerate the opening-up of telecommunications and other services sectors, he said, assuring better services and guarantees for foreign enterprises to continue flourishing in China.The representatives from the Saudi business community expressed an optimistic outlook regarding the Chinese economy, saying that they are willing to seize the opportunities and keep investing in China.They said they will further leverage the two countries' complementary advantages, innovate cooperation models and deepen cooperation in areas such as energy, new energy, finance and electric vehicles.On Wednesday, the Chinese premier also held talks with Secretary General of the Gulf Cooperation Council Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi.Li spoke highly of the GCC's contribution to promoting regional integration and facilitating regional peace, stability and development, saying that China is ready to strengthen communication and coordination with GCC countries to further deepen cooperation for mutual benefits.Noting that China and GCC countries are natural partners, with their economies being highly complementary, Li called on the two sides to strengthen the alignment of their development strategies and speed up negotiations on free trade agreement.The Arab League has renewed its call on Israel to stop its aggression in Gaza and the West Bank as its secretary-general accused Tel Aviv of a year of "genocide of ethnic cleansing" supported by some Western powers.During the meeting of the 162nd Arab League Council at the Level of Foreign Ministers held in Cairo on Sept 10, Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, the Arab League’s secretary-general, accused some Western powers of providing a safety umbrella for Israel's crimes and political cover for the killings, leading to the prolongation of the conflict and its expanding repercussions, according to the Weibo account of China Central Television (CCTV) International News.Aboul-Gheit said the world had witnessed almost a year of genocide, a year of ethnic cleansing and of displacement, as he accused the international community of failing to take decisive action, which has enabled Israel to carry on its military activities with impunity."The great powers in the world today are either unwilling or unable to exert pressure on the occupation," he was quoted as saying by the UAE media outlet The National.The meeting, chaired by Yemen, was also attended by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, a first in 13 years, European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini, and UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag.Fidan urged his counterparts to unite and continue putting pressure on the international community to reject Israel’s aggression. He warned that those who continue to support Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be held accountable for it.Gokhan Ereli, Gulf studies coordinator at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies in Turkiye, told China Daily, the most significant takeaway from the Arab League meeting was the growing disconnect between regional countries and Western powers, particularly the United States."Despite the EU's efforts, the US has shown little to no willingness to take clear, serious, and realistic measures against Israel, which has further hardened the stance of regional countries," said Ereli."In this context, it is evident that the Arab League has taken an unusually firm and unequivocal position on the Palestinian issue, and we can expect this to evolve into not just a unified stance among Arab nations, but also one that includes key regional powerhouses like Turkiye. More importantly, this could translate into unified action," he added.The Arab League’s condemnation came on the same day Israel bombed the Al-Mawasi "safe zone" in Gaza, which killed 19 people and wounded 60 others, Al Jazeera reported. The report also noted that a US-made 2,000-pound (907kg) MK-84 bomb was used in the latest attack.Despite the uncertainties in safety, UNRWA, or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, said its vaccination drive for Gaza’s children against the poliovirus would continue."Despite the significant incident yesterday where the Israeli Army stopped a UN convoy with staff traveling to provide #polio vaccinations, our teams have been able to vaccinate thousands of children in north #Gaza today," said UNRWA on its X account on Sept 10."This is a race against time, the spread of polio is a very real threat. Our colleagues continue to do the impossible to reach every child under the age of 10 across the GazaStrip," it added.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres took to social media to condemn Israel’s air strikes on what was supposed to be an Israeli-designated zone for displaced people in Gaza.In a post on X, he noted that the Palestinians "had moved to this area in search of shelter and safety, after being repeatedly instructed to do so by the Israeli authorities"."I repeat my call for an immediate ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages still held in Gaza," said Guterres.Ahmed Ayesh Alnajjar, director-general of international relations at the Education Ministry in Gaza, who has been displaced many times over the past year, said there "is nothing called safe zone" as it "is a big lie".Alnajjar told China Daily of several families that have been victims of Israeli bombings across Palestinian territories from Rafah to the Al-Farouq Mosque in the Al-Bureij refugee camp, central Gaza Strip, and Tubas City in the northern West Bank —- "all in a few hours only".RAMALLAH - Regional countries, including Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, and Iran, on Tuesday strongly condemned the deadly Israeli attacks on a crowded tent camp housing displaced Palestinians in Khan Younis of southern Gaza.The continuation of the war against the Palestinian people and the US support have put the region at risk, Palestinian Presidency spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh said in a press statement carried by the official Palestinian news agency WAFA.The strikes on the designated safe zone on Tuesday killed at least 40 people and injured more than 60 others, according to the Hamas-run Gaza government media office. At the same time, local health authorities reported the arrival of 19 bodies at hospitals, saying more victims are likely being trapped under the rubble."If it were not for the unprecedented US support politically, militarily, and financially, the leaders of Israel would not have dared to commit such crimes, defying all resolutions of international legitimacy and international law by killing children, women and the elderly without accountability," said Rudeineh.The Palestinian Foreign Ministry warned in a press statement that the continued impunity of Israel and its leaders and the provision of protection for them gives them more time to commit the most heinous crimes of killing and displacing Palestinians.In a statement, Jordan's Foreign Ministry strongly condemned Israel's "systematic and continuous" targeting of civilians and shelters for displaced persons in Gaza.Ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah reaffirmed the kingdom's absolute rejection and denunciation of Israel's continued violations of international law and international humanitarian law, accusing Israel of committing "war crimes and genocide" against the Palestinian people in Gaza.He emphasized that the absence of a firm international stance to curb Israeli aggression and compel it to respect international law has led to unprecedented killing, destruction, and humanitarian disaster.Echoing a similar sentiment, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry stated that the absence of effective international action to put an end to the human suffering in Gaza has become a real challenge to the credibility of all humanitarian standards and values.Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani also called on international organizations, especially the UN Security Council, to take immediate and effective actions to deter Israel and curb its "unbridled crimes".The overnight airstrike took place in the Al-Mawasi area in Khan Younis, where a sprawl of tent camps has been erected along the Gaza coast to serve as a humanitarian zone for displaced persons. The Israeli military said the strike targeted senior Hamas leaders operating from a hidden command center in the area.Israel has launched a large-scale retaliatory offensive against Hamas in Gaza following a surprise attack by Hamas across the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages. The Israeli offensive has so far killed 41,020 Palestinians and injured 94,925 others in the coastal enclave, according to Gaza-based health authorities.GAZA -- The Palestinian death toll from the ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 41,020, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Tuesday.During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 32 people and wounded 100 others, bringing the total death toll to 41,020 and injuries to 94,925 since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out in early October 2023, it added.At least 40 Palestinians were killed and more than 60 others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Tuesday."Israeli warplanes launched rockets at tents housing displaced Palestinians at the entrance to Mawasi in Khan Younis, causing widespread destruction and resulting in numerous casualties," Palestinian medics told Xinhua.Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said that the attack targeted senior Hamas leaders operating from a hidden command center in a humanitarian area of Khan Younis.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage.GAZA - The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 40,988, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Monday.In the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 16 people and wounded 64 others, bringing the total number of deaths to 40,988 and injuries to 94,825 since the conflict began in early October 2023, according to the statement.Meanwhile, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said in a press statement that its teams in northern Gaza have faced a severe shortage of fuel supplies for nearly three weeks. The rescue organization indicated that it is now operating at minimum capacity, exacerbating the humanitarian and health crisis in the area.The Indonesian and Kamal Adwan hospitals in northern Gaza also warned of a potential suspension of services due to fuel shortages, amid the ongoing Israeli blockade and restrictions on fuel supplies. Both hospitals said that an imminent suspension of medical services would pose a major threat to the lives of the sick and injured within their facilities.Israel has been conducting large-scale military operations and imposing a severe blockade on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, in response to a surprise attack by Hamas on Israeli towns adjacent to the strip. GAZA -- At least 40 Palestinians were killed and more than 60 others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Palestinian and Israeli sources said Tuesday."Israeli warplanes launched rockets at tents housing displaced Palestinians at the entrance to Muwasi in Khan Younis, causing widespread destruction and resulting in numerous casualties," Palestinian medics told Xinhua.Dr. Mohammed Al-Mughair, director of supply at the Civil Defense, confirmed that rescue teams had recovered 40 bodies and come to the aid of more than 60 injured individuals.He said that the bombardment created craters up to nine meters deep, suggesting the Israeli use of explosive missiles. "We are facing one of the most horrific massacres committed in this war," he lamented.Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said that the attack targeted senior Hamas leaders operating from a hidden command center in a humanitarian area of Khan Younis.These individuals, he said, were involved in planning and executing "terrorist operations" against the army and Israeli civilians.Adraee added that the army took extensive measures to reduce civilian casualties.Hamas has not yet commented on these reports.Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage.BEIJING - Premier Li Qiang of the State Council will travel to Saudi Arabia to chair the Fourth Meeting of the High-Level Chinese-Saudi Joint Committee and visit Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from Sept 10 to 13, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning announced on Monday.Li is invited by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman and the UAE's Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Mao added.DAMASCUS -Israel carried out air strikes on a scientific research facility and an arms depot in central Syria on Sunday night, a war monitor reported.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack targeted sites in Masyaf, in western Hama province. Ambulances were seen rushing to the area, the Britain-based group said, adding that a large fire was seen near Wadi al-Oyoun in western Hama following the strikes.Syrian state television reported that air defenses responded to "Israeli aggression" in central Syria. The Observatory said several missiles were intercepted.The extent of casualties and damage was not immediately clear.Israel has conducted numerous strikes in Syria in recent years, often targeting what it says are Iranian-linked and Hezbollah positions.GAZA/JERUSALEM — The conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza entered its 12th month on Saturday with little indication of respite for the Palestinian territory as the humanitarian disaster deepens.Israeli military strikes across the Palestinian Gaza Strip killed at least 61 people in the space of 48 hours, medics said on Saturday.Airstrikes on two former schools that were housing displaced people, one in Gaza City and one in Jabalia, killed at least 12 people, Palestinian medics said.The Israeli military said the strikes targeted Hamas gunmen who were operating in the compound. Five more people were killed in a strike on a house in Gaza City, Palestinian medics said, with a total of 28 people killed on Saturday.International mediators have all been mediating to bring about a cease-fire in the conflict, which authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say has killed at least 40,939 people.Hamas' Oct 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, according to Israeli official figures.Tens of thousands of Israelis joined protests in Tel Aviv and other cities, demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government make a deal under which the remaining about 100 hostages would be released.Scores were released during a one-week truce in November.Hamas is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal, but Netanyahu insists troops must remain along the Gaza-Egypt border.International pressure to end the conflict was further underlined by Friday's fatal shooting in the occupied West Bank of Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, who was demonstrating against Israeli settlements in the territory.Eygi's family demanded an independent investigation into her death, saying her life "was taken needlessly, unlawfully, and violently by the Israeli military".The UN rights office said Israeli forces killed Eygi, 26, with a "shot in the head".Turkiye said she was killed by "Israeli occupation soldiers", while the United States called her death "tragic" and pressed Israel to investigate.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced Israel as a "barbaric" state and urged Muslim nations to forge an "alliance "against Israel, saying: "It is an Islamic duty for us to stand against Israel's state terror. It is a religious duty."Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded by saying that Erdogan "continues to throw the Turkish people into the fire of hatred and violence for the sake of his Hamas friends".A gunman opened fire on Sunday at the Allenby Bridge, a key crossing point between the West Bank and Jordan, killing three people before being shot dead by Israeli forces, Israeli officials said.The Israel Defense Forces described the incident at the crossing jointly controlled by Israel and Jordan as a shooting attack. Police confirmed the assailant had been shot dead.Fears have been raised over the widening of the conflict. Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement also exchanged fire.Hezbollah had announced a string of attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Saturday, while Israel's military said it had intercepted missiles detected crossing from Lebanon and struck a Hezbollah launch site in the country's south.Lebanon's health ministry said three emergency personnel were killed and two others wounded in an Israeli attack on a civil defense team putting out fires in south Lebanon.Hezbollah later announced retaliatory rocket fire targeting a town in northern Israel "in response to the enemy attacks … and particularly the attack" that killed the emergency workers.Despite the truce deadlock, the United Nations, in collaboration with local health authorities, has pursued a campaign to vaccinate 640,000 children in Gaza after its first polio case in around 25 years. Limited pauses in the fighting have allowed the campaign to proceed.UN officials said they were making progress, having reached more than half of the children requiring the drops in the first two stages in the southern and central Gaza Strip.On Sunday, the campaign is expected to move to the northern Gaza Strip. A second round of vaccination will be required four weeks after the first.Agencies - XinhuaSaudi Arabia is eyeing greater collaboration in research and development, as well as innovation with Asia as it looks to China for technology and automotive advancement in its mining sector transformation push, according to a senior government official.The plans are part of the country's grander economic diversification plan — Vision 2030 — introduced by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud in 2016 and includes mining as the third pillar of national industrialism. Saudi Arabia's abundant mineral wealth is estimated at $2.5 trillion.Saudi Arabia's Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Bandar bin Ibrahim AlKhorayef, told China Daily in an interview in Hong Kong on Saturday that his country could complement the Asia region in providing greater opportunities for relocating most of the manufacturing to his country with cooperation in R&D and innovation."We've all seen the challenges that had been faced in supply chain disruptions and we believe that Saudi Arabia can be a great place to solve these challenges," he added."There's a lot of commonalities between the two regions and (one of) Saudi Arabia's ambitions is to grow its manufacturing base, to explore its mining capabilities. This is not only to satisfy our local market but also to participate in the global market," said AlKhorayef.The minister was wrapping up his trip to the Greater Bay Area, following a weeklong visit to Asia, including Singapore, where he said the purpose was to help large players look to Saudi Arabia as their next production location.Exactly a year ago, AlKhorayef visited the Chinese mainland where he met with senior government officials and visited factories and companies."China is a big country and last time we visited five cities. This time, we visited Guangzhou. There's a different flavor in each one of these cities and we try to capture the value and what each region of China can offer to Saudi Arabia," said AlKhorayef."We aim to focus on two areas. One is to help large players look to Saudi Arabia as their next production location or logistics location because we can offer a mixture of enablers from the raw material to the energy prices to infrastructure, great location," he added.Business modelsAnd the other side, "which is interesting", he said, was innovation and the adaptation of new business models, such as "Industry 4.0" and "Industry 5.0", and artificial intelligence, other than manufacturing.During his visit, AlKhorayef invited Chinese companies to invest in Saudi, which was highlighted by the National Industrial Strategy during a roundtable meeting organized by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce in Guangzhou.In Hong Kong, AlKhorayef met with senior officials of the Trade and Industry Department, the Innovation and Technology Commission and the Commerce and Economic Development of Hong Kong, among others, according to the Saudi Press Agency.China is Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner. According to the Ministry of Finance of Saudi Arabia, the volume of trade between the two countries reached more than $100 billion in 2023."We believe Saudi Arabia can offer many opportunities for many global players from different countries. China is definitely the number one trade partner to Saudi so it's only logical that we find areas of collaboration and bring some local content also to Saudi Arabia. Localization is key also to our strategy," said AlKhorayef.When it comes to the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China, the minister said Saudi was greatly located in an area where it can serve to help many regions connect with each other."Definitely we are also positioned in a way that allows us to access markets that are growing and have high potential to grow," said AlKhorayef."It's great to be here. I used to be a businessman visiting China, also Singapore. It's great to be here with an official eye. I've been really welcomed very well and by everyone, both private sector and government. So, it's overwhelming and I think (there are) great opportunities that we can bring together," he added.The United States' criminal charges against Hamas leaders for their role in the Oct 7 attacks on Israel are "politically motivated", aimed at reducing pressure on Israel even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is accused of being the "main obstacle" in the cease-fire talks.Former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz has accused Netanyahu of being an obstacle in negotiations and for prioritizing the Philadelphi Corridor over the return of hostages after the death of six Israeli captives whose causes of death have yet to be determined as violence rages on in Gaza, most recently the West Bank.Ayman Yousef, a professor of international relations at the Arab American University in Jenin in the West Bank, told China Daily that the timing of the US announcement "is part of their negotiation strategy"."I think the US wants to put more pressure on Hamas to surrender a part of their demands," said Yousef.They are still unable to have a deal or to negotiate a deal, he added.Rami Khouri, a distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut, questioned the US decision to charge Hamas' top leaders in an interview with Al Jazeera and said Washington was behaving like an "imperial colonial power" over its refusal to apply the law equally on all parties accused of violations.Further, he noted the US was keen to hold Hamas responsible for its actions but has no similar desire to hold Israel accountable for its actions. The International Criminal Court Prosecutor had earlier sought arrest warrants for both Hamas and Israeli officials, including Netanyahu.It was announced on Tuesday that the US Justice Department in February launched criminal charges against Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and other senior militants over their involvement in the attack on Oct 7 last year.Netanyahu said at a news conference on Tuesday that the Philadelphi Corridor between the Gaza Strip and Egypt "will not be evacuated". If Israel gives up control, he said, Gaza "will become a terrorist enclave".But countries such as Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iraq have condemned Netanyahu's remarks alleging Hamas was receiving weapons through the corridor.In a statement, Jordan's Foreign Ministry said the allegations were "baseless" and were intended to obstruct the ongoing cease-fire negotiations, in which Egypt is a key mediator.Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, Secretary General of the Gulf Cooperation Council, stressed GCC's "full rejection of such irresponsible statements, which do not serve peace in the region but rather contribute to increasing tension and exacerbating the situation".Meanwhile, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, posted on his X account that what the Israeli army is doing in Jenin and other locations in the West Bank "is a continuation of the extermination campaign".On the battlefield, Israeli forces killed at least 35 Palestinians across Gaza on Tuesday, Palestinian officials said, but brief pauses in fighting allowed medics to conduct a third day of polio vaccinations for children, according to Reuters.A shipment of 350,000 polio vaccine doses arrived in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. A total of approximately 1.6 million doses are expected to arrive, enough to vaccinate all children from birth to 10 years old with two doses each, Xinhua News Agency reported.JERUSALEM -- Rallies and a partial strike continued across Israel for the second day in a row on Monday, as the discovery of the bodies of six hostages in a Gaza tunnel over the weekend has intensified national outage.Protesters descended on Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and other cities, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure the return of remaining hostages by negotiating a ceasefire with Hamas.Protesters blocked the Ayalon Highway in the city of Tel Aviv, Israel's main freeway, for several hours, as well as entrances to railway stations in Tel Aviv and Herzliya, a city north of Tel Aviv.Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that thousands of protesters gathered outside Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, urging him to sign a hostage release deal. Some of them carried coffins wrapped in the Israeli flag, the report said.Nisan Kalderon, brother of Ofer Kalderon, one of the 101 remaining hostages in Gaza, said Netanyahu's decisions "are killing hostages", the report said.According to a police statement, at least 19 people have been arrested in rallies throughout the country.Meanwhile, a partial strike that involved the shutdown of cinemas, theaters, restaurants, cafes, and pubs Sunday evening in Tel Aviv returned on Monday, affecting kindergartens, primary schools, universities, hospitals, and banks in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and other cities.Public transportation, airports, and chain stores also slowed or paused operations across Israel.The strike was then called off at 14:30 local time (1130 GMT) following a court ruling that inadequate notice had been given.On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said six bodies, including two women and four men, were discovered on Saturday in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area, southern Gaza.According to an initial assessment by the IDF, the hostages were estimated to be murdered by Hamas about 48 to 72 hours before the Israeli troops reached them.All six were taken hostage during Hamas' surprise attack on Oct 7, 2023, which left around 1,200 people dead and approximately 250 others captured.Meanwhile, Hamas confirmed in a press statement that the bodies were found by the Israeli army in a tunnel in Rafah but noted that they "were killed by Israeli shelling".Many Israelis have been blaming Netanyahu for failing to secure the hostages' release through a ceasefire deal.JERUSALEM -- Hundreds of thousands of Israelis rallied across the country on Sunday, demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas to secure the return of hostages held in Gaza.According to Israel's Ynet news site, around 700,000 people participated in demonstrations on main roads and at junctions nationwide, with 550,000 attending the central rally in Tel Aviv. The protests began in the morning after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced the recovery of six hostages' bodies and continued through the night.In Tel Aviv, an emotional demonstration took place outside the Kirya military base, the IDF's headquarters. Protesters waved Israeli flags and chanted "A deal -- Now!" Many carried posters featuring the hostages. There are still 101 hostages in Gaza, with about half presumed dead due to either Hamas attacks or Israeli bombings.Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, addressed the crowd, claiming that there is "a deal proposal on the table" but that Netanyahu refuses to accept it to avoid losing support from his coalition of pro-settler leaders.Later in the night, thousands of protesters in Tel Aviv set fire on the Ayalon Highway, temporarily blocking the main freeway. Police said they dispersed the crowd and reported at least 12 arrests nationwide.By nightfall, cinemas, theaters, museums, universities, restaurants, cafes, pubs, and other businesses across the country closed in solidarity with the protest.The demonstrations are expected to continue into Monday with a general strike. Arnon Bar-David, secretary-general of the Histadrut, Israel's largest workers' organization, announced the strike on live television, accusing Netanyahu of hindering the deal due to "political considerations".The protests followed the recovery of the bodies of two women and four men from Gaza. The IDF said they were killed in a Hamas tunnel shortly before soldiers arrived.The six had been captured alive on Oct 7, 2023, during Hamas's surprise attack on Israeli communities, which killed about 1,200 people and resulted in the capture of approximately 250 others.The United Nations, in collaboration with Palestinian health authorities, began to vaccinate 640,000 children in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, with Israel and Hamas agreeing to brief pauses in the conflict to allow the vaccination campaign.The campaign began in areas of central Gaza, and will move to other areas in the coming days. Fighting will be paused for at least eight hours on three consecutive days, CNA News reported.Rik Peeperkorn, head of the World Health Organization office for the West Bank and Gaza, said 2,180 workers in 295 teams would administer the oral vaccines to 640,000 children under 10 years of age at 392 sites. The vaccine is to be delivered in two doses about four weeks apart.Sam Rose, senior deputy director of the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA in Gaza, said the lack of access to aid, services, water and healthcare creates a situation under which polio has recently reemerged in Gaza "with a small number of cases that could spread very rapidly"."It's really that perfect storm of conditions that created the environment in which polio can occur," he said in a video released on the UNRWA website.Juliette Touma, communications director at UNRWA, told Reuters on Sunday that the vaccination campaign was massive and "one of the most complex in the world"."Today is test time for parties to the conflict to respect these area pauses to allow the UNRWA teams and other medical workers to reach children with these very precious two drops. It's a race against time," Touma said."Children continue to be exposed. Every child must be vaccinated in Gaza and Israel to curb the risk of this vicious disease spreading."WHO officials have said at least 90 percent of the children need to be vaccinated twice with four weeks between doses for the campaign to succeed, but it faces huge challenges in Gaza, which has been largely destroyed by the continuing conflict.The Health Ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that at least 40,738 people have been killed in the conflict, now in its 11th month. The toll includes 47 deaths in the previous 24 hours.Meanwhile, families of Israeli hostages have called for a nationwide general strike starting on Sunday night to force the government to reach a deal to secure the release of captives still held in Gaza.The call came after the Israeli military found the bodies of six hostages in a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, sparking outrage and anger among their families.Xinhua and Agencies contributed to this story.SANAA -- Yemen's Houthi group claimed responsibility on Saturday for an attack on a cargo ship named Groton in the Gulf of Aden."In support of the Palestinians and Hamas, we carried out a military operation targeting the ship Groton in the Gulf of Aden because of its company's dealings with Israel," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a statement aired by Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV.He said bomb-laden drones and missiles were used in the attack and that "the hit was accurate."Sarea added that it was the second time his group had targeted the vessel in August, with the first attack occurring on August 3, and warned of more attacks on cargo ships.The UK Maritime Trade Operations reported on Friday on social media platform X that it had received a report of an attack on a cargo ship 130 nautical miles east of Yemen's southern port city of Aden. It said two missiles exploded near the vessel, and all crew members were safe and proceeding to the next port of call.Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted what they describe as "Israeli-linked" cargo ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden to show solidarity with the Palestinians amid the ongoing Gaza conflict.The Houthis have controlled much of northern Yemen since late 2014, forcing the internationally recognized government out of the capital, Sanaa.China's envoy to the United Nations on Thursday "strongly condemned" Israel's large-scale military operation in the northern West Bank, one of the largest assaults in the Israeli-occupied territory for months.Israel launched a large-scale raid across the northern West Bank early Wednesday. The Palestinian Health Ministry has confirmed that 16 people have been killed in the raids. "China strongly condemns it," said Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN.Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz posted on social media platform X on Wednesday, describing the large-scale operation as part of a "full-fledged war". He compared the situation to the Gaza Strip, saying that "we need to address the (terror) threat exactly as we deal with terror infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian civilians and any other step needed."Deeply concernedGeng said China is "shocked and deeply concerned by such outrageous statements". "Gaza has already become a living hell. We must not allow the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza to be repeated in the West Bank, turning it into another living hell," he said at a Security Council meeting on the Palestinian question."China opposes any actions or rhetoric that escalate tensions and condemns all attacks against civilians. We call on all parties, particularly Israel, to remain calm and exercise restraint to prevent further escalation of the situation," Geng emphasized.In the West Bank, Israel continues to violate international law and Security Council resolutions by expanding settlements and intensifying searches, arrests and attacks against Palestinians. Since October last year, more than 620 Palestinians have lost their lives in the region, said Geng.On Wednesday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also urged Israel to halt its military operation in the West Bank immediately.UNITED NATIONS -- Israel and Hamas have agreed to halt hostilities in the Gaza Strip for a World Health Organization (WHO)-led polio vaccination campaign, a WHO official said on Thursday.Rik Peeperkorn, head of the WHO office for the West Bank and Gaza, told reporters in a video briefing that the UN health agency, the Hamas health ministry and the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees, known as UNRWA, would launch the campaign on Sunday.He said the first two rounds of the vaccines would be administered from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time in Gaza's central region for three days, followed by three days in the southern region and finally three days in the north. The pause in hostilities for each three-day campaign may be stretched to a fourth day if necessary.The WHO official said 2,180 workers in 295 teams would administer the oral vaccines to 640,000 children under 10 years of age at 392 sites. The vaccine is to be delivered in two doses about four weeks apart.Peeperkorn said if some children could not be brought into the planned 392 sites in hospitals and other medical points, "we will try to get to them."After a 10-month-old girl was found to have contracted polio, partially paralyzing her left leg, the WHO announced plans for the Gaza vaccination campaign.Also in Gaza, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Israeli authorities announced that displaced people could return to specific areas in Deir al-Balah, the first time where return is officially allowed to an evacuated area.OCHA said the evacuation orders are also severely constraining aid efforts. Recently, they have displaced many humanitarian colleagues and lost access to warehouses, water wells, other critical facilities and humanitarian routes."UN colleagues assessed the water, hygiene and sanitation conditions in two sites hosting over 1,200 families in Rafah," the office said. "People are struggling with drinking water as no trucking is currently available. They report skin diseases being the main morbidity among women and children, with no treatments available when they go to the medical points."OCHA also said sea water floods the tents of those living directly on the beach in Mawassi.In the West Bank, the office said there are reports of displaced families, particularly in urban areas where Israeli forces have repurposed homes as military positions. In multiple locations, military bulldozers have heavily damaged infrastructure and electricity and telecommunication outages continued."Military operations near hospitals also continue, effectively besieging these facilities and limiting the movement in and out, including that of medical staff," OCHA said.The office said the UNRWA clinic in the Al Far'a refugee camp had to suspend operations on Wednesday, resuming on Thursday only when Israeli forces left the area. UN agencies warned of the risk of unexploded munition in some areas.RAMALLAH -- The Israeli army on Thursday killed five Palestinians, including a commander, in an exchange of fire in the Tulkarm refugee camp in the West Bank, Palestinian and Israeli sources said.Mohammed Jaber, also known as Abu Shujaa, a commander of Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), was killed after exchanging fire with Israeli forces who besieged the building he was in with other Palestinian militants, Palestinian sources told Xinhua.Avichai Adraee, the spokesperson of the Israeli army, said in a press statement that under the direction of the Shin Bet, and after an exchange of fire, members of the special police unit eliminated five militants, including Abu Shujaa, who were hiding in a mosque in Tulkarm.Abu Shujaa was involved in several operations and "directed the shooting operation in June that resulted in the death of the Israeli Amnon Mukhtar," Adraee said.He added that one of the members of the police unit sustained minor injuries and was transferred to a hospital in Israel for treatment.For the second day in a row, the Israeli army has launched a large-scale military operation in Tulkarm, Jenin and Tubas refugee camps in an attempt to arrest wanted persons accused of involvement in operations against Israel.Iran says its potential retaliation against Israel for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh will be "unpredictable", while an analyst points to varied actions."For the time being, (Israel) must remain in a state of anxiety and panic as it awaits our revenge, but what is certain is that the response will be unpredictable," Iran's Deputy Defense Minister Seyed Hojatollah Ghoreishi was quoted by Iran's Tasnim News Agency as saying on Tuesday.Reacting to the killing of Haniyeh on July 31 in Teheran, high-ranking Iranian officials have vowed to give a strong response, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying that Israel has prepared the ground for harsh punishment for itself through the assassination, Mehr News Agency reported.On Tuesday, in a video broadcast on state television, Khamenei indicated that there was "no barrier" to discussions with the "enemy", possibly about civil use of nuclear energy and economic sanctions.It is the US administration led by Donald Trump that pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was signed in July 2015 and limits Iran's nuclear development.The United States also reintroduced more sanctions against Iran. Such sanctions, among others, have made it difficult for Iran to purchase medicine and health supplies from abroad, including COVID-19 vaccines.White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday the US remains committed to defending Israel in the event of a possible Iranian attack.Kirby told Israel's Channel 12 that it was tough to predict the chances of an attack but the White House takes Iranian rhetoric seriously."We believe that they are still postured and poised to launch an attack should they want to do that, which is why we have that enhanced force posture in the region," he said."Our messaging to Iran is consistent, has been and will stay consistent. One, don't do it. There's no reason to escalate this. There's no reason to potentially start some sort of all-out regional war. And number two, we are going to be prepared to defend Israel if it comes to that."Some other US officials are also constantly issuing statements about potential retaliatory strikes on Israeli targets over the violation of Iranian sovereignty.Patrick Ryder, spokesman for the US Department of Defense, said on Monday that the Pentagon continues to assess that there is a threat of attack by Iran and resistance groups against Israel.Possible actionsNagapushpa Devendra, a West Asia analyst and research scholar at the University of Erfurt in Germany, told China Daily that Iran may undertake "direct but more indirect" retaliatory actions against Israel.Iran's actions may include supporting or encouraging proxy groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon or other military forces in the region to launch attack on Israeli targets, Devendra said. Iran might also engage in cyber operations or other asymmetric tactics in response to the killing of Haniyeh, she said.Regarding the reason for Iran's potential actions, she said: "Under the leadership of Iran's newly elected president, Iran is attempting to regain its security influence and capabilities that were undermined by sanctions imposed by the US.Given this scenario, it is likely that Iran's response may also be a way to assert its position as a key player in regional politics."Agencies contributed to this story.The United States continues to display its "bizarre" hypocrisy over its support for Israel's self-defense while allowing massacres to happen in Gaza, experts said, as the United Nations noted that the month of August saw the most evacuation orders issued, fueling demoralizing conditions there.Hanan Ashrawi, former executive committee member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said in a post on her X account that nothing could be more bizarre than the US "showering Israel with billions" by supplying Tel Aviv with unlimited lethal weapons, munitions, and deploying its own warships to fight for Israel's "wars of self-defense" and then claiming the US was "doing everything to prevent the escalation and expansion of the "conflict". The US, she said, also threatens Israel's victims should they dare retaliate.Farhan Mujahid Chak, visiting faculty at the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, told China Daily that the US "is in direct complicity" to all the crimes against humanity and the flagrant violation of the "most basic norms of international law" and society. This "needs to be stopped and called out"."(On) the negotiations that are ongoing, there's no better way to explain them as a charade. A charade of constantly edging the world to inform them that they're on the brink of the breakthrough when in reality, the intensity of the violence directed toward an overwhelming women and children population continues unabated," said Chak.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned on Aug 27 that humanitarian operations are "ongoing where feasible" after reports of a halt made rounds due to risks amid the Israeli military's repeated orders.OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke said there has been no decision to halt operations and there "never has been", noting the aid workers have "been there for 10 months"."I want to remind you that only 11 percent of the territory of the Gaza Strip is not under evacuation orders…so we're trying to work with that number and keep the operation going," said Laerke, adding that a total of 16 evacuation orders had been issued for the month of August alone, creating much upheaval for Gazans already uprooted multiple times.Since Aug 23, the Israeli military has issued three new evacuations covering 19 neighborhoods in northern Gaza and in Deir al-Balah, affecting more than 8,000 people sheltering in these areas.The OCHA said the total number of evacuation orders issued in August was now 16, directly impacting approximately 258,000 people, or around 12 percent of Gaza's population."In Deir al-Balah, the orders have displaced UN humanitarian staff, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and service providers, along with their families. These relocations took place at short notice and in dangerous conditions," according to an update on Aug 26."OCHA is particularly worried about the order issued yesterday (Aug 25) for a part of Deir al-Balah. It affected 15 premises hosting UN and NGO aid workers, four UN warehouses, Al Aqsa hospital, two clinics, three wells, one water reservoir and one desalination plant. All of these are either in or near the designated area," it added.Arie Afriansyah, associate professor at the Faculty of Law at Universitas Indonesia, told China Daily that Israel's repeated issuance of evacuation orders are not to minimize civilian casualties but "are only for Israelis"."Considering the actions committed by Israel lately, it is hard to believe that Israel starts to listen to the world's concerns in Gaza… Nevertheless, we should not stop hoping and praying for a better situation," said Afriansyah.The orders also encompass the UN's aid hub in the central city of Deir al-Balah. Previously, the UN and humanitarian response partners had been based in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah. But the Israeli military incursion there in May resulted in an exodus, effectively shrinking the humanitarian zone at the coast.US Jewish activist and co-founder of the anti-war organization CodePink, Medea Benjamin, has also called for an end to US support for Israel, calling it a "betrayal of American values", Turkiye's Anadolu Agency reported, citing a documentary produced by TRT World."It is truly a mockery of everything that people who stand for the rule of law, for the rights of noncombatants," said Chak from Georgetown University."I think for strategic geopolitical purposes in the near future, this will prove even more dangerous for the global world order in which particularly the Global South is coming to the realization that there is absolutely no commitment coming from the G7 countries, in particular, the Western countries, to abide by the human rights' law," he added.Chak said it "is going to pose even greater dangers and exacerbate tensions and the likelihood of conflict will be increased".jan@chinadailyapac.comIn between bombings and shootings, cries and hunger in devastated Gaza Strip, Ahmed Ayesh Alnajjar clings on to his life amid continuous displacements and a shrinking safe zone across the occupied narrow Strip, struggling to find scarcest safety and hope from international community.Video by Jan Yumul and Mike GuRAMALLAH - The Israeli army began on Wednesday a large-scale military operation in the Jenin, Tulkarm, and Tubas camps in the northern West Bank, according to Palestinian and Israeli sources."The Israeli forces have begun military operations in Jenin, Tubas, and Tulkarm to thwart terrorism," Avichai Adraee, spokesman of the Israeli army, said in a statement.Palestinian sources told Xinhua said that large forces, along with huge bulldozers, are involved in the Jenin operation.The sources added that Israeli military vehicles stormed the city from multiple directions, penetrating its neighborhoods and the refugee camp.According to the Ramallah-based health ministry, two Palestinians were killed and two others wounded by Israeli army gunfire in northern Jenin.Wiam Bakr, director of Jenin Governmental Hospital, said that the Israeli forces surrounded the hospital and prevented medical staff from entering.In Tubas and the Far'a refugee camp, Israeli forces clashed with Palestinian gunmen as they stormed the area. Tubas governor Ahmed al-Asaad told Xinhua that the scale of the operation suggests that Israel is following through on threats of a military campaign in the northern West Bank.Meanwhile, the Israeli forces clashed with Palestinian gunmen as they stormed the city of Tubas and the Far'a refugee camp.Ahmed al-Asaad, the governor of Tubas, told Xinhua that the scale of the operation suggests that Israel is following through on threats of a military operation in the northern West Bank.Similarly, Israeli forces stormed the Nour Shams refugee camp east of Tulkarm, where Palestinian sources told Xinhua that the forces besieged Thabet Thabet Governmental Hospital and seized a Palestinian ambulance.Palestinian armed groups said that their members were fighting Israeli forces with explosive devices and gunfire in Jenin, Tulkarm and Tubas.Since Oct 7, the northern West Bank have witnessed a major escalation, with over 650 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire across the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.RIYADH - Saudi Arabia is set to host the third edition of the Global AI Summit from Sept 10 to 12, aiming to establish the kingdom as a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and to emphasize the role of governments in leveraging AI for economic growth, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported on Tuesday.The summit, themed "Leveraging AI for the Betterment of Humanity", will take place in Riyadh. It will address topics such as ethical AI development and AI applications in urban life, focusing on transportation, urban design, mental health, and resource management. It will also address the role of AI in governance, according to SPA."The summit will delve into AI's current capabilities, its future, and the ethical boundaries we must establish to ensure its beneficial impact on society," said Abdullah bin Sharaf Alghamdi, president of the Saudi Data & Artificial Intelligence Authority, the organizer.The summit will gather over 300 experts and speakers from 100 countries and feature more than 120 interactive sessions and workshops. These will explore diverse aspects of AI, including generative AI and its integration into smart cities, as stated by the organizer.JERUSALEM - The Israeli military announced on Tuesday that its forces had rescued an Israeli hostage from an underground tunnel in the southern Gaza Strip when combing the area.Qaid Farhan Alkadi, 52, was found alone in a tunnel, without any guards or other hostages, said the military in a statement. Being held by Hamas militants since Oct 7, 2023, Alkadi is the eighth hostage freed through a military operation and the first Israeli Arab hostage to be rescued alive. He is also the first hostage rescued from the underground.The military added that Alkadi came from Karkur, a Bedouin village south of Rahat city in southern Israel, and was kidnapped from his workplace, a packing house in Magen, during Hamas' attack on the kibbutz.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that military troops, along with agents from the Shin Bet security agency, scanned the tunnel in recent days to search for hostages, Hamas militants, and explosive devices, while noting that they had no specific information about Alkadi's whereabouts.According to state-owned Kan TV news, Alkadi heard the soldiers and shouted for help, then his guards fled the area. The man told his relatives that he survived mainly on small amounts of bread. His family reported that Alkadi lost approximately 20 kilograms during his captivity.Shlomi Kadosh, the hospital director, stated that Alkadi had undergone a medical examination and was in stable condition.In a press briefing, IDF Spokesman Daniel Hagari described the rescue as "a complex mission," saying that "commandos rescued Alkadi from an underground tunnel upon accurate intelligence."In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized the government's commitment to bringing all hostages home. "We are doing this in two main ways: negotiations and rescue operations," Netanyahu said. He also underscored the necessity of maintaining Israel's military presence in Gaza.A government official confirmed to Xinhua that an Israeli delegation is set to depart on Wednesday to continue indirect talks in Doha over a potential deal that includes a ceasefire and the exchange of hostages and prisoners between the two warring sides.Approximately 250 hostages were taken during the Oct 7 Hamas assault, with 108 still held by Hamas, and many of them are believed dead, official Israeli figures indicated.UNITED NATIONS - Despite Gaza's deadly violence and several recent Israeli evacuation orders further disrupting aid operations, the head of UN security said on Tuesday that relief deliveries are continuing."The United Nations is determined to stay in Gaza to deliver life-saving aid for and with Palestinian civilians," said Gilles Michaud, the undersecretary-general for safety and security. "Humanitarian aid delivery continues -- a tremendous feat given that we are operating at the upper-most peripheries of tolerable risk."Michaud said that humanitarians have been in the crosshairs throughout the crisis, "by far the deadliest on record for the UN."He called the several recent mass evacuation orders the latest in a long list of unbearable threats to the UN and humanitarian personnel."Like most Palestinians in Gaza, we are running out of safe spaces for our own staff," Michaud said. "The timing could hardly be worse, with the start of a massive polio vaccination campaign scheduled for next week, for which large numbers of staff will need to enter the (Gaza) Strip."He said the Israeli Defense Forces' series of evacuation orders this past weekend compound existing security threats and seriously impact the pace of safe aid deliveries."These constraints are beyond our control," the undersecretary-general said.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that they could distribute some tents as temporary shelters in response to the evacuation orders on Monday. However, the stock is running low and limited.OCHA said the World Food Programme (WFP) staff had to relocate to other UN premises, leaving behind their offices and guest houses in Deir al Balah. Despite these challenges, the agency continues to deliver food assistance."In addition to the loss of warehouses and other humanitarian premises due to evacuation orders, it remains difficult to move around the south of the Gaza Strip due to the severe overcrowding and continuous displacement," OCHA said.The office said access of UN humanitarian partners to northern Gaza is particularly challenging as it requires coordination with the Israeli authorities and passage through an internal checkpoint.OCHA said plans to fuel hospitals in the north of Gaza have now resulted in access being denied five times in the past week, leaving some hospitals without new provisions for fuel for over 10 days. The dependency on fuel to run backup generators is complete, as the Israeli authorities cut electricity provision from the Gaza Strip back in October.Following the delivery of polio vaccines into Gaza, UN staff on the ground are now positioning them in 11 health centers. Beginning this weekend, they are training over 1,000 medical workers and volunteers to participate in the campaign.Also, Stephane Dujarric, chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, attempted to counter some disinformation about the vaccine being administered."The safest and the most effective way to protect children against the polio virus, regardless of the variant, is to vaccinate them," Dujarric told reporters at a regular briefing. "This vaccine is safe. It is effective and it offers top-quality protection. It is a vaccine globally recommended for variant type 2 poliovirus outbreaks by the World Health Organization."He said that since 2021, more than 1.2 billion vaccine doses have been used to protect children in over 40 countries.The spokesman said the UN Children's Fund, the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees, known as UNRWA, and the World Health Organization plan to roll out the campaign in Gaza this weekend. It will be done in two rounds, each consisting of two drops of oral polio vaccine type 2, for more than 640,000 children under 10 years of age, to reach at least 95 percent of the children in each round.The United States is seen as seemingly trying to downplay the immediate threat of a broader conflict in the Middle East even after two of its air carriers are now ready for attacks in the region while Israeli strikes continue in both Gaza Strip of Palestine and Lebanon.Israeli attacks on Gaza — mainly in Deir el-Balah and Khan Younis in the south — have killed at least 20 people, Al Jazeera reported on Aug 27.The attacks came just days after Israel and Hezbollah exchanged strikes along the Israel-Lebanon border on Aug 25.Hezbollah unleashed hundreds of missiles against Israel in retaliation for the killing of its top military commander, Fouad Shokor, in Beirut in late July.Tel Aviv reported it had conducted a series of "preemptive airstrikes" targeting Hezbollah's rocket launchers in southern Lebanon.Despite this, United States Air Force General Charles Q. Brown, Jr, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Reuters that the near-term risk of a broader conflict in the Middle East had eased "somewhat".However, he urged caution over a possible response from Iran, adding that Teheran's regional allies also posed a risk.Yet recently the US has deployed its warships to the Middle East amid concerns of a regional escalation after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Teheran on July 31.The Pentagon has extended the deployment of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group after a largely failed attack by the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah on Israel over the weekend, according to a report by Defense News website.The Theodore Roosevelt arrived in the Middle East in early July, replacing the carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose deployment to the region had itself been extended multiple times, earlier this summer. Just last week fellow carrier Abraham Lincoln steamed into the region. Now two carriers and their warships are "available for US Central Command amid the threat of a full regional war erupting", said the report.While many have viewed the exchange of fire at Lebanon border as a significant escalation in the longstanding Israel-Hezbollah conflict, Ayman Yousef, an international relations professor at the Arab American University in Jenin in the West Bank, told China Daily Hezbollah's response was "nothing extraordinary".He said that he thinks Washington "is watching the behavior of Hezbollah", which so far has proved to be "very much within the rules of confrontation"."Hezbollah did not hit any civilian targets. It did not hit any Israeli city or civilian settlements but instead the focus was on some military posts, establishments, and installments," said Yousef, adding that Washington was not ready for any kind of regional confrontation where Israel and Iran would face off.On the ground, Yousef said he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will "keep on moving militarily in Gaza", taking advantage of weak opposition at home."The opposition forces in Israel are not united. They failed to neutralize this government led by Netanyahu," said Yousef, adding that this scenario may continue until the US presidential elections in November.According to Yousef, Netanyahu will be watching the outcome of those elections to see who wins between former US president Donald Trump and current US Vice-President Kamala Harris."I think Netanyahu's going to continue bargaining with the US, as he's bargaining with Hamas, as [he is] with the mediators including the Egyptians and Qataris," he said."So this is part of his strategy and vision to carry on with this war. I think the war is serving him at the political level and personal level. At all levels," said Yousef.On Aug 26, Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani met Iranian Foreign Minsiter Abbas Araghchi in Tehran on Monday, a day after the latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations ended without an agreement, Iran International reported.Further, the report said Iran would support any cease-fire deal agreed by Hamas, Araghchi told his Qatari counterpart.TEHRAN - Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Monday called on Muslim states to take joint actions to force Israel to stop its "crimes and genocide" in Gaza.He made the appeal during talks with visiting Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Tehran, according to a statement by his office."Muslim states and all those countries that are committed to international law and frameworks stand together and, through taking joint actions, manage to force the supporters of Israel into reining it in and stopping its crimes and genocide in Gaza," said Pezeshkian.Applauding Qatar's efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, he said that while all legal international regulations were constantly being violated in Gaza, the countries "claiming to be advocating human rights" chose to remain silent in the face of those "crimes" and even supported the ones perpetrating the violence.Tensions in the region have been heightened recently as Iran and its allies vowed to take revenge for the killings of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah's military commander Fouad Shokor last month.Haniyeh, who was in Iran to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Pezeshkian, was killed on July 31 along with his bodyguard when their residence in Tehran was attacked, one day after the death of Shokor in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut.Hezbollah unleashed hundreds of missiles and drones against Israel early Sunday morning in vengeance for the killing of Shokor while Israel claimed conducting a series of "preemptive airstrikes" targeting Hezbollah's rocket launchers in southern Lebanon.Iran has not made its retaliation yet, but a response to the assassination of Haniyeh will be "definitive, measured and well calculated", Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi said on X on Sunday night."We do not fear escalation, yet do not seek it," he added.Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Mohammad Baqeri also vowed on Monday that the revenge is "definite", semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.Baqeri said Iran would decide about its revenge for Haniyeh's assassination itself, and the resistance axis, as was seen on Sunday, would act separately and independently.He described the "cowardly" assassination of the Hamas chief in Tehran as an "unforgettable" incident, saying Iran would not fall into the trap of the enemies' media "provocations".During talks with Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Brown on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, "Iran's aggression has reached an all-time high."To counter this, Israel and the United States "must work together to achieve and project groundbreaking capabilities in all arenas", a readout of his office quoted Gallant as saying.The latest round of Gaza cease-fire talks ended with no deal, raising suspicions of delaying tactics and a diplomatic smoke screen of a joint "Israel-US project serving Israel's campaign of destruction", experts say.Despite optimistic statements from the United States, the resumption of weeklong talks in Cairo, Egypt- and earlier in Doha, Qatar — ended on Sunday with neither Hamas nor Israel reaching an agreement.Majd Abuamer, a researcher at the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies in Doha, said the US cannot be seen merely as a supporter of Israel or a mediator in the cease-fire talks, noting that talks are focused on technical and logistical details."The real objective behind the ongoing negotiations in Doha and Cairo … is to divert attention from the situation in Gaza and to give Israel more time to complete its campaign of destruction," Abuamer said.Israel had sustained its retaliatory military operations amid talks even throughout the Paris Olympics, issuing evacuation orders as it continued bombing schools and refugee camps.The health ministry in Gaza said on Monday that at least 40,435 people have been killed in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants, now in its 11th month.Abuamer said it should not be forgotten that reaching a cease-fire agreement does not necessarily entail ending the military campaign."Despite reaching agreements, Israel often fails to adhere to them and instead continues with its policy of assassinations and bombings, which reignites the conflict," he said.Hamas said its delegation demanded that Israel accept what had been agreed upon on July 2, based on US President Joe Biden's proposal and the United Nations Security Council resolution, Xinhua News Agency reported.Furthermore, the delegation reportedly stressed that any agreement must include a permanent cease-fire, Israel's complete withdrawal from Gaza, the return of residents to their homes and prisoner-hostage exchange.Intense pointOne of the intense points of contention was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demand that the Israel Defense Forces continue to be deployed along the Philadelphi Corridor that stretches the entirety of Gaza's border with Egypt, US media outlet Axios reported.On Friday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby, speaking to reporters, denied that the cease-fire talks were on the verge of collapse. Israeli authorities have said they will join the talks on their terms."The cease-fire talks in Cairo seem less about peace and more about power plays, with progress being announced but nothing concrete emerging," Arhama Siddiqa, a research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan, told China Daily.Negotiations have become "a well-worn tool in the US-Israel strategy" that gives the appearance of diplomacy but the situation on the ground tells a much different story, Siddiqa said.The "narrative of progress" allows Israel to continue its operations, with each passing day bringing more destruction to Gaza, she said."It's hard to ignore the suspicion that this is a delaying tactic, a diplomatic smoke screen behind which Israel carries out its military objectives."The US speaks of progress, but the lack of tangible results suggests the talks are more about stalling than stopping the violence."The question of the Philadelphi Corridor only deepens the deadlock, with its future tied to broader strategic goals rather than immediate peace, she said.Furthermore, the delay seems to work in Israel's favor, she added. "Each day the talks stretch out, more ground is covered, more homes are destroyed, more lives are lost."Late on Sunday, Israel issued new evacuation orders for Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, forcing more families to flee, saying its forces intended to act against Hamas and others operating in the area.Recently, Israel has issued several evacuation orders across Gaza, the most since the beginning of the conflict, prompting an outcry from Palestinians, the UN and relief officials over the reduction of humanitarian zones and the absence of safe areas.The Deir al-Balah municipality says Israeli evacuation orders have so far displaced 250,000 people.Agencies contributed to this story.UNITED NATIONS - A recent spate of Israeli evacuation orders has forced a shutdown of UN agency humanitarian aid operations in Gaza, a senior UN official said on Monday.However, two officials in Gaza for the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees, known as UNRWA, told reporters its organization continues providing services, albeit constrained while preparing for the beginning this weekend of a massive anti-polio vaccine campaign.Stephane Dujarric, chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said that "UNRWA is, given the way they're embedded with the population, is able to operate in situ with people who are already there."He said the senior UN official was referring to moving about by UN officials and UN humanitarian staff trying to get to places with aid when the opportunity arrives."If humanitarian workers are embedded with a certain population in a certain area, and they have the tools to operate and to share and to distribute, they will do so," the spokesman said. "But it is half a drop in a barrel."Dujarric said there were 16 evacuation orders so far in August, three of them since Friday.The UN official who briefed earlier said that what happened over the weekend just brought the agencies to the point where they couldn't continue to operate because of conditions not under their control."This is not a decision that we're saying we're stopping to operate but practically, we cannot operate," he said, but added, "we are not leaving."Following the UN official by less than an hour, Louise Wateridge, senior communications officer, and Sam Rose, senior deputy field director for UNRWA in Gaza, briefed from a guest house "in the middle of Gaza".Rose said UNRWA is continuing to deliver directly through 5,000 staff at 90 health points, mostly schools turned into shelters.He described Gazans' decrepit living conditions, ripe for the polio virus, and the population fleeing one site for another on an evacuation order.Wateridge said conditions are so bad and such a limit on what can be brought into Gaza, there is no chlorine for the water, and Gazans can't even buy a bar of soap for washing.Rose said polio vaccines have arrived in Gaza and will be administered this weekend to 640,000 children in two doses.Humanitarian partners of the world body reported at least 50,000 children born since the Gaza conflict erupted in October are highly unlikely to have received any immunizations due to the collapsed health system.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that since Friday, the Israeli military's three new evacuation orders were for more than 19 neighborhoods in northern Gaza and in Deir al Balah, with more than 8,000 people staying in the areas, many sheltering in 29 displacement sites."In Deir al Balah, the orders have displaced UN humanitarian staff, NGOs (nongovernmental organizations), and service providers, along with their families," OCHA said. "These relocations took place at short notice and in dangerous conditions."The humanitarians are worried about the order issued on Sunday for a part of Deir al Balah, affecting 15 premises hosting UN and NGO aid workers, four UN warehouses, Al Aqsa hospital, two clinics, three wells, one water reservoir and one desalination plant in or near the designated area."This effectively upends a whole lifesaving humanitarian hub that was set up in Deir al Balah following its evacuation from Rafah back in May, and it severely impacts our ability to deliver essential support and services," the office said.OCHA said World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reported that nearby health facilities risked becoming non-functional. Many patients and staff have left the Al Aqsa hospital, reducing healthcare capacity as hostilities intensify.The office said water production in Deir al Balah was reduced by 85 percent due to the loss of access to water sources in areas designated for evacuation."As we have reported earlier, only about 11 percent of the Gaza Strip has not been placed under evacuation orders," OCHA said. "Most people in Gaza are now squeezed in this small, overcrowded, polluted area where services are poor, and which is unsafe, just like the rest of the Gaza Strip."OCHA said the World Food Programme (WFP) reported that its operations were severely hampered by intensifying conflict, a limited number of border crossings, and damaged roads.The office said that in the last two months, the WFP brought in only half of the 24,000 metric tons of food aid required for operations serving 1.1 million people in Gaza. The WFP also had to reduce the contents of food parcels.The WFP warned that shell craters and debris made driving slow and challenging for truck drivers even in dry weather. Rain and flooding in two months will make most roads unusable.The agency also reported that aid workers grappled daily with slow authorizations and frequent refusals from Israelis when they asked for permission to move. Looting and public order problems were frequent, especially when convoys wait hours at holding points.BRUSSELS -- Several major airlines in European countries announced the suspension of flights to and from Israel and Lebanon Sunday following escalating hostilities between the two Mideast countries.According to French news channel BFMTV, Air France has decided to suspend its flights to Israel's Tel Aviv and Lebanon's Beirut until at least Monday due to growing tensions in the region."Today's and tomorrow's flights are canceled," an Air France spokesperson said, noting that the suspension could be extended after the company conducts a new assessment on Monday.Similarly, British Airways announced a suspension of flights to and from Israel's Tel Aviv until Wednesday."Due to the escalating situation in the region, Wizz Air is temporarily suspending flights to and from Israel on the 25th of August," Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air also posted on its website.Greek flag carrier Aegean Airlines canceled several flights to Israel and Beirut on Sunday. Its official website listed three flights to Tel Aviv and two flights to Beirut, including one scheduled for Monday, as canceled.German airline giant Lufthansa extended its suspension of flights to Beirut until Sept. 30, and to Tel Aviv and Tehran until Sept. 2.Israeli and Hezbollah forces engaged in extensive exchanges of fire early Sunday morning along the Israel-Lebanon border, marking a significant escalation in their longstanding conflict.Hezbollah claimed that it had launched hundreds of missiles into Israel in retaliation for the killing of its commander, Fouad Shokor, in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut last month. In response, Israel reported conducting numerous preemptive airstrikes targeting Hezbollah's rocket launchers in southern Lebanon.Following the most severe exchange of fire between the two sides in the Middle East, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defense Secretary John Healey both called their respective counterparts in Israel on Sunday, urging for an immediate ceasefire in the region, according to their posts on X, formerly known as Twitter.In early August, as tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border began to mount, many European countries urged their citizens to leave Lebanon. Meanwhile, some European carriers, including Air France and Romania's national airline TAROM, suspended their flights, although they later resumed services before this latest escalation.JERUSALEM/BEIRUT - About 100 Israeli warplanes struck and destroyed "thousands" of Hezbollah rockets and missile launcher barrels to be launched at northern and central Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Sunday.The strikes targeted more than 40 launch areas in southern Lebanon, which began before dawn, the IDF said, adding that most of the launchers were aimed at northern Israel, with some directed toward central Israel."Whoever hurt us -- we hurt them," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement.During the strikes, one person was killed in the town of Khiam in southern Lebanon, Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported.Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service reported that a woman in northern Israel was lightly injured by shrapnel. Video footage circulating on social media showed that a residential home in Acre was hit and sustained heavy damage.IDF Spokesman Daniel Hagari said during a press briefing that the military had "identified extensive preparation by Hezbollah to fire toward the Israeli home front" and launched the strikes as "a self-defense act to remove threats."Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has declared a "special situation on the home front" nationwide. New security guidelines were issued for residents from the north to Tel Aviv, banning large gatherings and urging people to stay close to shelters or safe rooms.Ben Gurion International Airport was temporarily shut down for incoming and outgoing flights, the Airports Authority announced, adding that full operations would resume during the morning hours.Hezbollah said on Sunday that it had fired more than 320 rockets at 11 Israeli army sites in retaliation for Israel's attack on Hezbollah's senior military commander, Fouad Shokor, the Lebanese National News Agency (NNA) reported.The NNA further reported that a series of Israeli air strikes on Lebanon began in the early hours of Sunday, causing serious damage to property, crops, and infrastructure, especially electricity and water systems. It was the heaviest since the start of the Hezbollah-Israeli conflict late last year.The attacks occurred amid escalating tensions in the region, including cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah since Oct 7, 2023, as well as ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, aimed at preventing a broader conflict in the Middle East.BEIRUT -- Israel launched "a string of airstrikes" in Lebanon on Sunday morning, targeting positions held by the Lebanese Hezbollah group in a pre-emptive move, Israel Defense Forces Spokesman Daniel Hagari said."Dozens of warplanes" participated in the attack, Hagari told a press conference, describing the attack as "a self-defense act to remove threats."Shortly afterward, Hezbollah announced it had launched a large-scale drone attack on Israel in retaliation for the killing of one of its senior commanders in Beirut, triggering air raid sirens in northern Israel.GAZA — The Israeli military has issued so many evacuation orders in 10 months of conflict that many Gaza civilians no longer heed them, despairing of finding space or safety in the enclave.Over the first three weeks of August, the Israeli army sent out 11 evacuation orders via flyers dropped from planes, text messages or social media.They called on 250,000 Gazans, almost all of whom had been displaced at least once already, to leave their place of shelter."For your safety, we urge you to evacuate immediately," read one such order sent out on Thursday in the southern province of Khan Younis."Every time we arrive somewhere, we get a new evacuation order two days later. This is no way to live," Haitham Abdelaal told Agence France-Presse.Amneh Abu Daqqa, 45, said she saw no point in moving again, when there are so few options for safe haven. "To go where?" the displaced mother of five asked."There is nowhere safe, there are airstrikes everywhere."The United Nations said tens of thousands of civilians have been on the move again this week from Deir al-Balah and the southern city of Khan Younis after Israeli military evacuation orders, which precede military operations.The conflict has displaced about 90 percent of Gaza's population, often multiple times, leaving them deprived of shelter, clean water and other essentials as disease spreads, the UN says."Civilians are exhausted and terrified, running from one destroyed place to another, with no end in sight," Muhannad Hadi, a humanitarian coordinator of the UN, said on Thursday.The proliferation of Israeli evacuation orders also severely complicates relief distribution by United Nations agencies in a blockaded territory where aid trickles in via Israeli-held entry points.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied reports on Thursday suggesting that Israel is considering agreeing to the deployment of an international force along a narrow border strip between Gaza and Egypt known as the Philadelphi Corridor."Prime Minister Netanyahu insists on the principle that Israel will control the Philadelphi Corridor to prevent the rearmament of Hamas, which would allow them to repeat the atrocities of Oct 7," his office said in a statement.Ongoing fightingPalestinian health officials said Israeli strikes have killed at least 16 people in the Gaza Strip. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital received the bodies, which were counted by an Associated Press reporter and included the remains of a woman and three children, after strikes overnight and into Thursday.US and Israeli delegations started a new round of meetings in Cairo on Thursday aimed at resolving differences over a truce proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, two Egyptian security sources said.Egyptian and US officials had met to seek compromises over plans for providing security on the border between Egypt and Gaza following an Israeli military withdrawal demanded by Hamas, the sources said.The proposals were due to be presented to Israeli officials later on Thursday, with a Qatari delegation due to join on Friday, they added.Egypt, along with the United States and Qatar, has been a mediator in months of stop-start negotiations to secure a cease-fire in Gaza, as well as the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.Agencies Via XinhuaGAZA - The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 40,265, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Thursday.During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 42 people and wounded 163 others, bringing the total death toll to 40,265 and injuries to 93,144 since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, it added.There are still a number of victims trapped under the rubble and scattered on roads, as ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them, it said."Critical water wells and sanitation infrastructure have been repeatedly damaged throughout the war," the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said on social media platform X on Thursday."With overcrowding, lack of hygiene and unbearable heat, access to clean water continues to be a struggle in the Gaza Strip," it added.Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage. Though far away, Palestinians displaced by the ongoing conflict in Gaza have found some comfort in the help extended by Chinese organizations to the besieged enclave.Ahmed Ayesh Alnajjar, director general of international relations at the Education Ministry in Gaza, who is among thousands of those displaced in Khan Younis, conveys his message of thanks to China.JERUSALEM - Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that Hamas' Rafah Division in Gaza has been "defeated" and signaled that the military was shifting its focus to the fighting against Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border.Gallant made the remarks during a tour of the Philadelphi Corridor, an area that runs along the Gaza-Egypt border and which Israel seeks to maintain control even after a potential ceasefire. The Israeli Defense Ministry released a photo of Gallant, clad in a bulletproof vest and surrounded by commanders, in a Palestinian building that Israeli troops had seized and converted into a headquarters.He said that Division 162 of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had "defeated" Hamas' Rafah Division. During the assault on Gaza's southernmost city, the IDF destroyed 150 tunnels, according to figures revealed by Gallant. He added that "a small number" of tunnels remained intact and he had "given an immediate order" to destroy them.In May, the IDF launched a large ground offensive in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza that had been designated as a "safe zone" and was sheltering over one million displaced Palestinians.Israeli security officials have recently claimed that most potential military targets in Gaza have been exhausted. Gallant indicated that the military was now shifting its focus."The most important thing, in my view, in terms of strategy, is to achieve all the war's goals regarding Hamas and the hostages, and now to look northward," he said, referring to northern Israel, where ongoing conflict with Hezbollah has intensified since Oct 7, 2023.The cross-border tensions have heightened in recent weeks following the Israeli assassination of a senior Hezbollah official in Beirut at the end of July.Dubai is stepping up efforts to foster robust partnerships with China in key sectors such as logistics, trade, high technology and green energy, as industry insiders see huge potential in China's economic growth.The Dubai Business Forum — China, hosted by Dubai Chambers on Wednesday in Beijing, aims to attract high-growth companies to Dubai and support Chinese businesses in leveraging opportunities for regional and global expansion.In the opening remarks, Mohammad Ali bin Rashed Lootah, president and CEO of Dubai Chambers, said: "Dubai has become increasingly attractive to Chinese investors with global ambitions."According to him, by the end of the first quarter of this year, there have been about 5,400 Chinese companies registered as active members of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce.According to Dubai Chambers, China is Dubai's largest trading partner, with a non-oil trade volume of $67.8 billion in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 4 percent and an increase of 83 percent compared with 10 years ago.Abdulla Al Hashmi, chief operating officer of Parks & Zones, DP World GCC, a logistics company based in Dubai, underscored some key factors behind Dubai's achievements in international trade."We have made bold investments when we created the infrastructure that is needed to stimulate trade, whether it is the Jebel Ali Port or Al Maktoum Airport," he told China Daily.Besides, he highlighted the importance of simplifying business processes."We've established a single trade window, called Dubai Trade, where traders, manufacturers, and all supply chain participants can conveniently conduct their transactions," he said. "So the ease of doing business is extremely important and this is what Dubai excels at."Beijing Xiaocheng Technology, a company that works on integrated circuits and electric energy meters, is among those looking for business expansion and are interested in Dubai's favorable policies."We already established our own office in Dubai, and we are planning to further expand our business in Dubai in the future," Liu Hang, deputy general manager of the company, told China Daily.Stephen Hurst, managing director and head of the China Management Office at HSBC China, also sees "a massive opportunity" between Dubai and China."The Middle East is a very important region for us in terms of our strategy in supporting clients," Hurst told China Daily. He is now based in China and helps clients with banking solutions."China and the Middle East are long-standing trading partners, and Dubai in particular, so I see there is a huge opportunity for Chinese corporates that are going overseas, and Dubai can be the platform for them," he added.As China and the United Arab Emirates celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations, their economic ties have significantly strengthened. China has maintained its position as the largest trading partner of the UAE for many years. Last year, the non-oil trade between the two countries reached nearly $81 billion. The two countries also look forward to a bilateral trade volume of $200 billion by 2030, according to a joint statement issued by China and the UAE on May 30.When asked about the UAE's BRICS membership, which took effect on Jan 1, Al Hashmi said: "We are an advocate of open market, trade without border, so we believe that this membership will enhance the multilateral trade relationship between the UAE and BRICS countries, we believe there is an opportunity to strengthen that through dialogue among the BRICS nations."Wang Haoran contributed to this story.China, rather than the United States, is better positioned to be a negotiator and mediator among countries in the Middle East, a US expert says."The Chinese government talks to everybody in the region," said Jack Midgley, principal of the global consultancy Midgley & Co and an adjunct associate professor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University. "China's role as a convener, an advocate, a sponsor of all sides will be much stronger as time goes by."The US military said on Aug 11 that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Georgia, a nuclear submarine, to the Middle East. The Pentagon said in a statement that Austin issued the order after speaking with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant."It's unbelievably powerful," Midgley said of the ship, whose complement includes 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, each of which can carry a 200-kiloton nuclear warhead."The move of the USS Georgia into central command is the clearest possible signal that the US will defend Israel with nuclear weapons if necessary," he said, pointing out that the Pentagon's announcement was a public signal that the firepower could be used to defend Israel and also "a very powerful deterrent signal to the Iranians".Since October, the US position "has moved toward unconditional support for Israel and away from a more balanced position" that it took in the past, Midgley said.The US government and officials have repeatedly made statements supporting a two-state solution.However, since the recent escalation of the conflict in Gaza, "there is no discussion about any topic really by the US other than how much military support Israel needs", Midgley said."The Americans used to be the convener. They used to be the authority that everyone could talk to in the Middle East."Meanwhile, China's position is "a balanced one", he said, adding the country is "better able to address all the parties" than the US is."China is calling attention to the need of the Palestinians. At the same time, China has maintained its position that the key to success is restraint, negotiations and a two-state solution."So the Chinese government talks to everybody in the region. However, the US remains an essential military partner for everyone in the Middle East. That won't be changed anytime soon."'Hardly achieved anything'On Tuesday night, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken left Qatar, concluding his ninth tour to the Middle East. As with his previous eight trips, this one has hardly achieved anything, Xinhua News Agency commented."Despite the declared optimism from the American side, American mediation could not solve the problem between Hamas and Israel, because reaching an agreement will not be easy due to the fundamental differences between them," said Kheir Diabat, a professor of the International Affairs Department at Qatar University.Mostafa Amin, an Egyptian researcher on Arab and international affairs, said the failure of US mediation in the Middle East and its inability to solve the problem from the outset until now arise from the lack of real pressure from Washington on Israel to stop the war, while it continues to supply Israel with weapons to kill Palestinians.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right officials in the Israeli government had realized that the Joe Biden administration is unable to apply meaningful pressure on Israel because of its preoccupation with the upcoming presidential election and its unwillingness to jeopardize relations with Israel, Amin said.Midgley said the two-state solution currently is "much farther away than it ever has been", as none of the three requirements for the solution — cease-fire, agreement at some level on borders, and governance for Palestine — are met."And I think China's voice for a two-state solution and China's economic influence in the region can help keep this idea alive," he said."The US has already taken a position in favor of Israel and is providing unlimited military assistance to the Israelis."The second fact is that China maintains good relationships with all of the countries in the region, including Israel."This represents an opportunity for China to consolidate and improve its relationships in the Pacific while the United States is busy elsewhere. And I'm sure that Chinese policy will reflect that opportunity."China is one of several countries that has continued to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to alleviate the unprecedented humanitarian crisis.From November last year until July, about 400 Palestinians a day in Khan Younis City were among the beneficiaries of education and food and aid from mainly China and Malaysia among others, Ahmed Ayesh Alnajjar, director general of international relations at the Education Ministry in Gaza, told China Daily.Among the Chinese donors are civic organizations such as Beijing One Heart Sphere Charity Foundation (BOHS), China Pak Youth Exchange Community, and Lok Sin Charity.JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told hostage families on Tuesday that he is uncertain whether a deal with Hamas will be reached, emphasizing that Israel will not relinquish control of two corridors in the Gaza Strip, a key demand by Hamas, state-owned media reported."Israel will not withdraw under any circumstances from the Philadelphi Corridor and the Netzarim Corridor, despite enormous pressure to do so," Netanyahu told Gvura Forum and Tikva Forum, two groups representing families of hostages, as reported by Kan TV news.The Philadelphi Corridor is a border area between Egypt and Gaza, while the Netzarim Corridor divides the enclave into northern and southern zones. Israeli forces currently control both, but Hamas has insisted on Israel's withdrawal as part of a ceasefire agreement.Netanyahu's office did not deny the comments reportedly made during his meeting with the hostage families. In a statement, Netanyahu pledged to "preserve our strategic security assets despite significant pressures."Israeli officials involved in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations accused Netanyahu of attempting to sabotage efforts to reach a deal after a new bridging proposal was presented in Qatar over the weekend."Netanyahu's remarks were intended to derail the negotiations," officials told Kan TV. "The prime minister knows we are at a critical juncture, working on solutions for the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors ahead of the next summit. He is aware of the progress made, yet his statements contradict what was agreed upon with mediators."The remarks came a day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after meeting with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Monday, said Israel had accepted the bridging deal proposal. The proposal, advanced by Qatari, Egyptian, and U.S. mediators, was described by Blinken as a last-ditch effort to reach an agreement, which aims at securing a ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.Hamas has demanded that the deal include a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire.Outside the Kirya base in Tel Aviv, the Israeli military's headquarters, dozens of hostage families and supporters rallied on Tuesday, urging the government to sign a deal. Similar demonstrations took place across the country.The rallies were triggered by the retrieval of six hostages' bodies from a tunnel in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis during a military operation. They were kidnapped by Hamas fighters on Oct 7, 2023, during their assault on Israeli communities.Netanyahu praised the operation, stating, "Israel will continue to make every effort to bring our hostages back."However, military spokesman Daniel Hagari said at a press conference that "there are currently 109 hostages held by Hamas," and added, "We won't be able to rescue all of them through military operations." He added that the National Institute of Forensic Medicine is still determining the cause of their death.Meanwhile, Israel's Channel 13 TV reported that officials from the Israeli delegation expressed doubt over the resumption of talks in Cairo this week. Major General Nitzan Alon, representing the Israeli military in the delegation, may not attend due to Netanyahu's refusal to compromise on the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors. "If there is no compromise on the main issues, what is the point of going to Egypt?" officials told the channel.Hamas fighters took about 250 hostages during their Oct 7, 2023 assault on southern Israeli communities. While dozens have since been released in deals, Israeli security officials, speaking to Xinhua on condition of anonymity, said only about 60 hostages are believed to be alive.Israel's response to the attack has resulted in a massive onslaught, killing more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly civilians, and causing widespread destruction across the enclave, according to health authorities in Gaza.Dubai aspires to serve as a gateway for Chinese companies to broaden their presence in the Middle East, a senior official has said, hoping for joint efforts between China and the United Arab Emirates to capitalize on the progress over the past 40 years, fostering an even more fruitful future.The UAE holds a crucial position as a strategic partner in advancing the Belt and Road Initiative. From the onset of the BRI, the country has functioned as a vital trade portal connecting the Middle East with the global community, Mohammad Ali Rashed Lootah, president and CEO of Dubai Chambers, said in an interview with China Daily.He made the remarks before departing for Beijing to attend the Dubai Business Forum-China on Wednesday, when more than 50 Dubai-based companies and 350 Chinese ones will participate.Calling China "a priority market", Lootah said the event aims to showcase the diverse investment opportunities in the emirate; attract Chinese multinational companies, unicorns and fast-growing startups to Dubai; and support Chinese investors and businesses to establish partnerships with their counterparts in the Middle East."It will explore economic synergies, new frontiers in innovation and technology, as well as investment opportunities in high-potential sectors, such as green tech, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, healthcare and renewable energy," he said.Last year, Dubai remained the world's top destination for greenfield foreign direct investment projects for the third consecutive year.The Middle East hub is home to modern airports, seaports, logistics facilities and a well-developed transportation network with numerous free zones that provide businesses with world-class infrastructure and access to incentives, Lootah said."Dubai's strategic geographical location, combined with its world-class hard and soft infrastructure, numerous free zones and its ability to attract diverse high-quality talent, creates a dynamic ecosystem that is highly conducive for business growth," he said.This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the UAE. Their mutually beneficial cooperation has set a model for partnerships and different civilizations coexisting in harmony.Last year, amid a challenging global economic environment, the volume of China-UAE trade nearly reached the milestone of $100 billion, with more than 8,000 Chinese companies having invested and started business in the UAE, said Zhang Yiming, China's ambassador to the UAE, in May.The state visit to China by UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in late May has paved the way for further strengthening China-UAE ties, as the two countries' joint statement vows a bilateral trade volume of $200 billion by 2030.The Gulf country is also home to nearly 400,000 Chinese, Lootah said, adding that more than 5,100 Chinese companies had been registered by the end of the first quarter with Dubai Chamber of Commerce.China is also the largest trading partner of Dubai with non-oil bilateral trade worth $67.8 billion last year, a 4 percent year-on-year rise and a more than 80 percent growth compared with a decade ago, according to Dubai Chambers.Last month, the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee held its third plenum, focusing on advancing China's modernization, outlining comprehensive reforms and proposing more than 300 measures. Lootah said this sent a strong signal to the world that China will continue to deepen its reform and opening-up.Remarkable success"We see China as a global economic powerhouse and believe that its remarkable success story is set to continue," he said. "This is one of the reasons of why we have three international offices in China alone, in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Hong Kong, which is the highest in any other region around the world."As China has emerged as one of the world's largest digital economies and a leading global center for advanced technologies, Lootah emphasized Dubai's eagerness to enhance cooperation in AI, blockchain and the internet of things."We admire China's deep-rooted commitment to innovation and are excited about the vast trade and investment opportunities that can be leveraged to empower tech startups," he said, adding that the UAE's digital economy is expected to reach a value of more than $140 billion by 2031.Last year, Dubai unveiled the Dubai Economic Agenda, known as D33, to double the size of its economy to $8.7 trillion over the next decade. Lootah said this strategy and the BRI can be aligned to explore innovative, green and prosperous future, pointing out that the UAE's entry into BRICS is attracting more Chinese investors to Dubai."For us, China is a market of great strategic importance. ... We will serve as a catalyst for collaboration and mutual prosperity," he said.Pan Jie in Beijing contributed to this story.JERUSALEM - Israel has accepted a new proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.During a press conference in Tel Aviv, Blinken said that Netanyahu "confirmed that Israel approves" the new US-backed bridging proposal. The proposal was presented to Israel and Hamas by Qatari, Egyptian, and US mediators over the weekend.Blinken urged Hamas to approve the bridging proposal, emphasizing the urgency of addressing the suffering in Gaza, where more than 40,000 have been killed in Israeli assaults, and the need to release the hostages still held by Hamas.Blinken visited Israel amid ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, before heading to Egypt and Qatar, key mediators in the negotiations.Netanyahu released a video statement during Blinken's press conference, referring to his meeting with Blinken as "good and important", but did not explicitly voice support for the bridging proposal.The prime minister said the United States "showed understanding to our vital security needs amid joint efforts to release our hostages".Hamas had previously dismissed the bridging proposal, claiming it was too aligned with Israel's demands, particularly concerning Israel's insistence on maintaining military forces within the Palestinian enclave, and accused Israel of introducing new demands.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' planned visit to Gaza has been welcomed amid worsening humanitarian conditions in the enclave, including fears of a polio outbreak, despite the resumption of cease-fire talks led by mediators.Dina Yulianti Sulaeman, director of the Indonesia Center for Middle East Studies, said although Abbas' desire to come to Gaza is "a little bit late", it is "worthy of appreciation"."This new development is related to the unity agreement of the Palestinian factions in Beijing (last month) and the escalation that is happening due to the killing of Ismail Haniyeh," said Sulaeman, referring to the July 31 assassination of the Hamas leader in Teheran."I hope that Mr Abbas, who has been known to have a more accommodating position toward Israel when meeting directly with the resistance factions in Gaza, will increasingly provide support to take a firm stance against Israel, namely demanding that Israel stop its attacks on Gaza and open up humanitarian aid channels."Abbas announced his planned trip at the Turkish parliament during a visit on Thursday, the same day that the death toll in Gaza amid Israel's military campaign surpassed 40,000.There are also fears of a polio outbreak in Gaza.On Friday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to all parties for a ceasefire so that humanitarians can safely vaccinate more than half a million children in Gaza against polio.'Restoring unity'Palestine's Wafa news agency reported that Abbas and his government are preparing to travel to Gaza to "restore national unity" and emphasize that the State of Palestine and the Palestine Liberation Organization are the mandate holders responsible for the entire State of Palestine.Abbas was in communication with the UN, Arab countries and Israel to ensure the success of the trip, Wafa reported. But UN spokesman Michele Zaccheo said the idea that the UN could provide security "is probably not so realistic at this stage".He added that the principal responsibility for providing security in the occupied territories "lies with the occupying powers", Turkiye's state-run Anadolu Agency reported.Negotiations on a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel are set to resume on Wednesday in Cairo, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing Egyptian officials.Also on Friday, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said in a statement that their countries "share a common interest in the security of the State of Israel" and the "stability of the region as a whole" and they have a responsibility to support ending the current escalation and securing a lasting peace to the benefit of Israelis, Palestinians and the whole region.Muslim Imran, director of the Asia Middle East Center for Research and Dialogue in Malaysia, said the joint statement is "self-defeating" because it reads as if Israeli security is at stake, not the fact that Israel is "currently perpetrating one of the most heinous genocides in modern history".On her X account, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese called out Western powers on Friday for omitting civilian deaths in their statements.Referring to a joint statement by the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom last week, she said after 10 "catastrophic months", the three Western countries wrote a 21-line statement on the Middle East with "not a single word about the millions scarred by the ongoing atrocities".RAMALLAH - Preparations are taking place for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's planned visit to the Gaza Strip as the Palestinian officials have reached out to countries worldwide for support, according to a statement published by Palestinian official news Agency WAFA on Sunday.The visit aims to demonstrate solidarity with Gaza's residents, assert that the State of Palestine and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) are the legitimate authorities over all Palestinian territories, and promote national unity, said the statement.The statement noted that "the Palestinian leadership" is engaging with the UN agencies, UN Security Council members, Arab and Islamic countries, the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the EU, the African Union, and other global powers to ensure the initiative's success and garner support.Israel has also been informed, it added.In a speech delivered at a Turkish parliamentary assembly, Abbas said he decided to travel to Gaza with all members of the Palestinian leadership, emphasizing his commitment to stand with the Palestinian people, WAFA reported.CAIRO — Israeli strikes killed 19 people in Gaza on Sunday, including six children, Palestinian health authorities said, ahead of a visit to the region by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to try to push forward cease-fire talks.The children and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in the central town of Deir al-Balah, health officials said.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, but they said the strike destroyed rocket launchers used to hit Israel from the southern city of Khan Younis, the scene of intense fighting in recent weeks, and killed 20 Palestinian fighters.Diplomatic efforts to halt the current conflict and secure a deal to return hostages held in Gaza have intensified in recent days. Talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States are set to continue this week in the Egyptian capital Cairo, following a two-day meeting in Doha last week.Blinken is making his 10th trip to the region since the conflict began, days after the US put forward bridging proposals that the mediating countries believe would close gaps between the warring parties.He is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials.Netanyahu's office said on Saturday there was "cautious optimism" a deal could be reached and US officials have also been positive, while cautioning there was still work to be done.However, Hamas said optimistic US comments were "deceptive" and accused Netanyahu of making new conditions in an attempt to "blow up" the negotiation.Agencies via Xinhua MANILA -- Filipinos staying in Lebanon have been advised to leave the Middle East country as early as possible as tension escalates due to the threat of an all-out war between the Iran-backed group Hezbollah and Israel.In a social media advisory Friday night, the Philippine Embassy in Lebanon urged Filipinos to leave when the airport remains operational."We advise all Filipino nationals to prioritize their safety and depart the country as soon as possible," the advisory read.To Filipinos who cannot leave Lebanon, the Embassy "strongly recommended" that they evacuate to safer areas outside capital Beirut, south of Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley.There are approximately 17,500 Filipinos staying in Lebanon, and around 3,000 are in southern Lebanon.In early October last year, tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border spiked in the wake of Hamas' attack on Israel from Gaza and Israel's subsequent military campaign.The heightening tension on southern Lebanon's border forced the Philippines to raise the alert level to 3 on a scale of 4 and urge its citizens to leave.In July this year, the Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) renewed its appeal for Filipinos to avail of the government's voluntary repatriation program as tensions in Lebanon continue to escalate.However, the DFA said that only about 300 Filipinos have been repatriated since the Philippine government raised the alert level to 3.Alert level 3 or voluntary repatriation is issued "when violent disturbances or external aggression occur in a limited area."JERUSALEM -- The Israeli army's fighting in the Gaza Strip has ended, Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported late Friday night.Citing senior security officials, the TV said that Israel can return and re-enter Gaza "when there is new intelligence," but in general the Israeli military's activity in the Palestinian enclave is over.According to the channel, the Israeli army told the decision-makers that the Rafah Brigade of Hamas had been defeated and that it practically did not exist.It added that these things were said at the political level during the security situation assessment discussions in the last few days.Israeli senior defense officials also told the political echelon that this is the time to start a hostage deal when most of the fighting units of Hamas are disbanded, Kan TV noted.The channel also reported that the Israeli delegation that participated in the negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza on Friday did not arrive in Qatar by flight for fear of an Iranian attack. The delegation landed in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and proceeded to Doha, not by flight.A joint statement from the United States, Egypt, and Qatar released on Friday said that "over the last 48 hours in Doha, senior officials from our governments have engaged in intensive talks as mediators aiming to conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees." Palestinian death toll in Gaza exceeds 40,000: health authoritiesIran has stressed its right to self-defense in possibly retaliating against Israel and urged Western powers to pressure Tel Aviv into a cease-fire in Gaza instead of dictating to Teheran what it should do.Iran has accused Israel of the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Teheran on July 31, which has escalated tensions in the Middle East. Israel has yet to publicly confirm carrying out the attack.Nasser Kanaani, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iran, criticized on Tuesday the joint statement by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom on the contentious Middle East issue, accusing the Western countries of ignoring Israel's crimes against the Palestinians while dictating to Iran what response measures it should or should not take following the assassination of Haniyeh.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned on Monday evening that some Western states' continued support to Israel has emboldened it to keep threatening peace and security at the regional and global levels, according to the IRNA news agency.Iran also rejected the United States' accusations over its alleged involvement in the Gaza peace talks.Meanwhile, Hamas slammed Washington for approving a multibillion-dollar arms deal to support Israel amid a surge in Palestinian civilian death tolls in recent months."The situation in the Middle East is highly volatile and if global powers aren't cautious, it could escalate into a world war," Abdul Wahed Jalal Nori, an analyst and lecturer at the Department of Fundamental and Inter-Disciplinary Studies at the International Islamic University Malaysia, told China Daily.The advice from US allies came just as US President Joe Biden's administration approved more than $20 billion worth of arms sales to Israel, including new F-15 fighter jets and tens of thousands of tank and mortar shells, US news outlet Axios reported.Abdul Wahed said the timing of the announcement could reflect broader geopolitical calculations, where the US aims to maintain its influence in the Middle East.Increasing turmoilGiven the increasing regional turmoil, he said Washington may be reaffirming its commitment to Israel's security and military superiority, not peace."They don't want peace. The situation is very dangerous. … Genocide is taking place. Not one is talking about it (to stop the genocide)," said Abdul Wahed."A multibillion-dollar arms deal to support Israel doesn't contribute to regional peace; it only fuels more killing and destruction. Instead, Washington could leverage its influence to pressure Israel to end the war, stop the killing of civilians, and invest those funds in rebuilding peace," he added.Belal Alakhras, a political analyst and Palestinian researcher at the University of Malaya in Malaysia, noted that the US approval of the arms to Israel contradicts its public statements on a cease-fire and "aligns it with Israel against other regional players".For months, he said, the US has "tried to isolate the war on Gaza", but Israel's inability to defeat Hamas has "led to recent escalations in Iran and Lebanon, including the assassination of Haniyeh in Teheran, further muddying the waters"."The US is not acting as a rational power considering its global interests, instead allowing itself to be influenced by Israel's actions which appears to be marching to the beat of its own drum without strategic foresight," Alakhras told China Daily, adding that the critical moment highlights the need for other major powers to "step up to the plate"."The other concerned actors could potentially join forces to turn the tide and work toward ending the regional conflict comprehensively. Without such efforts, the situation risks snowballing based on US actions in lockstep with Israel, potentially setting the region ablaze if left unchecked," he added.BEIRUT - Hezbollah attacked the Mount Neria base, a battalion leadership headquarters of Israel's Golani Brigade forces, with volleys of Katyusha rockets late Tuesday night, according to Lebanese TV channel al-Manar.Earlier, Hezbollah had launched over 20 rockets from southern Lebanon at the Meron base in northern Israel, both al-Manar and Al Jazeera have reported.Al-Manar reported that heavy rocket fire, explosions, and sirens were heard in Western Galilee.Hezbollah announced that its fighters targeted an Israeli deployment at the Jal Al-Deir site with a barrage of rockets at 10:00 pm on Tuesday, hitting them directly, according to the National News Agency (NNA).Israeli warplanes launched airstrikes targeting the Lebanese villages of At Tiri, Haddatha, and Rchaf around midnight, NNA added.Israeli warplanes also conducted airstrikes on the Lebanese villages of Kafr Kila and Khiam, as well as the municipality of Kunin, it noted.Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border escalated on Oct 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the day before. Israel then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.The situation escalated further after Israel's attack on Dahieh in Beirut's southern suburbs, killing a Hezbollah senior military commander, Fouad Shokor, and seven civilians. Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah threatened a definite and painful response to the Israeli raid at the appropriate time and place.GAZA - Nearly 84 percent of the Gaza Strip is under evacuation orders issued by the Israeli army, a UN relief and human development agency said Tuesday."People run for their lives, grabbing what they can and leaving everything else behind. They are exhausted and have nowhere safe to go," the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said on social media platform X.Since the onset of the Gaza war, the Israeli army has demanded that residents in Gaza leave their homes in preparation for military operations. Displaced individuals have been forced to seek refuge in UNRWA shelters, stay with relatives, or set up tents in streets and schools.According to data from the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, 2 million people out of a total population of 2.3 million in the enclave have been displaced due to the current conflict.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a Hamas attack on Oct 7, 2023, which resulted in approximately 1,200 deaths and around 250 hostages being taken.The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 39,929, the Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Tuesday.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations recently warned that the entire Gaza Strip is at high risk of famine.According to Palestinian organizations active in the enclave, many diseases, including skin conditions, have been reported in overcrowded shelters in Gaza.Palestinian militant group Hamas is pushing for implementing a Gaza cease-fire plan previously backed by the United Nations Security Council rather than holding further rounds of talks for a fresh pact, ahead of a meeting on Thursday proposed by negotiators.In a statement on Telegram, Hamas said it wanted a deal based on United States President Joe Biden's May 31 cease-fire proposal, the framework for which was laid out by mediators Qatar and Egypt on May 6, and adopted by the UN Security Council Resolution 2735, Al Jazeera reported on Sunday.The mediators should enforce the deal on Israel instead of pursuing further rounds of negotiations or new proposals as the process prolongs the killing of Palestinian civilians, Hamas said in the statement, as Israel continues its deadly airstrikes on Gaza.Jawaid Iqbal, chairman of the Department of West Asian and North African Studies at Aligarh Muslim University in India, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to eliminate Hamas, instead of negotiating a cease-fire with it.Netanyahu had been firm on his position of destroying Hamas and getting all hostages being held by the group, Iqbal said.Gaza officials told Agence France-Presse on Monday that they had identified 75 of 93 Palestinians killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school building in Gaza, while Israel's military said the weekend raid had "eliminated" 31 militants.Iqbal said Israel "uses the smokescreen of endless negotiations to continue the war"."The recent Tabeen school massacre demonstrates this opposition to cease-fire," he said.Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a video published on IDF's X account that they took numerous steps to mitigate the risk to civilians after receiving "clear intelligence" of the threat posed by "terrorists".'Precision strike'The IDF conducted a precision strike on one specific building where, according to their intelligence, no women and children were present, he said.Hagari blamed Hamas for abusing civilians and civilian infrastructure to attack Israel. These include underground tunnels that run under towns, hospitals, schools, mosques and UN facilities, he said.However, Hassan Ben Imran, a board member at nonprofit Law for Palestine, told China Daily that Israel's bombing of schools is claiming the lives of "mostly children, with no military targets"."What Israel announced is complete nonsense; even the 'targets' they used to justify the bombing with are actually not legal targets," he said.Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, said on X that just in the past few days, more than 75,000 people have been displaced in southwest Gaza.The International Committee of the Red Cross made a call on X to make the Geneva Conventions a political priority."Seize every chance to de-escalate," said Mirjana Spoljaric, president of ICRC, on the 75th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions on Monday."The faithful application of international humanitarian law can bolster peace initiatives. We must reduce suffering and protect humanity from further destruction."Meanwhile, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered a guided missile submarine to the Middle East and is asking the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to sail more quickly to the area, the Pentagon said on Sunday, as mounting tensions raise fears of a region-wide conflict.Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder said Austin, who spoke with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant on Sunday, had also ordered the USS Georgia guided missile submarine to the area.The US military had already said it will deploy additional fighter jets and navy warships to the Middle East as Washington seeks to bolster Israeli defenses.Agencies contributed to this story.Iran and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah's apparent restraint since Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh's assassination on Iranian soil underscores the region's commitment to de-escalation and has nothing to do with Washington's show of force, analysts said.They also said Iran and Hezbollah, despite being painted as "rogue" by Israel and the United States, are also trying to encourage to put "an end to the ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians" and urged Washington and Tel Aviv to stop behaviors that defy international consensus.Even as the region is bracing for Iran and Hezbollah's response, Al Jazeera reported that Khan Younis faced a heavy bombing campaign with nearly 30 air attacks, destroying buildings and infrastructure in the span of a few hours and eastern Khan Younis becoming uninhabitable, "turning gradually into a wasteland".Thousands fled on Thursday, carrying essentials like small gas cylinders, mattresses, tents, backpacks and blankets.Officials from Israel and the US said they believe Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' newly named political chief and one of the architects of the Oct 7 attack on Israel, could be hiding in tunnels under Khan Younis.Mehran Kamrava, a professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar, said Iran's restraint "so far has nothing to do with the US show of force".US media outlet Axios first reported on Aug 4 that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his G7 counterparts that Iran and Hezbollah may attack Israel in the next 24 to 48 hours.Iran and Hezbollah had earlier vowed to respond to Haniyeh's assassination, which they said was Israel's doing.Diplomatic toneWhile Iran's acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani told the emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on Wednesday that Iran has the right to self-defense, the joint communique of the 57-member Muslim bloc firmly held on to its diplomatic tone."One of the things we've seen consistent in the strategic behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran is its unwillingness or inability to respond positively to threats," Kamrava told China Daily."The restraint that Iran has shown so far has a number of reasons, but none of those reasons have anything to do with the supposed show of US strength, which has been quite minimal so far or fears of an Israeli reprisal, which the Iranians fully expect and anticipate."Rasha Al Joundy, a senior researcher at the Dubai Public Policy Research Centre, told China Daily that Iran "is gaining from this delay" and is able to show how much it has changed regarding its relations with Saudi Arabia and consequently other Arab leaders in the region."This was notable through the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement and the OIC meeting and final statement. This demonstration of solidarity with Iran after (Haniyeh's assassination) gave diplomatic weight to Iran as a victim of aggression, not as a rogue state like Israel and US like to paint Iran," Al Joundy said.She said Iran and the other Gulf Arab countries do not want an allout war, so the OIC meeting called on the Security Council to fulfill its role in managing conflicts, "which the Security Council is not doing due to the US backing of Israel".Palestinian presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said on Thursday that Israel had entered the stage of being internationally isolated and rejected, "thanks to its aggressive policies and total disregard of the United Nations resolutions and international law", Palestine's WAFA news agency reported.Abu Rudeineh slammed the measures as "provocative behaviors" that were intended to defy the international community and called on the US to compel Israel to halt the fighting against Gaza.Various media outlets reported that cease-fire talks are expected to resume next week with the Israeli delegation in attendance.A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Friday confirmed this, saying that pursuant to the proposal by the US and other mediators, Israel "will, on Aug 15, send the negotiations team to a place to be determined in order to finalize the details of the implementation of the framework agreement".Mike Gu in Hong Kong and agencies contributed to this story.jan@chinadailyapac.com  JERUSALEM -- Israel replied to Qatari, Egyptian and US mediators early Friday, saying that it will send a delegation to resume talks on a Gaza ceasefire deal on Aug 15.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that the negotiation team will be dispatched "to finalize the details for implementing the framework agreement."The announcement was made after mediators of the three countries released a joint statement, calling on Israel and Hamas to restart the talks on Aug. 15 to close all remaining gaps in the proposed deal and begin implementing it without further delay.Editor's note: There are no signs of letup in violence in Gaza as the conflict enters the 11th month. China Daily looks at the international community's efforts in finding a solution as well as humanitarian crisis on the strip.With both the death toll and humanitarian situation rapidly worsening in Gaza, the international community has made continued efforts to end the conflict, with the UN Security Council adopting at least four resolutions, namely Resolution 2712, 2720, 2728 and 2735.The resolutions call for an immediate cease-fire, the immediate and unconditional release of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas, the need to expand the flow of humanitarian goods into the Gaza Strip, and reinforce the protection of civilians in the conflict zone.However, until now, there have been no signs of a letup in the conflict despite the diplomatic efforts, not even after the Paris Summer Olympics torch was lighted on July 26.The desperate appeals from the families of Israeli hostages, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to bring their loved ones home, have fallen on deaf ears.An advisory from the International Court of Justice, published on July 19, declared that Israel's laws and measures violate the international prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid.The court also demanded that Israel end its occupation of Palestinian territories, dismantle its settlements in the West Bank, provide full reparations to Palestinian victims and facilitate the return of displaced people.But all these consolidated efforts, legal advice and international opinion continue to be ignored.A series of international condemnations and resolutions largely aimed at preventing Israel's military strikes on the Gaza Strip have done little to improve the conditions of aid worker Nebal Farsakh and her colleagues, as well as the 2 million Palestinians struggling for survival in their homeland.Despite the existence of international humanitarian laws, "our teams have been strategically and repeatedly targeted", which has resulted in the killing of 19 Palestine Red Crescent Society members up to this moment, Farsakh, a spokesperson for the group, told China Daily.Farsakh noted that while several United Nations resolutions have been passed to restrain Israel since the conflict in Gaza began, these have had no direct impact on their work — in terms of ensuring the aid workers' safety.She said the group's objective is to ensure "the protection of our staff, the humanitarians, medical personnel and medical facilities" so they can continue to provide lifesaving work.On Aug 3, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies confirmed the death of one of their own — Tamer Jalal Muhammad Saqr — who died after he was shot during an Israeli raid on the Balata refugee camp east of Nablus in the West Bank on July 27. He was helping the wounded civilians after a blast killed two people and injured more than 20 others.On Aug 8, the US-based food aid charity World Central Kitchen said on its X account that Nadi Sallout, an integral member of the warehouse team from the early days in Rafah and a humanitarian at his very core, was killed near Deir al-Balah, Gaza.On April 1, seven of its staff, which included citizens from the US, Australia, Britain and Poland, were killed after the Israeli military attacked their three-vehicle convoy despite being clearly marked with logos of the organization.The schools in Gaza are not safe either. On Aug 4, at least 25 Palestinians were killed when an Israeli airstrike hit the al-Nasr and Hassan Salama schools in Gaza City, Xinhua News Agency reported. Many of the victims were children and women. Israeli Army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said the attack was aimed at militants operating inside Palestinian schools.Editor's note: China Daily presents the series Friends Afar to tell the stories of people-to-people exchanges between China and other countries. Through the vivid narration of the people in the stories, readers can get a better understanding of a country that is boosting openness.China has spent many years developing its automation and robotics industries, and it is now the appropriate time to bring that expertise to the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC, said Saleh Al Tunaib, co-founder and CEO of btr.tech.The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman."We've been working with Chinese companies for a while and we found there are huge opportunities," Al Tunaib said, noting there was "ease of working and efficiencies" in the way the Chinese companies do business."Usually, when we try to bring technologies from Europe to the Middle East, it takes between nine and 12 months to bring them here," Al Tunaib said. In contrast, Chinese companies take three months to come in and deploy their technologies, he added.Al Tunaib noted he has been working in the retail industry for almost 15 years, and said he sees a huge need for automation in the sector. For instance, the value of e-commerce can be expected to reach $40 billion in the next couple of years, in his view.When his team built their first automated warehouse, they went through a process of trying to choose the right technology. "We dealt with mainly US and European technologies, as the access to Chinese technology was very difficult… in 2020," he said.It was only when his team gained more exposure to the Chinese market that they realized the existence of many Chinese technologies that they could bring to the Middle East region.In the Middle East, there was not enough access to Chinese technology, he said. Al Tunaib's team seeks to bridge the gap between China and the Middle East as there is a "huge opportunity" for bringing Chinese e-commerce technology to the region.Al Tunaib's team, which runs a logistics hub out of Kuwait, operates its own software to integrate the use of robotics in the retail industry.After operating AutoStore, an innovative automated material handling solution, for a few years, his business gained a better understanding of the Chinese market, he said. Then, with the help of eWTP Arabia Capital, which provides access to technology from mature global markets, Al Tunaib's team visited China in January.They visited four cities in China, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, where they interacted with multiple robotics companies.According to Al Tunaib, his company is setting up clients with auto parts and e-commerce warehouses in Kuwait across 35,000 square meters with the help of robotics technology from China. One of the companies involved in the project is Quicktron Robotics, a Shanghai-based firm in robotic logistics solutions. His team has been working with other Chinese manufacturers such as Megvii and Senad since its visit in January, he said.There's no need for any data to prove the need to connect Asia with the GCC and Europe. The integration of cross-border operations will bring in more business and connect us even further, he added.Such an integration of cross-border operations will "take us to another level. It will change the way we do business", Al Tunaib said.According to Al Tunaib, there is great growth momentum in Saudi Arabia as the nation plans to spend $27 billion over the next four years to help improve logistics and the ports sector.The investment is part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 and aims to connect Asia through Saudi Arabia to Europe by becoming a global logistics hub.Expertise in automationBy leveraging the Chinese company's expertise in automation, Al Tunaib's company aims to transform the logistics operations of e-commerce businesses throughout the GCC region."Today we represent Quicktron, Shenzhen DBL Technology, and many other Chinese companies in the Middle East region," he added.Al Tunaib said an obvious advantage of Chinese companies is their focus on a niche area in the logistics sector."Although there are different segments of robotics, including drones or electronic vehicles, within each segment of robotics every Chinese company has its own focus, such as the Automated Case-handling Mobile Robot. The Chinese companies want to be the best in a specific technology."In many other countries, what we've seen is that they try to do something of everything," he noted. In this process, "sometimes you lose focus", Al Tunaib added.Al Tunaib collaborates with Chinese companies in two ways. One is by bringing technology to the region and adopting these for the public and private sectors. The other way is bringing relevant technologies and manufacturing partially or entirely in the GCC."So, there are ways for us to innovate together, bring our minds and resources together," he said.According to Al Tunaib, the people of Gulf countries and China share similar traits. "I love China and its people," he said. GAZA -- Hamas announced on Tuesday the selection of Yahya Sinwar as its political bureau chief, replacing late chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran last week."We announce the selection of leader Yahya Sinwar as head of the movement's political bureau, succeeding leader Ismail Haniyeh," Hamas said in a statement.Sinwar, 61, has been the Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip since 2017. He spent more than 20 years in Israeli prisons and was released under a prisoner exchange deal with Israel in 2011. He is considered by Israel as one of the main planners of the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel.Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on July 31, which Hamas attributed to a "treacherous" Israeli raid on his residence.BEIRUT - An Israeli airstrike Tuesday hit a house in the village of Maifadoun in southern Lebanon, killing four people, the National News Agency reported.ISLAMABAD - Pakistan will emphasize the urgency of peace and provision of relief assistance for Gaza in the upcoming Organization of Islamic Cooperation's (OIC) meeting, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry has said.Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will attend the Extraordinary Meeting of the OIC convened at the request of Palestine and Iran in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah on Wednesday, the ministry said in a statement on Monday.He will present the South Asian country's serious concerns about the dire situation in Gaza and the wider Middle East region, it added."As one of the staunchest supporters of the Palestinian cause, Pakistan has always been at the forefront in raising its voice at all international fora, including the OIC," the statement said.GAZA - At least 25 Palestinians were killed by Israeli airstrikes on the schools of al-Nasr and Hassan Salama in Gaza City, Palestinian security and medical sources said Sunday.Israeli warplanes bombed with several missiles at the two schools, security sources said. Medical sources told Xinhua that at least 25 Palestinians were killed and dozens of others wounded as a result of Israeli air raids.Most of the victims are women and children, the Civil Defense Authority in Gaza said in a statement.Meanwhile, Israeli Army Spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a statement that Israeli warplanes attacked militants operating inside Hamas command and control complexes that were hidden inside the Hassan Salama and al-Nasr schools in Gaza City.Since Oct 7, 2023, Hamas and the Israeli army have been involved in a large-scale war, right after Hamas carried out its unprecedented attack on the Israeli towns adjacent to the besieged coastal enclave.The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip has risen to 39,583, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Sunday.RAMALLAH - China on Thursday donated $3 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to support its emergency humanitarian efforts in Gaza.Zeng Jixin, head of Office of the People's Republic of China to the State of Palestine, signed the contribution agreement with Deputy Commissioner General (Operational Support) of the UNRWA Antonia Marie De Meo, the office said in a statement.China has always supported the UNRWA's active performance of its duty, and called on the international community to support the agency's work, Zeng said, adding that China had provided emergency cash assistance to the agency after the outbreak of the Gaza conflict last year.China will continue to implement the Global Security Initiative and work with the international community to end the fighting in Gaza at an early date, ease the disastrous humanitarian situation, and implement the two-state solution, Zeng said.De Meo, on behalf of the UNRWA, expressed gratitude for China's consistent support and said that China's contribution was critical.She also expressed willingness to strengthen cooperation with China to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.TEHRAN -- Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said on Saturday that Hamas Politburo Chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated by a "short-range projectile loaded with an almost 7-kg warhead.""In view of the conducted investigations, the terrorist operation has been carried out through firing from outside the guests' residence a short-range projectile loaded with an almost 7 kg warhead, causing an intense explosion," the IRGC said in its third statement about Haniyeh's assassination in an alleged Israeli attack in the Iranian capital Tehran, according to the armed force's official news outlet Sepah News.The statement added the "terrorist" attack had been designed and carried out by Israel with the US government's support.The IRGC stressed that "the revenge for Haniyeh's blood will be definite," adding the "adventurist and terrorist" Israel would receive a "decisive response to this crime, which is a harsh punishment, at the appropriate time and place and with the appropriate quality."Haniyeh, who had been invited to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday, was killed along with his bodyguard early Wednesday when their residence in Tehran was hit.Iran held funeral processions on Thursday for Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh after he was killed in a strike in Teheran blamed on Israel, while United Nations Security Council countries called for stepped-up diplomatic efforts to avert a wider Middle East conflict.Thousands of mourners paid respects to Haniyeh as the Israeli military confirmed that an airstrike in Gaza last month killed the Hamas military chief, Mohammed Deif.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh ahead of his burial in Qatar, with President Masoud Pezeshkian standing next to him. State television later showed the coffins placed in a truck and moved on the street toward the Azadi Square in Teheran and people showering flowers at them.The assassination of Haniyeh, who went to Teheran to attend Pezeshkian's inauguration on Wednesday, sparked threats of revenge against Israel and fueled concerns that the Gaza conflict is turning into a wider Middle East war.It occurred just hours after a top Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr, was killed in an Israeli strike on Lebanon's capital Beirut in retaliation for a deadly weekend rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.At a news briefing on Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said the country is deeply concerned that the assassination may plunge the region into further turmoil and stressed the necessity of a permanent cease-fire in Gaza as soon as possible."There should be no more escalation of conflict and confrontation," he said. "China is always committed to safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East and is opposed to external interference. We stand ready to work with relevant parties toward lasting peace and security in the region."Charter principle stressedFu Cong, China's permanent representative to the UN, said the assassination was "a blatant attempt to sabotage peace efforts and wantonly trampled on the fundamental UN Charter principle of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states".The Gaza conflict has been going on for 300 days, resulting in nearly 40,000 deaths and an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe, Fu said.The UN Security Council adopted a resolution in early June aimed at reaching a comprehensive Gaza cease-fire deal in three phases.However, Fu said negotiations have yet to yield any progress, "while the spillover effects of this conflict are increasingly visible, with the tensions between Lebanon and Israel, between Syria and Israel, and in the Red Sea sounding the alarm frequently".Failure to achieve a cease-fire in Gaza was responsible for worsening tensions, he said. "Countries with major influence must put more pressure and work more vigorously ... to put out the flames of war in Gaza."Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran's UN ambassador, said Teheran has consistently exercised maximum restraint but reserves its right to respond decisively. He called on the Security Council to condemn Israel and punish it with sanctions.Iran's first vice-president Mohammad Reza Aref said his country has no intention of escalating the Middle East conflict, state media reported.Robert Wood, the United States' deputy ambassador to the UN, called for members of the Security Council with influence over Iran "to increase pressure on it to stop escalating its proxy conflict against Israel and other actors".Israel has declined to comment on the Teheran strike, but experts said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is likely to benefit domestically from the killing, Agence France-Presse reported."It's a tactical, not a strategic victory (for Netanyahu), he scored points but that could change very quickly", said Asher Cohen, a political science professor at Israel's Bar Ilan University.Agencies and Mo Jingxi in Beijing contributed to this story.JERUSALEM -- The Israeli army announced Thursday that Mohammed Deif, the commander of Hamas' military wing, was killed by Israeli airstrike in Khan Yunis area in the Gaza Strip on July 13.GENEVA — The UN human rights office issued a report on Wednesday saying Palestinians detained by Israeli authorities since the Oct 7 attacks faced waterboarding, sleep deprivation, electric shocks, the release of dogs and other forms of torture and mistreatment.The report said Israel's prison service held more than 9,400 "security detainees" as of the end of June, and some have been held in secret without access to lawyers or respect for their legal rights.A summary of the report, based on interviews with former detainees and other sources, decried a "staggering" number of detainees, including men, women, children, journalists and human rights defenders, and said such practices raise concerns about arbitrary detention.Often, they were blindfolded and shackled before being transported to Israel and placed in "cage-like" military centers and forced to wear nothing but diapers for prolonged periods, it said. The report said 53 detainees died in custody.Agencies via XinhuaHamas said on Wednesday its political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike in Teheran and vowed the act "will not go unanswered".Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed in a statement the death of Haniyeh, hours after he attended a swearing-in ceremony for the country's new President Masoud Pezeshkian.The statement said Haniyeh's residence in Teheran was hit and he was killed along with a bodyguard, adding the attack is under investigation and details will be released later.Iran declared three days of mourning.An "official and public" funeral ceremony for Haniyeh would be held in Teheran on Thursday before his body is flown to Qatar, his base in recent years, for burial on Friday, Hamas said.Israel declined to comment on the strike, which came after it struck a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut on Tuesday, targeting a senior commander of the Lebanese militant group it blamed for a deadly weekend rocket strike on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.Speaking in an interview with Channel News Asia in Singapore, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was "not aware of or involved in" the strike that killed Haniyeh.Haniyeh was elected head of the Hamas political bureau in 2017 to succeed Khaled Meshaal.The killing has caused wide concerns and condemnation, with many warning of "chaos" in the Middle East.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened "harsh punishment" for Haniyeh's killing, saying, "We consider it our duty to seek revenge for his blood as he was martyred in the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran."Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned Haniyeh's killing as a "cowardly act". "He urged our people and their forces to unite, remain patient, and stand firm against the Israeli occupation," his office said.Palestinian factions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank called for a general strike and protest marches across the territory.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said China firmly opposes and condemns the assassination of Haniyeh. "We feel worried that the issue may cause further turbulence in the region," Lin told a regular news conference on Wednesday.Noting that China always believes that regional disputes should be settled through negotiations and dialogue, he called for an early, comprehensive and permanent cease-fire in Gaza to avoid further escalation of conflicts.Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani cast doubt on the success of future mediation between Israel and Hamas following the killing of Haniyeh."Political assassinations & continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side? Peace needs serious partners," Sheikh Mohammed, who has led Qatar's mediation efforts, wrote on X.Russia, Turkiye and Iraq also condemned it.Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles also warned of "profound "risks for further escalation in the Middle East after Israel was blamed for the assassination of Haniyeh on Iranian soil. "I think all of us look at what's occurring in the Middle East and want to see an end to the catastrophe that is playing out," he said.No sign of an endHaniyeh's assassination came as Israel's military campaign in Gaza approaches the end of its 10th month with no sign of an end to a conflict that has threatened to spiral into a wider regional conflict. Ceasefire talks brokered by Egypt and Qatar appear to have faltered.At the same time, the risk of a war between Israel and Hezbollah has grown following the strike in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights that killed 12 children on Saturday and the subsequent killing of the senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr.Hezbollah has not yet confirmed Shukr's death, but said he was in the building hit by an Israeli strike.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its Oct 7 attacks on Israel, which sparked the conflict in Gaza.The attacks resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally. Israel's campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,400 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's Health Ministry.Agencies and Wang Qingyun in Beijing contributed to this story.MIKE GU in Hong Kongmikegu@chinadailyhk.comTEHRAN/GAZA -- Hamas Politburo Chief Ismail Haniyeh and one of his bodyguards have been killed in the Iranian capital of Tehran, Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said on Wednesday.Haniyeh and his bodyguard were killed early Wednesday when their residence was hit in Tehran, according to a statement published on the IRGC's official news outlet Sepah News.The statement said the attack was under investigation and the results would be announced later.The Islamic Hamas movement confirmed the death of its leader, saying Haniyeh was assassinated by an Israeli attack in Iran.In a press statement, Hamas said that it "mourns to the Palestinian people, the Arab and Islamic nation, and the free people of the world," after their leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli raid on his residence in Tehran.Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday.He was also expected to discuss with the Iranian president the political and field developments related to the Palestine-Isreal conflict in the Gaza Strip, a source close to Hamas told Xinhua.The Israeli army has no comment on the issue yet.Since Oct. 7 last year, Israel has been launching a large-scale strike on Hamas.According to Gaza health authorities, the Israeli offensive has led to the killing of over 38,000 Palestinians in the enclave, while the UN estimated that nearly 2 million people there have been displaced. Iran's new President Masoud Pezeshkian, who was inaugurated on Tuesday in the presence of dignitaries from more than 80 countries, promised to continue to support Palestine and increase exchanges with other countries while boosting domestic development.Peng Qinghua, special envoy of Chinese President Xi Jinping and vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attended the inauguration ceremony held in the hall of the Iranian Parliament in Teheran.Two presidents, 11 speakers of parliament, four deputy parliament speakers, four prime ministers, along with special envoys, ministers and deputy ministers were among the foreign guests who attended the ceremony, official news agency IRNA reported.Exchanging views by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Pezeshkian discussed the revival of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a 2015 nuclear deal between Teheran and world powers, and the removal of sanctions, Xinhua News Agency reported.The United States reimposed many sanctions against Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from the deal in 2018.In the one-hour call, Pezeshkian expressed his readiness to improve ties with France based on honesty and mutual confidence building, said a statement issued by the president's office.While meeting on Monday with Ziad al-Nakhalah, secretary-general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, Pezeshkian said, "Supporting the cause of the oppressed Palestinian nation will continue with strength and nothing can disrupt our will and resolve on this issue," IRNA reported.In a message to Pezeshkian, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN eagerly waits for cooperation with the new government of the Islamic republic, IRNA reported.Iran will also enhance exchanges with other countries, especially the Islamic ones, to create synergy among Islamic societies, Pezeshkian told guests.Dina Yulianti Sulaeman, director of the Indonesia Center for Middle East Studies, told China Daily she is optimistic that Pezeshkian will maintain a firm stance on the Palestinian issue.During his inauguration speech before Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the new president said he "will follow the path of the martyrs", which Sulaeman said can be interpreted as signaling Iran's resistance against the US and Israel.Sulaeman said Pezeshkian will continue the late president Ebrahim Raisi's policy of enhancing trade and investment ties with regional countries, and leveraging regional organizations such as BRICS and Shanghai Cooperation Organization.Nagapushpa Devendra, a West Asia analyst and research scholar at the University of Erfurt in Germany, said: "Regionally, the new president is likely to continue seeking strategic involvement ... (In) hindsight, there may be efforts to reduce regional tensions through diplomatic channels especially with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia."Domestically, Pezeshkian may focus on mitigating the effect of sanctions, especially those imposed by the US, Devendra said."Since Pezeshkian is a reformist, there is definitely some expectation in terms of introducing some incremental changes to improve freedom of expression and political participation," he said.Seyed Mostafa Khoshcheshm, a former professor at the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Faculty of International Relations, said: "Iran's foreign policy will more or less move ahead in similar ways to the policies exercised by president Raisi.""Iran will continue to develop ties with the neighbors and enhance strategic cooperation with Russia and China. And Iran will continue to develop its ties with Africa and Latin America," he added.JERUSALEM/BEIRUT -- Israel's army announced on Tuesday that it killed Hezbollah's top military commander, Fouad Shokor, in an airstrike in Beirut, saying the assassination was a retaliation for a cross-border rocket that killed 12 youngsters on Saturday.Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party, did not immediately confirm his condition. Earlier Lebanese media reports said the attack targeting Shokor was missed."Tonight, IDF (Israel Defense Forces) conducted a targeted strike in Beirut, eliminating Fouad Shokor, also known as 'Sayyid Muhsan,' the most senior military commander and head of the Strategic Unit of Hezbollah," IDF's Spokesperson Daniel Hagari told a press briefing in Tel Aviv.Hagari said that Shokor served also as Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah's "right-hand man" and was Nasrallah's adviser for planning and directing wartime operations.In a press release, IDF blamed Shokor for being responsible for the deadly rocket on Saturday that hit a football pitch in Majdal Shams, a Druze town in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.The commander "was responsible for the majority of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets, and UAVs. He was responsible for force build-up, planning, and execution of terror attacks against the State of Israel," IDF said.A strong blast was heard in the Lebanese capital on Tuesday night, and video footage on social media showed mass destruction of a residential building, with rubble scattered in the street.Lebanon's Al Manar TV cited the Lebanese health ministry as reporting 74 people injured along with three killed in the attack around Hezbollah's Shura Council.Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack, saying Lebanon preserves its right to take all necessary measures that contribute to deterring the aggression.Lebanese Foreign Affairs Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said Lebanon will submit a complaint to the UN Security Council over the attack.TEHRAN -- Masoud Pezeshkian was sworn in as Iran's ninth president on Tuesday in a ceremony held at Tehran's parliament, the official IRNA news agency reported.The ceremony was attended by high-ranking officials, military commanders, and representatives from 88 countries and 10 international organizations.Following his oath-taking before parliament, Pezeshkian outlined his administration's goals, focusing on Iran's economic development, national interests, and improving citizens' lives.He highlighted key foreign policy objectives aimed at safeguarding national security and enhancing economic prosperity within the framework of "dignity, wisdom, and expediency."Pezeshkian also condemned Israeli actions in Gaza, criticizing bombings that affected civilians, including women and children, and those who supported such actions.Pezeshkian, 69, emerged as the winner on July 6 in the country's presidential elections and was officially endorsed by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei as Iran's ninth president on Sunday.He now has 15 days to submit his proposed cabinet to parliament for approval.TEHRAN - Iran and The Gambia resumed their diplomatic ties on Monday almost 14 years after the latter cut them.According to a joint statement released by the Iranian Foreign Ministry, the decision was made in a meeting between Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani and Gambian Foreign Minister Mamadou Tangara in the Iranian capital Tehran, in line with the interests of both countries.The Gambian Foreign Minister has traveled to Tehran to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, which is scheduled for Tuesday.According to the statement, the two governments agreed to expand bilateral cooperation covering the political, economic, investment, trade and cultural spheres.The statement added that the two countries' embassies in Senegal's capital Dakar agreed to serve as diplomatic contact points to help resume official diplomacy.The Gambia cut diplomatic and economic relations with Iran in November 2010 and ordered all Iranian representatives to leave within 48 hours.The Gambia cited no reason for cutting ties with Iran. Tehran, however, attributed the action to pressure from the United States.TEHRAN - Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York has rejected claims by US intelligence officials that Tehran sought to influence the US presidential election, the official news agency IRNA reported on Tuesday.The remarks were made in a statement released on Monday after US intelligence officials earlier in the day claimed that Iran was working to "influence the US presidential election and undermine Donald Trump's bid to regain the White House", the report said.Iran's permanent mission stressed that Tehran had no objective or activity to influence the US election, adding a major part of such accusations were within the framework of the "psychological operations designed to artificially pep up election campaigns" in the United States.The US presidential election is scheduled for Nov 5, 2024.The international community has urged Israel not to escalate tensions in the Middle East after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was authorized to decide how the country should respond to a rocket strike that killed 12 youngsters in the annexed Golan Heights.Israeli officials and Lebanon-based Hezbollah group have accused each other of launching the fatal attack on Saturday at a soccer field in the predominantly Druze community in Majdal Shams.The tragedy has prompted Lebanon's Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib to demand an international investigation into the incident.On Sunday, Israel's security cabinet authorized Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to decide on the manner and timing of a response to the strike.Visiting the site of the deadly attack on Monday, Netanyahu vowed Israel would deliver a "severe response" to the rocket fire."These children are our children... The State of Israel will not, and cannot, let this pass. Our response will come and it will be severe," he said at the site of the attack, according to a statement issued by his office.The incident has added to concerns that months of cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah could spiral into a broader, more destructive war.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for restraint and warned against escalating violence in the region.European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned "this bloodbath" and "unacceptable incident", as he called for utmost restraint.French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned in the strongest terms the rocket attacks in his phone call with Netanyahu, saying that France was fully committed to avoid a new escalation in the region, The Times of Israel reported.British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said both he and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati agree that widening of conflict in the region "is in nobody's interest".The Syrian Foreign Ministry has accused Israel of the "brutal massacre" in Majdal Shams, stressing that holding Hezbollah responsible for the crime was part of Israel's "blatant attempts to fabricate pretexts" to continue aggression on the region as a whole, Syria's SANA News Agency reported.Caught up in violenceHaydar Oruc, a former researcher at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies in Turkiye, told China Daily the Druze people in Golan Heights, who are "not Israeli citizens", find themselves caught up in the violence in the region."It is considered to be part of Israel's attempt to draw the US into the field," Oruc said.The Golan Heights is Syrian territory occupied by Israel in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. Israel captured it in the Six-Day War in 1967, and annexed the territory in 1981. The Druze community in Israel is recognized as a separate religious entity whose culture is mostly Arab, according to the Jewish Virtual Library.In an interview on Sunday with local broadcaster Al-Jadeed, Bou Habib said the United States, France and others were trying to contain the escalation."Israel will escalate in a limited way and Hezbollah will respond in a limited way... These are the assurances we've received," he said.After Israel threatened reprisals, Air France and the German airline group Lufthansa said on Monday they were suspending flights to Beirut. Royal Jordanian also announced the suspension of flights, with at least two of its regular trips to Beirut canceled.The strike has raised fears of a wider conflict in the region, where tensions have intensified because of Israel's military assault in Gaza, which began more than nine months ago.Furkan Halit Yolcu, a researcher at Sakarya University Middle East Institute in Turkiye, said the prolonged Palestinian struggle to "merely survive on its inherited soil continues", and warned that if any major new conflict between Hezbollah and Israel starts, both parties will suffer huge losses involving "several dimensions".Agencies contributed to this story.JERUSALEM -- Israeli officials have called for retaliation against Hezbollah following a rocket attack on a football pitch in Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed at least 12 children and youths on Saturday. The Lebanese Shiite militant group has denied involvement.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Hezbollah "will pay a heavy price for this attack, one that it has not paid so far," according to a statement from his office. The attack "will not go unanswered," it added.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Spokesperson Daniel Hagari described the attack as the most severe on civilians since the October 7 assault by Hamas."Hezbollah is behind this disaster and is responsible for its consequences. We embrace the families of the dead and wounded," Hagari stated on social media platform X.However, Hezbollah denied any involvement, stating it had "absolutely nothing to do with the incident."Israeli military and security officials have presented Defense Minister Yoav Gallant with various options for action against Hezbollah. The Defense Ministry confirmed that Gallant has determined the courses of action but did not provide further details.A security cabinet meeting is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon in Tel Aviv, shortly after Netanyahu is set to arrive from Washington.Israeli President Issac Herzog called the rocket attack "heartbreaking," adding "Israel will firmly defend its citizens and its sovereignty."The Lebanese government also condemned "all acts of violence and aggression against civilians," calling the attack a violation of international law and humanity. The statement also urged an "immediate cessation of hostilities" following recent cross-border exchanges.The rocket struck a football pitch in Majdal Shams, causing around 30 injuries in addition to the fatalities. Magen David Adom, Israel's emergency service, reported that six of the injured were in serious condition.Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border have escalated since Oct. 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the previous day. Israel retaliated with heavy artillery fire into southeastern Lebanon.JERUSALEM -- Ten people, including children, were killed on Saturday in a rocket attack struck a football pitch in the Druze town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, according to Israeli media outlets.Helicopters, ambulances, and intensive care vehicles were dispatched to the scene, evacuating the injured to Ziv Medical Center, where at least 30 casualties were the result of the attack, reported Israeli state-owned broadcaster Kan."We arrived at the field and saw destruction and objects burning. Casualties were lying on the ground, and the sights were difficult to see," said Idan Avshalom, a senior medic at the Magen David Adom, the country's emergency medical service.Israeli media said that the rocket was fired from Lebanon by the Hezbollah militant group, while Hezbollah denied on Saturday evening that the Shiite group had "absolutely nothing to do with the incident."Following Hezbollah's denial, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that "following assessments carried out in the IDF and the intelligence available to us, the rocket fire at Majdal Shams was carried out by Hezbollah."Israel's Minister of Defense Yoav Galant, army chief Herzi Halevi, and other senior defense officials conducted an operational situation assessment following the attack, according to Kan.Israeli Prime Minister's Office said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, currently visiting the United States, has been informed of the incident's details and is holding security consultations with senior security officials.Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border have escalated since Oct. 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the previous day. Israel retaliated with heavy artillery fire into southeastern Lebanon.WASHINGTON -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid out a vague vision for post-conflict Gaza during his speech to the US Congress on Wednesday."The day after we defeat Hamas, a new Gaza could emerge," Netanyahu said. "My vision for that day is of a demilitarized and deradicalized Gaza.""Israel does not seek to resettle Gaza. But for the foreseeable future, we must retain overriding security control there to prevent the resurgence of terror, to ensure Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel," he told a joint meeting of the Congress."A new generation of Palestinians must no longer be taught to hate Jews but rather to live in peace with us," he added.Roughly 70 Democrats from the House and Senate boycotted Netanyahu's speech. The most notable was the absence of US Vice President Kamala Harris, who serves as president of the Senate.Outside the US Capitol and at Washington's Union Station, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in protest against Netanyahu's visit to the United States, demanding Washington stop military aid to Israel.As the war in Gaza enters its 10th month, at least 39,090 Palestinians have been killed and 90,147 others injured. Israel and Hamas have failed to reach a complete ceasefire agreement and a hostage release deal after multiple rounds of negotiations.People in the Gaza Strip have become exhausted by ongoing displacement and unlivable conditions, and are trapped in increasingly small and overcrowded areas, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said on Wednesday.The UN agency estimates that clearing the Gaza Strip of the 40-million-tonne rubble caused by Israel's war on the Palestinian enclave will take 15 years."Debris poses a deadly threat for people in the Gaza Strip as it can contain unexploded ordnance and harmful substances," it said.Maged Refaat Aboulmagd, an ambassador member of Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, said the fact that China has recently brought Palestinian factions to Beijing and managed to convince them to work together, is the kind of soft power that China needs to export to the world and exercise more and more. "We would love to have China more active also in these fields and beyond," he said.GAZA - The signing of a declaration on ending division and strengthening unity by 14 Palestinian factions in Beijing is "an additional positive step" toward achieving Palestinian national unity, Hamas said on Tuesday.The declaration's importance comes from the host country, said Hossam Badran, a member of Hamas's political bureau, in a statement."We are talking about the People's Republic of China with its international weight and its firm position in support of the Palestinian cause," Badran said.He expressed his "high appreciation for the great efforts made by China to reach this declaration", noting that this announcement came at an important time as Palestinians are facing an ongoing conflict, especially in the Gaza Strip.The solution represents "the ideal and most appropriate national solution" for the Palestinian situation after the conflict, he said.At China's invitation, senior representatives of 14 Palestinian factions held reconciliation talks in Beijing from July 21 to 23.International aid agencies and Arab nations have slammed the Israeli Parliament for giving preliminary approval for a bill labeling the United Nations agency serving Palestinian refugees as a "terrorist organization" — a move that will exacerbate the already dire conditions of humanitarian and other essential workers in Gaza.According to the Knesset website, the Knesset Plenum voted to approve on first reading the bill for "Cutting Off the State of Israel's Relations with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and Declaring it a Terrorist Organization, 2024".The bill proposed that the State of Israel "sever its relations with UNRWA, both directly and indirectly", and also strip off its personnel's immunity and privileges.Another bill proposes to prohibit the UNRWA from operating any mission, providing any service or conducting any activity within Israel's sovereign territory, accusing the agency of working in collaboration with Palestinian militant group Hamas for the "cruel massacre" that took place in Israel on Oct 7.The bills will be returned to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee for deliberation as two more readings are required for them to become effective.Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories, said on her X account that Israel's "disrespect and abuses against the UN" should have been addressed long ago. She said it had "gone too far" and called for unseating Israel at the UN.Jordanian Foreign Ministry spokesman Sufyan Qudah slammed the Israeli decision as an "attempt to kill the agency, assassinate it politically" and target its symbolism, which affirms the right of Palestinian refugees to return and get compensation under international law.'Premeditated hostility'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of Palestine said the Israeli Knesset's classification of the UNRWA as a "terrorist organization" is a "premeditated hostility that aims to dissolve the Palestine refugee issue and a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2730 (2024)". The ministry also described the latest development as part of a "systemic incitement campaign" carried out by Israel.A case in point, highlighted by UNRWA personnel, was the targeting of a UN aid convoy by the Israeli Defense Forces.Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of UNRWA, said on his X account that a UN vehicle received "at least five bullets while waiting just ahead of the Israeli Forces' checkpoint south of Wadi Gaza" on Sunday.Like all other similar UN movements, he said this one "was coordinated and approved by the Israeli authorities", adding that those responsible "must be held accountable".In February, Israeli forces said they had discovered a tunnel network hundreds of meters long and running partly under the UNRWA's Gaza headquarters. The Israelis said the network was new evidence of Hamas' exploitation of the aid agency for Palestinians. Israel had also accused some UN staff members of involvement in the Oct 7 attack.The allegations prompted several countries to halt funding to the UNRWA earlier this year. But a UN-backed independent review found that Israel had not provided credible evidence for its claims, and most donors, like Japan, Germany, Italy, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, have since reinstated funding.Arie Afriansyah, associate professor at the Faculty of Law at Universitas Indonesia, told China Daily that Israel's policy to categorize the UNRWA as a terrorist organization is "highly unusual in the context of international law".He said Israel's policy could endanger UNRWA's humanitarian workers. By labeling the UNRWA a terrorist organization, Israel "could effectively legitimize actions against its workers, making them targets for arrest, harassment, or worse".A new round of reconciliation talks among Palestinian groups was held in Beijing from Sunday to Tuesday, and a closing ceremony of the talks was held on Tuesday morning, according to the China Central Television.JERUSALEM - The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday that an Israeli delegation will visit Qatar later this week to resume negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange deal.Netanyahu held a lengthy discussion on Sunday with members of the negotiation team and senior security officials regarding the Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip, according to his office.The delegation, headed by Mossad chief David Barnea, will arrive in Doha on Thursday and engage in indirect negotiations brokered by Qatar and Egypt and supported by the United States.The new round of negotiations had been delayed for about a week after Hamas halted the talks in protest over an Israeli attack on Khan Younis on July 13, which killed at least 90 Palestinians.Previous rounds of talks in Qatar have so far failed to produce an agreement to end the more than nine months of conflict in Gaza, with both sides blaming each other for the deadlock."Mom, if I excel in my exams next year, could we visit the United Arab Emirates?" asked 11-year-old He Yuda at the May Fourth Square in downtown Qingdao on Saturday.The boy was among Chinese tourists taking pictures with UAE performers showcasing the traditional Al-Razfa dance, a popular art featuring about 20 performers clad in white robes, brandishing delicate bamboo canes and replica rifles, moving in sync to the rhythmic beat of drums."Sure we can," said the mother as her son enters sixth grade in September. They are interested in the UAE's exotic culture and intrigued by such content on Douyin, she said.Omar Alshehhi, an Emirati performer, said: "Everyone I met in Qingdao was nice; it will be an unforgettable experience. I like the cool weather in this modern city with many skyscrapers."Their performance marked one of the festivities commemorating the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the UAE, with Qingdao as the inaugural venue. The three-day event concluded on Sunday.The UAE has emerged as China's largest trading partner in the Arab region. Since 1984, the two countries have made significant advancements across various sectors, with non-oil trade soaring nearly 800-fold, according to the UAE embassy."Qingdao, a captivating coastal city, holds a special allure for Emiratis," said Hussain bin Ibrahim Al Hammadi, the UAE's ambassador to China. He highlighted the extensive exchanges between the UAE and Qingdao in trade, tourism and culture.The state visit by UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to China in late May has paved the way for further strengthening UAE-China ties, he said, as the joint statement vows a bilateral trade volume of $200 billion by 2030.He credited the countries' successes to visionary leadership, efficient governance and the unwavering commitment of both people toward a prosperous future."Our collaboration has reached unprecedented heights, with these shared values serving as the pillars of our achievements and future partnership," he said. He also said similar celebrations will be held this year in various Chinese cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing.Noting that both countries are participants in the Belt and Road Initiative, Zhang Hui, deputy secretary of the Communist Party of China Qingdao Municipal Committee, said Qingdao will leverage its status as a cultural and tourism hub to bolster exchanges with the UAE.With the strengthening ties, there has also been a growing enthusiasm among Emiratis for Chinese culture.Zhuo Jiameng, chief representative of Dubai Chamber's Shanghai office, noted a growing trend of her UAE colleagues studying Chinese and using it on social media platforms such as WeChat."We aim for a sustainable exchange and such mutual cultural understanding is vital for our business endeavors," she said.The International Court of Justice's historic decision ruling Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories as "illegal" has been widely welcomed by Middle East, Asian and Western leaders, strengthening the case to end the conflict and work toward a two-state solution.However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – currently facing domestic pressure at home to reach a cease-fire deal before departing for the United States this week – has slammed it as "absurd", adding that no opinion from The Hague "can deny the historical truth or legal right of Israelis" to live in their "ancestral home".The court's 83-page report titled "Legal Consequences Arising From The Policies And Practices Of Israel In The Occupied Palestinian Territory, Including East Jerusalem" issued on July 19 concluded that Israel's broad policies in its "capacity as an occupying power" constituted systemic discrimination against the Palestinians.The decision also came just a day after the Knesset, or Israel's parliament, rejected a resolution establishing Palestinian Statehood, which itself was criticized widely.The ICJ also considered that Israel's policies and practices obstructed the right of the Palestinian to determine its political status and to pursue its economic, social and cultural development. It also ruled that Israel's occupation of the West Bank is in violation of international law.In a statement, Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, said that the ICJ's legal opinion "confirms and reinforces the Palestinian people's attainment of their legitimate and legal rights in accordance with international and United Nations resolutions to regain the Palestinian territories seized by the Israeli occupation forces."He pointed out that the settlement decisions and attempts to change the geography carried out by the Israeli army are illegitimate measures that do not enjoy any regional or international recognition, stressing that the seized Palestinian territories will "remain Palestinian and an inherent right of the Palestinian people".Albudaiwi also reiterated the GCC's support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state within the borders of June 4, 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The GCC comprises the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait.Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said in a statement that the ICJ's advisory opinion constituted "a key legal pillar in supporting the Palestinian narrative and boosting its legitimacy and credibility".He also said it helped counter Israel's attempts "to blur the lines around the nature and origin of the conflict to tighten its grip on the Occupied Palestinian Territory".In its statement, the European Union said the ICJ's conclusions "are largely consistent with EU positions", which were themselves "fully aligned on UN resolutions regarding the status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory"."In a world of constant and increasing violations of international law, it is our moral duty to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to all ICJ decisions in a consistent manner, irrespective of the subject in question," the statement said."The ICJ Advisory Opinion will need to be analyzed more thoroughly, including in view of its implications for EU policy," it added.Countries who backed the ICJ's decision included Belgium, Iceland, Norway, Ireland, Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt.Omar Awadallah, Palestine's assistant foreign minister for the UN and Specialized Agencies and part of the delegation to the court sessions, said that the "historic" advisory opinion was "not only for the question of Palestine, but for justice and for all the legal system" as he believed that this determination "will help in achieving justice and stability in the region if it's implemented".He stressed this was why it was important to work with the international community, with the UN, and other states toward imposing a mechanism toward ending this Israeli occupation."Our move will be toward countries bilaterally. That means that we will be working with states toward taking irreversible steps, toward taking actions by putting consequences on this illegal occupation by not assessed or render aid or recognizing the illegality that Israel is doing and consolidating in the occupied Palestinian territories," Awadallah told China Daily.He said there were many things to be done whether at the UN General Assembly or the UN Security Council level or any other organ within the UN Human Rights Council, and other bodies in the UN toward implementing this important and significant and landmark advisory opinion."We believe that the court said that they did what they had to do on moral and legal basis and it's time for the international community to act on these moral and legal bases to end this illegality," said Awadallah.Hassan Ben Imran, board member at Law for Palestine, a nonprofit human rights organization, praised the court's advisory opinion as "good" as it offered several legal grounds for Palestinians "to further their legal struggle for freedom and liberation"."However, it should be noted that there is no expectation that Israel would comply with it. Israel has given absolutely no reason to believe in a fraction of that," Imran told China Daily."Therefore, the only way forward is imposing sanctions, economic, political and military ones, on Israel. Israel's membership at the UN and other international fora, like the FIFA for instance, should be suspended," he added.RAMALLAH - Palestine has rejected an Israeli-US proposal to temporarily reopen the Rafah border crossing, calling instead for an Israeli withdrawal and the establishment of Palestinian sovereignty, an official source told Xinhua on Wednesday.A meeting was held last week involving representatives from Palestine, the United States, and Israel to explore the possibility of operating the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, according to the source who requested anonymity.The Israeli side proposed that six Palestinian employees participate in managing the crossing without uniforms or police, and without raising the Palestinian flag, said the source in a statement sent to Xinhua.The source explained that the proposal was rejected because it aimed to open the crossing temporarily without Palestinian sovereignty, which contradicts the Palestinian position and international agreements.According to the source, the Palestinian stance is in line with the 2005 agreement on the Rafah crossing, which requires Palestinian sovereignty, European participation, and a full Israeli withdrawal from the crossing.The meeting concluded after the Israeli-US proposal was rejected by the Palestinians, and there has been no further dialogue following the meeting, said the source.The meeting is considered the first between Israel and representatives of the Palestinian Authority to discuss the future of Gaza after the ongoing conflict.On May 7, the Israeli army announced the imposition of "operational" control over the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, which led to the cessation of aid delivery from Egypt into Gaza through the crossing.GAZA - The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said Wednesday that it is struggling to prevent the spread of diseases among displaced people in the Gaza Strip."High temperatures, severe overcrowding, water scarcity, and a severe shortage of personal hygiene and cleaning supplies such as soap, shampoo, and disinfectants lead to an increase in skin infections and bacterial contamination among the displaced," the UNRWA said on social media platform X.The UN agency said it is making great efforts to control the spread of this infection and prevent the exacerbation of similar cases through its health centers, despite the limited resources and lack of treatments in its warehouses.The agency stressed the necessity to reach a ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible.During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 81 people and wounded 198 others, bringing the total death toll to 38,794 and injuries to 89,364 since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out in early October 2023, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Wednesday.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage.Arab leaders are rallying for the need to activate international accountability mechanisms in the face of Israel's continued aggressions, including the bombing of UN agency-aided schools and "safe zones", as they renewed calls for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.In the last 24 hours, Israel's military had bombed a UN-run school as well as a "safe zone" it designated in the Gaza Strip, leaving at least 42 Palestinians dead while wounding dozens.The attacks on Tuesday hit the UN's Al-Razi School in the central Nuseirat refugee camp and a main street lined with market stalls in the southern Al-Mawasi area, where thousands of displaced Palestinians had sought shelter.At least 25 people were killed in Al-Razi while 17 were killed in Al-Mawasi, according to Gaza's government media office while more than 70 people were injured in the attacks.Earlier, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, noted that 70 percent of its schools in Gaza have been hit and bombed since the start of the conflict on Oct 7.Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of UNRWA, said on his X account that at least eight schools were hit in the last 10 days, including six UNRWA schools."All rules of war have been broken in Gaza. Losing our common humanity must not become the new norm," said Lazzarini.The Israel Defense Forces said on X that based on precise intelligence, the IDF "struck terrorists who operated in a UNRWA school in the area of Nuseirat".International organization Save the Children said on its X account that the recent attacks on schools and hospitals in Gaza were "horrific" as the "healthcare and education systems are being decimated before our eyes". It said children "cannot continue to be at the forefront of this conflict" and reiterated that hospitals and schools should never be targets.The Saudi Cabinet, led by Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, condemned the "continuation of genocidal massacres against the Palestinian people", reiterating the demand for an immediate and permanent cease-fire and protection of unarmed civilians, the Saudi Press Agency reported.Necessity stressedFurther, it stressed the necessity of activating international accountability mechanisms.Speaking to reporters at a joint news conference during his visit to Luxembourg on Tuesday, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi urged the United States, the European Union, and the global community to "come together and stand by international law, international humanitarian law, and by the rights of all peoples to live in peace and security, including the Palestinians".Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi briefed his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on Tuesday on Egypt's mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas, while he stressed the need for uniting international efforts to ensure the success of mediation and to deliver adequate humanitarian aid to the battered enclave.Egyptian and Qatari mediators, as well as US negotiators, reconvened over the past week in hopes of reaching a cease-fire agreement, which would include the prisoner swap deal between Israel and Hamas, but blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the delay over his "new conditions".Belal Alakhras, a political analyst and Palestinian researcher at the University of Malaya in Malaysia, said the "issue" was that the world "has treated Israel as more than just an occupying force"."We're on the edge of global chaos. This situation shouldn't be left to the calculus of the United States on whether it will allow Israel to continue this war or not. Other major global powers need to step up and ramp up pressure before it's too late," Alakhras told China Daily.Contact the writers at jan@chinadailyapac.com. TEHRAN - Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani said Tuesday that the new administration's foreign policy would emphasize promoting multilateralism in line with the United Nations Charter and international law.Speaking at a UN Security Council meeting in New York, Bagheri Kani outlined the diplomatic stance of Iran's President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian, according to a statement from Iran's foreign ministry.The Iranian top diplomat stressed that Pezeshkian's administration aims to "open new horizons and expand friendly relations with other governments based on dialogue, cooperation, equality, and mutual respect".Pezeshkian was declared Iran's next president on July 6 after winning a runoff against Saeed Jalili, a former chief nuclear negotiator.Bagheri Kani added that Iran supports initiatives promoting multilateralism, respect for international law, and the goals of the UN Charter.Describing multilateralism as key to addressing global threats and challenges, Bagheri Kani criticized unilateral sanctions, calling them "extreme and inhumane" manifestations of unilateralism.He insisted that the United States and its Western allies should be held accountable for the suffering caused by these sanctions, including in Iran.Bagheri Kani headed a delegation that left Tehran for New York on Monday to attend UN Security Council meetings focused on the escalating situation in the Middle East.Palestinian militant group Hamas has dismissed reports that it has withdrawn from Gaza ceasefire negotiations amid continued Israeli attacks, which killed about 90 civilians in strikes over the weekend, with the excuse it is targeting Hamas military commanders.Meanwhile, families of Israeli hostages have slammed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for putting the progress of truce talks at risk, following the massive strike that was directed at the Al-Mawasi area near Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Saturday.Israel and Hamas have been trying to reach a cease-fire deal for months through mediators Egypt, Qatar and the United States. The parties reconvened in Doha and Cairo last week.Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said in a statement on Sunday that reports of a decision to stop negotiations in response to the Al-Mawasi massacre were "baseless", accusing the Netanyahu government of "trying to obstruct reaching an agreement to stop the aggression on Gaza".The Times of Israel reported that thousands of people rallied outside Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem on Saturday, calling for a hostage deal. Einav Zangauker, mother of 24-year-old hostage Matan Zangauker, accused Netanyahu of "time after time, trying to separate me from Matan".Netanyahu's office released a statement on Saturday reiterating the prime minister's conditions before halting the fighting with Hamas."Victory will be achieved when we eliminate the military and governing capabilities of Hamas, bring all of our hostages back home, ensure that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel, and return our residents in the south and the north securely to their homes," Netanyahu said.He appealed to the families of the hostages for their patience and understanding, while acknowledging their "suffering".The Israel Defense Forces confirmed in a post on X that Rafa'a Salameh, whom they said was one of the masterminds of the Oct 7 attack against Israel, has been "eliminated". It was also reported that 90 Palestinians were killed and 300 others were wounded in the process.Among the casualties initially reported were Mohammed Deif, commander of Hamas' military wing, and Salameh, commander of Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade. Both were said to have been the target of the strikes. But a Hamas official insisted that Deif was "fine".Shocked by lossFollowing the deadly weekend strikes, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Saturday that Guterres was "shocked and saddened by the loss of lives".Dujarric noted reports that the attack had taken place in a densely populated area "designated as a humanitarian zone sheltering displaced people", underscoring there was nowhere safe in Gaza.Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, denounced in a statement "the brutal bombardment by the Israeli occupation forces on the Al-Mawasi area", stressing that this shelling is "evidence of the series of systematic and ongoing Israeli crimes against the brotherly Palestinian people".The Organization of Islamic Cooperation said the "massacre "on Saturday was "a continuation of the crime of genocide the Israeli occupation has been carrying out against Palestinian civilians in flagrant defiance of the UN resolutions and the injunctions of the International Court of Justice". It renewed calls on the UN Security Council and the international community to assume their responsibility toward ending the nine-month conflict."The war has reached a point where there is a universal desire for peace. ... Mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United States have thus far failed to secure an agreement for the release of hostages," Arhama Siddiqa, a research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan, told China Daily.She said Netanyahu's recent call for Israel to retain control along the Gaza-Egypt border, in the belief that Hamas is weakening, "is seen as an irresponsible move likely to squander a potentially unrepeatable opportunity for peace"."Such tactics are viewed as diversionary efforts to stall the peace process and force Hamas into submission, allowing Netanyahu to save face and possibly retain some semblance of political clout," Siddiqa said.TEHRAN - Iran "looks forward to more extensive" cooperation with China, said President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian in an article published on Saturday.Pezeshkian said China, along with Russia, had consistently stood by Iran during challenging times, adding, "We deeply value this friendship."The article titled "My Message to the New World" is published in Iran's English language daily Tehran Times.Pointing to a long-term comprehensive cooperation agreement signed between Iran and China in March 2021, Pezeshkian noted, "Our 25-year roadmap with China represents a significant milestone towards establishing a mutually beneficial comprehensive strategic partnership, and we look forward to collaborating more extensively with Beijing as we advance towards a new global order."He hailed China for its "constructive vision and forward-thinking approach to international affairs", stressing that in 2023, China played a "pivotal role" in facilitating the normalization of relations between Tehran and Riyadh after a seven-year diplomatic freeze.In the article, Pezeshkian vowed that his administration would pursue an "opportunity-driven policy" by creating balance in relations with all states, consistent with the country's national interests, economic development, and requirements of regional and global peace and security."We will prioritize strengthening relations with our neighbors," he said, adding that his administration's other foreign policy priorities would include fostering mutually beneficial relations with emerging international players in the Global South, especially African nations, as well as Latin American states.Pezeshkian was announced as Iran's next president on July 6 following his victory in a runoff against Saeed Jalili, a former chief nuclear negotiator.SANAA - Yemen's armed Houthi group on Sunday claimed responsibility for missile and drone attacks against an Israeli ship in the Gulf of Aden and the Israeli city of Eilat."The armed forces targeted the Israeli ship, MSC UNIFIC, in the Gulf of Aden," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a televised statement aired by the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV.The group also attacked "military targets" of the Israeli city of Eilat with drones, he added.The spokesman reiterated that the group will continue attacking Israeli targets until the war on Gaza stops.Meanwhile, the US Central Command said its forces had destroyed two drones and one unmanned boat in the Red Sea in the past 24 hours, according to a statement on social media platform X.Earlier in the day, the Houthi television reported that the US-British naval coalition conducted two airstrikes against the Hodeidah airport in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah.Last November, the Houthis began to launch anti-ship ballistic missiles and drones targeting what they said were Israeli-linked ships transiting the Red Sea to show solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi said in a televised speech last week that his group had targeted "a total of 166 ships linked to Israel, US, and Britain".In response, the US-British naval coalition stationed in the waters has since January conducted air raids and missile strikes against Houthi targets to deter the group, but this only led to an expansion of Houthi attacks to include US and British commercial and military ships.DAMASCUS - The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates cautioned on Sunday that Israeli attacks on Syrian soil could lead to uncontrollable consequences and serious repercussions.In a statement released hours after Israeli missile attacks on a residential neighborhood in the Syrian capital of Damascus and military sites, the ministry reaffirmed Syria's legitimate right to defend its sovereignty and liberate its occupied land through all legitimate means guaranteed by international law.The ministry warned against the escalation of Israeli attacks on Syrian soil, adding that persistent international silence regarding such attacks would undermine the ability of the international system to confront violations of its charter and international laws.Israeli strikes in Damascus earlier in the day resulted in casualties among the Syrian military and fires in the targeted areas, as reported by the Syrian Ministry of Defense and relevant sources.The Defense Ministry said a military personnel was killed, and three others were injured during the attacks.The ministry added that the attacks were launched from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan and aimed at several military sites in the southern region and a residential building in the Kafr Sousa area of Damascus.The Syrian air defense systems responded to the "enemy's missiles" and shot down a considerable number of them, the ministry said.GAZA - At least 71 Palestinians were killed and 289 others injured on Saturday by an Israeli airstrike that attacked tents of displaced people in the Mawasi area of the Khan Younis city in the south of Gaza, the Gaza health authorities said.With three missiles, Israeli jets bombed the tents housing displaced people in Khan Younis, and then a civil defense vehicle was targeted, local and security sources told Xinhua.Dozens of bodies of the killed and wounded people were lying on the ground, locals told Xinhua.The Israeli raid targeted a large gathering of displaced people in Mawasi, the Gaza Civil Defense Service reported in a brief statement.Meanwhile, Israeli state-owned Kan TV news said that the target of the Israeli attack on the Mawasi area was Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, noting that the army was awaiting the results of the raid.Hamas rejected the claim, saying it comes in the context of covering up Israel's crimes. BEIRUT -- A Hezbollah member was killed and two civilians injured on Friday in Israeli airstrikes and artillery shelling targeting several border areas in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanese military sources.The sources, who spoke anonymously, said Israel's drones and warplanes carried out eight airstrikes on six border towns and villages, while its artillery bombed 14 other towns and villages with more than 45 shells.One of the raids targeted a house in the village of Taybeh, killing a Hezbollah member named Ali Hassan Nahla, said the sources, adding that a worker of Bangladeshi nationality was wounded in the Israeli shelling of Al-Wazzani village.They continued that an Israeli drone fired two air-to-surface missiles at a motorcycle traveling on the road between Al-Wazzani and Rachaya Al-Fakhar in the eastern sector of the border area, seriously injuring its driver, who was then sent to hospital.Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border escalated on Oct. 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the day before. Israel then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.The violent confrontations between Hezbollah and the Israeli army have intensified recently, as the latter announced "its approval of operational plans for an attack on Lebanon."Meanwhile, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah warned that no place in Israel "will be safe" from his party's missiles in the event of an outbreak of war.A group of independent experts and special rapporteurs of the United Nations have said famine was now gripping the Gaza Strip as children die from malnutrition amid Israel's alleged starvation campaign as bombings of schools continued."We declare that Israel's intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence and has resulted in famine across all of Gaza. We call upon the international community to prioritize the delivery of humanitarian aid by land by any means necessary, end Israel's siege, and establish a cease-fire," said experts for the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in a statement on Tuesday.Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva slammed the famine statement, saying the UN experts were as much accustomed to spreading "misinformation" as they were to supporting "Hamas propaganda", the Times of Israel reported.Israel's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories, or COGAT, which implements the government's civilian policy within the territories of Judea and Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, posted on its X account on Monday that they were committed to collaborating closely with international partners to meet urgent humanitarian needs of civilians "despite our war with Hamas".The independent experts highlighted the deaths of Fayez Ataya, who was barely 6 months old when he died on May 30, and 13-year-old Abdulqader al-Serhi, who died at the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah on June 1. These were followed by the death of Ahmad Abu Reida, 9, on June 3 in the tent sheltering his displaced family in Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis.All three died from malnutrition and lack of access to adequate healthcare. With the deaths of these children from starvation despite medical treatment in central Gaza, there is "no doubt that famine has spread from northern Gaza into central and southern Gaza", the experts said.Further, they noted that the death of a child from malnutrition and dehydration indicated that the health and social structures "have critically weakened".Al Jazeera reported on Wednesday that at least 30 Palestinians were killed in Gaza after Israel struck a school housing civilians in Khan Younis. The report noted it was the fourth attack on schools in as many days and following Israel's most recent mass evacuation orders for parts of Khan Younis and Gaza City. The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating from within the schools, which Hamas denied.Acute malnutritionThe UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees on June 15 had earlier said that more than 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition.The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification's acute food insecurity analysis conducted in December 2023 had warned of a risk that famine may occur by the end of May 2024, affecting an estimated 1.11 million people.It noted in its latest report on June 25 that the amount of food deliveries and nutrition services provided to the northern governorates increased, temporarily alleviating conditions there. In this context, the report said, available evidence does not indicate that famine is currently occurring.But it said a high risk of famine persists across the entire Gaza Strip "as long as the conflict continues and humanitarian access is restricted". It said about 96 percent of the population in the Gaza Strip, or 2.15 million people, face high levels of acute food insecurity through September 2024."While the whole territory is classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), over 495,000 people (22 percent of the population) are still facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 5)," the report said.Maysa Saleh, the Norwegian Refugee Council's Education Officer in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, in her update on Monday said that food remains "the number one worry".She noted that only last week, there were no vegetables on the market besides some aubergines, tomatoes and onions. Tinned food was diminishing in both quality and quantity.European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on his X account that it "is imperative to immediately reach a cease-fire to bring respite to hundreds of stranded civilians, free all the hostages, deliver the needed humanitarian aid".Special rapporteurs, independent experts and working groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent of any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity. RAMALLAH -- Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa on Wednesday called for a unified Palestine under a single authority and government once a ceasefire is reached in Gaza.During a meeting with UN officials, consuls, and ambassadors in Ramallah, Mustafa emphasized the need for unity and cooperation."The day after the war ends, Palestine must be unified under one authority and one government, working with partners as one team with one plan. There can be no undefined transitional period that would create more complexity and chaos," Mustafa said, according to a statement from his office sent to Xinhua.Mustafa urged international partners, donors, and UN institutions to closely coordinate with the Palestinian government to ensure swift recovery and address urgent humanitarian needs resulting from the conflict in Gaza and its repercussions in the West Bank.He highlighted the Palestinian Authority's longstanding responsibility for providing essential services such as healthcare, education, water, and electricity to Gaza residents despite Israeli deductions from Palestinian funds.Delegations from Egypt, the United States, Qatar, and Israel met on Wednesday in Qatar's capital Doha to resume the Gaza truce talks.Also on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed his country's commitment to a potential ceasefire agreement during a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden's special envoy to the Middle East, Brett McGurk, in Jerusalem.Netanyahu assured McGurk of his "commitment to the deal as long as Israeli red lines are maintained," according to a statement from his office.Iran's new administration looks forward to enhancing relations with China and others as the country rides on fruits of cooperation from the first year of membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, or SCO, according to officials and diplomats.Nasser Kanaani, spokesman for Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in Monday's news conference that Iran would continue to pursue mutual relations with China, one of the most important countries in the world.Commenting on the future of the relations between Teheran and Beijing in view of Masoud Pezeshkian's election as Iran's new president, Kanaani expressed hope that Iran's relations with friendly countries, including China, would be further promoted.He said Iran's foreign policy was based on promoting constructive interaction with all those countries that were ready to, in a reciprocal and constructive approach while observing mutual respect, work toward the expansion of bilateral ties, Xinhua News Agency reported."China and Iran are both important developing countries and both adhere to true multilateralism," Chinese Ambassador to Iran Cong Peiwu said in an article in the Tehran Times on Monday."Since Iran successfully joined the SCO one year ago, it has actively participated in various cooperation under the SCO framework and achieved fruitful results," Cong said.Iran's entry into the SCO has injected new vitality into it, which is in line with the expectations of the international community and the common interests of emerging market countries and developing countries, he said.China stands ready to work with Iran and other SCO partners under the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, enhance solidarity and mutual trust, build consensus on cooperation, expand cooperation across the board, actively participate in global governance, and advance the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative to "contribute more SCO strength to the lasting peace and common prosperity" of the world, according to Cong.Speaking at the SCO Green Development Forum held in Qingdao on Monday, Ali Salajegheh, head of Iran's Department of Environment, said that SCO members using their capacities can make a difference for green development in the region, as well as become a perfect model for environmental cooperation at the global level, according to IRNA news agency."Developing countries should make sure of their social and economic development as the main priority, because the fight against poverty and the development of health and the provision of housing and energy is still a significant part of the developing world," Salajegheh said.Spokesman Kanaani further spoke about promoting cultural, trade and political relations with neighboring countries, and resuming ties with some regional states with which the country's relations had been severed.Pezeshkian, a reformist and former health minister, was declared president on Saturday following a runoff election against principlist Saeed Jalili.Xinhua contributed to this story.GAZA - At least 25 Palestinians were killed and some others wounded in an Israeli airstrike targeting a school in the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources said Tuesday.Security sources told Xinhua that Israeli aircraft targeted the gate of the Al-Awda School, which houses hundreds of displaced people in the town of Abasan al-Kabira, east of Khan Younis, using at least one missile.The videos shared by Palestinian activists on the social media platform Facebook showed dozens of bodies lying on the ground, covered in blood.Medical sources said the Israeli airstrike killed at least 25 people, including women and children, and wounded dozens in varying degrees.The sources told Xinhua that the number of victims is expected to rise due to the overcrowding in the area.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Wednesday that using precise munition, the Israeli Air Force struck a terrorist from Hamas' military wing who took part in the Hamas rampage in southern Israel last year, among other terrorist activities.The IDF is looking into the reports that civilians were harmed, adjacent to the Al-Awda School, which is located near the location of the strike, it added.Israel has been launching a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage.The Hamas-run health authorities said on Tuesday the total Palestinian death toll in Gaza has climbed to 38,243 since the outbreak of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.TEHRAN - Iran's President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday exchanged views on the promotion of bilateral relations, according to the official news agency IRNA.In a phone call, the two sides voiced their countries' readiness to sign a comprehensive cooperation agreement on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit in Russia's Kazan in late October.Pezeshkian said Iran attached great importance to its relations with friendly and neighboring countries and would undoubtedly strengthen such ties.He added his administration would be focused on following up on and implementing the bilateral agreements reached during the term of Iran's late President Ebrahim Raisi, who lost his life in a helicopter crash on May 19.Pezeshkian described it as important cooperation between the two countries within the frameworks of regional and international organizations, coalitions and treaties, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS and the Eurasian Economic Union.He said the documents pertaining to the comprehensive cooperation agreement between Tehran and Moscow had been finalized and Iran was prepared to sign them on the sidelines of the upcoming BRICS summit.For his part, the Russian president congratulated Pezeshkian on his election as Iran's ninth president, wishing him success in fulfilling his new responsibility.Putin said the bilateral relations were at the highest level, hoping that bilateral ties would continue during Iran's next administration by implementing the agreements reached between the two sides in Raisi's term.He pointed to expanding bilateral relations, especially in the energy and transportation sectors, inviting Pezeshkian to attend the upcoming BRICS summit.Putin assured that Russia was ready to sign the comprehensive cooperation agreement with Iran on the sidelines of the Kazan summit.Pezeshkian was announced as Iran's next president on Saturday following his victory in a runoff against Saeed Jalili, a former chief nuclear negotiator.GAZA - Hamas has made urgent contacts with mediators, warning that the Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip would return the ceasefire negotiating process to point zero, the movement said on Monday.Considering the ongoing threats by the Israeli army to large neighborhoods of Gaza City, and the killings and displacement it is carrying out, the head of Hamas's political bureau Ismail Haniyeh has made urgent contacts with mediators, Hamas said in a statement.Haniyeh warned of the repercussions of Israel's operations in Gaza City, Rafah and other areas across the Strip, noting that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli army would bear full responsibility for the collapse of the negotiation path, the statement added.On Sunday and Monday, the Israeli military instructed tens of thousands of people residing in 19 blocs in Gaza City to immediately evacuate, according to a report published by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Monday.As of Monday, Al Ahli Baptist Hospital and the Patients Friends Association Hospital were evacuated, in fear of intensified military activities that would render them inaccessible or non-functional, and critical patients were transferred to the Indonesian and Kamal Adwan Hospitals in North Gaza governorate, it added.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Monday that following intelligence indicating the presence of Hamas and Islamic Jihad infrastructure, operatives, weapons, and investigation and detention rooms in Gaza City, the army began an operation in the area overnight."With the start of the operation, the IDF called on and warned civilians about the operational activity in the area, and a defined route will be opened to facilitate the evacuation of uninvolved civilians from the area," it added.Hamas signaled last week that it had dropped a key demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before the group would sign an agreement, raising hopes for progress in the internationally brokered negotiations, according to media reports.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage.During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 40 people and wounded 75 others, bringing the total death toll to 38,193 and injuries to 87,903 since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Monday.UNITED NATIONS - UN humanitarians said on Monday 90 percent of Gazans were displaced, some multiple times, as more evacuations ordered and poor or no security hampers aid and fuel deliveries.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the Israeli military instructed on Sunday and Monday tens of thousands of people living in 19 blocs of apartments in Gaza City to evacuate immediately. On Sunday, some residents were ordered to evacuate to western Gaza City, while the order on Monday included areas that people had fled to a day earlier and instructed them to evacuate to shelters in Deir al Balah."The two directly affected areas encompass 13 health facilities that were recently functional, including two hospitals, two primary healthcare centers and nine medical points," OCHA said, adding that 13 out of 36 hospitals in the Gaza Strip are only partially functional.The office said that with nine out of every 10 people estimated to be displaced in Gaza, new waves of displacement are mainly affecting people who have already been displaced multiple times, only to find themselves forced to flee again under shelling. They were forced to reset their lives repeatedly without any of their belongings or any prospect of finding safety or reliable access to essential services."People, especially children, spend long hours queueing to collect water each day," OCHA said. "Access to emergency health care is also a challenge, particularly given limited communications coverage to contact emergency services, high transportation costs to reach hospitals (26 US dollars roundtrip) and the long walking distance of at least 3 kilometers to reach the nearest medical point."In northern Gaza, the aid partners especially highlighted the lack of safe shelters for up to 80,000 IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons) who were forced to hastily flee from Shuja'iyeh and other parts of eastern Gaza City following evacuation orders in late June. Many were found sleeping amid solid waste and rubble, with no mattresses or enough clothing, and some had sought shelter in partially destroyed UN facilities and residential buildings.The Israeli military designated these same areas as evacuation zones, forcing many of the same families, including young children and the elderly, to go through successive waves of displacement over the past two weeks, the office said.OCHA said that insecurity, damaged roads, the breakdown of law and order, and access limitations continue to hamper movement along the main humanitarian cargo route between Kerem Shalom crossing and Khan Younis and Deir al Balah."This has resulted in critical shortages of fuel and aid commodities to sustain humanitarian operations, in addition to increasing the risk of spoilage and infestation of stranded supplies (especially food) due to extremely high temperatures," the office said.The humanitarians said the Food Security Sector (FSS) reports that the shortages forced partners to provide reduced food rations in central and southern Gaza in June and undermined their ability to keep bakeries and community kitchens running.According to OCHA, only seven out of the 18 bakeries supported by humanitarian partners remain operational in Gaza, all in Deir al Balah, and six bakeries already working at partial capacity have now been forced to completely cease operations due to the lack of fuel.The office said that in the absence of cooking gas and a stable flow of food supplies, community kitchens are also struggling to operate, resulting in a reduced number of cooked meals prepared throughout Gaza. As of the end of June, about 600,000 cooked meals prepared in 190 kitchens were distributed daily to families across the strip, compared to more than 700,000 in the first half of June.OCHA said it meant that displaced households rely on burning wood and plastic from furniture and waste to cook, exacerbating health risks and environmental hazards.As for cooking, humanitarian partners said they continue to distribute wheat flour and canned food that enter northern Gaza through the Erez West crossing. No commercial trucks have been entering the area for months.A joint assessment by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the UN Satellite Centre estimated that about 57 percent of Gaza's cropland and one-third of its greenhouses were damaged.The FSS reported a near-total lack of protein sources, such as meat and poultry, on the local market, and only a few types of locally produced vegetables are available at unaffordable prices.The sector reported that continued military operations in Rafah and recent displacement from eastern Khan Younis, where significant agricultural production was concentrated before the war, have resulted in additional damage to greenhouses. It forced more people to leave their farms unattended, further destabilizing food systems.OCHA said that on Friday, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) reported that its teams at Nasser Medical Complex were "running on emergency medical stocks" and all departments were overwhelmed by patients, far exceeding available bed capacity.MSF said the Nasser Medical Complex is the main site on which field hospitals rely to sterilize their equipment, and if the facility is left without electricity, several field hospitals will also cease functioning.It said the hospital has been unable to bring any medical supplies into Gaza since the end of April, including most recently on Wednesday when the Israeli authorities denied trucks carrying MSF medical aid entry into the Gaza Strip due to ongoing hostilities.The cease-fire talks between Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel have seen its momentum dented after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a list of "nonnegotiable" conditions in relation to Israel's objectives in Gaza, despite international calls amid heavy casualties and humanitarian disasters.The news came after Hamas delivered its acceptance of three-phase arrangements to negotiator countries, the United States, Egypt and Qatar, while Israel continued its bombardment in Gaza, with Palestinian families fleeing their homes and hospitals and Israeli settlers bulldozing the northern entrance of Palestinian city Salfit in the occupied West Bank, Wafa News Agency reported.Late on July 7, Netanyahu presented a list of Israeli demands just as the Israeli negotiating team was preparing to depart for further talks in Cairo and Doha expected later this week.According to a statement published on the Israeli prime minister's website, it was Netanyahu's "steadfast position" against the attempt to halt Israel Defense Forces' action in Rafah that "led Hamas to enter negotiations".It noted that any deal would allow Israel to resume fighting "until all of objectives of the war have been achieved". There would also be "no smuggling of weapons to Hamas from Egypt to the Gaza border" and no return of "thousands of armed terrorists to the northern Gaza Strip".Also, Israel would "maximize the number of living hostages who will be released from Hamas captivity"."The plan that has been agreed to by Israel and which has been welcomed by (United States President Joe Biden) will allow Israel to (retrieve) hostages without infringing on the other objectives of the war," said the statement.Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, on his X account, questioned the timing of what he referred to as "provocative messages" from the Netanyahu government, pointing out that all parties were in "a critical moment in the negotiations" and that "the lives of the (Israeli) abductees depend on it".Losing faithSoon after Netanyahu's announcement, The Times of Israel reported that Sharon Alony Cunio, a freed hostage whose husband was still being held in Gaza, said she was "losing faith"."I was very optimistic, but as the days pass you suddenly notice that the messages that come out are more focused on the gaps (between the sides)," she was quoted as telling Army Radio. "Don't jeopardize the deal with statements."Cunio, along with her 3-year-old twin daughters, was freed from Gaza in November following an Israel-Hamas prisoner swap deal.The Times of Israel also reported that the statement from Netanyahu's office was met with anger by Israeli security officials and mediators who reportedly accused the prime minister of trying to sabotage the deal.It was widely reported over the weekend that Hamas had dropped a demand that Israel first commit to a permanent cease-fire before signing the agreement, and accepted a proposal from Washington to resume talks on releasing Israeli hostages, including soldiers.Abdul Wahed Jalal Nori, an analyst and lecturer at the Department of Fundamental and Inter-Disciplinary Studies at the International Islamic University Malaysia, told China Daily that the tough stance taken by Netanyahu might "risk derailing the talks "because Hamas will view the new conditions as "unacceptable"."The more Netanyahu insists on continuing the conflict, the deeper the enmity grows," said Abdul Wahed.He said Hamas' willingness to enter the negotiations is aimed at ending the hostilities, with an initial cease-fire followed by discussions on issues like blockade-lifting and reconstruction aid."If those things are not achieved, the conflict will continue. Therefore, a more balanced strategy, incorporating security concerns with genuine humanitarian considerations and diplomatic flexibility, might offer a better path toward lasting peace and stability," said Abdul Wahed.jan@chinadailyapac.comGAZA/JERUSALEM — Israel carried out deadly airstrikes in the Gaza Strip as the conflict entered its 10th month on Sunday, with Hamas reportedly having accepted a US proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages.A senior Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday that Hamas has accepted a US proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages, including soldiers and civilians.The militant group has dropped a demand that Israel first commit to a permanent cease-fire before signing the agreement, and would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.Hamas is waiting for a response from Israel on the cease-fire proposal, two officials from the militant group said on Sunday."We have left our response with the mediators and are waiting to hear the occupation's response," one of the two Hamas officials told Reuters, asking not to be named.The three-phase plan for the Palestinian enclave was put forward at the end of May by US President Joe Biden and is being mediated by Qatar and Egypt.Another Palestinian official, with knowledge of the cease-fire deliberations, said Israel was in talks with the Qataris."They have discussed with them Hamas' response and they promised to give them Israel's response within days," the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters on Sunday.Israel has said it will send a delegation in the coming days to continue truce talks with Qatari mediators that began recently in Doha.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said "gaps" remained with Hamas on how to secure a cease-fire and hostage release deal."It was agreed that next week Israeli negotiators will travel to Doha to continue the talks. There are still gaps between the parties," the spokesman said in a statement on Friday.US Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns will travel to Qatar soon for negotiations, a source familiar with the matter said.Fighting continuesMeanwhile, the fighting in Gaza continued unabated, with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society saying on Sunday that the bodies of six people, including two children, who were killed in Israeli strikes, had arrived at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah.Paramedics also said on Sunday that six people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a house in the northern area of Gaza City.The day before, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said 16 people had been killed in a strike on a school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees that was sheltering displaced people in Nuseirat, in central Gaza.The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted "terrorists" operating around the Al-Jawni school.The military earlier said it had conducted operations across much of the Gaza Strip, including Shujaiya in the north and Deir al-Balah and Rafah in the south.Shujaiya is among the areas the military had previously declared to be cleared of Hamas, but where fighting has since resumed.There has been no truce since a one-week pause in November when 80 Israeli hostages were freed in return for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.Pressure has mounted domestically for another hostage release deal, with regular protests and rallies in Israel."It's important that we reach a deal so that all the mothers can embrace their children and husbands, just as I hug my mother every morning now," rescued hostage Almog Meir Jan said in a recorded message to a rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday.Israeli protesters blocked roads in the city for a second day on Sunday, demanding the government secure a hostage deal with Hamas as the Gaza conflict entered the 10th month.The conflict started on Oct 7 when Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to official Israeli figures.At least 38,153 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military onslaught, according to Gaza health officials, and the coastal enclave has largely been reduced to rubble.Also, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement have exchanged cross-border fire almost daily since the Gaza conflict began.Agencies via XinhuaGAZA -- Hamas's Undersecretary of the Ministry of Labor Ehab al-Ghussein was killed in an Israeli airstrike west of Gaza City on Sunday, said Palestinian sources. GAZA -- At least 16 Palestinians were killed, most of them children and women, in an Israeli bombing of a school sheltering displaced people in the Nuseirat area in the central Gaza Strip on Saturday afternoon, the Palestinian official news agency WAFA reported.The Al-Jaouni school was bombed for the third time since the onset of the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict, WAFA said.The Israeli military said it was looking into the report about the incident, according to Israeli media.In a statement on Saturday, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said the attacked school sheltered about 7,000 displaced people, adding that since the outbreak of the conflict, the Israeli army has bombed more than 17 schools and displacement and shelter centers inside the Nuseirat refugee camp.UN statistics estimated earlier this week that the number of people internally displaced within Gaza has risen to 1.9 million people, or about nine out of ten people in the Strip.During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 29 people and wounded 100 others, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Saturday morning. Among those killed were five local journalists, raising the death toll of journalists since Oct. 7 to 158, according to the media office.The Palestinian death toll in the Gaza Strip has reached 38,098, with 87,705 injuries since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out in early October 2023, according to health authorities in Gaza.UNITED NATIONS - The United Nations expressed grave concerns on Friday about intensified clashes along the Lebanon-Israel frontier, known as the Blue Line.The world body highlighted the mounting tensions following an increase in exchanges of fire between Lebanese and Israeli forces.This recent surge in hostilities, which occurred on Thursday, "heightens the risk of a full-scale war," according to a note from the office of the spokesperson for the UN secretary-general.The note underscored the necessity of restraint, noting, "Escalation can and must be avoided. We reiterate that the danger of miscalculation leading to a sudden and wider conflagration is real," and emphasized that "a political and diplomatic solution is the only viable way forward."On the same day, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, engaged with key Lebanese officials including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Najib Mikati to discuss the urgency of de-escalation along the Blue Line.The UN note also reiterated calls from the UN Interim Force in Lebanon for an immediate cessation of hostilities and renewed commitment to Security Council resolution 1701, which was adopted in August 2006 to seek a full cessation of hostilities shortly after a month of deadly warfare between Israel and Hezbollah ended with a fragile truce.TEHRAN - Masoud Pezeshkian, Iran's former health minister, won the country's 14th presidential election, Iran's Election Headquarters Spokesperson Mohsen Eslami announced on Saturday.Eslami made the announcement while disclosing the results of the runoff held on Friday between reformist Pezeshkian and principlist Saeed Jalili, Iran's former chief negotiator in the nuclear talks with world powers.Eslami put the total number of votes cast in the runoff at 30,530,157, adding that according to the number of the used ballots, which stood at 30,573,931, the turnout reached 49.8 percent.Of all the votes, Pezeshkian secured 16,384,403, whereas Jalili garnered 13,538,179, said Eslami.The runoff began at 8:00 am local time (0430 GMT) at nearly 59,000 polling stations nationwide and abroad. It was scheduled to end at 6:00 pm local time (1430 GMT) but was extended three times, with each extension lasting for two hours.Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei cast his ballot at a polling station in Tehran immediately after the voting began and made a brief speech, calling the election "an important political affair of the country".Pezeshkian, 69, is a cardiac surgeon and currently a lawmaker in the country's parliament. He was the parliament's first deputy speaker from 2016 to 2020 and health minister between 2001 and 2005 in the government of former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.He ran for president in 2013, but withdrew, and failed to qualify for the presidential race in his second attempt at the presidency in 2021.Pezeshkian managed to secure 10,415,991 votes, over 42 percent of the total, in the first round of the presidential election.Jalili, 58, is currently a member of Iran's Expediency Discernment Council. He was the secretary of the country's Supreme National Security Council from 2007 to 2013 and was a chief negotiator in the nuclear talks between Iran and world powers.He was a candidate in Iran's 11th presidential election in June 2013, but finished in third place. He also ran for president in 2021, but withdrew in favor of late President Ebrahim Raisi before the election.Jalili managed to garner 9,473,298 or over 38 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential election.CAIRO/GAZA/JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told US President Joe Biden on Thursday he has decided to send a delegation to resume stalled negotiations on a hostage release deal with Hamas, their administrations said.A source from the Israeli negotiating team, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was a real chance of achieving agreement after Hamas made a revised proposal on the terms of a deal."The proposal put forward by Hamas includes a very significant breakthrough," the source said.The Israeli response to the Hamas proposal, submitted via mediators, was in marked contrast to past instances during the nearly nine-month conflict in Gaza, where Israel has said the conditions attached by Hamas were not acceptable.An Israeli official said the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency would lead the Israeli delegation for talks.Netanyahu was scheduled later on Thursday to have consultations with his negotiating team, and then discuss the hostage release talks with his security cabinet.Israel received Hamas' response on Wednesday to a proposal made public at the end of May by Biden that would include the release of about 120 hostages held in Gaza and a cease-fire in the enclave.A Palestinian official close to the mediation efforts told Reuters that Hamas has shown flexibility over some clauses that would allow a framework agreement to be reached should Israel approve.Two Hamas officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hamas has said any deal must end the conflict and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel maintains it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until Hamas is eradicated.It was not clear where the Israeli delegation would go to resume talks. Prior efforts to end the Gaza conflict were mediated by Egypt and Qatar, with talks held in both locations.In Gaza, Palestinians reacted cautiously to the prospect of renewed talks."We hope that this is the end of the war, we are exhausted and we can't stand more setbacks and disappointments," said Youssef, a father of two, now displaced in Khan Younis in the south of the enclave.On Thursday, Gaza's health ministry said the Palestinian death toll in the nearly nine months of conflict had passed 38,000, with 87,445 wounded.Ongoing strikesAn Israeli strike hit a school in Gaza City and the Civil Emergency Service said five Palestinians were killed and others wounded, while other Israeli strikes on Gaza City's old town on Thursday killed a woman and wounded several others, medics said.The Israeli military said it had been operating to dismantle Hamas' military and administrative capabilities. It said it was acting in accordance with international law and taking feasible precautions to minimize civilian casualties.In another development, Israel's regulatory body has approved plans for building 5,295 new settler homes throughout the occupied West Bank, a settlement monitoring group said on Thursday.Peace Now, a settlement watchdog based in Israel, stated in a news release that the Higher Planning Council of the Civil Administration approved the new construction during a two-day discussion on Wednesday and Thursday.The approval of the new settler housing units came a day after Israeli authorities approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers of land in the West Bank, marking the largest single appropriation in about three decades.These moves are likely to stoke further tensions in the region, which is already experiencing increasing violence.XinhuaThe Council of the Arab League has demanded freezing Israel's participation at the United Nations General Assembly as Tel Aviv continued to defy the UN Charter and international laws in its military offensive to destroy Hamas in Gaza.The Permanent Representative of Palestine to the League of Arab States Ambassador Muhannad Al-Aklouk led the appeal during the extraordinary session at the level of permanent delegates, headed by Yemen, at the request of the State of Palestine in Cairo, Egypt, on July 4.Al-Aklouk pointed out that during the past eight months of the crime of genocide, the League held two summits, four councils of foreign ministers, and six councils at the delegate level, and one temporary committee of permanent delegates was tasked last January with formulating practical measures that could be taken to force Israel to stop its atrocities.At least 38,000 Palestinians have been killed to date in the Gaza Strip since Israel launched its ongoing retaliatory strikes in October last year over revenge for Hamas' killing of 1,200 Israeli citizens and taking in over 200 hostages.The Arab nations are also pushing for the implementation of a resolution demanding the inclusion of a list of Israeli "extremist organizations" and groups associated with "Israeli colonial settlement activities" that "intrude upon the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the national Arab terrorism lists", as well as boycotting companies "operating in colonial settlements".The Council discussed the policy of confronting the "crimes of genocide and Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people, in addition to colonial expansion", the Union of News Agencies of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (UNA) reported.According to the UNA report, Al-Aklouk called for freezing Israel's participation in the UNGA because of its lack of commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, viewing it a threat to international peace and security, and for Tel Aviv's "failure to fulfill its obligations that were a condition for accepting its membership in the UN".Further, the report also noted that international law has proven that it alone "is unable to stop the greatest crime possible" as it accused Israel of "genocide while enjoying immunity".Al-Aklouk stressed the need to submit Arab referrals and complaints to the International Criminal Court, and to direct Arab civil society organizations, federations and unions to begin filing cases against Israeli officials in national and international courts.In May, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor sought arrest warrants for Israel and Hamas leaders on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity as a result of their fighting in Gaza.Israel stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice with a ruling that ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its military operation in Rafah, which it launched on May 6.Gokhan Ereli, Gulf studies coordinator at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, in Turkiye, told China Daily that the recent actions taken by the Arab League marked a significant shift in the region's geopolitical dynamics.He said the unity displayed by the Arab nations enhance their collective diplomatic and political leverage, signaling a rare moment of cohesion in addressing the brutal Israeli assaults on Palestine."By strategically employing international law and diplomatic channels, the Arab League aims to delegitimize Israeli actions and hold it accountable through global institutions such as the UN and the ICC," said Ereli."This approach not only seeks to increase international scrutiny on Israel but also to apply economic pressure through the endorsement of the BDS movement and boycotting companies involved in illegal settlements," he added.The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, launched in 2005, works to end international support for Israel's oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law, according to the BDS website.Al-Aklouk reaffirmed the Arab countries' to support the Palestinian question "with firm political positions supportive of the issue, whether in the League's decisions or in international forums".The Council reaffirmed that any Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories since 1967, whether de facto or through invalid legislation, "constitutes a new Israeli war crime".It demanded the international community to exert pressure and implement punitive measures to compel Israel to halt its illegal annexation and settlement practices, which the Council said undermined the prospects for peace and a two-state solution, Palestine's WAFA News Agency reported.Al-Aklouk lamented the children who have been killed, gone missing, lost limbs or had been orphaned, as well as the more than 10,000 women that have been killed, including putting 60 pregnant women at huge risk of death before or after child birth as the health system had collapsed."At the core of these efforts is the push for the establishment and recognition of an independent Palestinian state, preventing further annexation of Palestinian territories, and supporting the Palestinians' right to self-determination," said Ereli."The Arab League's actions highlight the importance of a just resolution to the conflict, aiming for an independent Palestinian state as a cornerstone of regional stability and peace," he added.UNITED NATIONS -- China on Tuesday called on Israel to fulfill its obligations under international humanitarian law and heed the international community's call to ensure the rapid and safe entry of humanitarian supplies into Gaza.In remarks at the UN Security Council briefing on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, China's permanent representative to the United Nations Fu Cong highlighted the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by extreme shortages of essential supplies and dire health conditions.He noted that "millions of people are struggling with hunger, disease, pain, and despair," describing the situation as a man-made humanitarian disaster and a serious breach of international law.Fu pointed out that Gaza has been under blockade for nine months, with over 2 million people living in an "open-air prison" without adequate access to water, electricity, food, medication, and fuel.He criticized the closure of the Rafah crossing due to Israeli military operations, which has left thousands of trucks loaded with humanitarian supplies waiting in long lines."The existing crossing points are far from being able to meet the demand for humanitarian aid," Fu said, emphasizing that land transport routes are key to expanding humanitarian access.Fu also addressed the obstruction of humanitarian supplies and the challenges faced by humanitarian workers, who encounter unreasonable difficulties and accusations.He condemned the repeated attacks on facilities of humanitarian agencies and noted that over 200 humanitarian workers have died in the conflict, calling this "unprecedented in history and shocking."Reiterating that "hunger cannot be weaponized, humanitarian issues cannot be politicized," Fu said the man-made exacerbation of the humanitarian disaster is "unacceptable."Fu urged Israel to ensure the "rapid and safe entry of humanitarian supplies at scale into Gaza," and to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations.The council's adoption of resolution 2720 aimed to expand humanitarian access, but its implementation has fallen short.Fu called for an examination of the reasons behind this and urged the concerned parties to work harder to remove obstacles to the large-scale entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.Fu concluded by emphasizing that the fundamental way to alleviate the humanitarian disaster is through a lasting ceasefire and the early relaunch of the two-state solution.He called on the international community to continue efforts toward this end and supported the council in taking further necessary action.JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that his country is in "the final stage" of eliminating Hamas' armed force in the Gaza Strip."We are advancing towards the completion of the elimination" of Hamas, Netanyahu said during a meeting with cadets from Israel's National Security College, according to a statement released by his office.Netanyahu's estimate came a day after he toured the Gaza Division and held a security assessment meeting, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the army's senior command, on Israel's nine-month-long offensive in Gaza, "with emphasis on the fighting in Rafah, as well as the continuation of military pressure on Hamas," according to Netanyahu's office.Also on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered a mass evacuation of civilians from the eastern Khan Younis, signaling that ground forces might soon resume their offensives in the southern Gazan city, presumably to fight Hamas forces that have regrouped in the area.Israel completed a large-scale attack in Khan Younis in early April and subsequently withdrew most of its forces.RAMALLAH - The Palestinian presidency on Sunday rejected any foreign presence on Palestinian lands, in response to Israeli statements calling for the handover of the Gaza Strip to international forces.In a declaration carried by the official news agency WAFA, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for the presidency, said that "there is no legitimacy for any foreign presence on Palestinian lands, and only the Palestinian people can decide who governs and manages their affairs."He stressed that the Israeli government "is delusional if it thinks it can decide the fate of the Palestinian people and cement the occupation by bringing in foreign forces".The spokesperson called the Palestine Liberation Organization the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, which "has legal authority over all of Palestine's territory, including Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem".He emphasized that "the Palestine issue is about land and statehood, not just humanitarian aid; it is a sacred issue and the central cause for Arabs."On Friday, Israeli public radio Kan reported that Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant discussed the transitional phase plan for Gaza during his visit to the United States days ago.The plan would be overseen by a steering committee led by the US and involving moderate Arab countries, according to the radio.The international forces, possibly including soldiers from Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco, would oversee security in Gaza while the American side would handle leadership and logistics from outside the strip, likely in Egypt, it reported.The plan will be implemented in stages from north to south Gaza and aims for the gradual transfer of local security responsibilities to Palestinian forces, the report said.It noted that the plan assumes that Hamas's military capabilities have been sufficiently reduced, rendering the group unable to conduct large-scale attacks.Israel's National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi stated last Tuesday during a conference at the Reichman University in Herzliya that "the post-war plan for Hamas and Gaza has been prepared in recent weeks, and we will soon see practical steps towards this."He added, "We do not have to wait for Hamas to disappear, as it is a long process," explaining, "We cannot eliminate Hamas as an idea; we need an alternative idea."Hanegbi believes that establishing an alternative to replace Hamas is essential for achieving long-term victory, saying that the alternative should be a government supported by local residents who wish to live alongside Israel, with backing from moderate Arab countries.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had faced widespread criticism from within and outside Israel for not presenting a clear post-war plan for Gaza.Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage.CAIRO -- Egypt denied reports suggesting that it agreed to relocate the Rafah crossing bordering the Gaza Strip or build a new terminal near Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, Egypt's Al-Qahera News TV channel reported Sunday.There were no Egyptian discussions regarding the relocation of the Rafah crossing or Israeli supervision over the crossing, said the TV channel, citing a high-ranking security source who stressed Egypt's adherence to the Israeli army's complete withdrawal from the Palestinian side of the crossing.Egypt also rejected the entry of any Egyptian forces into Gaza, the source said, adding that the post-war arrangement of the strip is a Palestinian affair.On May 7, the Israeli army announced the imposition of "operational" control over the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, which led to the cessation of aid delivery from Egypt into Gaza through the crossing.GAZA/JERUSALEM — Airstrikes and gunfire rattled northern Gaza over the weekend, where Israeli military operations have uprooted tens of thousands of Palestinians and compounded what the UN called "unbearable" living conditions in the territory.Explosions were heard from the Shujaiya area near Gaza City, and Israeli forces advanced further on Sunday.The armed wings of both Hamas and the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said they were engaged in fighting with Israeli forces there.Israel's military on Saturday reported two soldiers killed and two severely wounded in combat in northern Gaza.The Israeli forces also pushed deeper into western and central Rafah in the south.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a week ago the "intense phase" of the assault was winding down after almost nine months, but experts see a potentially prolonged next phase.Mediators' efforts have failed to conclude a truce, with both sides blaming each other for the impasse.Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said on Saturday there had been no progress in cease-fire talks with Israel over the conflict.The Palestinian group is still ready to "deal positively" with any cease-fire proposal, Hamdan told a news conference in Beirut.Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh on Saturday discussed with Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel the course of the negotiations to achieve a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.The call came after Israel's Hebrew public radio Kan reported that the US administration presented a revised version of a prisoner exchange deal that includes a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.The Israeli offensive has killed at least 37,877 Gazans, in response to Hamas' surprise attack in Israel on Oct 7, which killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.At a Tel Aviv mass rally against Netanyahu's government on Saturday, a former hostage said "we must do everything to bring them back home", referring to the hostages in Gaza.The United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA estimated that "about 60,000 to 80,000 people were displaced" from the area last week. Louise Wateridge, spokeswoman for UNRWA, said: "It's really unbearable."The conflict has also uprooted people on the Israel-Lebanon border, where the Hezbollah movement and Israeli forces have engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire.Agencies - XinhuaTEHRAN - Iran's 14th presidential election on Saturday entered a runoff vote, with former Health Minister Masoud Pezeshkian and former chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili leading in the first round but no one gets minimum threshold of 50 percent of votes, Iran's Election Headquarters Spokesperson Mohsen Eslami said.The spokesperson said turnout of the voting stands at 40 percent, adding that the runoff election will be held on next Friday.According to Eslami, Pezeshkian got 10,415,991 of votes, accounting for over 42 percent of the total votes counted, while Jalili got 9,473,298, or over 38 percent.Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf got 3,383,340, or 13.8 percent, and Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a former interior minister and justice minister, got 206,397, or 0.8 percent, Eslami said.TEHRAN - Voting for Iran's 14th presidential election started at 8 am local time (0430 GMT) on Friday, after President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash last month."We start the elections" for the country's 14th presidential election, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said in a televised address.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Tuesday for "high participation" in Friday's presidential election to replace Ebrahim Raisi, who died last month in a helicopter crash."We emphasize the importance of high participation (in the election) because it is the pride of the Islamic republic," Khamenei, 85, said in a televised speech. "In every election where the turnout was low, the enemies of the Islamic republic have denounced us."Voters have the choice between six candidates, who were selected by the Guardian Council from 80 hopefuls.AGENCIES VIA XINHUAIsrael kept up its bombardment of Gaza on Tuesday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out ending its eight-month-long fighting in the enclave any time soon, as experts call for the implementation of the United Nations cease-fire resolution.Netanyahu said late on Sunday that he would only accept a partial cease-fire deal that would not end the conflict in Gaza.He said he was ready to make a partial deal to bring back some of the 120 hostages still held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, but "we are committed to continuing the war after a pause, in order to complete the goal of eliminating Hamas".Since the UN resolution's adoption on June 10, Hamas has notified mediating parties Qatar, Egypt and the United States that it welcomes the adoption and stated its readiness to implement the resolution.Although the White House keeps talking of Israeli acceptance, Israel, however, has so far failed to officially announce it would carry out the resolution that requires an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, release of all hostages and no hindrance to the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.Hamas noted Netanyahu's position is "a clear confirmation of his rejection of the recent Security Council resolution and the proposals of US President Joe Biden", according to The Palestinian Information Center.The US has pressured Hamas to agree unconditionally to its proposals for the three-phase Gaza cease-fire. Biden announced the proposal in May.The US proposal holds Hamas responsible for the delay, rather than making Israel accept the UNSC resolution.Abdalfatah Asqool, an international law lecturer at the University of Palestine in Gaza, told China Daily that what the US is doing is to give Israel more time to continue the conflict.Three phases for peaceThe UNSC Resolution 2735 specifies three phases for peace, the first of which would include an immediate, full and complete cease-fire with the release of hostages and the return of the remains of some hostages who have been killed, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the populated areas in Gaza.Ayman Yousef, a professor of international relations at the Arab American University in Jenin, told China Daily there are questions regarding the US and Israel's differing views of the cease-fire proposal.Yousef said the US has failed to differentiate between a temporary or permanent cease-fire, with the latter effectively meaning an end to the conflict.This confusion has been passed to both Hamas and Israel, Yousef said, and Netanyahu is exploiting the gap between the different definitions of cease-fire.Meanwhile, Israeli forces killed at least 24 Palestinians in three separate airstrikes early on Tuesday in Gaza City and the dead included a sister of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, Gaza health officials and medics said.Israeli tanks also pressed deeper into the western areas of Rafah overnight, blowing up homes, residents said.Two Israeli airstrikes hit two schools in Gaza City, killing at least 14 people, medics said. Another strike on a house in the Shati (Beach) camp, one of the Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps, killed 10 others.The house in Shati belonged to the extended family of Haniyeh, who is based in Qatar, killing one of his sisters along with other relatives too, family members and medics said.Haniyeh, who leads Hamas' diplomacy and is the public face of the group that has been running Gaza, has lost many relatives in Israeli airstrikes since Oct 7, including three sons.The health ministry in Hamasrun Gaza said Tuesday that at least 37,658 people have been killed during more than eight months of war between Israel and Palestinian militants.Agencies contributed to this story.mikegu@chinadailyhk.comEgypt narrowly escaped colonization by France and Britain, the two great European powers of the 18th and 19th centuries. Instead, Egypt experienced French and British "cultural imperialism".French engineering built the Suez Canal, the French Napoleonic Code became the basis of the Egyptian legal system, the children of Egypt's upper classes studied French language and literature, and Cairo's architecture reflected French styles. The spread of British culture came later, after the militarization of the Suez Canal, with administrative, commercial and financial influence. British tourists traveled the Nile and upper-class Egyptians began to play English sports.After World War I, Egypt gradually came more under the cultural influence of the United States, the new great power. In 1956, when the US stopped the British-French-Israeli seizure of the Suez Canal, the prestige of the European powers collapsed. As the US seemed to care less about dominating Egypt than controlling the oil resources of the Gulf, Egyptians came to view it as benign, less self-interested than the Europeans.The US quickly achieved a similar reputation across most of the Middle East. As Arab countries emerged from British or French colonial rule, they readily identified with Americans who had also escaped an empire. Moreover, in the final decades of the 20th century, the US' economic achievements and prowess in space suggested there was much to learn from it. The atheism of Soviet communism made it easier for Muslims to side with the Americans; Hollywood movies and American television familiarized Arab elites with American culture; and friendly American tourists were popular as they toured the region's historic sites.The US, the sole superpower after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the uncontested leader of the global economy, dominated the region. It was not only US naval strike groups or American influence over global economics that impressed the Arab elite. Many accepted the US' claimed "exceptionalism" and even its self-image as the "indispensable nation", the only power capable of managing international conflicts. Many were also attracted by the American political and social model, viewing it as the best template for the gradual modernization of their own societies and the advancement of their poor. They saw much to gain from learning from the US.By the end of the 20th century, it was common to speak of the US' "soft power" — non-coercive means of co-opting support through the appeal of its values and the attraction of its example. The assertion of such cultural power, it was suggested, would minimize US dependence on its military.In the new century, however, the US aggressively exercised its hard power, first in Afghanistan, then in Iraq and Libya. US prestige waned as each military venture failed to achieve its stated aims. In those years, also, the US was gradually losing its absolute preeminence in the global economy and the appeal of its institutions was being sullied by its increased political and social dysfunction. The American example no longer seemed so worthy of emulation.Policy failures and strategic incoherence hastened a decline in American soft power. Washington pursued inconsistent policies toward the great rivals, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Russia, not the US, was the decisive player in the murderous Syrian civil war. President Obama punctured Egyptian belief in a friendly US by abandoning the Hosni Mubarak regime for the Muslim Brotherhood.The Middle East awoke to China's version of soft power in the second decade of the 21st century. Governments and elites, astounded that tens of millions of Chinese were escaping poverty every year, saw much to admire, perhaps to emulate, in China's economy and its win-win approach to problem-solving. Chinese diplomacy amazed the region by brokering an accommodation between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Some began to think that the West was in terminal decline, and that the future would belong to the Global South in a multipolar world.Unlike the US, but in the tradition of other great powers of history, China understands that the Middle East is the bridge between the Mediterranean world and Asia. Moreover, in contrast with US policies, which had dealt with the region on a country-by-country basis, China announced an ongoing relationship with the whole Arab world.President Xi Jinping indicated that the Chinese-Arab relationship, building on historic Silk Road contacts, would involve enhanced exchanges and mutual understanding between two great civilizations. His recognition that Chinese and Arab civilizations are historic peers is in significant contrast to Western attitudes that privileged the achievements of the Pharaohs while neglecting those of the Arab past.President Xi described China's relationship with the Arab world as "a strategic partnership of comprehensive cooperation and common development". The economic promise of the partnership is to link China's market of 1.4 billion people with the Arab world's 475 million.The lodestar or guiding principle for "a closer China-Arab community with a shared future" is the Belt and Road Initiative. China puts Egypt and the Suez Canal at the center of its 21st Century Maritime Silk Road for Asian trade with Europe.Egypt is home to huge BRI engineering projects, including major power plants and a new Canal Economic Zone for industry, trade and logistics. Egypt's New Administrative Capital, now being created in the desert east of Cairo, will house 6.5 million people in skyscrapers projected to be among the tallest buildings in Africa. These projects support Egypt's national development plan targeted for completion in 2030.Breaking with America's laissez-faire doctrine of modernization through private investment and market forces, China has integrated its BRI projects with the national development plans of other Middle Eastern governments, including Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, Oman's Vision 2040 and Morocco's Emergence plans. China has also supported several Arab governments in developing port infrastructure and coastal economic zones, and improving logistics and supply chains.The West never built anything on the scale of the BRI projects. Indeed, in physical terms, only the architectural monuments of the ancient empires in Egypt — the Ptolemies, Romans, Arab dynasties and Ottomans — are comparable. And those ancient monuments were built over centuries, not in a decade or two.But soft power achieves its persuasive influence over hearts and minds — not physically, but gradually through countless human interactions. After two centuries, the cultural impression of the West remains strong in the Middle East. China's soft power faces formidable cultural competition from the English language, Western ideas about economics and politics, and long habits of interaction between Western and Arab elites.People-to-people connectivity, identified by President Xi as a primary BRI goal, will add to China's soft power by producing mutually profitable deals between Chinese and Arab businesses. He also emphasized the importance of cultural mutual respect and mutual learning.Today, however, both Chinese and Arab commercial elites are largely ignorant of the other society, either its historic achievements or its contemporary culture. Chinese-Arab business — indeed the whole Chinese-Arab relationship — will never achieve its potential until that deep cultural divide is bridged.The future of China's soft power in the region depends on Chinese and Arabs getting to know one another better, and more fully understanding each others' lives, hopes and struggles. It will be decided by individual Chinese and Arabs discovering mutual goals as they talk, work and play together.The author is a former senior Egyptian diplomat, most notably as consul general to London and Hong Kong and ambassador to Slovakia.JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Monday that Israel is "committed" to the deal proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden for a ceasefire in Gaza in return for the release of hostages."We are committed to the Israeli proposal that President Biden endorsed," Netanyahu said during a special plenum session of the Knesset (parliament) summoned by the opposition, noting "Our position has not changed."Biden first presented the deal proposal to end the ongoing conflict in late May, referring to it as "the Israeli proposal". Netanyahu's remarks marked the first time the Israeli side has confirmed that Israel has approved and supports the proposal.Netanyahu told the Knesset that Israel will not end the conflict "until we bring back all the hostages, all 120 of them -- both the living and the fallen" and until Hamas is "eliminated" and the residents in southern and northern can safely return to their homes.Israel has been carrying out a massive offensive in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a Hamas rampage on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.The Israeli assault caused a severe humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave and killed more than 37,600 people, according to the health authorities in Gaza.UNITED NATIONS - UN Humanitarians said on Monday that access and security constraints hinder food aid delivery to hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and the medical evacuation of 10,000 patients.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the inability to transport aid commodities from the Kerem Shalom crossing safely and the continued closure of the Rafah crossing compounded the challenges facing aid operations.OCHA said fewer than half of the 86 coordinated humanitarian missions to northern Gaza planned for this month were facilitated by Israeli authorities. More than a quarter were impeded, 12 percent were denied access and 12 percent were canceled due to logistical, operational or security reasons."A humanitarian mission returning to southern Gaza after delivering fuel and medical supplies to Gaza City in the north was delayed for more than 13 hours at an Israeli military checkpoint, putting the convoy in danger of being caught in crossfire," the office cited as just one example of the challenges in aid delivery. "Planned humanitarian missions requiring coordination to areas in southern Gaza also continue to face impediments and access denials."The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that more than 10,000 people need medical evacuations to outside Gaza. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appealed for their sustained medical evacuation and timely passage using all possible routes."Pediatric patients are among those who need to leave Gaza for specialized care," OCHA said. "WHO and partners transferred five of these patients -- four with cancer and one with second-degree burns -- from Al-Ahli hospital to Nasser Medical Complex, where they will continue to receive care until they can depart Gaza."The humanitarians said the WHO team also delivered medical supplies to cover the health needs of 20,000 patients at Al-Ahli and As-Sahaba hospitals and 19,000 liters of fuel.In short supply in Gaza, fuel is necessary for electricity generators and to power smaller vehicles transporting aid and personnel.JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that intense fighting against Hamas is "very close" to an end.In an interview with Israeli Channel 14 TV news, Netanyahu said that "the intensive phase of the war in Rafah is about to end", and the Israeli forces were "very close" to concluding the "intensive phase" in the entire Gaza Strip.However, he said, this does not mean an end to the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip, and operations will persist with the fighting against Hamas targets.After the conclusion of the "intensive phase" in Gaza, "we will continue northward," Netanyahu said, referring to Israel's warnings of launching a full-fledged war against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.He said that any agreement to secure a ceasefire along the Israel-Lebanon border, where Israeli and Hezbollah forces have traded fire since Oct 7, 2023, "will have to meet our terms".He stated he would only agree to a deal that would see Hamas removed from power in the Gaza Strip and the release of about 100 hostages who are still held in the Palestinian enclave.GAZA/JERUSALEM — Dozens of people were killed in Israeli attacks on districts of Gaza City in the north of the Palestinian enclave on Saturday, as food continued to pile up at a Gaza crossing amid warnings from agencies that they are unable to deliver aid.One Israeli strike on houses in Al-Shati, one of the Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps, killed 24 people, Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run government media office, told Reuters. Another 18 Palestinians were killed in a strike on houses in the Al-Tuffah neighborhood.The Israeli military issued a statement saying: "A short while ago, IDF fighter jets struck two Hamas military infrastructure sites in the area of Gaza City."Hamas said the attacks targeted the civilian population and that the perpetrators "will pay the price for their violations against our people"."People were going about their business" when, suddenly, "the whole area was wiped out" in an airstrike, said Abu Mahmud al-Kariri, a witness in Al-Shati.The European Union's foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, on Saturday called for an "independent investigation" into the shelling that damaged the office of the International Committee of the Red CrossLate on Friday, the committee said 22 dead and 45 wounded were taken to a Red Cross field hospital after shelling with "heavy caliber projectiles" near its southern Gaza office.Gaza's health ministry blamed the shelling on Israel.The Israel military said on Saturday that an initial inquiry found "there was no direct attack carried out by the IDF against a Red Cross facility", but that the matter was being looked into.The conflict has led to dire humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip and repeated warnings by the United Nations of famine.Desperation among Gaza's 2.4 million people has increased as fighting rages, bringing warnings from agencies that they are unable to deliver aid."The breakdown of public order and safety is increasingly endangering humanitarian workers and operations in Gaza," the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Friday.With civil order breaking down in Gaza, the UN says it has been unable to pick up any supplies from Kerem Shalom since Tuesday, leaving crucial aid in limbo.A deputy UN spokesman said last week that the crossing "is operating with limited functionality, including because of fighting in the area".Tel Aviv protestsOn Saturday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced what organizers said was the biggest anti-government protest since the conflict began.Tens of thousands rallied in Tel Aviv. One demonstrator's sign accused Netanyahu of being an "Enemy of Israel".Supporters and families of the Gaza hostages also rallied, holding their pictures aloft.Netanyahu said on Sunday that a dispute with the United States over weapons delays relating to the Gaza conflict would be resolved soon.Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant flew to Washington to discuss the next phase of the war and escalating hostilities on the border with Lebanon.Exchanges of fire across the Lebanese border between Israel and Hezbollah have also escalated, raising fears of wider conflict.On Saturday a security source said a leader of the Lebanese group Jamaa Islamiya was killed in an Israeli strike on a vehicle in eastern Lebanon.Hezbollah said it had targeted a military position in northern Israel "with an attack drone" in response to the killing of a commander of the Jamaa Islamiya group.The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said cross-border hostilities must not turn Lebanon into "another Gaza"."One rash move — one miscalculation — could trigger a catastrophe that goes far beyond the border and, frankly, beyond imagination."Violence has also soared in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Israeli troops tied a wounded Palestinian man to a military vehicle during a raid in the city of Jenin on Saturday, the army said on Sunday, acknowledging that soldiers had violated operational procedures.Footage of the incident on the internet shows a Jenin resident strapped to the hood of a military jeep as it passes through a narrow alley."The incident will be investigated and dealt with accordingly," the military said, adding that the wounded man was transferred to the Palestinian Red Crescent for treatment.Agencies via XinhuaSANAA -- Yemen's Houthi group on Sunday claimed responsibility for attacking two cargo ships in the Red Sea and the western Indian Ocean."The naval forces of our armed forces carried out a second targeting operation for the ship TRANSWORLD NAVIGATOR in the Red Sea with an unmanned boat, which resulted in a direct hit on the ship," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a statement aired by Houthi-run al-Masirah TV."The missile force of our armed forces carried out an operation targeting the ship STOLT SEQUOIA in the Indian Ocean with several cruise missiles, and the operation achieved its objectives successfully," he said.The attacks come in response to what Houthi claimed their owner companies' violation of the group's entry ban into Israeli ports, according to the spokesman.Speaking of the U.S. aircraft carrier Eisenhower, which had just left the region, Yahya claimed that a series of Houthi attacks drove the vessel away.He reiterated that his group's attacks would continue until Israel stops its war in the Palestinian enclave of the Gaza Strip.Earlier in the day, a Yemeni government official told Xinhua that the merchant vessel TRANSWORLD NAVIGATOR, flying the Liberian flag, was struck twice by the Houthi group successively on Saturday in the Gulf of Aden, and on early Sunday, in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen's port city of Hodeidah.The official said the ship was damaged but was still proceeding to its destination with no injuries reported from the crew.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) confirmed receiving a report of an incident approximately 65 nautical miles west of Hodeidah.The UKMTO's statement indicated that the master of a merchant vessel reported an impact from an uncrewed aerial system, which resulted in ship damage. All crew members were reported safe, and the ship was said to be proceeding to its next port of call.These attacks are part of a broader campaign by the Houthis, which began in November 2023, targeting ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab Strait. The group claims to be targeting vessels associated with Israel or en route to Israeli ports, citing the ongoing Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip as justification.The ongoing conflict along the vital shipping lanes of the Red Sea and surrounding waters continues to raise concerns about maritime security and global trade implications. TUNIS -- The death toll among Tunisian pilgrims who performed Hajj in Saudi Arabia has risen to 53, Tunisia's state television Wataniya 1 reported."Until this Saturday, the number of Tunisian pilgrims who died in holy places in Saudi Arabia while performing the Hajj rituals, increased further from 49 to 53," said the report.The Tunisian diplomatic mission in Riyadh and the consulate general in Jeddah are currently coordinating to monitor the situation of Tunisian pilgrims who are missing, deceased, or hospitalized in Saudi Arabia, according to the report.On Friday, Tunisian President Kais Saied sacked Ibrahim Chaibi, the minister of religious affairs, without specifying the reason for the dismissal.Chaibi headed the official Tunisian delegation to Saudi Arabia during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The delegation was tasked with supporting and assisting Tunisian pilgrims during the Hajj.Chaibi attributed the loss of human life to factors including the extreme temperatures surpassing 50 degrees Celsius, a significant presence of elderly pilgrims, and a high number of pilgrims with pre-existing illnesses.Hajj, a key pillar of Islam, is annually performed in Mecca, by pilgrims from all over the world. The number of pilgrims exceeded 1.8 million this year, according to Saudi authorities.GAZA - At least 42 Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes on residential houses in two areas of Gaza City, according to Palestinian security and medical sources."About 18 were killed and dozens of others wounded in al-Shati refugee camp after the Israeli warplanes attacked a residential square," Palestinian medical sources told Xinhua.The medical sources noted that the number of victims is likely to increase as the civil defense teams were still trying to pull out the victims from the rubble, adding that the residential square had become "a huge amount of ruins".Palestinian security sources said that Israeli warplanes launched several raids on al-Shati refugee camp, destroying seven inhabited homes.Also on Saturday, at least 24 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed during Israeli airstrikes on houses in the al-Tuffah neighborhood in the northeast of Gaza City, the Hamas-run government media office said in a press statement.The Israeli army said on Saturday in a press statement that its warplanes had attacked two Hamas military infrastructure sites in Gaza City.According to the Times of Israel, the Israeli army targeted Raed Saad, a senior commander of Hamas in Gaza. So far, there has been no official Palestinian confirmation of his death.Saad, identified as a chief of Hamas operations, was reportedly believed to have been at Gaza City's al-Shifa Hospital during an Israeli raid in March, although he was not found there at the time.Israel launched a large-scale war on the Gaza Strip since Oct 7, 2023, after Hamas carried out a military attack on Israeli towns near the Strip, killing about 1,200 and capturing around 250 others.The health authorities in Gaza said in a press statement that as of Thursday, the Palestinian death toll from Israeli military operations has risen to 37,431 people, with 85,653 others wounded. UNITED NATIONS -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday voiced "profound concern" over escalating violence and "bellicose rhetoric" between Israel and Hezbollah militants across the frontier with Lebanon.Speaking to the press at the UN headquarters in New York, the UN chief warned that one false move could trigger a catastrophe for the whole region and beyond."One rash move -- one miscalculation -- could trigger a catastrophe that goes far beyond the border, and frankly, beyond imagination," he said.He underscored that a widening of the conflict in the Middle East must be avoided."Let's be clear: The people of the region and the people of the world cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza," he stressed.The UN chief noted that on both sides of the Blue Line, many people have already lost their lives, and tens of thousands of people have been driven from their homes, with their livelihoods destroyed.He urged both sides to urgently recommit to the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1701 and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities.Adopted in 2006, the resolution set in motion a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and the establishment of demilitarized zone."The world must say loudly and clearly: immediate de-escalation is not only possible -- it is essential," Guterres said, declaring that "there is no military solution.""It is time for reason and rationality. It is time for practical and pragmatic engagement by the parties to the diplomatic and political avenues available to them," he stressed, noting that the cessation of hostilities and progress toward a permanent ceasefire is the only durable solution.The UN chief also underscored the need to protect civilians, ensure that children, journalists and medical workers are not targeted, and ensure the displaced can return to their homes.The United Nations is actively engaging to promote peace, security and stability, in line with resolution 1701, he said."UN peacekeepers, UNIFIL, are on the ground working to de-escalate tensions and help prevent miscalculation, in an extremely challenging environment," he said, adding that the United Nations fully supports diplomatic efforts to end the violence, restore stability and avoid even greater human suffering in the region."And we do so as we continue to press for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages and a real pathway to a two-state solution," Guterres concluded.YEREVAN - Armenia officially recognized the State of Palestine, the Armenian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday."On various international platforms, we have always advocated a peaceful and comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian question and support the two-state principle of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We are convinced that this is the only way to ensure that Palestinians and Israelis can realize their legitimate aspirations," the ministry said."Based on the above and reaffirming its commitment to international law and the principles of equality, sovereignty and peaceful coexistence of peoples, the Republic of Armenia recognizes the State of Palestine," read the statement.Norway, Ireland and Spain made a coordinated announcement on May 22, declaring their recognition of Palestine as a state effective as of May 28. But their decision was condemned by Israel.On June 3, over 20 UN experts and special rapporteurs called on all countries to recognize a Palestinian state. So far, over 140 countries have already recognized a Palestinian state, representing more than two-thirds of the United Nations' membership.RIYADH -- The China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) on Wednesday announced that it has completed the 2024 Hajj operation of the Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro Line in the city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.Over the seven days, 2,206 trains have been dispatched, serving about 2.094 million passengers, CRCC said in a statement.The Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro Line operates for seven days a year, used exclusively as a shuttle train for pilgrims between holy sites in Mecca to reduce congestion during the Hajj.This marks the 10th year that the CRCC successfully managed the Hajj operation, added the statement.The Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro Line, starting operations in 2010, marks not only Saudi Arabia's first light rail but the first light rail built by a Chinese company in the Middle East, said CRCC."Over a decade ago, this place was a desert. Now, we have left a convenient pilgrimage route for Muslims worldwide," said Zhang Long, project manager of the metro line, adding that the project is a testament to Chinese enterprises' commitment to high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative.Also on Wednesday, the Saudi Health Ministry announced there were no outbreaks of disease or other threats to public health during the current Hajj season, despite the significant number of pilgrims and the challenges posed by high temperatures.Minister of Health Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel specifically acknowledged the Central Hajj Committee's recommendation for pilgrims to avoid performing rituals during peak temperatures, which significantly contributed to safeguarding pilgrims' health and minimizing heat stress injuries.The Israeli military's approval of operational plans for offensive attacks against Lebanon in defiance of Lebanese and US warnings is seen as a major escalation of the regional conflict, while continuing the bloodshed in the Gaza Strip.The Israeli threat raised the fears of the Palestinian leadership and United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk, who called for the de-escalation of violence along the Israel-Lebanon border to avert a full-scale war.The Israel Defense Forces said on Tuesday that the generals held an assessment, during which "operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved", as part of preparations to engage in combat with Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border, The Times of Israel reported.Before the IDF announcement, Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati told US envoy Amos J. Hochstein that stopping the persistent Israeli aggression on Lebanon "is required immediately so as to maintain calm and stability in the south of Lebanon", Qatar News Agency reported.Hochstein, who visited Tel Aviv before Beirut, said during the meeting with Mikati that it was in everyone's interest to resolve the conflict along the blue line between Israel and Hezbollah quickly and diplomatically, noting it is "both achievable and urgent".Muslim Imran, director of the Asia Middle East Center for Research and Dialogue in Malaysia, told China Daily that the Israeli military and political leadership are "very delusional"."Now going into war with Lebanon … only shows that Israel's leadership has lost its mind," Imran said.Imran said the Israeli plan against Lebanon before ending the Gaza conflict is proof that the current Israeli leadership is only interested in day-to-day political and administrative survival.Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes and clashes between IDF troops and Palestinian militants rocked Gaza on Wednesday. Witnesses and the civil defense agency in Gaza reported Israeli bombardment in western Rafah, where medics said drone strikes and shelling killed at least seven people.In a video recording, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized close ally Washington for "withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel", in remarks rejected by the White House.Apart from "one particular shipment of munitions" that US officials were looking into closely, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said there are no other pauses. "None," she said.Imran said the United States is being dragged down the same hole as Israel, with the upcoming presidential elections making it very difficult for the US to engage in conflict.At the 56th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council on Tuesday, Turk said he is extremely worried about the escalating situation between Lebanon and Israel.The IDF may have repeatedly violated fundamental principles of the laws of war in a series of prohibited indiscriminate attacks on Gaza, according to a report issued by the UN Human Rights Office on Wednesday.Xinhua and Agencies contributed to this story.JERUSALEM - The Israeli military announced Tuesday that it has approved "operational plans" for an offensive against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.In a statement, the military said Ori Gordin, commander of the Northern Command, and Oded Basiuk, head of the Operations Directorate, "approved the plans and held a joint situation assessment in the Northern Command" as part of preparations for the continuation of combat against Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border.The military added that "decisions were made on the continuation of increasing readiness of troops in the field".The announcement came amid increasing tensions between the two sides, also at a time when US envoy Amos Hochstein, during his visit to Beirut, called for urgent de-escalation of confrontations on the Israel-Lebanon border.In his meeting with Israeli leaders on Monday, Hochstein also urged relevant sides to soon resolve the conflict along the Blue Line, the border demarcation between Lebanon and Israel, via diplomatic means, which he said would serve everyone's interest and is "achievable and urgent".Tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border escalated on Oct 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the day before. Israel then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.Internal divisions in Israel's government and the dissolution of its war cabinet have cast doubts on Tel Aviv's objectives in Gaza, amid delays in agreeing on a cease-fire deal and the distribution of aid.The war cabinet was dissolved as the Israel Defense Forces announced a "local, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes" between 8 am and 7 pm daily from Sunday until further notice.The IDF said this was to increase the volume of humanitarian aid entering Gaza following discussions with the United Nations and international aid organizations.Analysts said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's latest move and its timing aimed to deflect international criticisms and pacify domestic woes, which are further delegitimizing his embattled government.On Monday, The Times of Israel and other media reported that Netanyahu had disbanded Israel's six-member war cabinet. Netanyahu formed the emergency government on Oct 11 to manage the response to Palestine's Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah following Hamas' surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7.The decision was announced amid pressure from his far-right coalition partners to form a new "war cabinet" and the threats of expanding the Gaza conflict to Lebanon. The announcement came soon after the resignation of Benny Gantz, a retired general and member of Israel's Knesset, on June 9.Nagapushpa Devendra, a West Asia analyst and research scholar at the University of Erfurt in Germany, said dissolving the war cabinet "reflects a shift in Israel's security priorities", with Netanyahu possibly reevaluating the approach to dealing with Hamas and Hezbollah.She said this may be seen as a tactical maneuver by Netanyahu aimed to further consolidate power within the prime minister's office and centralize the decision-making processes, especially now that his political rival Gantz has quit the emergency government."Netanyahu's decision to disband the war cabinet may be a strategic ploy to deflect criticism from the international community and the Israeli public," Devendra told China Daily, noting that Netanyahu may be seeking to enhance his political standing and bolster his reputation on the global stage.She said this could also serve to placate domestic critics who have raised concerns about the government's handling of security issues.'Political maneuver'The timing is "evidence of a calculated political maneuver" with Israel facing mounting pressure from the international community, the West, regional leaders, as well as the Jewish community, Devendra said.Meanwhile, anti-government protesters took to the streets of Jerusalem on Monday amid growing discontent over Netanyahu's handling of the bombardment in Gaza, demanding the freeing of hostages and even calling for elections.By sundown, a crowd of thousands had gathered outside the Knesset before marching to Netanyahu's private home in the city.Separately, the IDF's announcement of a pause in fighting has been called into question with Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, saying that this has not happened.He said hostilities were ongoing in Rafah and in the south of Gaza and that "operationally, nothing has changed yet", Al Jazeera reported.In the south, Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday killed at least 17 Palestinians in two of the Gaza Strip's historic refugee camps and Israeli tanks pushed deeper into the enclave's southern city of Rafah, residents and medics said.In central Gaza, witnesses reported gunfire and artillery shelling near Nuseirat refugee camp, where the civil defense agency said at least 13 people died in two separate strikes on a family home and a commercial building.Witnesses and the Hamas government media office said there were some strikes and fighting elsewhere in northern and central Gaza."The current situation reflects Israel's strategic delaying tactics amid internal turmoil. It is no secret that Israel has long been engulfed in internal conflicts, and now lacks both international and domestic legitimacy," Arhama Siddiqa, a Middle East analyst and research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan, told China Daily.She said the 11-hour pause in hostilities offers a little reprieve, with Israeli atrocities reaching new levels daily and children dying every hour, illustrating the "dire choices between death by bullet or starvation".Agencies contributed to this story.ADEN, Yemen -- A merchant vessel struck by the Yemeni Houthi group days ago has sunk in the Red Sea, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations reported Tuesday.GAZA/JERUSALEM — In tents in the stifling heat and in bombed-out mosques, Gazans marked the start of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha on Sunday, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dissolved the six-member war cabinet.Israeli media reported on Monday that Netanyahu told the security cabinet on Sunday night that the war cabinet, which was created on Oct 11, has been officially disbanded.Netanyahu is now expected to hold consultations about the Gaza conflict with a small group of ministers, including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer who had been in the war cabinet, Reuters reported.The prime minister had faced demands from partners in his coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, to be included in the war cabinet, a move which would have intensified strains with international partners, including the United States.Former general Benny Gantz left the government last week, over what they said was Netanyahu's failure to form a strategy for the Gaza operation.After more than eight months of a devastating Israeli offensive that has flattened much of Gaza, displaced most of the besieged territory's 2.4 million people and sparked repeated warnings of famine, Eid this year is a day of misery for many."There is no joy. We have been robbed of it," said Malakiya Salman, who is now living in a tent in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip."I hope the world will put pressure to end the war on us, because we are truly dying, and our children are broken."Palestinians used to celebrate the holiday by decorating streets and alleys, slaughtering sacrificial animals, exchanging visits to offer greetings, and children and young people by visiting parks and playgrounds in the Strip with their families to have fun.Holiday rituals absentAll the holiday rituals, however, were absent from the family of Ahmed Mansour, who was displaced from his home in Gaza City after October. "I was not able to buy new clothes for my children and we could not prepare the cakes. In short, this holiday came without joy," the 35-year-old father of three told Xinhua News Agency.The Israeli military announced on Sunday morning a "tactical pause of military activity" around a Rafah-area route to facilitate the delivery of desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gazans.The pause "for humanitarian purposes will take place from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm every day until further notice along the road that leads from the Kerem Shalom crossing to the Salah al-Din road and then northward", a military statement said.The United Nations welcomed the Israeli move, although "this has yet to translate into more aid reaching people in need", said Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA.But Netanyahu criticized the plans announced by the military."When the prime minister heard the reports of an 11-hour humanitarian pause in the morning, he turned to his military secretary and made it clear that this was unacceptable to him," an Israeli official said.More than 37,347 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military offensive on Gaza since Hamas' surprise attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed.Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators have been pushing for a new Gaza truce, so far without success.The only previous truce lasted one week in November and saw many hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, while increased aid flowed into Gaza.Hamas has insisted on the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a permanent cease-fire — demands Israel has repeatedly rejected.Agencies - XinhuaJERUSALEM, - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his wartime cabinet, which was created on Oct 11, 2023, an Israeli government official confirmed to Xinhua.The wartime cabinet was established days after the beginning of Israel's conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, in order to discuss Israel's operations in the enclave and along the northern border against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, a Hamas ally in the region.Netanyahu announced the decision during a security cabinet meeting on Sunday, according to the official.The disbanding of the wartime cabinet came as Itamar Ben-Gvir, a right-wing extremist minister of internal security, demanded to join it. His request came following the resignation of Benny Gantz, leader of the only centrist party in Netanyahu's coalition government, on June 9.The wartime cabinet consisted of three members - Netanyahu, Gantz, and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who together made important decisions regarding the military campaign in Gaza.The Group of Seven nations is being urged to do more to end Israeli atrocities in Gaza as Tel Aviv has yet to publicly accept a US-backed United Nations Security Council resolution despite the bloc's claim that it welcomes Israel's acceptance of the proposal.The Islamic Relief group urged the G7 countries Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States to end arms sales to states in which there "are serious risks of international law being violated, such as Israel's actions in Gaza".Military spending was at "record levels" while humanitarian aid to help people affected by wars and disasters had been cut, even as more than 1 million Palestinians are starving, it said.Israel's continued offensives are reported to have killed at least 37,337 Gazans, in response to Hamas' attack on Israel in October, in which about 1,200 people were killed.Eight Israeli soldiers were killed in a blast in southern Gaza on Saturday, the military said.In Rafah, witnesses reported clashes between militants and Israeli troops in the city's west and artillery fire toward a refugee camp in the city center.Abdalfatah Asqool, an international law lecturer at the University of Palestine, told China Daily: "They announce a deal, which is originally an Israeli deal, and they ask Hamas only to say yes to the deal without any comments. This proves that the US is acting as a representative of Israel. They announced that Israel accepted the deal, but we did not hear it from the Israelis themselves."So it is better for the US to stop playing the two faces role, because this will make them keep losing on both the local and international level."Abdul Wahed Jalal Nori, an analyst and lecturer in the Department of Fundamental and Inter-Disciplinary Studies at the International Islamic University Malaysia, told China Daily that what the G7 said at its summit was "insufficient and overly cautious". G7's reliance on US President Joe Biden's proposed deal "places too much responsibility on Hamas to accept terms without significant leverage or guarantees", he said."This is seen as somewhat one-sided, failing to adequately pressure Israel to make concessions necessary for peace, such as easing the blockade on Gaza or addressing settlement activities in the West Bank."At the G7 summit in Apulia, Italy, from Thursday to Saturday, the bloc called on Hamas to accept and implement UN Security Council Resolution 2735 while reaffirming support to Israel and its "right to defend itself", according to a G7 communique published on Friday.Though demanding an increase in humanitarian aid flow, the G7 said it wanted "Israel's security interests and safety for Palestinian civilians in Gaza assured".However, the government of Israel has yet to publicly acknowledge or accept the proposals even though the US has given assurances that Tel Aviv has accepted the conditions.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "faces significant pressure from various domestic political factions", Abdul Wahed said, and acknowledging international calls for a cease-fire or concessions to Hamas "might be seen as a sign of weakness or a betrayal of national security interests"."This could erode political support within right-wing and conservative segments of the Israeli electorate, who favor a hard-line stance against Hamas and other Palestinian factions."Though G7 leaders in their communique reiterated a commitment to a two-state solution, the outcomes "expressly show the double standards of the international community in dealing with the issues", said Asqool of the University of Palestine.The G7 agreed on the right of Ukraine to resist but ignored the Palestinian right to defense against occupying forces and did little for the thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians killed after the Hamas attack in October, Asqool said.Agencies contributed to this story.jan@chinadailyapac.comGAZA -- At least nine Palestinians were killed by an Israeli airstrike on the Al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza on the first day of Eid al-Adha, Palestinian medical sources said on Sunday.The airstrike targeted two residential houses, killing nine people, including six children, and injuring several others who were then taken to the hospital, said medical sources who require anonymity.As of Sunday, the Palestinian death toll from the ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 37,337, with 85,299 injuries, the Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza said.Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a statement on Sunday that fighting continued in the southern Gaza Strip, including in the southernmost Gazan city of Rafah.He also confirmed that the road through which goods pass will be open during daylight hours for the passage of humanitarian aid only.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct. 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage.AMMAN -- Jordan on Sunday confirmed the deaths of 14 citizens and the missing of 17 others who were performing Hajj rituals in Saudi Arabia.Sufian Qudah, the spokesperson for the Jordanian Foreign Ministry, said in a statement that the Jordanian side is following up with concerned Saudi authorities on burials or home returns of the deceased at their families' request.The Saudi authorities were also continuing the search for the 17 missing pilgrims, according to the statement.The statement did not detail further nor disclose the cause of the tragedy, but the Jordanian Foreign Ministry reported a day earlier that six Jordanians had died of heat stroke during the Hajj pilgrimage.Gaza -- About 625,000 children have been denied an education in the Gaza Strip as schools have been forced to remain closed due to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a UN body said on Saturday.The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said in a statement on social media platform X that its crews continue to support Palestinian children through activities that help them return to learning, but this is not enough, stressing the necessity of a ceasefire now.The war robbed the children in Gaza of their childhood, and the survivors are suffering from deep trauma, as their schools were destroyed and they lost an entire academic year without education or play, it added.Children are the first to suffer the most in conflicts and wars, pointing out that a very large number of them have been killed and others injured, and many of them will have scars for life, the statement said.As of Friday, the Palestinian death toll from the ongoing conflict has risen to 37,296, with 85,197 others wounded, Hamas-run health authorities said in a press statement.Also on Saturday, Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a statement that eight Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers were killed in fighting in the southern Gaza Strip.In a separate statement, Adraee said the IDF forces are moving forward with defeating the military wing of Hamas and stripping its Rafah Brigade of its capabilities."The forces in the field daily kill many terrorists and destroy weapons, platforms, and rockets, thus preventing Hamas from returning to action against Israel as it was on Oct. 7," Adraee added.Since last Oct. 7, Israel has been waging a large-scale war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which has led to massive casualties and destruction of homes and infrastructure after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, which claimed the lives of about 1,200 Israelis.JERUSALEM -- The Israel Defense Forces announced on Saturday evening that its eight soldiers were killed in a blast in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah in the morning.MANILA -- The Philippines on Friday said Filipino sailors were among the crew on board a commercial ship attacked by Houthi militants in the Red Sea on June 12."The Philippine government will take all necessary measures to secure the safety and well-being of the Filipino crew on board and ensure justice. We call on all UN member states to protect the human rights of seafarers," said the Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).The DFA did not say how many Filipinos were on board, but Xinhua sources said over 20 Filipino crew members were working on the ship.Yemen's Houthi militants launched a boat-borne bomb attack on Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier MV Tutor in the Red Sea on Wednesday.Filipino sailors have been killed or abducted in Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. The rebels are still holding a number of the kidnapped victims.In April, the Philippines banned the deployment of Filipino seafarers on passenger and cruise ships transiting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden due to the risk of sailing in those regions.The Philippines is among the biggest suppliers of maritime labor in the world, providing almost one-fifth of the 1.2 million seafarers worldwide, according to the International Labor Organization.SANAA - Yemen's Houthi group on Thursday claimed responsibility for missile attacks against three ships in the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea."The first attack targeted the vessel Verbena in the Arabian Sea, causing damage and a fire on board," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a televised statement, adding the other two attacks struck Seaguardian and Athina ships in the Red Sea."All attacks were carried out with several ballistic and naval missiles and drones and achieved their goals successfully," he noted.Since last November, the Houthi group, which controls much of northern Yemen, has initiated the launch of anti-ship ballistic missiles and drones targeting what it said were Israeli-linked ships transiting the Red Sea, to show solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.In response, the U.S.-British naval coalition stationed in the area has since January conducted air raids and missile strikes against Houthi targets to deter the group, which, however, only led to an expansion of Houthi attacks to include U.S. and British commercial vessels and naval ships.Urgent actions are imperative to achieve an immediate, permanent cease-fire and to accelerate humanitarian aid delivery to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to a leaders' statement on Tuesday, as the conflict is triggering wider spillover effects in the region.The "Call for Action: Urgent Humanitarian Response for Gaza" conference in Sweimeh, Jordan, was co-organized by Jordan, Egypt and the United Nations on Tuesday to address the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, where about 1 million civilians are in hunger and forcibly displaced.The statement called for establishing an immediate, permanent cease-fire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and civilians who are being illegally held captive, demanding their safety, well-being and humane treatment in compliance with international law."We cannot abandon Gaza," King Abdullah II of Jordan said at the conference.The leaders expressed grave concerns at the enormous loss of life, the unprecedented civilian casualties and the unfolding man-made humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, caused by the continuing lack of humanitarian access to civilians in need, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs."Humanitarian aid to the Palestinians in Gaza is imperative", said Haoliang Xu, under-secretary-general and UNDP associate administrator, on behalf of UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner, as stated on the United Nations Development Programme website.In his remarks at the conference, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi welcomed the entry of sufficient and sustainable humanitarian aid into Gaza, as well as Resolution 2735 adopted on Monday by the UN Security Council.On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to Qatar for talks after Hamas submitted a response to a US-led proposal for a cease-fire.Blinken, on a four-country tour around the Middle East to push Hamas to accept the truce proposal, will meet the top leadership of Qatar, which has been in communication with the Palestinian militant group.Amendments proposedHamas, responding to the plan laid out late last month by the United States, proposed amendments late on Tuesday, including a ceasefire timeline and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, according to a source close to the talks.Egypt and Qatar said they had received Hamas' response, but did not disclose the content.Hamas' response to a proposed Gaza cease-fire deal "opens up a wide pathway" to reach an agreement, Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said on Wednesday.The movement's response is "responsible, serious and positive", al-Rishq added.The US said Israel accepted its proposal, but Israel has not publicly stated this. As Israel continues its assaults in central and southern Gaza that are among the bloodiest in the conflict, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said Israel would not commit to an end of its assault in Gaza before Hamas is eliminated.As the fate of a cease-fire hangs in the balance, Hezbollah fired a massive barrage of rockets into northern Israel on Wednesday to avenge the killing of a top commander, further escalating regional tensions.Hezbollah said it fired missiles and rockets at two military bases in retaliation for the killing of Taleb Sami Abdullah, 55. Known within Hezbollah as Hajj Abu Taleb, he is the most senior commander killed since the fighting began eight months ago.Hezbollah has traded fire with Israel nearly every day since the Israel-Hamas conflict began and says it will only stop if there is a truce in Gaza.As air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel, the military said about 160 projectiles were fired from southern Lebanon, making it one of the largest attacks since the fighting began. There were no immediate reports of casualties.Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story. KUWAIT CITY -- The death toll from a fire early Wednesday morning in a residential building in the Mangaf area, south of Kuwait City, rose to 49, according to a statement released by the Interior Ministry.Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah ordered an immediate investigation into the cause of the fire, and vowed to hold those responsible accountable, Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported.The emir, Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah Al-Khaled Al-Sabah, and Prime Minister Sheikh Ahmad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah have sent condolence messages to the families of the victims, the KUNA said.Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al-Sabah, Kuwait's first deputy prime minister, defense minister, and interior minister, ordered the detention of individuals involved, including the building owner, until the forensic evidence team completes its investigation.He also instructed relevant government departments to inspect and address violations in the construction sector to avoid similar accidents.Local newspaper, citing anonymous sources, reported that the fire started in the guard's room, spread to a lounge on the first floor, followed by a storage area containing gas cylinders, and eventually engulfed the rest of the building. A large number of residents near the building had been evacuated.According to the sources, around 160 workers were inside the building, with many of the fatalities being of Indian nationality.JERUSALEM - About 160 rockets were fired from Lebanon at northern Israel on Wednesday morning, said the Israeli army, after Israeli airstrikes killed four Hezbollah officials, including a senior commander.The barrage marked the largest rocket attack by militants in Lebanon on Israel since the beginning of the new round of Israel-Hamas conflict on Oct 7, 2023.In the early morning, the military said approximately 90 projectiles were identified launched from Lebanon. The National Fire and Rescue Authority said that the rockets caused fires in several areas.Later in the morning, a barrage of some 70 rockets was fired toward Western Galilee and Mount Meron in Upper Galilee region, where a key aerial defense control unit is located."A number of the projectiles were intercepted, most of them fell in open areas, and several fell in a number of locations in northern Israel," the military said, adding that the details were still under review.So far, no injuries have been reported by the Israeli side.In response to the latest barrage, Israeli aircraft struck the launcher in the area of Yaroun.The Upper Galilee Regional Council called on residents to reduce outdoor activities to essential ones only, citing fear of additional barrages.With the United Nations Security Council adopting a resolution on Monday for a comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza, the international community is calling on Israel to urgently implement the consensus and halt the military campaign that is causing untold suffering to millions of besieged Palestinians.According to a statement published by WAFA news agency, the Palestinian presidency welcomed the adoption of Resolution 2735 by the UN Security Council, calling for an immediate and complete ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, as "a step in the right direction to stop the ongoing war of genocide against the Palestinian people".It also reiterated its call for the implementation of the two-state solution. Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour, who spoke to the media after the vote in New York, said Palestine is "determined with our friends to make a long-lasting, permanent cease-fire".On Tuesday, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri, who is based outside Gaza, said it accepted the cease-fire resolution and was ready to negotiate over the details.It is up to Washington to ensure that Israel abides by it, he added. He said Hamas accepted the formula stipulating the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a swap of hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel.Belal Alakhras, a political analyst and Palestinian researcher at the University of Malaya in Malaysia, told China Daily that the resolution endorsing a cease-fire in Gaza reflects the international consensus that "continuing the genocidal war is illegitimate and that restoring stability in the region is urgently needed".US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the fighting could "stop today if Hamas agrees to the deal now endorsed by the Security Council".But Reut Shapir Ben-Naftaly, political coordinator of the Israeli mission to the UN, said her country's goals have been "very clear "since Oct 7, namely to bring all Israeli hostages home and dismantle Hamas and its capabilities, ensuring that Gaza "does not pose a threat to Israel in the future".She also said Israel "will not engage in meaningless and endless negotiations which can be exploited by Hamas as a means to stall for time".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday following the rescue of four Israeli hostages that Israel would not relent "until we complete the mission and return all our hostages home, both the living and the deceased".Last week, Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich issued calls to "expand the war in Gaza" and to invade southern Lebanon.Turkiye welcomed the UNSC resolution as "an important step toward putting an end to the massacre", and lauded Hamas' "constructive and positive approach" to the cease-fire plan. "It is imperative that Israel announces its commitment to the implementation of a permanent cease-fire and fully implements all elements of the resolution," the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement.Alakhras noted that the US vetoed three cease-fire proposals while enabling Israel's conflict in Gaza for more than eight months, leading to unprecedented killing and destruction that impacted the entire region and swayed the US' and international public opinion.Dire need"This inconsistency highlights the world's dire need for a system not confined to one major power that can rapidly reverse course on matters of self-inflicted consequence. The priority now is implementing this resolution, though Palestinians seek guarantees that the war will truly end, while Israeli leaders publicly want to achieve all objectives of their total war," he said.Further, he said emerging powers on the Security Council "should take the initiative to promote stability proactively, not just react after massive lives and interests are impacted".In a social media post, Francesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the West Bank and Gaza, welcomed the cease-fire resolution, but shared what she called "some critical observations".She said the UNSC "cannot infringe people's right to self-determination" as it lacked the authority to determine who will or should rule over Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory, and underscored that only Palestinians will have to choose via "free and democratic elections".Agencies contributed to this story.DOHA/CAIRO - Qatar and Egypt have received a response from Hamas regarding the proposal for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, according to a statement by the Qatari Foreign Ministry on Tuesday.Hamas and other Palestinian factions responded Tuesday to "the most recent proposal for a ceasefire deal and the exchange of prisoners and detainees", it said.The two countries confirmed that they are mediating alongside the United States until an agreement is reached, but did not disclose details, according to the statement.The mediators "will examine the response and coordinate with the parties concerned regarding the next steps", it added.The Egyptian Foreign Ministry also announced on Tuesday that it had received a response of Hamas and the Palestinian factions to the latest ceasefire proposal and prisoners-detainees swap deal.In a joint statement sent to Xinhua, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Islamic Jihad said that a delegation from the two movements delivered the Palestinian factions' response on Tuesday to Qatar during a meeting with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, and the response was also delivered to the Egyptian side.The statement added that the response prioritizes the interests of the Palestinian people and emphasizes the necessity of completely stopping the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.It noted that the delegation expressed its readiness to engage positively to reach an agreement that would end this war against the Palestinian people.The submission of the response follows the adoption by the UN Security Council on Monday of an American draft resolution aiming to reach a comprehensive agreement for a three-phase ceasefire to end the war in Gaza.The resolution was adopted with 14 votes in favor and Russia abstaining. According to the resolution, the first phase includes an "immediate and complete ceasefire with the release of hostages and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners".The second phase will see a permanent cessation of hostilities "in exchange for the release of all other hostages still in Gaza and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza".In the third phase, a "major multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza" will begin, and the remains of any hostages who were killed and are still in Gaza will be returned to Israel.The resolution stated that Israel has "accepted" the agreement and "calls on" Hamas to do the same.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage. JERUSALEM -- An Israeli official said on Tuesday that Israel had received Hamas's response to the US-drafted proposal for a ceasefire-hostage release deal and the movement had rejected it, Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported.Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad said in a joint statement earlier in the day that they had delivered their response to the proposal to Qatari and Egyptian mediators, expressing a "willingness to deal positively in order to reach an agreement." They emphasized their priority of stopping the war in the Gaza Strip and ensuring the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory.Israel has yet to formally announce its position, although both US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had endorsed the proposal.White House spokesman John Kirby said the US had received Hamas's response and was evaluating it.As tensions rise on the Israel-Lebanon border, Iran hopes the situation can be de-escalated and there is no new full-blown war in the region, with Israel urged not to launch any actions that infringe on Lebanon's territorial integrity.Israel's actions have led to instability and insecurity in the region, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said at a press conference on June 10 in Teheran. The United Nations should take Israel's threats against Lebanon seriously, and any provocative actions that infringe on Lebanon's territorial integrity should be strongly condemned, Kanaani added.Israeli military have said they are ready for cross-border attacks while Lebanon resistance forces said they will counter possible Israeli offensives, according to local media.Mehran Kamrava, a professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar, said that Iran considers Hezbollah to be a strategic ally and Lebanon to be a part of Iran's strategic steps. Any attack to Lebanon from Israel might be detrimental to Iran's military and strategic objectives."As a result, Iran wants to ensure that the genocide in Gaza does not extend to Lebanon. That's why, for the various reasons, Iran doesn't want to see an expansion of the conflict and war to Lebanon," he added.The Israeli military said on June 10 that it has established a new battalion solely focused on operating the country's "Iron Dome" aerial defense system to better intercept the growing number of drones from Lebanon.Lebanese armed group Hezbollah said on June 10 that it shot down an Israeli drone over southern Lebanon. The Iran-backed group said in a statement that its fighters ambushed a Hermes 900 drone armed with missiles and targeted it with air defense weapons before the drone could carry out its attack, Xinhua News agency reported.A Lebanese military source told Xinhua that a surface-to-air missile launched from southern Lebanon struck an Israeli drone, causing it to catch fire before landing in the vicinity of al-Rehan mountain in Jezzine District, situated deep in southern Lebanon.Arhama Siddiqa, a Middle East analyst and research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan, said global protests and statements condemning Israel's actions are testament to their eroding legitimacy. The region teeters on the brink, unable to bear another full-scale conflict, she said."Any significant response from Hezbollah or other actors will likely come only after a consensus is reached among the various factions. The region is delicately balanced, and while a strategic response may occur to curb Israeli provocations, the broader aim remains to avoid an all-out conflict," Siddiqa told China Daily."The complex web of alliances and the potential for widespread destabilization act as significant deterrents against a full-blown war," she added.A social media user said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on June 11: "Israel shouldn't make its wish come true, because Lebanon is supposed to be a sovereign country. All-out war with Hezbollah would draw Iran into the conflict, then who knows which Arab countries might want to side with them."Earlier, on June 9, two members of Hezbollah were killed and three civilians injured on June 9 in Israeli airstrikes on Lebanese villages, Lebanese military sources said, according to Xinhua.Israel's widespread use of white phosphorus in south Lebanon on June 4 has put civilians at grave risk, contributing to civilian displacement, non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch said.Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story.JERUSALEM/GAZA — A key member of Israel's war cabinet quit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on Sunday, heaping domestic pressure on the Israeli leader as the conflict in Gaza rages.Benny Gantz, a former Israeli general and defense minister, announced his resignation from the emergency body after failing to get a postwar plan for Gaza approved by Netanyahu, which he demanded in May.Although his departure is not expected to bring down the government, it marks the first political blow to Netanyahu eight months into the Gaza assault against Palestinian Hamas militants."Netanyahu is preventing us from progressing to a real victory. That is why we are leaving the emergency government today with a heavy heart," Gantz said.Netanyahu responded within minutes, saying: "Benny, this is not the time to abandon the battle — this is the time to join forces."It came after Israeli special forces fought gunbattles with Palestinian militants over the weekend in central Gaza's crowded Nuseirat refugee camp area as they swooped in to free the four captives.The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said 274 people were killed and 698 wounded, in what it labeled the "Nuseirat massacre".Among those were at least 64 children, 57 women and 37 elderly people, the ministry said."People were screaming — young and old, women and men," said Nuseirat resident Muhannad Thabet, 35."Everyone wanted to flee the place, but the bombing was intense and anyone who moved was at risk of being killed due to the heavy bombardment and gunfire."Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh on Sunday condemned the "horrific massacre" in Nuseirat and insisted that "any agreement reached must include a permanent cessation of aggression, a complete withdrawal from the strip, an exchange deal and reconstruction".On Monday, Palestinian residents said tanks had been trying to thrust deeper toward the north in the early hours of Monday, edging Shaboura, one of the most densely populated and militant stronghold neighborhoods at the heart of the city.Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 37,124 people in Gaza, in response to Hamas' surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7, which has killed about 1,200 people.Domestic discontentAdding to the domestic discontent over Netanyahu's handling of the eight-month conflict, a senior military commander, Brigadier General Avi Rosenfeld, also resigned on Sunday over what he called his failure to prevent the Oct 7 attack.National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir demanded to join the war cabinet in place of Gantz.Netanyahu is also under growing pressure from his far-right coalition allies, who have threatened to quit the government if he goes ahead with a hostage release deal outlined by US President Joe Biden last month.Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have insisted that the government should not enter into any deal and continue the assault until the end goal of destroying Hamas has been achieved.A senior Hamas official urged the United States on Monday to pressure Israel to end the conflict in Gaza, ahead of a planned visit on Monday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the region to push forward cease-fire efforts."We call upon the US administration to put pressure on the occupation to stop the war on Gaza and the Hamas movement is ready to deal positively with any initiative that secures an end to the war," senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said.Blinken arrived in Egypt on Monday at the start of a regional tour to push for a much-awaited Gaza ceasefire. He also aims to ensure the conflict does not expand into Lebanon.Two members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah were killed and three civilians injured on Sunday in Israeli airstrikes on Lebanese villages, Xinhua reported, citing Lebanese military sources.In his eighth visit to the region since Oct 7, Blinken met Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo before heading to Jerusalem later on Monday to meet Netanyahu.Agencies—Xinhua GAZA -- The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) announced on Monday that it welcomes a resolution adopted by the UN Security Council earlier in the day aimed at reaching a comprehensive ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza.Hamas expressed in a statement its readiness to cooperate with the mediators to engage in indirect negotiations to implement resolution principles "that are consistent with the demands of our people and resistance," including a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces, prisoner-hostage exchange and reconstruction.The movement reiterated its commitment to continuing its "endeavor and struggle" for the Palestinian people's national rights.The Palestinian presidency hailed the adoption of the resolution as a step in the right direction to stop the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian News Agency WAFA reported.The Palestinian presidency also called on all parties to fulfill their responsibilities to implement the resolution.The UN Security Council on Monday adopted a resolution aimed at reaching a comprehensive ceasefire deal in three phases to end the war in Gaza.Adopted by a large majority with 14 votes in favor and Russia abstaining, the resolution also urges both parties to the conflict to fully implement the terms of the proposal "without delay and without condition."GAZA/CAIRO — Israeli forces pounded central Gaza anew on Sunday, a day after killing 274 Palestinians during a hostage rescue raid, and tanks advanced further into areas of Rafah in a bid to seal off part of the southern city, according to residents and Hamas media.Palestinians remained in shock over Saturday's death toll, the worst over a 24-hour period of the Palestine-Israel conflict for months that included many women and children, Palestinian medics said.In an update on Sunday, Gaza's Health Ministry said 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 were injured when Israeli special force commandos stormed into the densely populated Nuseirat refugee camp to rescue four hostages held since October by Hamas militants."My child was crying, afraid of the sound of the plane firing at us," Hadeel Radwan, 32, said, recounting how they fled the intense combat as she carried her 7-month-old daughter."We all felt that we wouldn't survive," she told Agence France-Presse, condemning "this brutal occupation that will not let us live".Israel's military said a special forces officer was killed in the exchange of fire with militants emerging from cover in residential blocks, and that it knew of "under 100" Palestinians killed, though not knowing how many of them were militants or civilians.Egypt condemned "with the strongest terms" Israel's attacks on the Nuseirat camp, with its Foreign Ministry calling it a "flagrant violation of all rules of international law".Jordan also condemned it.The rescued hostages were taken to hospital for medical checks and were in good health, the Israeli military said. They were all kidnapped during the attack by Hamas militants on Israeli towns and villages near Gaza on Oct 7, which precipitated the devastating offensive on Gaza.Hamas' raid killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities, and Israel's retaliatory bombardment and assault of Gaza has killed at least 37,084 Palestinians, Gaza's Health Ministry said on Sunday.Abu Ubaida, spokesperson for Hamas' armed al-Qassam Brigades, said some hostages were killed during the rescue operation."It's a blatant lie," Israeli military spokesman Peter Lerner told CNN, refuting the claim.On Sunday, three Palestinians were killed and several hurt in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Bureij in the central Gaza Strip, while tanks shelled parts of nearby Maghazi and Nuseirat. All are built-up, historical refugee camps. JERUSALEM -- Israel's centrist War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz announced on Sunday that he was resigning from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's emergency government and called for new elections. He accused Netanyahu of prioritizing narrow political considerations over the return of hostages and victory over Hamas.GAZA - The death toll in the Israeli military operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on Saturday has risen to 274, with 698 injured, Hamas-run health authorities said in a press statement on Sunday.The statement noted some victims remained under the rubble amid heavy bombardment and a lack of rescue crews.During the operation, Israeli forces rescued four hostages from the refugee camp, namely Noa Argamani, 25, Shlomi Ziv, 40, Almog Meir Jan, 21, and Andrey Kozlov, 27, all of them among the about 250 Israelis abducted last October by Hamas while attending the Nova festival, an outdoor music event, in a rural area near the Gaza-Israel fence.After the Hamas rampage, which killed about 1,200 according to Israeli tallies, Israel launched a retaliatory large-scale offensive in Gaza, which so far has killed 37,084 and injured 84,494 others, according to Gaza's health authorities.GAZA -- During its operation to release four hostages in the central Gaza Strip, the Israeli army had killed several other hostages held there, Hamas armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said on Saturday.In a statement, Al-Qassam denounced the Israeli military operation in the Nuseirat area in central Gaza as "a complex war crime," saying "the first to be harmed by it" were Israeli hostages."The operation will pose a great danger to the enemy's prisoners and will have a negative impact on their conditions and lives," Abu Obaida, spokesperson for Al-Qassam, said in the statement.At least 210 Palestinians were killed and more than 400 others injured in Israeli airstrikes on Saturday in central Gaza, where the Israeli forces rescued four hostages kidnapped by Hamas into the strip last October.The Israeli army, police, and intelligence body Shin Bet said in a joint statement that their fighters had attacked "a terrorist structure" in the region and freed four Israeli hostages.It noted that the kidnapped persons were rescued alive from two separate areas in the heart of Nuseirat.Following the rescue of the four, 120 Israeli hostages remain held in Gaza, including 43 feared dead, according to the Israeli army.Israel's attacks on central Gaza are the latest development of the deadly conflict between Israel and Gaza-ruling Hamas which began on Oct. 7, 2023, after Hamas militants stormed southern Israel from Gaza in a surprise attack, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to the Palestinian enclave.ISTANBUL -- The extraordinary meeting of foreign ministers of Developing 8 (D-8) countries held in Turkiye's Istanbul called on Saturday for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip."We demand an immediate, permanent, and unconditional ceasefire in Gaza and a halt to Israel's attacks on the Palestinian people," the ministers stated in a declaration after the meeting, Turkiye's state-run Anadolu news agency reported.The declaration noted that D-8 member states would offer unwavering support for Palestine's pursuit of full membership in the United Nations (UN) and its struggle for self-determination.At a press conference after the meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said D-8 countries will not remain silent in the face of Israeli atrocities in Gaza."We will work with all our strength to end the Israeli occupation and achieve the two-state solution," Fidan added.Advocating for the acceptance of Palestine's UN membership, the minister stressed that "Palestine's full membership in the UN is hindered by the US veto.As D-8 countries, we demand an immediate end to this injustice." D-8, established in 1997, is an organization for development cooperation among Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkiye. GAZA -- At least 210 Palestinians were killed and more than 400 others injured on Saturday by Israeli airstrikes in the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said. JERUSALEM -- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Saturday said that it rescued four Israeli hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas in the Gaza Strip on Oct 7, 2023.The four, Noa Argamani, Shlomi Ziv, Almog Meir Jan, and Andrey Kozlov, were located in two places in the center of Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp, in proper medical condition.The IDF conducted the operation with the Israel Security Agency and a police elite unit. GAZA -- At least 55 Palestinians were killed and dozens of others injured on Saturday in Israeli airstrikes on the Nuseirat camp and some other areas in the central Gaza Strip, according to medical sources.Khalil Al-Dakran, director of Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, told Xinhua that a large number of wounded Palestinians were sent to the hospital due to the intense Israeli bombing on the Nuseirat camp and the city of Deir Al-Balah, some of whom have been confirmed dead.Wounded Palestinians were still being sent in, overwhelming the hospital amid a severe shortage of beds, medicines, medical consumables, and fuel to run the main emergency generator, said Al-Dakran.Palestinian eyewitnesses told Xinhua that Israeli aircraft targeted the area with intensive firepower, and local civil defense and ambulances were unable to reach some injured people in time.Meanwhile, Palestinian security sources said deadly clashes broke out on the ground between Palestinian militants and Israeli troops raiding the Nuseirat camp under the cover of artillery and aerial bombardment.The Israeli army, police, and intelligence body Shin Bet said in a joint statement that "our forces are attacking a terrorist structure" in the region and freed four Israeli hostages.It noted that the kidnapped persons were rescued by Shin Bet fighters and the Special Police Unit from two separate areas in the heart of Nuseirat.The statement confirmed that the health condition of the hostages was good, and they were transferred for medical examinations to Tel Hashomer Hospital in Israel.JERUSALEM - Israel's General of the Northern Command Ori Gordin said Thursday that the deployment for a major offensive against Hezbollah has been "completed".Speaking in a ceremony to mark 18 years of the 2006 Lebanon War, which was fought between Israel and Hezbollah, mainly on Lebanese soil, Gordin said that the army's mission is "returning security to northern Israel"."We don't have a choice but to continue the fight until achieving this mission," he said, adding that the preparations were completed over the past week.Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire along the Israel-Lebanon border since Oct 7, 2023, but Israel has threatened to launch a full-fledged war against Hezbollah if calm is not restored.SANAA - The Houthi group in Yemen said it carried out two joint operations on Thursday with Iraq's Islamic resistance groups targeting the port of Haifa in Israel.GAZA -- At least 35 Palestinians were killed and dozens of others injured in an Israeli air strike targeting a school housing displaced people in the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, the Palestinian official news agency WAFA reported on Thursday.An Israeli fighter jet bombed at least three classrooms with several missiles, medical sources told Xinhua.Hamas-run media office in Gaza condemned Israel's attack on the school as a "terrible massacre" in a statement, calling it "clear evidence of the crime of genocide committed against civilians."The office said that Israel and the United States "should bear full responsibility for these crimes that endanger humanity and violate international law."Israel Defense Forces attacked a Hamas compound inside a school in the Nuseirat area during the night, eliminating many saboteurs who participated in an attack on Oct. 7, 2023, said Avichay Adraee, Israeli military spokesperson, in a statement on Thursday.The International Labour Organization (ILO) said that economic activity in all regions has returned — in varying degrees — to levels seen during the pre-pandemic period, but warned that some crises, like the Gaza conflict, could jeopardize these gains.This was revealed by ILO Director-General Gilbert F. Houngbo during his opening address at the 112th International Labour Conference (ILC) in Geneva, Switzerland, on June 3. In his speech, he expressed "ambivalence" where "we are making remarkable, positive and encouraging progress", but also "facing a never-ending chain of challenges and crises".Houngbo noted that global macroeconomic prospects were "stable", citing the International Monetary Fund's growth forecast in global gross domestic product (GDP) of 3.2 percent in 2024 and 2025.He lauded the "effective action taken by central banks" to bring inflation under control, which has also made a positive contribution to the global economy."In this sense, the surges in inflation should abate, with inflation decreasing from 5.8 percent in 2024 to 4.4 percent in 2025. I sincerely hope that this could relieve the purchasing power of workers, which has been badly affected," said Houngbo.As regards the labor market, Houngbo said the ILO is forecasting a global unemployment rate of 4.9 percent in 2024 and 2025, which was a slight fall in relation to 2023, when it stood at 5 percent. It is also a downward revision of the previous forecast of 5.2 percent, which was made in November 2023. The unemployment rate of 4.9 percent translates to "a total of 183 million unemployed persons throughout the world".As he warned of the challenges, the ILO chief cited the conflicts in Yemen, Sudan, Ukraine, among others, but said the "appalling situation in the Middle East" – referring to Gaza – has "added to the existing crises" as the global sources of tension "have intensified"."The absolutely awful conflicts in Gaza", Houngbo said, continued to be major problems for humanity and more especially for multilateralism.In a report published by the United Nations Development Programme in May, titled "Gaza war: expected socioeconomic impacts on the State of Palestine", it noted that the unemployment rate in the occupied Palestinian territories (Gaza, East Jerusalem and West Bank) is estimated to have reached 46.1 percent "after six months of war, compared to 25.7 percent before the war", and could get worse by the ninth month.Further, the report, citing the ILO, stated that 160,000 workers from the West Bank have either lost their jobs in Israel and the settlements, at least temporarily, or are at risk of losing them as a result of restrictions imposed on Palestinians' access to the Israeli labor market and the closures of crossings from the West Bank into Israel and the settlements."Only 8,000 temporary permits have been issued by Israel for workers from the West Bank since the current war began," the report stated.The report also noted before the conflict, Gaza was already grappling with a "hyper-unemployment" rate of 45 percent, with youth unemployment at nearly 62.6 percent in 2022. The freeze of work permits in Israel and the destruction of physical assets, personal injuries, internal displacement, and the halt of economic activity have compounded the situation.The ILO estimated as of January this year, 507,000 jobs had been lost across the occupied Palestinian territory. This included 201,000 jobs lost in Gaza, with an estimated loss of 12.3 million new Israeli shekels ($3.3 million) in total daily labor income.But as the conflict marks its eighth month, several international humanitarian organizations have witnessed the collapse of Gaza's infrastructure, including its healthcare system as the International Rescue Committee noted that "100 percent of the Gazans" are currently facing a crisis level of food insecurity — the highest share ever classified for "any area or country".The group cited Israel's blockade of food, water, fuel and essential medicines and supplies that is "inflicting immense suffering on Palestinians". Forced displacement had already pushed over a million people away from Rafah, according to the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency on June 3.In May, more than 50 international rights groups called for an official declaration of famine in Gaza, blaming Israel's alleged use of starvation as a "weapon", which contravenes international law.Israelis and Palestinians have been locked in heavy combat since Oct 7 last year after a rampage by Palestinian militant group Hamas inside Israel killed 1,200 people, and more than 200 people were taken hostages. Eight months of Israeli retaliation have left the Gaza Strip in ruins and at least 36,000 Palestinians dead.The ILO annual conference brings together worker, employer, and government delegates from 187-member states to address a wide range of issues that have a long-term impact on the world of work.jan@chinadailyapac.comA group of United Nations experts have called for global recognition of a Palestinian state, reiterating that a two-state solution remains the only internationally agreed path to lasting peace. Their appeal came as some countries expressed support for the latest US-initiated Gaza cease-fire plan.Over a dozen UN experts — including UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese — issued a news release on Monday.The statement said recognition of a Palestinian state "was an important acknowledgment of the rights of the Palestinian people and their struggles and suffering toward freedom and independence".This is a precondition for lasting peace in Palestine and the entire Middle East — beginning with the immediate declaration of a ceasefire in Gaza and no further military incursions into Rafah, the experts said, noting that 146 UN member states now recognize the State of Palestine, Xinhua reported."A two-state solution remains the only internationally agreed path to peace and security for both Palestine and Israel and a way out of generational cycles of violence and resentment," said the UN experts.Norway, Ireland and Spain made a coordinated announcement on May 22, declaring their recognition of Palestine as a state effective as of May 28.Israel has continued with its offensive in Gaza, where Al Jazeera reported on Tuesday that 45 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours.Meanwhile, the Gaza media office announced that more than 3,500 children under the age of 5 in the Palestinian enclave were at risk of death, blaming Israel for its alleged starvation policy.The foreign ministers of Egypt, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates on Monday underscored the importance of dealing with the US-authored cease-fire proposal "seriously and positively" as they reiterated that achieving the two-state solution is the only way to ensure security and peace in the entire region.Omar Awadallah, head of the UN organizations department in the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, told China Daily that a multilateral world where countries can live together is becoming an example.Awadallah said talks between Chinese and Arab leaders at the 10th ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing in May set a new example of a relationship based on a shared future.International consensusHe noted that the international consensus on the Palestinian question is the two-state solution "based on international law, based on ending the Israeli occupation".Bringing peace, stability, and security to the region needs one thing, Awadallah said. "That means the establishment and materializing the State of Palestine and the independence of Palestine, without the Israeli occupation based on the 1967 border, and with the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination."On May 10, the UN General Assembly adopted a historic resolution, which saw 143 votes in favor of the Palestinian bid to become a full UN member, with nine voting against, including the US and Israel, and 25 members abstaining, including the United Kingdom.The US had vetoed a similar move at the UN Security Council on April 18.In the latest US-backed peace proposal, President Joe Biden announced a three-phase plan between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday.The offer calls for a cease-fire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the reconstruction of Gaza.Israel's continued offensives killed at least 36,550 people in Gaza, in response to Hamas' surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people.Militants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, Agence France-Presse reported.Four more hostages were declared dead by the Israeli military on Monday.Hundreds of people, including relatives of the captives, gathered outside Israel's Defense Ministry and military headquarters in central Tel Aviv late on Monday, calling for a peace deal. Smaller protests also took place across the country.Ayman Talal Yousef, a professor of international relations at the Arab American University in Jenin in the West Bank, noted that the Biden administration's cease-fire proposal was also aimed "to neutralize the pressures being exercised internally on the Biden administration itself"."There is a growing anger among many people within the Democratic Party regarding the policies and decisions taken by the Biden administration to resolve this conflict and to end atrocities and aggression exercised by Israel in Gaza," Yousef told China Daily."The US public opinion is also changing in favor of the Palestinian narrative," he said.Yousef noted that those now speaking up in the US include "large segments of the public, mainly university students, intellectuals, media, and civil society organizations".Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story.SANAA -- The US Navy said late Tuesday that the Yemeni Houthi group launched two anti-ship ballistic missiles into the Red Sea in the past 24 hours."In the past 24 hours, Iranian-backed Houthis launched two anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM) from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen into the Red Sea. There were no injuries or damage reported by the US, coalition, or commercial ships," the US Central Command said on X."This continued malign and reckless behavior by the Iranian-backed Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden," it said.The Houthi group, which controls much of northern Yemen, began last November to launch anti-ship ballistic missiles and drones targeting what they said were Israeli-linked ships transiting the Red Sea to show solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.In response, the US-British naval coalition stationed in the waters since January has conducted air raids and missile strikes against Houthi targets to deter the group, but this only led to an expansion of Houthi attacks to include US and British commercial vessels and naval ships. GAZA/JERUSALEM -- Israeli fighter jets targeted Hamas positions in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, with ground forces simultaneously operating in the area based on intelligence, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on Tuesday.In a separate statement, Adraee reported that Israeli forces conducted a "precise raid operation" in Gaza City's Sabra neighborhood last week, discovering rocket warheads hidden in bags belonging to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The UN agency, which plays a critical role in providing humanitarian aid in Gaza, has not commented on the Israeli claims.Adraee also announced the completion of the destruction of a 1.5-kilometer-long and 23-meter-deep underground tunnel on Monday. The tunnel, used by Hamas, bypassed areas where Israeli forces are stationed. The exact location of the tunnel was not disclosed.On May 7, the Israeli military expanded its operations in Rafah, directing over 1.5 million Palestinians to move to Khan Younis and other central Gaza areas. The UNRWA estimates that these areas now shelter approximately 1.7 million people.Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation for the group's October assault on southern Israel, which resulted in around 1,200 deaths and over 200 hostages taken.RAFAH/JERUSALEM — Fresh strikes were reported across the Gaza Strip overnight into Monday, as doubts were growing about a plan for a Gaza cease-fire and hostage release deal outlined by the United States.US President Joe Biden on Friday presented what he labeled an Israeli three-phase plan that would end the conflict, free all hostages and the reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian territory.Israeli media have questioned to what extent Biden's speech and some crucial details were coordinated with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's team, including how long any truce would hold and how many captives would be freed when.Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir accused Netanyahu on Monday of trying to "whitewash" the deal to wind down the Gaza assault and repeated a threat to quit the government.Mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States said they called "on both Hamas and Israel to finalize the agreement".White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Sunday that "we have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal … that Israel would say yes".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken "commended" Israel on the plan in a phone call with War Cabinet member Benny Gantz and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the State Department said.Hamas has said it "views positively" the deal while the Palestinian National Liberation Movement on Sunday expressed its hope that the proposal will end Israeli aggression in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.But the bombardments and combat show no sign of easing, with the conflict soon entering its ninth month.On Monday, the Israeli military said over the past day its forces had struck "over 50 targets in the Gaza Strip".Fighting has continued to rock Gaza, with hospitals there reporting at least 19 killed in overnight strikes into Monday morning.Airstrikes and shelling were reported in Gaza City as well as in Rafah.Crossing reopening talksEgyptian state-linked Al-Qahera News said a Sunday meeting in Cairo with Israeli and US officials to discuss reopening the crossing had ended, without saying whether an agreement was reached.Quoting a senior official, Al-Qahera said Egypt reiterated its demand that "Israel withdraw from the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing so it can resume operations".The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said Sunday that all 36 of its shelters in Rafah "are now empty" after at least a million people fled the city.Adding to the region's tension, Israeli airstrikes after midnight Monday killed 12 pro-Iranian militias in Syria's northern province of Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.The attack hit several sites in the countryside of Aleppo. Several explosions were heard across the area.Meanwhile, the Maldives government will ban Israelis from the Indian Ocean archipelago, the office of the president said on Sunday, announcing a national rally in "solidarity with Palestine".Israel's Foreign Ministry said in response that the ministry recommends Israelis avoid any travel to the Maldives, including those with foreign passports, and those currently there to consider leaving.Agencies - Xinhua CAIRO -- The foreign ministers of Egypt, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Monday stressed the importance of dealing seriously and positively with the US President's proposal leading to a deal that guarantees a permanent ceasefire and the adequate delivery of aid to the Gaza Strip.In a joint statement issued after a virtual meeting, the foreign ministers of the five Arab countries said they had discussed developments in the mediation efforts undertaken by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States that will lead to a permanent ceasefire, the release of hostages and detainees, and the adequate entry of aid into Gaza.The foreign ministers of Jordan, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia affirmed their support for the mediation efforts, according to a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry.The ministers also highlighted the need to stop the aggression against Gaza and end the humanitarian catastrophe it has triggered, the return of the displaced to their homes, and the complete withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from the Gaza Strip.They reaffirmed that achieving the two-state solution is the only way to achieve security and peace for the entire region, and to this end, implementing relevant UN Security Council resolutions with clear timelines and binding guarantees.The international community has slammed Israel's plan to designate the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA, as a "terrorist organization", calling the proposal "outrageous" and warning that it would have "terrible consequences" in worsening the already dire situation in Gaza.The Knesset, the unicameral parliament of Israel, on May 29 passed a preliminary reading of a bill designating UNRWA a terrorist organization. The bill will abolish immunity and privileges for UNRWA personnel, the Jerusalem Post reported.Further, if the bill passes the final reading, the Anti-Terrorism Law will also apply to UNRWA, enabling Israel to cease all ties with the UN agency, and leading to closure of the humanitarian agency's operations in Israeli territory.Mohammad Abualrob, director of the Palestinian Government Communications Center in the West Bank, told China Daily that Israel's allegations against UNRWA "are fundamentally baseless"."Most donor countries supporting UNRWA have resumed their funding after recognizing the inaccuracy of Israel's claims. However, the Israeli Knesset's vote to designate the UN agency as a 'terrorist organization' will undoubtedly impact its operations in the Palestinian territories," said Abualrob.This designation, he said, would affect the entry of UNRWA's foreign staff into Palestine, as "their access is controlled through Israeli crossing points"."It will also hinder the agency's ability to pay salaries to its staff, procure aid, and distribute it to the 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem who rely on this support," he added.Christopher Lockyear, secretary general of Medicins Sans Frontieres International (MSF), said in a statement that the bill is an "outrageous attack on humanitarian assistance" and an act of collective punishment against the Palestinian people."Not only is humanitarian aid being obstructed, but if the bill passes a final reading, it will also be criminalized under Israel's Anti-Terrorism Law, in contradiction with international humanitarian law," said Lockyear.He said it would have terrible consequences as it could amount to a "free license" to attack UNRWA facilities and its humanitarian personnel, and would further endanger civilians seeking the protection of the UN agency.The MSF urged Israel's allies, which "are all members of the UN", to "stop the bloodshed" and "stand against this move to criminalize humanitarian assistance and ensure that UNRWA can continue its essential work".Saudi Arabia and Qatar condemned the Israeli parliament's move, with the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying in a statement that such classification "aims to lift the diplomatic immunity of UNRWA employees who are doing their duty to alleviate the severity of the humanitarian catastrophe that the Palestinian people are going through"."The Kingdom stresses that Israel, as an occupying state, must abide by international humanitarian law and stop obstructing the work of international organizations," the Saudi ministry said.Qatar's foreign ministry said in a statement that attempting to classify the UNRWA as a terrorist organization is "an extension of the systematic campaign aimed at dismantling the agency" at a time when the need for its humanitarian services is dire "due to the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip"."The Ministry of Foreign Affairs renews the State of Qatar's call for the international community to stand firmly in the face of Israeli plans aimed at liquidating the agency and depriving millions of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon of its necessary services," the statement said.Also weighing in was the European Union, which said it was deeply concerned about the terrorist designation and the Israeli Land Authority ordering UNRWA to vacate its East Jerusalem premises within the next 30 days."We recall the crucial and irreplaceable role of UNRWA in the humanitarian response in Gaza. UNRWA provides vital services to millions of people in Gaza, the West Bank, as well as across the region, including in Lebanon and Jordan," the EU said in a statement on May 31."The EU is a firm supporter of the United Nations, and the multilateral and rules based global governance system, of which UNRWA, as a UN agency, is a part. We urge the Israeli authorities to allow UNRWA to continue carrying out its crucial work in line with its mandate," it added.Last month, the International Crisis Group designated Gaza as "currently the most dangerous place for aid workers in the world".

Gaza has seen as many as 125,000 casualties of Palestinian civilians, most of whom are women and children, according to the joint declaration.Palestinians in Gaza are subject to "fatal famines and blockades", and Israel is responsible for the humanitarian plight there, it said.Both China and Arab states said they oppose the implementation of any plan, intention and behavior forcing Palestinian people to move from their land.They urged the United Nations Security Council to adopt resolutions that are more binding to achieve an immediate, comprehensive and lasting cease-fire, stop the forced migration of Palestinian people and guarantee the provision of rescue supplies to Gaza.Niu Xinchun, executive director of the China-Arab Research Institute of Ningxia University, said the joint declaration reflects the consistent position shared by China and Arab states over the conflict in Gaza.The international community has been concerned by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Niu said, adding that "an unconditional ceasefire is the most important way" to solve the crisis."China is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a major country, while the Arab world is among the most influential external forces over the Gaza conflict," Niu said. Such a joint declaration will serve to place "great pressure on Israel", thus helping to promote a cease-fire, he said.In the declaration, both sides voiced their support for Palestine becoming an official member state of the UN, and condemned the United States for using its veto power to stop it from becoming a UN member state.They also welcomed the recent trend in which many countries have recognized as the State of Palestine, and urged countries that haven't made the recognition to do so as soon as possible.Norway, Spain and Ireland formally recognized the State of Palestine on Tuesday, less than three weeks after the UN General Assembly convened an emergency special session and overwhelmingly adopted a resolution urging the Security Council to reconsider Palestine's full UN membership.The two-state solution is receiving increasingly extensive support in the world, Niu said, adding that more than 140 of the 193 UN member states have recognized Palestine as a sovereign state.China stands on the side of justice by always calling for an implementation of the two-state solution and decrying all forms of violence against civilians, he said.The country has played "a leading role" in the international community's efforts to promote an immediate cease-fire in Gaza by making its voice heard at many multilateral and bilateral occasions, including in the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council and BRICS summits, Niu added. JERUSALEM/GAZA -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has authorized the Israeli negotiation team to present an outline for the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, according to a statement by Netanyahu's office on Friday.The statement was issued following U.S. President Joe Biden's speech, in which Biden revealed a three-phase Israeli proposal that would lead to an end to the ongoing Gaza conflict and the release of all hostages."The Israeli government is united in the will to return our hostages as soon as possible and is working to achieve this goal," the Israeli statement said.It added that "the prime minister authorized the negotiation team to present an outline for achieving this goal while insisting that the war will not end until all of its goals are achieved, including the return of all our hostages and the eli
