dischargeshe noted that despite widespread opposition and broken promises to the fisheries community the ocean release continues with numerous contradictions and injustices remaining unaddressedoda added that previous claims such as the lack of space for additional storage tanks or the lower cost of releasing contaminated water into the sea have lost credibility the justification of needing storage for debris removal is also becoming less convincing given the current state of the cleanup effortswe are repeatedly told that decommissioning is essential for recovery and for that the removal of debris is necessary however is it really possible to safely remove such dangerous debris and what will they do after removing it the ultimate form of the decommissioning process has not been discussed and it seems like they are proceeding blindly said odafurthermore not only tritium but also other radioactive substances such as strontium and carbon remain in the water after being released even the dangers of tritium itself have not been adequately explained she addedthirteen and a half years have passed since the triple meltdown at the fukushima plant which was triggered by the magnitude great east japan earthquake and the subsequent tsunami in march  despite the severe damage local fishermen still wish to continue their work and persist in opposing the ocean discharge of

selling fish caught in other prefecturesinsufficient explanationon aug  which marked a year after the ocean discharge began japanese prime minister fumio kishida visited iwaki where he praised the local sashimi as delicious and assured the head of the fisheries cooperative that he would take full responsibility for the discharge until the endi cant help but wonder what hes talking about

operator of the fukushima daiichi plant and the japanese government are now deliberately releasing radiation from the incident into the global environment she added this process began without sufficient explanation or the publics consent making it completely unacceptable oda saidour concern is the longterm impact of radiation and we refuse to allow further contamination of the earths

strategic industries regional revitalization deregulation and peace diplomacyjapans outstanding government debt has now surpassed  trillion yen  trillion signaling a potential fiscal collapse without confronting the difficult reforms that involve painful budget cuts this party leadership election — filled with empty promises — risks accelerating japans decline he saidat the beginning of the debate

safeguarded its territorial sovereignty with the philippines withdrawing its unlawfully anchored vessel from xianbin reef in the south china sea on saturday afternoon after fivemonth illegal halt and china will take countermeasures if philippines continues its political provocations said military expertsthe philippine coast guard vessel no  was illegally anchored near the xianbin reef since april  during which time china took several necessary measures to warn and control the vessel in accordance with the law deterring several philippine attempts to carry supplies to the vesselliu dejun spokesman of the china coast guard said on sunday the philippines move to illegally strand the vessel severely infringed on chinas sovereignty and is a breach of the declaration on the conduct of parties in the south china sea which was signed by china and the members of asean in  and damaged regional peace and stabilityhe said the philippines should stop hyping the issue and infringing on chinas sovereignty and move in the same direction with china to protect the validity of the declaration on the conduct of parties in the south china seahe stressed that china has indisputable sovereignty over the nansha islands including xianbin reef and the adjacent waters the china coast guard will take necessary measures to firmly safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interestszhang junshe a former researcher at the naval research academy said that philippines attempts to transport supplies to its vessel during its illegal halt at xianbin reef under the garb of humanitarian aid was a lame excuseit is the philippines largest and modern vessel on active service which has been put into use in recent years so humanitarian aid is purely an excuse for its scheme of unlawfully anchoring near the reef and jostling with china for the reef he saidhe added that philippines tried to test chinas resolve in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty by keeping the vehicle stranded for such a long time it was also hoping for a favorable response from the united states but chinas mighty deterrence and the slim chance of getting support from the us finally made philippines leave in dismayhe said the vessels withdrawal proved that chinas policies and measures for coping with south china sea issues are appropriate the nation always insists on handling disputes through peaceful means such as negotiations and talks it respects historical facts and behaves in accordance with international lawsthe military expert added that the possibility of philippines continuing its political provocations in the future by sending another vessel to the south china sea cannot be ruled out as it has played unreasonable and shameless tricks in the region in

democratic party or ldp leadership election but none of the current candidates have clearly presented policies on these matters experts saida record nine candidates launched a day election campaign on thursday to vie for leadership of the ldp aiming to succeed fumio kishida as the countrys next prime ministerkishida announced on aug  that he will not seek reelection as leader of the ruling party his cabinet has continued to struggle with low approval ratingsnoriyuki kawamura an emeritus professor at nagoya university of foreign studies said most of the candidates are focusing on creating a superficial sense of renewal or socalled changing the atmosphere in other words they believe that by changing the face of the top leader the atmosphere will change but that alone is highly insufficienthe emphasized that whoever becomes the leader of the ldp will also become the prime minister of japan and the person must carry out fundamental political reform only by doing so can the publics trust in politics be restoredthe kishida cabinet has not conducted any thorough investigation into the issue of politics and money and the political funds control act has not undergone any fundamental revision but rather only minor surfacelevel adjustments said kawamuradespite receiving large sums of taxpayer money through party subsidies ldp politicians repeatedly held political fundraising events and failed to report the funds they received said kazuyuki hamada an international political economy scholar and former parliamentary viceminister for foreign affairs of japanthe ldps ability to reform itself and its vision for national reconstruction are being called into question the people have lost faith in the current political system and nearly half of them do not even bother to vote in elections said hamadathis race seems like something orchestrated by the ldp to divert attention from the issue of politics and money … however the candidates are not addressing the critical issues facing japans politics economy or defense said hamadasatoshi tomisaka professor at the institute of world studies at takushoku university said that voters can experience a certain sense of renewal by observing a somewhat transparent process of power transfer but that effect will not last longboth the renewal of a change in leadership within the ldp and the renewal of a change in the governing party have the same temporary effect of raising expectations however this does not stop the overall systemic fatigue said tomisakain addition to the need to tackle the issue of politics and money a significant shift in japans foreign policy is also required stabilizing relations with china will be a key challenge for the countrys next leader according to kawamura of nagoya university of foreign studiesin recent years japans foreign policy has increasingly aligned with the united states particularly in its adherence to us efforts to contain china this approach has contributed to growing instability and tensions in japans relationship with china kawamura saidto safeguard japans national interests and determine its future direction it is essential to balance its

president of the genron npo the host organization of the conferencedaniel russel former us assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs said people should be careful about labeling the current situation as a cold war because it creates a mindset that could drive policies and would actually escalate riskthere is a substantial difference nowadays from the sovietera cold war situation given the economic interdependence and the lack of cold warstyle proxy wars in addition international and regional frameworks have been established and technology has really changed the game russel notedprojecting the cold war framework onto todays geopolitical landscape clouds our vision and can create selffulfilling prophecies so i think its a mistake to think in cold war terms but at

by those three criteria we are not quite at a cold war yet said jiahowever he noted that people on both sides are thinking in terms of a worstcase scenario approach each side plans for the worst possible situations and takes measures in that direction and that prompts the other side to do the samewe need to change this worstcase scenario approach we need to give the benefit of the doubt to the other side said jiabesides other countries also have a role in shaping the relationship probably they need to make sure that they do not take sides to fuel the conflict he saidchristopher johnstone senior adviser and japan chair at the center for strategic and international studies said the reality of economic interdependence is such that the us is not going to decouple from china and the us has no ability to ask its close allies to decouple eitherwe are not in a new cold war its not a bipolar system said johnstonewhere we are really heading for is a world of competing coalitions

generating concrete economic benefits and excercising leadership on the global stage adequate resources and public awareness are crucial unfortunately african countries are yet to enjoy these privileges from indonesia not only did the country spend less than  percent of its gross domestic product on foreign policy but limited amount is also concentrated on management support and presence

changes as the party prepares for an upcoming election to select its new leader the ldp plans to retain the wording of the warrenouncing article  while adding a new section to explain the selfdefense

said kohei aoyama  a member of the democratic youth league of japancurrently many conservative members of the ldp particularly those in the faction formerly led by late prime minister shinzo abe support such an amendment and winning their support is crucial for any candidate aspiring for the ldp presidency as a result candidates tend to emphasize the importance of amending article  to gain

favor revision of the constitution is lowthe public is more concerned about improving their livelihoods and social security than about constitutional revision yet the ldp is pushing for this because

bloody massacre perpetrated by the japanese military police and militaristic thugs some extremists influenced by militaristic ideology and strong xenophobic sentiments deliberately fabricated excuses to carry out a massacre of innocent chinese peopleover the past  years family members of the victims have been working tirelessly between china and japan to seek justice they have organized and participated in more than  meetings and attended more than  memorial services at the massacre sites in japan they have repeatedly submitted petitions and demands to the japanese government to express their strong determination and deep dissatisfactionwe the families persist because we have yet to receive a clear apology and this matter remains unresolved said zhou songquan a representative of the

japanese government can truly take up its political and moral responsibilities seriously address and properly handle the relevant historical issues and demonstrate its commitment to reflecting on history through concrete actions he saidliu sipan counselor of the political division at the chinese embassy in japan noted that the immediate cause of the massacre was the malicious spread of rumors and the incitement of social panic but the root cause lay in japans path towards militarism at the time where extreme nationalism xenophobia and antiforeign sentiments prevailedthis also set the stage for japans subsequent aggressive wars of invasion which inflicted immense suffering on china and other asian countries she addedit is regrettable that more than  years later this tragic memory is fading in japanese society the japanese governments stance on historical issues has regressed and there are negative trends in japan where the denial distortion and beautification of its history of aggression occasionally occur said liubaku  azerbaijans ruling new azerbaijan party won the most seats in the countrys parliament in a snap election on sunday mazahir panakhov the central election

environmental damage to xianbin reef according to a report released in beijing on friday about the coral reef ecosystem of the reef in the nansha islandsthis conclusion was based on recent field investigations and remote sensing observations leading china to pledge enhanced ecological monitoring and protection efforts in the south china sea chinese scientists saidpart of chinas nansha islands and located east of renai reef xianbin reef falls under the jurisdiction of sansha south chinas hainan provincethe china coast guard also reported recently that philippine coast guard vessels had illegally intruded into the adjacent waters of xianbin reef and renai reef without permission from the chinese governmentbetween may and july a comprehensive assessment of xianbin reef was conducted by the south china sea development research institute under the ministry of natural resources in collaboration with other relevant departments and field research stationsthe report found that around the  survey spots set up by the scientific expedition team the average coverage of reefbuilding coral was  percent with a maximum of  percent which is relatively high compared to major coral reef distribution areas around the worldaccording to the report xianbin reef is home to  species of reefbuilding coral accounting for  percent of the recorded species of reefbuilding coral in the nansha islandsalthough isolated instances of coral bleaching were observed this is due to seasonal warming as it is currently summer no coral diseases were found said wei zheng a senior engineer at the south china sea development research institutethe scientific expedition team conducted material analysis of coral debris from the six cays of xianbin reef and found no terrestrial material input proving that the cays are naturally formedthe report also shows that the cays at xianbin reef have sufficient materials supporting their development and formation and their locations and geomorphology comply with natural lawsthis indicates that the claims made by the philippines about china artificially depositing coral debris in xianbin reef leading to mass coral bleaching and death in the area are completely unfounded wei saidhowever the frequent human activities by the philippines in recent months have started causing a certain degree of environmental damage to the reef said xiong xiaofei chief scientist from the south china sea ecological centerduring a field investigation in may xiong and his team observed the presence of the philippine coast guard vessel mrrv which had been anchored in the lagoon of xianbin reef since aprilwe also observed some philippine fishing boats and witnessed littering and discarded fishing nets he said noting that the expedition team also observed filipinos throwing cigarette butts into the seachen xiangmiao deputy director of the marine science research institute at the national institute for south china studies said we speculate that the actions of the philippines are an attempt to repeat their past tactics as they did with renai reef and huangyan island trying various means to establish a longterm presence at xianbin reef through fishing vessels and coast guard ships then asserting their claims over the reef and attempting to occupy itthey have also been spreading rumors in the international community claiming that china intends to construct artificial islands at xianbin reef which we have never done at all the facts prove that all these claims are fabricated liesthe international community should also clearly see the shameless face of the philippines he addedwei from the south china sea development research institute said further efforts should be made in the future to strengthen the investigation assessment

has much to offer samoa and other small island countries in the transition to clean energy and infrastructure said samoas ambassador to chinachinas leadership in clean energy development and potential partnerships with samoa and other small island states could significantly address the climate crisis and contribute to saving our planet luamanuvae albert mariner told china dailythe international community has shown great admiration for chinas environmental and sustainability initiatives he said china is leading in green technology and clean energy and has a real opportunity to be a global leader in the renewable energy sectorchina boasts about  percent of the worlds solar manufacturing capacity the vast output has lowered solar panel prices worldwide reducing cost barriers for developing countries to access clean energy technology and expertiseon tackling climate change he said now more than ever the world needs political partnerships to resolve the crisis that we face large economies must find a way because at the end of the day politics is at the heart of climate change negotiations he saidchina recognizes the context of small island countries developmental aspirations because these are countries that have nothing to do with climate change and yet theyre right at the forefront facing constant challenges and the impacts of climate change he saidspeaking about chinas belt and road initiative projects the ambassador said the program is critical as every country needs infrastructure development the focus now is on sustainability built into the infrastructure which holds the key to any countrys development he saidwhat china has offered is critical for development he said citing the example of samoa which is said to have one of the best international airports among small pacific island countries after the facility was built with help from chinamariner said a country involved in the bri is always certain that china is providing what their country truly needs the bri is a process and opportunity that allows ongoing conversations between china and the recipient countries he saidsamoa and china enjoy a comprehensive strategic partnership and will celebrate  years of diplomatic relations next yearmariner said chinese migration to samoa began in the late s and china is a large multicultural country with a fascinating and unique historythe more i read about chinas history the greater i understand and appreciate chinas complexity he saidchinas … success in eliminating extreme poverty is a remarkable achievementthe pacific region where samoa was the first small island country to gain independence is often at the heart of geopolitics in some ways mariner said in todays world apart from geopolitical tensions there is also a battle of narrativesone narrative comes from the western media which is very antichina and biased another perspective of people like him who come to china reveals that this mainstream western narrative is so unfortunate and wrong he said adding that china seeks to be understood and respectedchina places peace and stability as important prerequisites to its national economic development programs he addedit continues to pursue where possible peace mediation efforts in some of the most difficult global conflicts in the world and remains one of the biggest contributors to the un peacekeeping fundjapanese citizens are urging that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal become the central issue of the upcoming liberal democratic party ldp presidential election as a means to eliminate corrupt moneydriven politicson tuesday takakage fujita president of the alliance to stop the impermissible acts of slush fund and tax evasion by the ldp filed for a prosecutorial review with the tokyo no  committee for the inquest of prosecutionhe did this with his legal representatives to challenge the tokyo district public prosecutors offices decision to return their criminal complaints these complaints were against senior politicians in the ldp faction led by former prime minister shinzo abe and thenchief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga concerning a slush fund scandal and the misuse of the cabinets secret fundsearlier this year the tokyo district public prosecutors office returned their complaints claiming that the facts of the crime were not specifiedin these cases the special investigation squad of the tokyo district public prosecutors office has already conducted forced searches and seized numerous accounting records so the facts of the crime should be wellknown to the prosecutors therefore this response from the prosecutors office shows either a lack of understanding or a willful disregard for the overwhelming anger of the public over the ldp slush fund and tax evasion scandal fujita said at a news conference on tuesdayordinary people are forced to pay higher taxes down to the last yen with the introduction of the invoice system meanwhile ldp politicians can obtain millions of yen under the guise of political funds through fundraising party ticket sales use this money for personal extravagances and engage in all sorts of unacceptable behavior that defies common sense this is the essence of the scandal that has angered not just ldp supporters but many citizens said fujitahe emphasized that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal has not been properly resolved and the political funding reform law that the ldp and its junior coalition partner komeito forced through in the last ordinary session of japans parliament is an empty meaningless sham of reformthe ldp will hold its upcoming leadership election on sept  with the official campaign period for the race scheduled to start on sept  as the japanese media will focus on the ldp candidates for the next month fujita is worried that the scandal might be laundered through the hype surrounding the electionif the ldp presidential election is going to dominate the media we strongly hope that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal will be made the main theme of the election he saidthe prosecution has repeatedly stated that it will not pursue this case citing reasons such as unspecified facts however ordinary citizens lack the authority or resources to conduct investigations and can only file complaints based on the evidence they possess the prosecution should be investigating and bringing charges based on these complaints said akihiko ohaguchi a lawyer representing the complainantsthe way the prosecution and police are protecting the governments interests is evident … as citizens we must strongly criticize such actions by the prosecution said ohaguchinaohiko hasegawa another member of fujitas legal team said they filed two criminal complaints regarding this matter but both were quickly returned on the grounds that the facts were not specifiedan accusation is a request for investigative authorities to look into suspected facts therefore even if the specifics are not clear it is unacceptable to reject it outright just for that reason on the contrary there should be some level of investigation before a final decision is made said hasegawait appears that from the beginning there was no intention to address the slush fund issue seriously the matter seems to be handled with minimal effort with only lowerlevel figures being targeted while key influential members of the ldp remain untouched said hasegawahe noted that there is significant anger over the political funding issue and genuine frustration over the lack of a serious response what the people truly need is thorough and meaningful action including expulsions and strong recommendations for resignation or tax payment he addedshigeaki koga a policy analyst and a former official of japans ministry of economy trade and industry said the people want to know the facts about the scandal — when did these wrongdoings start who initiated them who spent how much money and for what purpose after clarifying these facts they want those who committed these wrongdoings to be appropriately punished possibly even criminally prosecutedin addition they also want the rules governing political funds to be fundamentally reformed to ensure transparency and fairness so that such incidents never happen again said kogafrom the perspective of the ldp fumio kishidas resignation as japans prime minister is viewed as a way to take responsibility with the hope that this will put the issue to rest they also believe that introducing a new candidate might create the impression of change and help regain the trust of the public he saidhowever from the publics viewpoint kishidas resignation is not so much appreciated as it is considered too late moreover even if a new leader is introduced the public still cannot see any substantial change at this stage and it is unlikely that they will so the ldp might fail to regain the trust of the public said kogaglobal experts and leaders called for higher utilization rates under the regional comprehensive economic partnership or rcep and making collective efforts to unleash the full potential of the framework for economic prosperity for allasean members have rather low utilization rates of rcep which constrains the realization of the agreements benefits said ong tee keat president of the belt and road initiative caucus for asia

framework that aims to lower trade barriers and secure improved market access for goods and services for businesses in the regionaccording to data from the vietnam chamber of commerce and industry vietnams total exports to the rcep region in  amounted to  billion with rcep preferential exports reaching  million it accounts for an rcep export utilization rate of less than  percentstudies indicated the utilization rates for chinas exports and imports were  percent and  percent respectively last yearthe minimum tariff differential with other trade agreements is among the factors leading

nuclearcontaminated water into the ocean expressing concern that the discharge is causing anxiety about the safety of food from fukushimathe citizens conference to condemn further pollution of the ocean a nonprofit organization in iwaki a coastal city in fukushima prefecture called for global action on saturday the organization invited people worldwide to join in by standing up and holding homemade placards to express their opposition to the dischargechiyo oda codirector of the organization also known as koreumi said the process of deciding to release the nuclearcontaminated water into the ocean was done in a way that ignored the opposition from the publicwhen i eat fresh and delicious fish and shellfish or when children and young people play by the sea i feel anxious that the effects of radiation may appear one day i feel that we are losing our natural way of life which is to eat delicious products and play freely in the sea around us said oda a resident of iwakion sunday japan completed its eighth release of around  metric tons of nuclearcontaminated water into the sea this was the eighth release overalltokyo electric power company or tepco the operator of the crippled fukushima daiichi plant has already released over  tons of contaminated water the discharge is expected to continue for several decadesthree japanese civic groups namely the fukushima prefecture peace forum the citizens nuclear information center and the japan congress against a and hbombs submitted a second round of signatures to government officials in tokyo on wednesday requesting an immediate halt to the ocean dischargeearlier this year they submitted a petition accompanied by the first batch of  signatures collected nationwide on wednesday the second batch of  signatures was handed over to officials of japans ministry of economy trade and industry bringing the total number of signatures to tepco has used the advanced liquid processing system or alps to remove multiple radioactive substances from the contaminated water before discharging it into the seahowever this has not alleviated the safety concerns of the japanese public and residents of other countrieseven though alps can reduce radioactive particles in the water it cannot eliminate them entirely moreover the water release is expected to continue for  to  years resulting in a tremendous amount of water containing radioactive substances being discharged said hajime matsukubo secretarygeneral and researcher at the citizens nuclear information centermasashi tsunoda corepresentative of the fukushima prefecture peace forum expressed skepticism over whether the discharged water truly meets safety standardsno assessmentthe government speaks of implementing a longterm monitoring system yet no comprehensive longterm assessment is being conducted therefore i find it hard to simply accept the safety claims based solely on official statements said tsunodamasayo ikeda secretarygeneral of the womens conference a nonprofit organization criticized the japanese government and tepco for claiming the released water is safe without thorough verificationthe presence of tritium and various radioactive substances means there is no guarantee that it wont have any environmental impact ikeda said she stressed the importance of japan continuously verifying the safety of the facilities and the water being releasedtoshihiro inoue a special committee member of the japan congress against a and hbombs criticized the government and tepco for using the term alpstreated water which gives the impression that the water is not contaminatedthis kind of image manipulation has made it increasingly difficult for us to call it contaminated water but the reality is that the water remains contaminated with radiation even if radioactive materials are reduced they are still present said inouehe expressed serious concerns over the longterm environmental impact of releasing this water over an extended period especially regarding its potential effects on marine products that enter the food supplyon thursday tepco suspended experimental work to extract nuclear fuel debris from one of the reactors at the wrecked fukushima daiichi plant after discovering an error in the installation of a debris removal devicethe government has set a goal to decommission the plant by however the recent setback in debris removal underscores the uncertainties surrounding the entire decommissioning process raising concerns that the timeline may be extended even further if the timeline is indeed prolonged it would mean the release of contaminated water could continue said inouewhats really needed now is an acknowledgment that the plans are delayed and that achieving the original goals might be impossible however instead of admitting this and communicating openly with local residents and those in surrounding areas the authorities continue to insist that everything is fine this approach is alarming because it puts undue pressure on the workers which could lead to mistakes and further complications he saidbefore the fumio kishida administration japans nuclear policy was to reduce nuclear power as much as possible but under kishida it has changed to make maximum use of it said motoo tomizuka a member of no nukes plaza tokyowith earthquakes becoming more frequent each year continuing to operate aging nuclear power plants only heightens the risk of another severe accident its a reckless decision said tomizukamasahide kimura a member of the japanese antinuclear campaign group said that in tepcos monitoring results the term not detected is used to indicate that radioactive material levels are below the detection limit however tepco treats these levels as if they are zerogiven the large volume of water being released if you multiply this by the detection limit it becomes evident that a significant amount of radioactivity is being discharged theyre releasing numerous radioactive substances including plutonium and strontium not just tritium kimura said during a protest in front of japans nuclear regulation authority on wednesdayapproach slammedmany others have expressed concern over the japanese governments approach of proceeding with the ocean discharge without properly securing international understandingchinese foreign ministry spokesperson mao ning said on friday that china strongly opposes japans unilateral discharge of nuclearcontaminated water into the oceanlet me stress that the more transparent and open japan is on the issue the easier it will be for japan to alleviate international concerns said maochina once again calls on japan to seriously address both international and domestic concerns and fully cooperate in establishing an independent international monitoring arrangement that remains effective in the long haul and includes substantive participation from japans neighboring countries and other stakeholders she saidkimura supports chinas proposal ideally japan should engage in international dialogue and address these issues with other countries before concerns are raised the discharge is expected to continue for  to  years possibly even longer it is essential to reassess the situation and initiate discussions now even though a year has already passed he saidikeda representing the womens conference shares a similar perspective i believe that an international monitoring system is absolutely necessary and i think it should be established she saidthe reforms initiated by chinas late leader deng xiaoping and

pacific oceanthe date serves as a grim reminder of the environmental and economic impacts of a deeply irresponsible move experts said despite assurances from japanese authorities skepticism remains as fears of longterm contamination and its consequences continue to growdespite fierce opposition both at home and abroad japan began discharging socalled treated water from the nuclear plant into the pacific ocean with the latest and eighth round carried out on aug the chinese embassy in japan expressed its firm opposition to the irresponsible move noting that it concerns the health of all mankind the global marine environment and international public interests which meant it was not a private matter of japanthe move to dump nuclearcontaminated water into the ocean severely violates the international law and is highly irresponsible and selfish drawing widespread condemnation from the international community particularly neighboring countries that bear the brunt of the impact meng xiaoxu a researcher at the institute of japan studies of the chinese academy of social sciences told china dailyunder international law states have a duty to prevent harm and must minimize transboundary damage meng said citing the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter adopted by the international maritime organization in  to which japan is a signatory the convention aims to control and prevent marine pollution by prohibiting the dumping of hazardous materialsjapan has violated other international laws such as the united nations convention on the law of the sea adopted in  meng saidsouth korean environment activists staged a rally near a building that houses the japanese embassy in seoul on wednesday to demand japan stop the

demanding an immediate stop to the releasethe japanese government has not effectively addressed the concerns of its citizens or neighboring countries and the international community wang zhen a research professor of international politics at the shanghai academy of social sciences institute of international relations told china daily the behavior is entirely selfserving and harmful to others driven by narrow selfishness at the expense of others he saida significant leak of  tons of radioactive water detected this month at fukushima once again highlights the management chaos at tokyo

accident the highest on the international nuclear and radiological event scalein  the government and tepco promised local fishermen and fishing federations that they would not dump nuclearcontaminated water into the sea without the understanding of those concernedhowever in  the japanese government unilaterally decided to discharge millions of tons of nuclearcontaminated water into the sea in  after treatment and dilution a process that can continue for decadesaccording to wang japan initially adopted a cautious attitude he added that the shift in  was driven by the fact that tepcos storage tanks were projected to become full by autumn mitsuhisa furuichi a parliamentarian from the fukushima prefecture said the japanese government and tepco opted for what they call the cheapest way of getting rid of the nuclearcontaminated waterthe japanese government set up a committee to determine what to do with the water furuichi told cgtn in april the committee decided that the cheapest way was to discharge the water into the sea and since it could be done at a cost of  billion yen  million or so they chose to do that … also about  billion yen was spent on reputation damage controlthe primary consideration for discharge is costsaving rather than the environmental safety of its citizens and the international community wang said tepcos spending on public relations rather than investing in nuclear security and proper treatment further highlights the narrow selfinterest and opportunism of both the japanese government and tepcothe cheapest solution turned out to be the most costly for the international community in terms of the nuclear risks borne by the whole of humanity meng saidwithout sufficient scientific evidence and transparency the irresponsible discharge will inevitably result in serious consequences meng addedthe us state department said in a statement in august last year the united states is satisfied with japans safe transparent and sciencebased processthere is a clear tendency among western countries to politicize the environmental issues surrounding japans move meng said from a strategic perspective the us supports its ally japan and sees potential benefits in deteriorating sinojapanese relationssome us politicians not only refrain from condemning japans discharge but criticize other countries legitimate concerns and moves including the suspension of seafood imports from fukushima wang saidwould the us and its western allies remain as calm and satisfiedif other nonwestern countries adopted similarly irresponsible practices as

dozens of sdf members in a collective visit to the shrine riding in an official vehicle in april retired maritime sdf admiral umio otsuka was announced as the th chief priest of yasukuni shrine the

museumon thursday japanese prime minister fumio kishida sent ritual offerings to the shrine in his capacity as president of the ruling liberal democratic partyatsushi koketsu an emeritus professor at yamaguchi university of japan noting that yasukuni shrine which played a key role in supporting japanese militarism is central to japans state shinto pointed out that visits by sdf members clearly violated the constitutional principle of the separation of religion and statethis is an attempt to revive the prewar militarism that used state shinto and such moves should be strongly criticized the scholar statedwhy is the sdf leadership so obsessed with yasukuni shrine in a recent public lecture in tokyo tetsuya takahashi an emeritus professor at the university of tokyo explained that many of the sdf predecessors such as members of the national police reserve and the maritime guard had participated in japans aggressive warsto put it simply the sdf has not severed ties with the old japanese military nor does it wish to takahashi remarkedthe scholar said that the sdf is now openly teaching students at the national defense academy of japan about how officers of the former japanese military commanded their subordinates by inviting rightwing politicians to promote the socalled military spirit of the old japanese forcesaccording to takahashi the sdf also uses yasukuni shrine as an educational base where young people who lack a proper understanding of japans history of aggression are taken to visit there they are indoctrinated with the idea that dying for the country allows one to enter the shrine and be enshrined as a deity a concept takahashi described as an emotional alchemysayuri saito a constitutional law professor at keisen university in japan argued that yasukuni shrine has not erased the militaristic colonialist and imperialist values of the old constitution or the socalled meiji constitution but affirms instead a historical perspective that could revive these valuesin her view the controversial shrine does not recognize the value of the current pacifist constitution with its beliefs incompatible with the basic principles of peace enshrined in the constitution which explains why forces that support the yasukuni historical perspective are eager to revise japans constitutionsaito pointed out that although yasukuni shrine lists words like safety and peace on its website its very concept is entirely different from the peace envisioned by the japanese constitutionthe yasukuni shrine located in central tokyo honors  convicted classa japanese war criminals from world war ii including hideki tojo inperson visits of japanese politicians to the shrine have long been strongly condemned by peace advocates within japan and the international communitykoketsu warned that the sdfs frequent involvement with yasukuni shrine would only heighten concerns in asia particularly in china and south korea and increase distrust and vigilance toward the japanese governmentthe growing power of the sdf and the revival of the yasukuni ideology will be seen as a resurgence of japanese militarismtrue peace will not come from an elite sdf but from

month though the figure rebounded slightly from last month the latest cabinet disapproval rating was  percent according to an opinion poll published by jiji press last weekthe starting point for the loss of support was the political funding scandal involving factions within the ldp said magosaki who is also a former senior official with japans ministry of foreign affairsthere was no prospect of

with russia china and other countries in the field of nuclear energy which opens up opportunities for creating effective regional energy systems such cooperation also helps kazakhstan strengthen its energy independence and ensure stability in the regionwhat mechanisms do you consider effective in managing international cooperation on nuclear and energy projects and how can they be applied to kazakhstans npp construction planson the international stage the key mechanisms for successful cooperation are transparency trust and clear legal frameworks it is important to establish sustainable

with its npp planskazakhstan has unique opportunities not only as a uranium supplier but also as a producer of nuclear energy with the growing interest in clean energy sources kazakhstan can become a leader in the development of small modular reactors smrs which offer more flexible and economically advantageous solutions for energy supply additionally kazakhstan should consider participating in international projects for the development and implementation of nuclear waste recycling technologies which could significantly increase the added value in the countrys nuclear industrybased on your professional experience what measures could the kazakh government implement to attract foreign investments and expertise and ensure the success of the projectto attract foreign investments and

support plays a crucial role in the success of any nuclear project in france where nuclear energy is the main source of electricity regulators place great emphasis on communication with the public the main mechanisms include transparent information about safety environmental aspects and the benefits of nuclear energy public hearings meetings with local communities and educational programs are

sources of power owing to their intermittency but he said nuclear energy will not only cut carbon emissions but is also a stable and flexible energy sourceas of  more than  percent of the power generated in the asean region was from coal and gas while renewables accounted for about  percentarianto said the first step in deploying nuclear power in the region is for the governments to have a strong political will to use nuclear power as a means to secure energy supply and transition to a cleaner source of fuel to create policies and laws on nuclear development and to build the nuclear power plantssignificant progressthe asean booklet has highlighted several countries that have made significant progress in their plan to use nuclear energy in the future indonesia for example has

do we allow netanyahu and his radical government to impose their agenda on the region and doom it to a future of more conflictor do we do what we all believe is right and bring about that permanent

wishes of peace and safety for the trip he saidduring their stay in thailand fu said many thai people asked him lots of questions about china apart from ordinary ones such as whether china had banks

their bodies as fertilizer also they were curious about my marriage and ask whether my wife was picked from a group of women that were arranged by the government fu recalled with laughterthose

from the asia news network ann of which china daily is among its  leading titlesthe south korean economy is poised to continue its recovery in the latter half of this year but the country must address its existential issue which stems from problems such as low productivity and a declining population the organization for economic cooperation and development said on july we publish surveys every two years but this one is about an existential issue for south korea said vincent koen the oecds country studies division chief in the economics department during a press briefing at the ministry of economy and finance building in the city of sejongone urgent issue south korea must address is the population decline and its notoriously low fertility rate according to the oecd economic surveys korea  report released that daysupporting people to have the number of children they desire would dampen the projected population decline while lengthening working lives and welcoming more foreign workers would counteract the adverse effects of aging the report notedfor this koen also called for structural reforms in the labor market improvements in labor and family policies and changes in societal norms to counter population declinethe report also called for a decisive upgrade in south koreas exportoriented growth model to bolster declining productivityciting the gap between large and small companies as a key reason for falling productivity the oecd urged reforms to create a level playing field for competition stricter management of subsidies and benefits for small and mediumsized companies as well as streamlined regulations to enhance market competition are recommended the report saidmeanwhile the oecd survey report forecast a  percent growth outlook for the south korean economy this year driven by improved exports and strengthening domestic demand in the second halfwith inflation falling back and renewed demand for computer chips powering a wave of investment in ai across the world exports are again driving growth koen saidfor  the oecd expected that south koreas economic growth would slow to  percentunlike exports private consumption in south korea has been weak in the first half of the year pulled down by high interest rates and weak real wage growth the oecd anticipates the domestic market to rebound in the latter half south koreas elevated debt servicing burdens and accumulated inflation will continue to weigh on private consumption and investment in the short term but domestic demand should strengthen from the second half of  the report statedthe korea heraldexposing illicit wildlife trade that thrives on ecommerce platforms is like a game of whackamole even with the use of artificial intelligence toolsillicit online listings of the likes of ivory pangolin scales or even live animals are often disguised using emoji other languages and code words such as rare collectibles that make them difficult to detect said jayasri srikantan who spearheads a volunteer effort under wildlife conservation group world wildlife fund to flag illegal trade to the authoritiesbut an ai model is being developed to assist wwfs volunteers — called cyber spotters — to evaluate flagged listings on ecommerce platforms with greater accuracythe system trained on thousands of wildlife product samples and their estimated black market prices helps to prevent false positives ensuring the groups credibility with law enforcement partnersthe programs accuracy rate is about  percent for now said jayasri adding that new code words and trends are regularly added to the system to keep it up to date with current trendsdeployed in  the wwfs cyber spotter ai model is part of an initiative to fund and kickstart ai projects in singapore to spur ai adoption led by national ai program ai singaporethe ai system which has been in the works since  is designed to help improve the accuracy of reports compiled quarterly by the wwf and by its pool of more than  volunteers in singapore who trawl local ecommerce platforms for hours each month for signs of illegal wildlife trade said jayasri wwf singapores head of education and outreachimages and text from postings flagged by the cyber spotters are uploaded to an ai model which analyzes text and photos for clues of illegally traded wildlife and their productsthe team needs to avoid flagging replicas by mistake and must look out for clues in each listings images text and prices to ascertain if it truly involves an exploited animal listings that have a high mix of these elements could be flagged by the software as genuinely illegalits trickier than it sounds jayasri said spotting ivory for instance is not as easy as it seems as schreger lines — unique patterns found within an elephants bones that guarantee its authenticity — are tough to discern through often blurry images onlinesome sellers brazenly list protected wildlife products online but others employ tactics to conceal their illicit offerings jayasri said these tactics include using emoji or code words that hint at the creature being sold or employing emoji representing the animal which all make it challenging for our team to identify genuine listings accuratelyivory replicas can be sold at low prices while real elephant ivory is more likely to be listed in the hundreds of dollars jayasri saidbut sellers can play all sorts of tricks to slip under the radar like lowering the prices or using other code words so that they arent suspected the ai needs to consider all of thisthe system does not replace the work of volunteers who conduct final checks on the reports before they are submittedjayasri said the team here flags tens of thousands of listings each year in an effort to prevent the illegal trade — the second leading cause of wildlife loss after deforestation worldwide and among the worlds most profitable crime sectorsthe end goal jayasri said is to fully automate the system so that an ai model is able to trawl websites for illegal listings and compile a report on its own but the technology has some way to go before achieving this level of autonomythe international agency

a choice that india has to make the economic survey report saideven though india is the fastestgrowing g country and is now recording growth rates that outpace chinas indias economy is still a fraction of chinas it notedthe report makes a case for removing restrictions on chinese fdi in order to turn india into an export hub that can export to the western economies analysts saybiswajit dhar

improve the competitiveness of the indian manufacturing sectorhe noted that china was able to leverage the strengths of foreign investors to increase the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector but the question is whether india can develop an effective strategy to benefit from chinese companies similar to what china did visavis western multinationals dhar saidsebastian morris a former professor at the indian institute of management in ahmedabad said that fdi from china will help indias manufacturing sector to be more competitive in the international market giving a boost to its

trade organizations after the biden administration finalized tariff increases on certain products made in chinalowerincome us consumers will face the biggest consequences from the new tariff hikes thomas fullerton an american economist and economics professor at the university of texas at el paso told china dailythat is because they purchase more merchandise goods than services and many of those goods are produced in china or contain components that are produced in chinathe biden administration first proposed the higher tariffs in may on more than  billion worth of products from china the tariffs are scheduled to start on sept the tariffs will rise to  percent on electric vehicles evs  percent on solar cells and  percent on ev batteries steel lithiumion batteries aluminum and key minerals increased tariffs on semiconductor chips will take effect over the next two years the office of the us trade representative said but the spike is likely to not only drive up costs for chinese brands that ship to the us but also for american companies and consumers who buy lowcost goods say expertsa substantial portion but not all of the higher costs will be paid by us consumers fullerton said chinese companies and us importers will also see reduced profit margins because not all the tariffs will be completely passed on in the form of higher pricesthe national foreign trade council nftc a trade association based in washington also has expressed concern about the impact that the tariffs will have on cashstrapped us households and importersthere is no question that tariffs raise costs for consumers and adding new and expanded tariffs will harm working families and imperil americas national and economic security nftc vicepresident of global trade policy tiffany smith told china daily tariffs are paid by us importers not the chinese government and represent dollars that are no longer available for these companies to reinvest in innovation employees or expanding their businesses she said the reality is that tariffs are blunt instruments that have not and will not resolve the complex economic challenges that exist between the united states and chinashe said that an analysis by the tax foundation found that the new tariffs proposed by the biden administration in may would create an additional tax burden of  billion on us businesses and consumers the updated tariffs came after a fouryear review aimed at strengthening protections for strategic industries the us trade representative said on sept in  former president donald trump began the original tariffs that eventually covered more than  billion in imports from china which later responded with its own tariffs biden not only kept trumps tariffs in place but has increased the ratevicepresident kamala harris the democratic presidential candidate hasnt detailed her tariff policy trump however has been clearhe recently branded himself a tariff president and the us a tariff nation at a campaign rally in wisconsin harris criticized his policy as a sales tax on american households and a trump tax trump said that its not going to be a cost to you its going to be a cost to another country numerous economists and retail organizations disagree they have projected that if trump enacts proposed tariffs of  to  percent on all goods and  percent on goods from china it will ultimately hurt us consumers walletsin the study why trumps tariff proposals would harm working americans by the washingtonbased peterson institute for international economics piie kimberly clausing and mary lovely argue that the tariffs could end up hurting americans families farmers and exporters the mostthe piie study said that in contrast to trumps frequent and mistaken claims that foreigners bear the impact of tariffs economists have long understood that tariffs burden domestic purchasers of imported goods because imports are the difference between domestic demand and domestic supply a tariff affects both sides of the marketlovely is professor emeritus of economics at the maxwell school of citizenship and public affairs of syracuse university and a senior fellow of the peterson instituteshe told china daily we look at the effect of these proposals on american households as consumers of imported goods the new taxes are economically significant — a household with median income is projected to pay  more each year in import taxes the new taxes are also regressive in the sense that they take a larger share of income from poorer households than richer householdsthe center for american action forum a liberal think tank estimated that tariffs proposed by trump could amount to a  annual tax increase for a middleincome familymodel simulations conducted by sp global intelligence moodys analytics and the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania all confirm that tariffs are primarily paid by consumers within the united states fullerton saidunited nations  fu cong chinas

territoryin remarks at the un general assembly emergency special session on the palestinian question fu said decades of occupation and oppression have inflicted untold sufferings on the palestinian people and made the longcherished dream of independent statehood ever more elusiveending the occupation is not an option but a legal obligation for israel he stressedthe international court of justice icj in its advisory opinion issued on july  unequivocally concluded that israels continued presence in the occupied palestinian territory is a violation of international law and that israel is under an obligation to immediately bring to an end its unlawful presence in the occupied palestinian territories the ambassador said adding that the icjs advisory opinion affirms the longstanding consensus of the international community and pinpoints the crux of the palestinian questionwe urge israel to heed the strong call of the international community by immediately ending its unlawful presence in the occupied palestinian territory he saidfu noted that ending the occupation is to redress historical injustice and more importantly lay the foundation for peaceunderscoring that independent statehood is the inalienable right of the palestinian people as a nation the ambassador said the prolonged illegal occupation has hindered the realization of selfdetermination of the palestinian people and given israel an exclusive veto over palestine this is unacceptableonly a complete end to the occupation and the establishment of the independent state of palestine will truly make it possible for palestine and israel to live side by side in peace for the two peoples to live together in peace and tranquility and for lasting peace to be achieved in the middle east he saidfu emphasized that the implementation of the twostate solution is the only viable way to resolve the question of palestine and is the broad consensus of the international communityhe called on the international community to make greater efforts and demand that israel implement the relevant resolutions of the security council and the general assembly cease its military operations in gaza and stop its illegal settlement activities in the west bankchina advocates the convening of a more broadbased and effective international peace conference to revitalize the political prospects of the twostate solution and to work out a timetable and a roadmap for its implementation he saidtoday is a historic moment fu said noting that the state of palestine has taken a seat among un member states and introduced a draft resolution to the general assembly that focuses on the implementation of the advisory opinion of the icjhe said china will vote in favor of the draft resolution and hopes the resolution will give new impetus to ending the occupation implementing the twostate solution and advancing the middle east peace processin the diverse culinary landscape of the united states there are nearly  asian restaurants in the us where chinese cuisine is prominentyet despite the popularity of chinese food — which is featured on  percent of the menus at asian restaurants — leaders in the chinese catering industry are calling for a shift in focusat a recent industry meeting experts emphasized that while taste remains crucial the future success of chinese restaurants in america hinges on enhancing the overall dining experienceamy duan founder of chihuo and initiator of the taste of asia event stressed that thriving in the competitive american market requires more than just flavor it demands an investment in ambience service and cultural storytellingfood is the language that means you like people so theres no politics no barriers … everyone will enjoy the beauty of good food duan told china daily at a recent north america asian food industry conference and exhibition in los angeleshundreds of people in the catering industry attended the conference to discuss franchise models marketing and brands localization strategies and supply chainsas american consumers increasingly seek authentic globally influenced culinary experiences chinese restaurant owners are encouraged to adapt and innovate learning from the successful models of american chains like mcdonalds and burger king to build a loyal and diverse customer base duan saidchinese cuisine is renowned for its rich and diverse flavors yet westerners might not fully appreciate the intricate techniques and cultural significance behind its preparationmany chinese dishes in the us have been adapted to suit american tastes often resulting in a sweeter lesscomplex flavor profile that has led to americanized chinese food becoming the primary representation of the cuisinemost of the chinese restaurants are feeling lonely they dont know if its the best way to do the business in america and how to promote the asian food culture in america duan saidwhile discussing expanding a restaurant chain globally the industry leaders emphasized the importance of understanding local markets adapting to customer preferences and overcoming cultural barrierszhao yong president of the asian american hospitality alliance highlighted the challenges facing chinese cuisine in the us describing the industry as being in a red ocean state — saturated with competition but lacking in cohesive strategyhe said there are three main problems low prices leading to a decline in quality a lack of standardization and the use of cheap labor which hinders the industrys growth and potential for public recognitionfor example if there is a small restaurant in a small us town with a population of  soon there will be  chinese restaurants in that town more than mcdonalds but everyone is undercutting prices and prices cant go any lower this has been the traditional expansion method for chinese restaurants in the us —competing against each other zhao saidto address those issues zhao suggested creating national chinese food festivals such as hot pot day or soup dumpling day to promote culinary brands and encourage investment in the chinese food supply chainsuch efforts would raise the profile of chinese cuisine he saidhowever some experts expressed doubts about introducing too much of the original culture into the us marketcervantes lee professor of hospitality business at the university of nevada las vegas said that while authenticity is important its crucial to respect local customs and culturethe business should be managed by a team familiar with the local market and the foods flavor must be adapted to suit local tastes lee saidits important not to assume that americans will immediately appreciate our authentic dishes duan saidfor asian restaurants in the us the focus is often on delivering the best flavors and tastes however american customers seek more than just good food they are drawn to the overall atmosphere — whether classic upscale or casual — and the story behind the restaurantservice is also crucial as dining out is about enjoying a complete experience a point emphasized at the gatheringunfortunately many asian or chinese restaurateurs tend to overlook the importance of environment vibe and service concentrating solely on taste which isnt enough to satisfy american diners duan saidstill chinese korean japanese and thai restaurants are increasingly being included on michelins list in recent years they become popular in the us partly due to adapting their offerings to local palatesthis approach contrasts with simply copying menus from their home countries and trying to sell them directly to nonnative audiences duan addedif the greatest challenge for a chinese restaurant is to preserve the traditional flavors and cultural heritage of chinese cuisine while adapting to local american tastes and building a loyal customer base then lao sze chuan in chicago has achieved bothformer chicago mayor rahm emanuel is a loyal customer often bringing

need for more manpower to control and extinguish the major blazesthe workdays are tough considering the length of the fire line the heat the wind and especially the type of fuel which is very dense

and provoking bloc confrontations on the ukraine crisisin the ongoing ukraine crisis there has been a steady influx of large quantities of weapons and ammunition into the battlefield which will only lead to escalated situation and the loss of more civilian lives geng shuang chinas deputy permanent representative to the united nations said at the un security council briefing on arms supply to ukraineit will have an extensive negative impact on international and regional peace and security he warnednoting that china is deeply concerned about the recent spiraling of the intensity of the war the ambassador said the pressing priority of the moment is to respect the principles of no expansion of the battlefield no escalation of the fighting and no provocation by any party with a view to swiftly deescalate the situationhe called on the parties to the conflict to demonstrate their political will meet each other halfway put an early end to the hostilities and relaunch peace talks he also called on the international community to pave the way to this end by providing tangible assistance and facilitation and urged all parties concerned to put peace and humanity first and rechannel their resources and energy to ending hostilities through diplomacyin response to remarks by the us representative that spread a false narrative in his earlier statement distorting and vilifying chinas position on the ukraine issue once again geng emphasized that china did not create the ukraine crisis much less are we a party to the conflictchina has not supplied weapons to either party and we have consistent and rigorous controls over dualuse items we maintain normal trade and economic cooperation with all countries around the world including russia and ukraine he addedunderscoring that chinas position on the ukraine issue is objective and impartial the ambassador said that for over two years china has been working hard to promote peace and encourage and facilitate peace talkshe elaborated the efforts made by china and other countries on the political settlement of the ukraine crisis including the sixpoint consensus jointly issued by china and brazil in may this year this fully demonstrates that diplomatic negotiations and a political settlement meet the common expectations of the majority of countries and represent the will of the international communitywe hope that the united states will not continue to turn a deaf ear to these calls for peace that it will desist from discrediting and obstructing the diplomatic efforts of china and other countries concerned undermining international solidarity creating division and antagonism and provoking bloc confrontations and that it will truly play a constructive role in bringing an early end to the war and achieving peace geng saidfinding the right way for china and the united states to get along with each other is what both nations and the international community need the most a top chinese envoy said

decoupling is illusive viewing each other as new cold war adversaries will prove to be the biggest strategic misjudgment in the st century xie said adding that a conflict between china and the us would be unbearable for both and the worldthe envoy underscored that among the four red lines china has drawn — taiwan democracy and human rights path and system and development rights the taiwan

harris vowed to build an opportunity economy citing plans to make housing more affordable and expand the child tax credit trump repeated his claim that he would impose tariffs on imports from other countries and also criticized the high inflation rates under the bidenharris administrationabortion was a vital issue for both candidates in the debate trump emphasized his position that abortion should be a state issueharris criticized what she referred to as the trump abortion bans since roe versus wade was overturned she also highlighted cases where women have been unable to get abortions after being raped or struggled to get miscarriage carethey also sparred over us foreign policies regarding the israelpalestine conflict the russiaukraine conflict and the us withdrawal from

considered a cornerstone of cooperation expired on aug the uschina science and technology agreement the first official agreement signed after the normalization of uschina relations in the s ended despite the scientific communitys efforts to have it renewedoriginally signed by then us president jimmy carter and then chinese leader deng xiaoping in  the symbolically significant pact had been renewed every five years since it took effect with the most recent renewal in however the agreements fate had been hanging in the balance since august  when it was on the verge of lapsing in an attempt to salvage the agreement the two countries extended it twice for six months each time to negotiate renewal terms those efforts proved unsuccessful and the most recent sixmonth extension expired last monthmany disappointedthe demise of the sta has sparked concern and disappointment among experts in the fieldrichard dasher director of the usasia technology management center at stanford university supports maintaining international cooperationi think we should stay internationally focused and i think that cooperation is good whenever we can do it so in principle i would be in favor of continuing the uschina science and technology agreement dasher told china dailythe frustration surrounding the obstacles to renewing the sta is palpable within the scientific communitydenis simon a former professor at duke universitys fuqua school of business and marcus stanley director of studies at the quincy institute for responsible statecraft voiced their exasperation by asking why cant we just let american and chinese scientists get alongin an article published in the quincy institutes online magazine responsible statecraft the day after the agreement expired the authors emphasized the critical role of the sta in fostering scientific collaborationthe sta provided an overarching framework for facilitating scientific exchanges joint research projects and the sharing of knowledge and technical expertise they wrotesimon and stanley warned of the potential consequences of allowing the sta to lapseit would be a mistake for agreements to facilitate basic scientific research cooperation such as the sta to become irretrievably damaged by the increase in uschina tensions the decision on whether to extend amend or terminate the sta has profound implications for the global scientific community they cautionedthe authors also highlighted the broader context of growing distrust between the two countries which has contributed to the current impasse besides congress the us government has increasingly scrutinized chinese scientists and researchers over national security concerns which has hampered academic exchangesthis climate of growing distrust not only has made renewal of the sta more contentious but it has also made the rekindling of overall science and technology cooperation more difficult they saidroger pielke jr a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative american enterprise institute think tank expressed his support for continuing the sta in the most robust form that can be negotiated between the two nationshe argued that the very existence of such an agreement is more important than its specific details adding he viewed decoupling to be a bad idea and it is also a bad idea in science and technologycrucial supportfor decades the sta has been instrumental in fostering scientific collaboration in areas of basic science such as agriculture clean energy public health and the environment it has provided us and chinese researchers with crucial financial legal and political support enabling them to work together on groundbreaking research and innovationsdasher emphasized the interconnected nature of the global scientific community and the importance of collaborationtheres a continuum between basic research and actual commercialization and certainly in the basic research area theres always cooperation potential just about everywhere he said and youre seeing a lot of papers written jointly between people in china and in the united statesthe agreement has contributed to a rapid increase in both the number and quality of joint papers by chinese and us researchers however in recent years research collaboration has declined attributed to rising tensions and antichina sentimenta study published by the national bureau of economic research in june showed that scientific cooperation between the us and china had drastically decreased since  when the former us president donald trump took officethe study analyzed data in three key areas stem science technology engineering and mathematics trainee mobility use of scientific works between scientists in each country and scientist productivity in each country as measured by the production of peerreviewed papersbetween  and  ethnically chinese graduate students were  percent less likely to attend a usbased phd program moreover those who did attend such programs were  percent less likely to stay in the us after graduation the study foundoutput dropsthe researchers also documented a sharp decline in chinese use of us science as measured by citations although they found no such decline in the propensity of us scientists to cite chinese researchthe trends are corroborated by the state of the science address delivered by us national academy of sciences president marcia mcnutt in junemcnutt presented data showing that the us is dropping in research output as measured by articles published while china is experiencing a tripledigit percentage increase in terms of research quality measured by the percentage of articles in the top  percent cited the us is losing ground while china has moved ahead of the european unionthe shifting landscape of scientific productivity is also reflected in the pharmaceutical industry chinas share of drugs in phase one to three trials has risen dramatically from about  percent in  to  percent in  while the us share is in decline according to mcnuttchinas number of patents per year surpassed the us around  and is now leading by a ratio of  to  as of in the corporate world china has emerged as a dominant force leading the global fortune  list with  out of  companies in  a stark contrast to its nonplayer status in those statistics underscore mcnutts conclusion that advancing the frontiers of basic research now requires international partnerships to benefit all researcherssaving livesthe importance of such partnerships is illustrated by an example provided by dasher involving a medical technology company he described a collaboration between a senior electrical engineer in silicon valley — with innovative ideas for medical image analysis — and a professor in chinachina has eight times as many medical images as the united states does so he cooperated with a professor in china and the two of them have created a company about medical image analysis to detect cancer dasher saidthats a very good use where china has data that is useful for everyone and we have a technology idea i think that kind of thing will continuethe benefits of international cooperation extend to the overall strength of the us technology sector dasher said one of the key strengths of silicon valley has been its diversity with  percent of the technical workforce born in chinaweve benefited from foreign people who come to the united states as students and continue to work here i think that its also the case where some americans may want to go to china and work in china so we need to maintain a very good safe environment for people to cooperate he emphasizedwith dwindling government investment the us industry began taking the lead around  and now dominates us research investment with a  percent share compared with the federal governments  percentthe strengths of the private sector in advancing scientific and technological development however have been challenged by the us governments national security measures aimed at containing chinas development in science and technologythe biotech industry provides a stark example of the potential consequences of decoupling many achievements under the sta such as uschina collaborations on gene editing research that have created diseaseresistant crops and improved yields are at risk of being reduced to historical footnotespatrick beyrer a researcher at the asia society policy institutes center for china analysis said a potential uschina biotech decoupling is being expedited while everyday americans arent adequately prepared for the consequenceshe cited the example of wuxi apptec as a research superstore for its us partners and wuxi biologics the secondlargest biologic outsourcer in the worldrecent policy recommendations from the us house of representatives select committee on china have described us dependence on chinese pharmaceutical supply chains as a distinct national security risk with some lawmakers proposing to block

from us supply chains would have an impact on developing treatments for critical medical conditions including hearing loss cystic fibrosis and leukemiain addition to china representing the largest and most costeffective exporter of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the us market jointly developed drugs agricultural technologies and other biotechenabled solutions have improved countless american lives he wrote in an articlethe collapse of uschina biotech partnerships would spell the end of such jointly developed innovations that harbor the potential to deliver sorely needed global public goods including saving american lives suffering from diseases such as cancer beyrer cautionedtalent crunchthe challenges faced by the biotech industry are symptomatic of a broader issue affecting uschina relations in science and technology export controls and other measures to restrict technology transfer have moved to the heart of the relationship increasing tensions between the two countries and posing significant challenges for us tech companiescraig allen president of the uschina business council criticized the us export controls for causing an intensely difficult problem for us tech companies particularly those that are in silicon valleytheres a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety and i think thats true across the board in tech allen observed during an event at stanford while visiting his organizations members in silicon valleythe semiconductor industry in particular has been hit hard by these restrictions allen said that several us chip companies have recently been banned from selling to an illdefined range of chinese customersits becoming more and more difficult to avoid that conflict of law and thereby the consequences would be terminating or severely restricting what had been a very profitable enterprise for decades he saidhe emphasized the importance of china for many technology companies both as a market and as a source of talentchinas extremely important for the tech companies many of them have a large percentage share of their total sales in china and many of them draw on that enormous chinese talent pool in china and that is not something that they can easily walk away from he saidan april report by the federal reserve bank of new york estimated that in a small subset of tech companies studied  billion of market capital was lost due to export controls when new export controls were announced employment in affected companies declined by  percentit is especially detrimental for american companies when export controls are unilateral enforced by the american government only on american companies in such cases and there are many unilateral export controls that asymmetrically hurt american firms and longterm american competitiveness said allenthese restrictions are disrupting longestablished partnerships and hindering access to crucial talent allen cited the case of a us multinational company whose lead scientist in china was denied a visa to visit his own laboratories in the usamerican companies need to access chinese talent if they are to remain globally competitive if american companies are barred from hiring chinese talent then other companies will be given a longterm structural advantage that probably over a very short period of time will impact american competitiveness he arguedthis talent crunch is exacerbated by the us dependence on international students to meet its stem workforce requirements as noted by mcnutt in her june address the narrowing channel for data flows between rd teams in china and the us is making this challenge more acute every daylooking ahead allen acknowledged the complex political landscape that companies must navigatewe live in a political world companies have to recognize that a potential future conflict between the united states and china would make it impossible for most international trade and investment to continue he saidwhile conflict is certainly not inevitable

astronauts butch wilmore and suni williams blasted into space aboard boeings starliner capsule in early june they expected their trip to last only a weekhowever three months down the line starliner undocked from the international space station and landed in new mexico on saturday minus the two astronauts who remain stranded in space because nasa deemed the starliners problems with its thrusters too fraught with risk for a crewed returndespite starliners safe return nasas commercial crew program manager steve stich said the decision not to have the astronauts on board during the crafts journey back to earth was the right onethe starliners successful return seems like pure luck as the issues it encountered could not be replicated on earth for a solution said lin luzhou assistant professor at beijing foreign studies universitys academy of regional and global governanceit points to problems in quality management an area where boeing used to excel he addeddespite the successful docking in early june and its uneventful return starliner has faced persistent issues including a failed unmanned test trip to the iss in  a doover mission in  went ahead but some thruster malfunctions remainedboeing is shifting away from being the crown jewel of us manufacturing in recent years it has prioritized profit over quality ding yifan a senior fellow at taihe institute a think tank in beijing saidcostcutting measures like outsourcing key components have further compromised standards he saidthe crashes of two boeing  max jets in  and  in indonesia and ethiopia killed  the company faced another blow when a door plug blew off during an alaska airlines flight in januaryit shows a broader decline in us manufacturing capabilities he addedfollowing its launch starliner reported helium leaks and thruster problems extending the space mission multiple times before nasa announced in august that the astronauts will only come back in february on a spacex dragon capsulenasas decision to ultimately rely on the dragon spacecraft must have come after extensive technical evaluations however the issues wont be resolved in just a couple of months lin of the academy of regional and global governance saidspace missions particularly those involving the international space station require meticulous planning and multilateral coordination he addedit is an image issue spacexs space program has indirectly benefited from nasas budget cuts over the years which led to the outsourcing of projects and the layoffs of nasa engineers — many of whom ended up working for elon musk ding of taihe institute saidboeing has a long history of working with nasa apollo  which was propelled by a boeingbuilt rocket landed on the moon in  previously ample funding supported us technological advancements however the focus has now turned to more profitable ventures and space exploration receives less support ding saidadditionally militaryindustrial complexes have shifted federal budget priorities further reducing nasas funding and diminishing its roleboeing incurred about  billion in cost overruns while developing the starliner facing repeated delays and price increases due to supply chain issues agence francepresse reportedthe current model for commercial space exploration undoubtedly starts with significant investment in research which is no longer sustainable under incumbent financing mode lin saidaccording to ding us public finances have become increasingly strained with growing debt leaving less room for discretionary spending the gross federal debt of the us has surpassed  trillion us treasury department data showednasas budget peaked during the apollo program in the s at more than  percent of the us federal budget according to the space report website it fell below  percent after  and has hovered around  percent in recent yearswhen the government budget is primarily allocated to debt repayment and military expenses public funding for space exploration — an area that isnt immediately profitable — diminishes ding saidhowever despite the constraints lin said we are witnessing a second major wave of human space exploration since the apollo program with commercial space ventures booming globallyboth established players as well as newcomers are undergoing significant transformations which will bring both opportunities and challenges he said adding that the key question is whether they can secure a competitive edge in the evolving space industrybeijing condemned on tuesday the socalled biosecure act passed by the united

buyers across latin america and reshaping views about chinese productsthe advanced technology and competitive pricing of chinese vehicles — evs as well as traditional cars — are rapidly translating into rising market share for chinas automakers in the latin american marketin  chinese carmakers sold about  billion worth of vehicles across latin america according to the international trade center by last year the value of chinese vehicles sold in the region almost quadrupled to  billion accounting for roughly  percent of the regions car marketthe quality of the cars and their price caught the attention of buyers like florencio perez romero a pilot in mexico romero recently bought a chinesemade mg rx because of the features it includes like a large touchscreen console myriad sensors and led lighting as well as an appealing panoramic sunroofthese are cool features compared to similar suvs in the market like toyota volkswagen ford and chevrolet it seemed like a good deal said romerothe price tag was another big factor for romero who noted that when all is said and done chinese vehicles end up being cheaper than similar offerings from other brandsmaking strideschinese ev makers have been making strides in global markets byd for example has topped tesla which also makes many of its cars in china as the top ev seller globallybut they are facing significant headwinds in north american and european markets which have increased their scrutiny and tariffs oxford economics noted in a reportthe us increased the import tariffs on chinamade vehicles from  percent to  percent in may and canada followed suit in late august in june the eu commission announced plans to impose tariffs on imported chinese cars and adjusted them in august for example tariffs on tesla evs manufactured in china were cut from  percent to  percent while tariffs on byd vehicles were reduced marginally from  percent to  percentin latin america meanwhile sales are flourishing from mexico all

attached to buying a chinese car make a big differencein chile in particular chinese automakers have been particularly successful both in selling cars to private buyers and providing vehicles to support infrastructure development like public transit chileans are increasingly willing to buy chinese traditional cars and evsbrands like mg maxus great wall and chery have dominated the streets with the highest sales numbers among chinese brands suggesting considerable popularity among chilean customers when buying a new vehicle said renzo burotto a historian at the university of chileaccording to the national automotive association of chile  chinamade cars were imported to the country in  reaching a market share of  percentburotto attributed the growth of chinese evs in chile partly to a free trade agreement and strong commercial ties between the two nationschinese evs are also increasingly visible in public transportation burotto pointed out that santiago the chilean capital uses more than  electric buses imported from china santiago which has the secondlargest fleet of such buses in the world outside of china has replaced more than  diesel combustion busesand there is little reason to think that buyers across latin america will not continue scooping up chinese cars and evs any concerns about the quality technology or safety of madeinchina products are fading quicklychina no longer just makes irons and blenders said burotto it is now not only manufacturing but also leading in innovation with a view to sustainable development and putting chinas

associate professor of the communication and organizational leadership department at robert morris university in pennsylvania said to china dailymoretti referred to the uschina dialogue of the financial working group fwg held in shanghai aug there exist two parallel tracks when you think of the us and china the political track is filled with all kinds of negativity from the us he said whether it be tariffs other forms of sanctions dubious legislative items or the daily negative rhetoric not much in the way of positive news comes out of that moretti saidbut the business community understands how essential it is for the us and china to find ways to keep as many doors open as possible and to ensure that optimistic dialogue exists he saidtogether we account for some  percent of

donemoretti said that green technology is good for china the us and the world so it is meaningful to make efforts to assist companies — large or small new or enjoying a long history — that create products that are costeffective and good for the environmentno matter how much the politicians criticize china they know that cooperation in areas such as pandemic research overcoming food insecurity and creating goodfortheclimate products brings positive results when china and the us are working together he saidus president joe biden has touted green initiatives but also announced new tariffs on

you say you believe in something then demonstrate a real commitment to it moretti said adding that the tariffs imposed by the biden administration on chinese evs make no sensewashington wants a healthier climate and yet it is deliberately blocking cars that are affordable of good quality and good for the globe from us consumers it defies common sense to preach a message of being climatefriendly and then slam the door on one such opportunity he saidthe west is ready to criticize whatever it is that china does he saidif the us showed a commitment to longterm strategic thinking as china has when it comes to the most modern technologies then it would enjoy strong market share for such products he said they did not so the criticism of china for doing so is weakmoretti said hat

uschina agriculture roundtable in multiple cities in china in june was nothing like what i was kind of expectingi had a lot of preconceived ideas about what to expect he told the audience on thursday at an online event to share his experiences there were times i was a little bit even apprehensive about making the trip but it turned out to be a great experienceaccording to min fan executive director of the us heartland china association ushca which organized the roundtable with several chinese agencies the delegation visited universities farms and agriculturalexperiment stations in china they enjoyed talking with their counterparts and also sightseeingwe had a wonderful enlightened trip fan saidbarlow has been to europe south america and africa and knows well the international dairy markets including chinas the trip his first to china opened his eyes to other facets of the countryand china its amazing how they have developed their own industry in the dairy world and are using much less exports than they ever have before barlow saidhe was amazed to see the work ethic in chinaeverybody is working everybody has something to do he said theres no wasteone thing he noticed is how land is used in china when we were on those bullet trains and you looked across you saw every inch of available land was in food production i thought that was fascinatingbarlow was also struck by other aspects of china i found it was obviously the cleanest and probably safest place ive ever been he saidhe said it was fascinating to see practically zero obesity in china and the citizens were very healthy and werent facing a lot of the issues that is really epidemic in our country today with obesity and things like thatthe trip led barlow to realize that it is important to keep the dialogue going its better to talk than to yell at each other and go through what the tvs sayfor olga boldentiller dean of agriculture at tuskegee university it was also her first time in chinai think what was most enlightening for me was the conversation around how the us can partner with china to really address global food security and do so from an educational standpoint she saidi like the model that china has with a few other organizations where they are partnering with developing countries to do work on the ground in china to really uplift a lot of their producers and some of the agricultural practices boldentiller saidlou swanson professor emeritus from colorado state university said he enjoyed the aspect of global citizenship from the trip at colorado state university we really think that peopletopeople studenttostudent facultytofaculty relationships are the core for having any kind of global citizenship said swansonwhat this trip did — and ive taken many delegations of students and faculty to china over the years — is the peopletopeople dimensionswanson said that trade and cultural exchanges are important to avoid misunderstandings that can lead to conflict trips

to expand cooperationthe event on tuesday was presented by the center for american progresslewis said political and economic tensions between the us and china are high and that is exactly when engagement on climate change is of the utmost importance to avoid derailing all the progress that weve made in our engagement with china over the last plus yearsshe said us engagement with china on climate change and clean energy has helped to build up chinas own capacity to track and reduce its emissions as well as its ability to promote a lowcarbon energy transitionand today we see that china has leapfrogged many other countries in these areas and our bilateral exchanges have become much more of a twoway street lewis said i also see that engagement has led to increased ambition transparency and trust between our two countriesshe said us president joe biden administrations inflation reduction act which she said moved the us in the right direction of making clean energy industries more competitive globally may have gone too far in terms of completely excluding chinese entities from participating in the us clean energy sectori think there has to be a conversation about our respective roles in global clean energy supply chains without just letting it devolve into a global trade war that will slow the lowcarbon transition globally she saidlewis visited china this summer for the first time since the pandemic meeting with chinese officials and touring chinas new clean energy manufacturing facilities she said she witnessed how china is leading the world in some aspects of green technologiesshe said there are ways that are smart and protect national security but also allow us to leapfrog and take advantage of a lot of the real impressive innovation that were seeing coming out of china lewis saidshe said the us should also have conversations with china on tough issues such as trade and research or it could risk derailing cooperation on climate changewe need to hit that headon i think its silly to make engagement on basic science a political issue lewis saidaug  marked the th anniversary of the birth of deng xiaoping the late chinese leader

even as us bonds boast higher yieldsas of july overseas institutions holdings in chinas interbank bond market had risen for  consecutive months an increase in foreign holdings of as much as  trillion yuan  billion according to data from the shanghai head office of the peoples bank of china the countrys central bankat first glance the inflow looks counterintuitive — why would investors opt for loweryielding bonds as of late august the year us treasury bonds still yielded around  percentage points more than their chinese counterparts according to market tracker wind infothe answer analysts suggest partially lies in the anticipated interest rate cuts by the united statesthe us federal reserve is expected to lower rates from the current  to  percent range to avoid a recession with chinas monetary policy to remain stable the renminbi is poised to rebound against the dollar this has set the stage for profitable exchange rate plays with the possibilities of investors converting dollars to renminbi investing in chinese bonds and locking in a profit by selling renminbi forward at a higher ratefrom october  to january  chinese bonds yielded  basis points higher on average than us bond yields of the same maturity after taking into account foreign exchange hedging according to calculations by boc internationalresilience of assetsa more fundamental reason for the inflow financial experts from home and abroad said is something beyond technical trading strategies — the growing appeal of renminbidenominated assets among international investors a trend that has withstood the headwinds of us rate hikessince the us fed started a drastic rate hike cycle in march  to combat inflation foreign holdings in chinas interbank bond market have risen they reached  billion yuan as of july with the trillionyuan inflow since september last year surpassing the outflow of  billion yuan between march  and august  according to the pbocs shanghai head officethe allure of renminbidenominated assets has been underpinned by a global shift away from overreliance on the us dollar chinas expansive economic ties and the countrys ongoing financial openingup the experts saidthese factors they said will continue to help the renminbis ascent as an international currency strengthening its reserve payment financing and pricing functions and offering a winwin for the global economydemand for diversification of reserves away from the us dollar remains strong globally driven by geopolitical economic and financial dynamics said massimiliano castelli head of strategy for official institutions at ubs asset managementwe believe the dollar is and will remain for the foreseeable future the main store of value for global investors including reserve managers however currency diversification is set to continue in the future as the world gradually moves toward a multipolar systemthe renminbi looks set to continue its steady rise in global foreign exchange reserves in particular if it is supported by an improvement in the chinese economy the ongoing rise in the use of the renminbi in crossborder payments and the more widespread use of the digital yuan said castellizhu min former deputy managing director of the international monetary fund said the world sees that a dominant us dollar is not necessarily a good thing for the whole world because us monetary policy and fiscal policy may have a big impact on the dollars value and capital movementshaving a more balanced force against the dollar is good for the whole world so i think the renminbi will continue to internationalize to serve that role not only for china but for the whole world and particularly for international financial architecture zhu saidthe worlds pursuit of alternative international currencies to the greenback including the renminbi has accelerated after the us froze the russian central banks foreign exchange reserves and removed several russian financial institutions from the swift messaging system in  in the wake of the russiaukraine conflictshaky greenbackzhang ming deputy director of the institute of finance and banking which is part of the chinese academy of social sciences said the weaponization of the dollar has presented an important opportunity for renminbi internationalizationmany countries have realized that it is dangerous to rely solely on the greenback said zhang who is also deputy director of the national institution for finance and developmentin july the renminbis share in global payments measured by value hit a record  percent swift data showed it remained the fourth most active currency for global payments by value for the ninth consecutive monththe chinese currency was the secondlargest global currency in the trade finance market for the second consecutive month with a market share of  percent in julyas the world has sought systems other than swift the crossborder interbank payment system or cips which specializes in renminbi crossborder payment and clearing has grown in popularity in july two direct and six indirect participants were added to cips by the end of july there were  direct participants and  indirect participants in the systeman increasing number of economies are also experimenting with central bank digital currencies or cbdcs in crossborder payments which can not only bypass the swift system but enjoy a faster settlement speed than the traditional agent bank system as a third party intermediary is no longer requiredearlier this year saudi arabia joined project mbridge a crossborder platform for experimenting with cbdcs — including the digital yuan — for international trade as the sixth full participantproject mbridge resulted from collaboration starting in  between the bank for international settlements innovation arm the bank of thailand the central bank of the united arab emirates the digital currency institute of the pboc and the hong kong monetary authorityglobal domestic challengesgeopolitical dynamics however can be a doubleedged sword experts said with the wall street journal reporting in april that the us was drafting sanctions that threaten to cut some chinese banks off from the global financial systema survey by ubs asset management of  central banks which manage about half of the global foreign exchange reserves showed that  percent of them believed that uschina tensions had not yet affected the internationalization trend of the renminbi thirtynine percent said it had slowed it down and  percent said the tensions had accelerated the trendzhang from cass identified the us suppression of china as a key challenge facing the renminbis internationalization this is in addition to domestic challenges such as economic growth slowing the yields of financial products declining and domestic financial risks becoming more apparentwhile ramping up efforts to boost economic growth china can further internationalize the renminbi through three main tasks zhang said they are improving the currencys function in commodity pricing providing more highquality renminbi financial assets to overseas investors via both onshore and offshore markets and stepping up the development of cipshe said since the pboc began promoting renminbi internationalization in  it has made significant progress over the past  years — the renminbi now holds about a  percent share in international transactions and  to  percent in global reserves the area that remains relatively weak is pricingto further strengthen the renminbis pricing function china — as a major buyer and seller of commodities — can promote renminbi pricing in the trade of commodities such as iron ore copper and natural gas zhang said he cited the example of shanghais launch of an international crude oil futures market denominated in renminbi in  which has grown rapidly into the third largest of its kind in the worldthe resolution adopted at the third plenary session of the th central committee of the communist party of china in july said that efforts should be made to steadily and prudently advance the internationalization of the renminbi and develop offshore renminbi marketsit also said the country would push forward the development of a homegrown controllable crossborder payment system and make steady progress in the rd and application of the digital renminbizhang said cips would serve as a backup option for china and the world particularly if geopolitical conflicts continue to escalate and the us imposes further financial sanctions not only china but also the european union india and saudi arabia are looking for new payment and settlement systems we are providing these countries with a second or third option as well he saidattracting participantsefforts are needed to boost the number of banks directly participating in cips the more direct participants there are the stronger the network will become and the faster payment and settlement will be zhang saidproject mbridge may assume greater importance going forward as an alternative and more efficient option for global payment and settlement he addedxiong aizong a senior research fellow at cass institute of world economics and politics said there is room for development concerning offshore renminbi clearing which can increase the crossborder trade and use of the yuanlast year renminbi clearing banks or arrangements were established in brazil pakistan serbia cambodia and other economies which greatly promoted the use of renminbi by enterprises and financial institutions in these economies for crossborder transactions xiong saiddeepening highlevel financial openingup to expand the channels for foreign investment in renminbi assets is also key to internationalizing the currency he said the bond connect program launched in  the improved qualified foreign institutional investor mechanisms and the swap connect market access scheme launched last year have all added to the currencys appeal to international investors xiong addedpan gongsheng governor of the pboc said in an interview with peoples daily in august that the central bank will promote renminbi internationalization by adhering to marketdriven and voluntary principles continue to improve crossborder renminbi policies optimize the global layout of renminbi clearing banks and promote the healthy development of the offshore renminbi marketsin line with pans remarks the pboc in august inked a memorandum of understanding with vietnams central bank for bilateral local currency swaps which can facilitate crossborder trade and investment in the renminbi by the end of  the pboc had entered into agreements with over  central banks for bilateral local currency swaps totaling  trillion yuanpan added that the central bank will keep the renminbi exchange rate generally stable at a reasonable balanced levelhuang yiping dean of peking universitys national school of development said china should also consider providing commercialized investments lowcost funding and government aid to developing economies to help them bridge the funding gap in achieving a green transitionsuch a scheme would be comparable to the ussponsored marshall plan to rebuild postworld war ii europe but with a focus on green development the scheme would be a winwin as it would facilitate the global

broader asian american community the figure rises to  percent according to the latest data from the us census bureauthe candidates whether for mayor or supervisors all hope to get chinese american voters support because we have become an important voting bloc that they could not afford to ignore louis lam chairman of the american teo chew business association and a board member of the chinatown nonprofit chinese newcomers center told china dailythe current mayoral race exemplifies the heightened focus on chinese american voters incumbent mayor london breed facing a challenging reelection bid has seen her approval rate shift dramatically among this demographic which played an important role in her previous electiona poll conducted by the san francisco chronicle in february revealed that  percent of potential asian voters disapprove of breeds performance and only  percent support herrecognizing the need to regain favor with chinese american voters the mayor has taken actions such as increasing the police budget granting law enforcement more authority addressing homeless encampments and even embarking on a trip to chinaduring her april visit to china breed signed an agreement to bring a pair of pandas to the san francisco zoo a move that resonated strongly with chinese american advocates she also lobbied for the restoration of direct flights between china and san francisco international airport which had been disrupted during the pandemicthose efforts appear to be paying dividends a recent chronicle poll indicated that breeds approval rating among asian voters doubled over the past six months the resurgence in support from the asian and chinese american communities has bolstered her standing in the mayoral racehowever breeds challengers are not ceding ground in the battle for chinese american votesformer san francisco supervisor mark farrell one of breeds main rivals recently secured a crucial endorsement from the san francisco chinese american democratic club — an organization that had previously backed breed in her last mayoral campaignfarrell has been a frequent presence at community events in chinatown distributing chineselanguage flyers and engaging with potential voters his campaign platform emphasizes cracking down on street homelessness and drug use issues that resonate strongly with many chinese american residentsanother prominent challenger daniel lurie founder of an antipoverty nonprofit and heir to the levi strauss fortune has taken a strategic approach to courting chinese american voterslurie has hired a chinese american campaign manager and enlisted chinese american activists to bolster his outreach efforts his campaign has been marked by personal interactions with chinese american residents visiting them in their homes and

chinese american campaign manager to strengthen ties with the citys chinese communitythe intense focus on chinese american voters in this election cycle is no coincidence political consultant jim ross emphasized the critical nature of the demographic saying to san francisco news website mission local it will be very challenging for any candidate to win without getting the most votes from that coalitionthe political engagement of san franciscos chinese american community has reached new heights driven by several factors said lam who attributed the surge to the communitys increasing education levels and a growing awareness of their voting powerall the people i know have realized the importance of casting ballots even those who do not read or speak english their children who are well educated can help them he saidthe successful recall elections in  which replaced several progressive school board members in the city and the liberal district attorney chesa boudin served as a watershed moment demonstrating the communitys ability to effect change through the ballot box he saideconomic concerns and public safety issues remain at the forefront for many chinese american voters as lam pointed out a significant portion of the community consists of small and mediumsized business owners or workingclass individuals who are acutely affected by the citys economic challenges and crime rateits tragic that many businesses in fishermans wharf remain closed and an office tower downtown was sold nearly  percent less than the price about a decade ago said lam adding that it was why he switched his support from breed five years ago to farrell and lurie for the upcoming electionan increasing number of chinese students and tech professionals are expressing their alarm on social

peopletopeople exchangeschinese student chen guo not his real name began his journey to boston massachusetts in  after he was accepted by harvard medical school however his academic dream quickly turned into a nightmare when on arrival in the us city he was subjected to an hour secondary inspection by us customs and border protection officerssharing his harrowing experience on chinese social media platform xiaohongshu earlier this year chen described how the officers scrutinized his emails and online browsing history and chat recordsthe ordeal reached its climax when they discovered a screenshot of a news photo celebrating a successful chinese satellite launch in his digital album despite his legally obtained visa chens entry was denied and he was unceremoniously deportedthey made me stand against a wall with a measuring scale for a photo isnt that how criminals are photographed chen said i never thought i would face such mental humiliationtwo weeks after chen was deported he received a collect parcel from the us which charged him  in postal fees and contained his electronic devices seized by us customsa chinese employee surnamed liu from an international internet company specializing in short video services shared a similar ordeal through his wechat public accountliu had thought he was on a routine business trip departing from guarulhos international airport in sao paulo brazil on march  he wrote in his wechat social media account life has become increasingly simple in middle age and a single backpack is enough for a fiveday business trip across continentshowever his experience at the border in houston texas shattered his relaxed and cheerful mood after getting off the planea cbp officer subjected him to the secondary inspection area at george bush intercontinental airport lius electronic devices were seized and he was interrogated for over  hoursthey asked me if i and my company were engaged in data theft spreading sensitive information and connected to chinese governments liu saidlius valid visa was eventually revoked despite his role in company logistics strategy leading to his deportation from the us and a severe blow to his career liu later learned from a cbp officer that his sufferings arose because his name was similar to that of a chinese scientistthe secondary inspection area is referred to as the small dark room on chinese social media although interviewees clarify it is not literally small or dark but labeled so due to the harassment and oppressive atmospheremore than  chinese students from computerrelated fields have been subjected to unwarranted harassment scrutiny and deportation by us authorities according to latest accountsmost were graduate students whose research areas included artificial intelligence information science cybersecurity electrical engineering software engineering and electronic information engineeringwhen the students applied for their visas the us side would have done the necessary security background checks that is to say they passed the security risk screening to get the visa said wu xinbo dean of fudan universitys institute of international studies and director of the center for american studies at fudan universitybut now even if you get a visa it is highly possible that you can be refused entry and deported when you enter the us which is not reasonableshi yinhong director of the center on american studies at renmin university of china said that these absurd incidents have been on the rise amid the escalating china threat rhetoric with the us increasingly viewing china as its main competitorshi said that the focus on national security signals a rise in protectionism and underscores us insecurity about advancements in science and technologywu from fudan university said the political motivation behind the phenomenon is clear — it aims to control and restrict cultural exchanges between the two countries for national security directly leading to a decline in peopletopeople interactionsmany online discussion forums have been organized through chinese social media platforms to address the concerns with students sharing their educational backgrounds and internship experiences and asking whether their academic credentials might affect their visa applications and entryfor students majoring in business and data at my university will there be issues with visa approvals i believe my major isnt sensitive but im worried that pursuing this degree might be futile asked one forum participantdepends on your luck replied another forum userchen the student who was heading to harvard medical school advised through his social media account that chinese students from universities identified as sensitive by the us should consider refraining from pursuing studies or postdoctoral positions in the countrya student surnamed chou who graduated in  from the university of california san diego said the us has long claimed to be a lighthouse of openness and inclusiveness but its actions run into the opposite directioncompared to the risk of being inspected and deported during each trip to and from the us it is a wiser choice to pursue higher education outside the us chou saidwe have already witnessed a significant decrease in the number of chinese students studying in the us over the past two years and this downward trend is expected to persist fudan universitys wu saidaccording to the open doors report on international educational exchange while china remains the largest source of international students in the us the total number has dropped from  to  in the past four years india surpassed china to become the largest source of international graduate students in  the proportion of chinese students in engineering fields is also decreasing annuallya source from an overseas study consultancy firm in shanghai said that us visa rejection rates for doctoral students in hightech fields are notably high even when they are not rejected the students face rigorous scrutiny prompting many to seek study opportunities in other countries like britain singapore and australia or at european universitiesexperts said that under the pretext of safeguarding national security us law enforcement authorities have overstretched the concept of national security and arbitrarily interrogated and repatriated chinese students which has caused a chilling effect and seriously affected the atmosphere of peopletopeople exchanges between the two countriesthe us attitude toward cultural and educational exchanges might be influenced by the us election and political situation said wu from fudan university adding that the us should act responsibly and be more open and inclusive in

sidestepping tariffs but also sparking a surge in local investment and job creation china daily looks at how international politics and economics are intertwining to drive significant shifts in manufacturing and tradewhen you buy drinks from mcdonalds wendys or dunkin the straws and cups you use are likely from a chinese company while the drinks are either produced in mexico or the united states and are a product of a complex trilateral trade relationshipafter former us president donald trump imposed tariffs on chinese imports and restricted chinese investments starting in march  the company making the cups fuling plastics began to face tariffs on many of its productsas a result fuling moved a factory to indonesia around  it also moved some production to monterrey mexico and then fuling opened a factory in pennsylvaniafuling plastics is not the only chinese company moving factories to north america amid rising uschina geopolitical tensionsmonterrey is the capital of nuevo leon a state in northern mexico chinese corporations last year were responsible for more than  percent of the foreign investment in the state second only to the us at  percent the new york times reporteda lot of our customers that are close to the border of mexico can take advantage of competitive pricing and shorter lead times not only do we avoid the tariffs coming out of china but customers within a reasonable distance of monterrey can enjoy the same type of products manufactured in mexico at a fairly competitive price tom melchiorre president of direct link usa a joint venture of fuling plastics told china dailythe company currently has about  employees in mexico operating out of a facility of  square feet  square meters but soon it will expand to more than  square feet and about  employees only the management is from china while all other employees are mexicanthe ministry of economy of nuevo leon reported that the state received  billion in investments from october  to april  creating  new jobsthe mexican ministry of economy recorded  foreign direct investment announcements in  worth  billion the us led with  billion followed by china with  billionin  chinas direct investment in mexico rose  percent yearonyear chinese companies now represent the fastestgrowing source of foreign investment in mexicothe trend of chinese investment in mexico started around  and will likely continue as the us imposes more tariffs on chinese products and industriesthe increasing tariffs from the us have been imposed on items from china such as solar panels electric vehicles and ev batteries which have led to shipping costs rising about six times melchiorre saidwhen youre producing commodity products and shipping costs rise that much your product is now  to  percent higher so i think it becomes more and more attractive to manufacture in mexico as we continue to face these challenges melchiorre saidmexicos exports to the us last year surpassed chinas for the first time in two decades a development linked to the political tensions between china and the us however the trade relationship between china and the us is resilient even under strained conditionsresearchers analyzed the evolution of the trilateral trade relationship between mexico the us and china from  to  and found that in general for every  percent increase in mexicos exports to the us mexicos imports from china increased by  percentxuedong liu professor of economics and engineering at the national autonomous university of mexico noted that since  about half of the us trade surplus with mexico has been offset by a growing deficit with china making mexico a key assembly hub for north america and china an influential player in the regions tradecosteffective goodsmexico chose chinese products not for political reasons but for their high costeffectiveness and the lack of substitutes from other countries liu told china dailythe primary reason is that mexicos local supply chain is not robust enough to meet all its needs to increase exports to the us mexico must also increase its imports these imports dont necessarily have to come from china they could come from other countries he saidhowever mexico ultimately chooses chinese products due to their competitive pricing this choice isnt driven by any specific policy or political measure but by market economicschinese products offer better value for money compared to those from other countries if this werent the case local manufacturers in mexico would opt for imports from countries like vietnam indonesia or brazil however these countries either lack competitive pricing or a complete supply chain for certain products liu addedthe joe biden administration in july announced new tariffs on imports of mexican steel containing chinese components the us will now impose a  percent tariff on such steel the same rate imposed on steel from china previously mexican steel with chinese components was exempt from dutythese tariffs that the united states put in place specifically to try to prevent metals that come from china from entering their country represent a risk for mexican exports because part of the exports are produced in china and not in mexico and in the short term it is very unlikely that mexico will be able to change that so those commodities are produced here ana azuara commodity markets specialist at grupo financiero base told bnamericas an online source of daily business information and intelligence on latin americathe tariffs were costly for mexico and to compensate for the economic toll the us and mexico agreed that steel imported from brazil that is processed in mexico and then exported to the us will not be subject to tariffs liu saidbut brazilian steel is not as costeffective as chinese steel it is currently very difficult to estimate the potential economic impact on mexico he saidunlike vietnam and malaysia mexico has a stronger industrial base to manufacture its own products especially after joining the north american free trade agreement nafta the predecessor to the usmca in usmca is a free trade agreement between the us mexico and canada which replaced nafta in still mexico faces challenges with its supply chain lacking intermediate and capital goods which limits its export capacity so to increase exports mexico needs to increase imports liu saidmexico is now importing more products from china which used to come from north america in   percent of mexicos imports in electronics such as mobile phones auto parts and motor vehicles came from china sectors where the us was traditionally the main supplier according to americas quarterly a nonprofit publicationsome believe that in the contest between the two major powers the us and china mexico has not yet found a strategy to address the increasingly complex trilateral trade relationship caught between uschina trade dynamics mexicos relationship with china has become more politically complicatedin january  the us mexico and canada established a committee to substitute imports from asia with products manufactured in north americabefore  trade between china and mexico was primarily driven by mutual benefit and market principles liu saidsince  bilateral trade between china and mexico has not only been influenced by economic and market factors but also political ones liu said he said that it is a new characteristic of the trade relationshipmexico welcomes chinese investment in  ahead of his visit to china former mexican foreign minister marcelo ebrard said the country wants to deepen economic ties with china by increasing its exports and attracting more chinese investmentebrard told reporters via a video link from the group of  summit in osaka japan in  that he would be prioritizing the expansion of business ties during his visit to chinawhat were interested in is increasing mexicos presence in china mexicos capacity to export to china and chinas investments in mexico he said according to reutersthe structural reasons that are bringing capital to mexico are here to stay said juan carlos baker pineda mexicos former viceminister for external trade i have no indication that the trade war between china and the us is going to diminish any time soonwhile the chinese origin of the capital coming into mexico may be uncomfortable for the policies of some countries according to international trade legislation those products are to all intents and purposes mexican the bbc quoted him as sayingciting examplesan example of such products is mexicos auto manufacturing industry in  tesla announced plans to establish a factory in mexico which attracted a large number of suppliers to the countrymany of those suppliers were already producing components or raw materials for tesla in china the chinese auto parts makers are rapidly setting up plants on the outskirts of monterrey where tesla plans its manufacturing plantwhile made in mexico is gaining ground in the north american market chinese companies still hold an advantage due to their stronger technical and supply chain foundations experts saidmexico now aims to strengthen local supply chains and increase production value but this has been a longstanding issue while china has invested heavily in technology and research over the past  years mexico has not making it difficult to achieve these goals quickly liu saidmost of the companies going to mexico are bringing skills that we dont currently have in mexico jose luis enciso business intelligence director for keno consulting in beijing told china daily this will benefit us by introducing new skills and creating new suppliers it will also benefit the chinese investors because they will gain access to a new market and become more efficientmeanwhile it is not easy for chinese companies capital and technology to enter the mexican marketgoing to mexico has helped reduce lead times which is an advantage for our customers not having such a long lead time coming from china youre cutting your lead time from  days to  days to two weeks so there are a lot of advantages to producing in mexico melchiorre saidthere also are some disadvantages resin the raw material for melchiorres companys products is more expensive in mexico he said compared with china the cost of labor also is higher in mexico and shipping is very expensive especially when the company produces and ships throughout north americathe further north we go the more expensive and less competitive we are out of mexico melchiorre saidcultural differences are another issue for chinese companies operating in mexico there are not many latin americans who speak chinese and not many chinese who have spanish skills and industry experiencethat can lead to misunderstandings and make it difficult for companies to understand the local context said enciso whose company provides consulting services for chinese businesses entering mexicowhile mexican companies are accustomed to working with european and us firms integrating chinese companies can be challenging that is due to the need for local expertise in engineering legal and accounting services which also must align with the practices of chinese companies enciso addedenciso who also served as minister counselor for trade affairs at mexicos embassy in china remains positive about the future development of economic and trade relations between the two countrieswhile we dont have a free trade agreement in place mexico and china have developed a very good economic and policy dialogue over the past  years he saidthe recent efforts to strengthen ties between china and mexico involve multiple sectorschina southern airlines announced a direct route from shenzhen to mexico city in may and hainan airlines resumed direct flights between beijing and tijuana and mexico city in julythe connectivity is really going to help enhance peopletopeople exchanges enciso saidseveral major ocean carriers have opened new chinatomexico trade routes in recent months at the government level mexican tourism secretary miguel torruco visited china in july which led to support from both governments to continue strengthening bilateral relationshipscertainly the global policy environment will continue to evolve unfortunately with more protectionist measures and security concerns however i believe its only a matter of time until common ground is found to recognize the positive aspects of increasing trade and investment enciso saidin the world of beauty yuesai kan has dedicated decades of her

from around the world have told us president joe biden that broad economic sanctions imposed by the united states amount to collective punishment and violate international law and that it should endin a letter addressed to biden the signers called for the us to comply with the international law by ending the use of broad unilateral coercive measures that extensively harm civilian populationsthe letter said the unilateral application of certain economic sanctions by washington constitutes collective punishment which is considered a war crime and prohibited by the geneva conventionscollective punishment has become a standard practice of us foreign policy through sanctions and the us imposes them more than any other country the letter saidwhile the use of sanctions is different from conventional warfare its collective impact on civilians can be just as indiscriminate punitive and deadly the signatories saidhundreds of millions of people currently live under the sanctions and notable cases include cuba iran syria and venezuelathe sanctions can spark and prolong economic crisis hinder access to essential goods like food fuel and medicine and increase poverty hunger disease and even death rates especially among the children the letter saidcivilian suffering is not merely an incidental cost of sanction policies but it is also the intent the letter said it cited comments by mike pompeo former us secretary of state about the effectiveness of the donald trump administrations sanctions against iran he said things are much worse for the iranian people and were convinced that will lead the iranian people to rise up and change the behavior of the regimeus officials are aware that sanctions cause sufferingconditions induced by sanctions often drive mass migration as in cuba and venezuela recentlyhuman rights groups have said that more than  million people — about  percent of venezuelas population — have fled the south american country in the past decadethe letter echoes a recent report by michael fakhri a united nations special rapporteur who spent two weeks in venezuela to assess the situationeconomic crisisi saw firsthand how unilateral coercive measures in the form of economic sanctions have constrained the governments fiscal ability to implement their social protection programs and deliver basic public services fakhri wrote in his reportnearly  percent of venezuelans live in poverty based on income levels and  percent are exposed to extreme poverty with insufficient income to purchase a basic food basketfakhri also recommended lifting sanctions on

yearoveryear according to the reportbeijing  for ramona klein a yearold native indian woman in america hunger physical punishment and forced labor are all she can remember about a former north dakota native boarding school at which she stayed beginning at the age of sevenduring her stay klein was frequently punished by kneeling on the broom handles and was beaten all over her body with a short paddle by the wardenits a lifelong scar its a lifelong wound she saidkleins experience epitomizes the tragic history of aboriginal americans the us interior department recently released an investigative report showing that at least  native american children died between  and  while attending us governmentrun or supported boarding schoolsmany of those children were abused in boarding schools forced to convert their beliefs and punished for speaking their native languages leaving lasting damage to aboriginal communitiesa war on aboriginal childrensince the enactment of the civilization fund act in  the united states has established native boarding schools on a large scale across the country forcing native children to enroll and destroy their cultural rootsthe conditions in these schools were deplorable and many children were subjected to physical punishment and sexual abuse at school some dying as a resultthe us interior departments report showed that at least  cemeteries had been discovered at  former boarding school sites across the united states for the burial of children who died while at schoolnative american boarding schools are a gruesome chapter in american history said american scholar barbara landis i dont think theres any way to whitewash thatsimilar scenarios played out in canada as well native children were taken most of the time by coerce to native residential schools characterized by poor hygiene physical abuse and hard laboraccording to a report released by canadas truth and reconciliation commission between the s and the s the canadian government established  residential schools to which at least  aboriginal children were forcibly sent and more than  were abused and killed at school there are more than  unmarked graves near the former sites of aboriginal residential schools in many parts of canadathose schools were a war on aboriginal children said survivor doris youngin australia to assimilate aboriginal people the australian government instituted a series of policies in the early th century that allowed authorities in some federal states to take aboriginal children from their parents at any time and for any reason and send them to native boarding schools in these places native children were forced to perform heavy physical labor and endure inhuman abusea report released by the australian government in  estimated that between  and  about onethird of native children were sent to boarding schools in australia dubbed the stolen generationdont try to tell me this wasnt genocidefrom the moment european colonizers set foot on the american continent they viewed native peoples as an obstacle to their plundering and a threat to the colonies to drive out these savages the colonists waged wars against the native indians killing and displacing them however war proved costly for the colonists so the first president of the united states george washington and others suggested that bloodshed could be minimized by forcing the native americans to assimilate into white culturein  carl schurz then us secretary of the interior said that the cost of educating a native indian child was far less than killing a native indian in a war investing in establishing more boarding schools was not only a philanthropic act but also the truest and wisest economyin the late s the us government opened the first boarding school for native indian children the carlisle indian industrial school whose founder richard henry pratt was the original author of the infamous slogan kill the indian in him and save the man over the next halfcentury nearly  aboriginal children attended the schoolthe canadian government inspired by the united states followed suit in establishing residential schools throughout the country and prohibited native children from entering other schoolsthe boarding schools in the united states and canada committed cultural genocide against the uncivilized aboriginal people under the guise of eradicating their savage indigenous cultures and rescuing themdont try to tell me this wasnt genocide survivor ben sherman said they went after our language our culture our family ties our land they succeeded on almost every leveldata from the statistics canada  census shows that most of canadas over  aboriginal languages are on the verge of disappearing with only  percent of aboriginal people being able to speak their native languages fluentlystolen landmany have noticed the sins of aboriginal boarding schools but rarely discussed the motive behind the policy of cultural genocidethe report of the canadian truth and reconciliation commission offered a clear answer  the government wished to divest itself of its legal and financial obligations to aboriginal people and gain control over their land and resourcesaccording to the statistics of american researchers from  to  the us government plundered about  square kilometers of land from the native indians through unequal agreements excessive expropriation or massacrethe period of the greatest expansion of the boarding school system coincided with the colossal theft of indigenous land said brenda child a professor at the university of minnesota in the united statesthe land taken from the native indians along with its underground resources was allocated by the government to public institutions such as colleges and universitiesprofessor childs university of minnesota was one of the institutions built on the stolen land according to a report released by the us news portal grist in february since its establishment in  the university of minnesota has taken more than  square kilometers of land from aboriginal tribes through relevant legislationthe university reaps huge benefits by renting or selling land grazing mining and other activities between  and  those lands produced more than  million us dollars in revenue primarily through leases for mining iron and taconite the report saidaustralia which is vast and sparsely populated has long been recognized by colonists as terra nullius  meaning land belonging to no one they deprived the aborigines of their ownership of land through legislation and occupied their land by expulsion and confiscationin the process of land looting by colonists many native australians were killed while those who survived lost their food sources as they were deprived of land for agricultural productionaccording to a study by australian researchers the first nations population went from an estimated  to  million before the invasion in  to less than  by the early slingering traumathe traumatic experience at boarding schools not only caused lifelong trauma but also had a lasting impact on the next generation of indigenous communitiesour people are still suffering our youths are suffering our children are still being born into very dysfunctional families that were created because of the irs indian residential school system so now we have a whole host of problems said dawn mcintyre a descendant of a survivor of the former beauval indian residential school in saskatchewan in central canadaresidential schools have destroyed indigenous cultures and family structures and the experiences of abuse have left indigenous people suffering from depression violence and drug addictioncanadian studies indicated that the lack of formal education in residential schools has resulted in lower literacy skills among the indigenous people which leads to lower income levels and higher rates of crime and suicide another canadian study found that children of residential school survivors are at greater risk of sexual and alcohol abuseit continues to go through generations and it continues to snowball and it takes a really great deal of effort for a person to lift themselves out of that mcintyre saidindigenous communities in the united states and australia also suffered from the lingering effects of the boarding school systemformer boarding school attendees were more likely to have chronic physical health conditions including diabetes and they had nearly four times the risk of any type of cancer as those who were not subjected to boarding schools according to a study by ursula bear an assistant professor of population health at the university of north dakotanotably bear also found that someone whose father attended a native boarding school had more possibilities of having chronic physical health problems than someone whose father did not attendaustralian government statistics showed that the average life expectancy of indigenous australians is over eight years lower than that of nonindigenous australians with higher rates of infant mortality obesity unemployment and suicideaccording to australian researcher patrick wolfe invasion is a structure not an event the suffering of the indigenous communities is not only from the past but still being perpetuated todaycompulsory residential boarding school education has had profound consequences for several generations of american indians said bearaugust introductionthe national endowment for democracy ned acts as the us governments white gloves it has long engaged

associate administrator for nasas space operations mission directorate said that we could take either path either returning the astronauts on starliner or seeking an alternative method of using spacexon june  astronauts butch wilmore and sunita williams were launched to the iss as part of starliners first crewed test flight and multiple technical problems have since occurredthe issues plaguing starliner include failures in the reaction control system rcs thrusters which are crucial for the spacecrafts maneuverability and safe return to earth and helium leaks in the propulsion system these problems have raised concerns about the capsules safety and reliabilitythe space agency is seriously considering a backup plan involving a spacex crew dragon capsule to bring the two back to earth this contingency could extend their stay in space to approximately eight months with a potential return date around february  according to wednesdays briefingsteve stich manager of nasas

then as we got closer and got a little bit more data we started to put a few more things in placethe starliner issues have broader implications for nasas commercial crew program the agency has long emphasized the importance of having multiple providers for crew transportation to ensure redundancy and continuous access to the iss spacex has been successfully ferrying astronauts to and from the

participating in fluid physics studies to understand how to manage liquids without gravityadditionally they have been involved in routine maintenance tasks including some less glamorous chores like toilet maintenance they also had to take emergency precautions when a defunct russian satellite broke apart near the iss forcing them to prepare for a potential evacuationa final decision on whether to proceed with the starliner return or switch to the spacex backup plan is expected by midaugust until then wilmore and williams will continue their extended stay aboard the issargentinas economic

justices binding code of conduct for the supreme court according to the fact sheetfirstly biden called for a constitutional amendment that makes clear no president is above the law or immune from prosecution for crimes committed while in officethis came in response to the courts july  ruling which determined that presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts performed while in office a decision related to a case involving former president donald trump who was indicted by a federal grand jury for his efforts to overturn the  electionsecondly biden supported a system in which the president would appoint a justice every two years to spend  years in active service on the supreme court currently supreme court justices serve lifetime appointments on the courtduring his tenure

those ambitious goals the state is turning its attention to offshore wind powerin california we have zero offshore wind today  right now china is far ahead of the us on the offshore wind industry daniel kammen a professor of energy at the university of california berkeley and director of its renewable and appropriate energy laboratory saidcalifornia has designated two zones for offshore wind farms — one in humboldt bay in the north and another in central california offshore wind is exciting because it can be permitted more quickly and serves as a battery for the grid kammen saidoffshore wind can complement the production cycles of solar and onland wind energy that characteristic is particularly valuable as solar production quickly diminishes when the sun sets requiring system operators to replace those megawatts with other sources in real time to maintain grid stabilityit also offers flexibility in energy production capable of generating electricity during peak demand and producing hydrogen or methanol during periods of low electricity prices that flexibility presents huge opportunities to decarbonize sectors that have traditionally been difficult to transition to clean energy kammen saidthe state can directly apply some of chinas practices he said the best way to apply it is not just to read about it but to actually get partners from chinacalifornia has already taken such steps by inviting engineering groups from norway the state is also exploring opportunities in fuel cells hydrogen production and other offshore renewable energy sources such as tidal and wave power those areas promise rich opportunities for knowledge exchange and collaboration with chinese partners who have wide experience in the fields kammen addedcalifornia and china have

before it was deployed security experts saythe latest version of its falcon sensor software was meant to make crowdstrike clients systems more secure against hacking by updating the threats it defends

and government offices were disrupted we currently estimate that crowdstrikes update affected  million windows devices microsoft said in a blog post on saturdaycrowdstrike released information to fix affected systems but experts said getting them back online would take time as it required manually weeding out the flawed codewhat it looks like is potentially the vetting or the sandboxing they do when they look at code maybe somehow this file was not included in that or slipped through said steve cobb chief security officer at security scorecard in new york which also had some systems affected by the issueproblems came to light quickly after the update was rolled out on friday and users posted pictures on social media of computers with blue screens displaying error messagespatrick wardle a security researcher specializing in studying threats against operating systems said his analysis identified the code responsible for the outagethe updates problem was in a file that contains either configuration information or signatures he said such signatures are code that detects specific types of malicious code or malwareits very common that security products update their signatures like once a day  because theyre continually monitoring for new malware and because they want to make sure that their customers are protected from the latest threats he saidthe frequency of updates is probably the reason why crowdstrike didnt test it as much he saidit is unclear how that faulty code got into the update and why it was not detected before being released to customersideally this would

the forecast for china had risen from  percent for  and  percent for  compared with the april outlookand this revision was in part based on stronger consumption numbers in the first quarter of the year stronger exports also and that led us to that revision he saidone of the reasons is that we expect that the new program which is called trading and equipment upgrade put in place by the chinese authority will help boost consumption and investment and growth at the same time said jeanmarc natal who is the deputy chief of the world economic studies division in the imfs research departmentwe

vulnerable to new shocks gourinchas in a blog on the july  weo called the us a concerning example and that at full employment it maintains a fiscal stance that pushes its debttogdp ratio steadily higher with risks to both the domestic and global economythe weo report also warned that inflation risks have increased with services prices holding up disinflation which increases the prospect of interest rates staying elevated longer in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertaintywe see an explosion in the number of traderestrictive measures gourinchas said noting that the measures include export restrictions and industrial policies and both may lead to retaliationone concern we have is that going forward this will weigh down on global activity he saidthe report also said that a resurgence of tariffs could lead to retaliation and a costly race to the bottomso lets remember that when we look at the assessment of for instance the previous rounds of tariffs that have been imposed by countries very often the cost assessment finds that its the country that imposes the tariffs that bear the cost of these tariffs he said and so it hurts the domestic

raised public concern about immigration and the farright alternative for deutschland party or afd is continuing to make political ground by campaigning heavily on the issue of migration controlscholzs threeparty coalition government comprising the social democrats greens and free democrats recently held talks with political opponents to try and find common ground over the topic but the opposition christian democrats or cdu said it would not take part in any more meetingsthere is no country in the world with a shrinking working population that has economic growth that is the truth we are confronted with scholz told members of the countrys parliament the bundestagbut while continuing to stress the importance of welcoming outsiders he also made it clear that there must be tighter controls than those employed by previous governmentswe are a country that offers protection to those who are politically persecuted who are running for their lives who have to save their lives and that is in our constitution and we are not putting that up for debate he said openness to the world is therefore necessary but openness to the world does not mean that anyone who wants to can come we must be able to choose who comes to germany i say that quite explicitly herescholz accused opposition groups including the cdu of sloganeering not getting anything done and he said the party was seeking to make publicity out of the issue without trying to resolve itcdu leader friedrich merz said scholzs proposals lacked substance and that is why we are not entering into an endless loop of talks with youbut scholz replied we will never slam a door you can always come back to discussionsat the same time as calling for tougher measures however merz did concede that germany needs to welcome outsiders for its economic and social healthgermany must remain an open and foreignfriendly country he said and wary of the rise of the afd he added that the cdu stands clearly and

a think tank specializing in european issues on friday on the french tv channel france infohowever as the oldest prime minister in the history of the fifth republic barniers challenge will be to remain in office as long as possible and avoid being overthrown he is expected to win  seats with support from macrons coalition  seats the lr  seats and the centrist liot group  seats this total

temporary foreign workers in regions with an unemployment rate of  percent or higherthe policy announced on aug  will go into effect on sept a un report issued july  called the program a breeding ground for contemporary slavery and said workers experienced a wide range of abuses because they had insufficient access to legal remediesemployers will be permitted to hire a maximum of  percent of their workforces from the temporary foreign worker program tfwp down from  percentthe tfwp was designed to help employers fill temporary labor shortages when qualified canadian citizens or permanent residents arent availablein  the highest number of work permit holders were from mexico  followed by india with  according to canadian government data there were  workers from chinaspeaking to reporters at the liberal party cabinet retreat in halifax last monday prime minister justin trudeau said his government had relaxed the programs rules to help businesses facing labor shortages recover from the pandemicbut the economic situation is different now he said and canada no longer needs as many temporary foreign workersaccording to public data from immigration refugees and citizenship canada there were  temporary foreign worker permits issued in  up from  in mario seccareccia a professor in the economics department at the university of ottawa told china daily i would rather describe this as a somewhat hybrid form of indentured labor where workers are brought over and are taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers by abusing them and not respecting their contractual obligations and not fully paying themhe said that existing regulatory mechanisms didnt protect the workers rights the key issue is the power imbalance created by the system in which foreign workers are tied to a single employer he said that creates a dependency that can lead to potential abuse as workers fear losing their jobs and being forced to return to their home countries if the employer no longer wants them seccareccia saida simple solution is to allow the foreign workers during the period of their work permit in canada to find another job for example in agriculture or the services industry removing that bondage to one employer would clearly reduce this abuse he saidhe said the program can easily lead to abuse because it doesnt allow foreign workers to leave abusive employers and to stay in canada during the full term of their permitsbut the federal and provincial governments should have more closely monitored the situation he saidthe un report called for an end to closed work permit systems and for all workers to be given the right to change employers the report also emphasized the need for governments to work proactively to inform workers of their rights rather than deferring to the demands of employersmathis denis a spokesman for employment minister randy boissonnault told china daily the health and safety of temporary foreign workers in canada is paramount it is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure that employers are complying with the program and to hold those who are not to accountdenis noted that in the last fiscal year the government completed  inspections under the tfwp during that period  million in fines were issued to noncompliant employers for violating program rules an increase of approximately  percent from the prior fiscal year twelve employers were banned from the program compared with the previous fiscal year when seven were bannedthe employment ministers office said that last year the government conducted a survey of more than  workers in the tfw program  percent of respondents said they knew about their rights and responsibilities and  percent reported increased knowledge of their rights and the resources and

an election this summer which could mean that the proposed new projects take even longer to be made realityvarious factors contributed to the delay of the new reactor including design complexity and a

sectors soundly and orderly encouraging companies to apply digital intelligent and green technologies to transform traditional industries and imposing tighter institutional constraints for

of chinas economic growth in  contributing  percent of the gdp expansion she said quoting a research paper published by the center in january this year the heightened focus by the chinese government on fostering new quality productive forces including green technologies will likely further drive production in this sectorshe said the growing volumes of affordable clean products in china could also help the global energy transition and the supply chains that need to be expanded worldwidechinas investment and production of green technologies were key drivers in bringing down international prices accelerating the uptake worldwide schaepe said chinese companies are already setting up new production facilities in other countries they can contribute to diversifying supply chains and offering technology transfer particularly with countries in the global southsustained focusmeanwhile chinas sustained focus on green transformation has also driven some traditional energyintensive industries to become cleaner both experts pointed outyang found out that both chinas central and local stateowned enterprises in the electricity sector while owning the majority of coal power assets in the country have actively diversified into renewable energy which significantly contributed to controlling the emissions by limiting coal consumption increasethe steel sector saw no new permits for coalbased steel plants in the first half of  signaling a shift toward cleaner production methods such as electric arc furnaces schaepe saidthe record expansion of renewables capacity coupled with saturation in the real estate sector and emission reductions from heavy industry signals that china may already have seen a carbon emissions peak in  she saiddespite that chinas path to carbon neutrality can still be long and winding she admittedschaepe called for ambitious staged carbon reduction targets leading from peak to carbon neutrality a clearer coal phasedown plan and stronger support for grid flexibility and power market reform to integrate renewablesyang expressed hope that policy support for clean industries would remain on course emphasizing the need for continued

images and data with the real world and the technology has the potential to make driving much safer with holograms on windscreens that can highlight hazards and additional environmental context for journeys likely in the near futureheadup displays or huds are augmented reality displays that can be fitted to cars and work similarly to virtual reality headsets except they provide visual feedback for the real world insteadtwo dimensional huds are actually established technology that have been commonly used in aerospace and the military since as early as the s three dimensional holographic versions however provide a stronger more visible physical presence which can integrate with the depth of field view of the driverthe human brain is not designed for prolonged attention to detail the mind fatigues and distractions become more commonplace and intense the longer time passes when this happens a driver can lose awareness of the road and react too slowly to upcoming hazards huds can help highlight sudden changes in road conditions or preempt themthe technology would solve a major issue in road safety psychology called the look but fail to see phenomenon this is when a user does not register something right in front of their eyes having a secondary display system highlights problems making them harder to miss studies show that visual cues draw human attention to details in situations extremely effectively saving mental energy on prolonged tripsable to assist with navigation performance and hazards the promise of efficient and distractionfree driving is attractive to the consumer car industry which has been silently developing the technology for many yearsminiature lasers powered by a graphics card processing chip produce d holograms that are powerful enough to create visible images even when bathed in intense sunlightsuch advancements may also make driving more accessible to those with poorer vision current driving tests universally rely upon strict eyesight requirements it is hoped that huds may increase accessibility for the differently abled or the elderly in the near futurenaturally each brand or model of car will vary in the type of displays they choose to utilize and the type of holographic images on show sports vehicles could prioritize velocity and physics of the ride perhaps showing the g force the driver is sustaining under each turn urban drivers on the other hand may prefer displays that warn about pedestrians ahead or potholes in the road whatever the requirements of the driver an increased offering of visual information and context could allow them to stay alerta key contemporary issue in a future that could include selfdriving vehicles will be how best to balance road safety with a drivers desire to relax on a trip while still remaining fully aware of hazards and taking action when necessary here huds could also come into play popping up with attentiongrabbing colors and symbols to warn drivers even while they are relaxing much like the way in which inflight entertainment halts when instructions are given for passengers to fasten their seat belts or prepare for landing it is hoped huds will be able to alert drivers in the future by cutting into their relaxationit is important however that they will be designed in a way that notifies people at critical times without causing alarm or confusionaugmented reality displays are likely to become a mainstream optional consumer choice in the near future customers may opt to have the feature built into new car models and also purchase huds as installable separate addon extras this element of choice is equally as important when it comes to customizing huds to fit driver requirements warning messages are of course a mandatory component of the hud experience however extras such as telephone call information and music choices must be carefully managed by drivers and offered with caution by the manufacturer to prevent further distractionsbarry he

bank or ecb will now slash borrowing costs by a quarter of a pointthe optimism followed news that inflation fell during august within the member bloc that uses the euro for currency to a threeyear low of  percent after having edged up in july to  percent from  percent in junebert colijn an economist at ing told the financial times newspaper the fact that eurostat the european unions official statistics agency declared the eurozones inflation rate to be within a whisker of the ecbs target of  percent means rate cuts will be likely when the bank discusses the issue on sept the inflation environment is slowly getting more benign colijn said the ecb has arrived on a long home straighteurostat said germany and spain reported bigger than expected falls in consumer price rises in august while france also did well recording inflation at  percent in spite of cost pressures associated with hosting the olympic gamesif the ecb does reduce its key interest rate by a quarterpoint to  percent it will follow on from a quarterpoint cut in june and could lead to more cuts with the financial times saying traders are now hoping for two or three additional quarterpoint reductions before the end of the yearhowever within the overall inflation rate there was a worrying uptick in the cost of services something that jack allenreynolds from capital economics told the financial times may cause concern at the bankhowever we doubt that augusts unexpected increase in services inflation will stop the ecb from cutting interest rates at its next meeting in september he told the papera  percent fall in the cost of energy during august more than offset the increase in the cost of servicescore inflation which ignores price changes in volatile commodities including alcohol energy food and tobacco stood at  percent in august according to eurostat down slightly from  percent in julyfrench newspaper le monde said the ecb is likely to look closely at the core inflation rate when setting its interest rate and this could mean interest rate cuts are far from certainthe ecb started its campaign of aggressive interest rate hikes in july  when the eurozones inflation rate was rocketing up to  percent in october largely because of fastrising energy and food costs attributed to the ukraine conflictsam miley from the londonbased centre for economics and business research told le monde that interest rate cuts are more likely now than they were a few weeks ago but are not guaranteedthe … rate of core inflation and continually tight labor market will present risk factors to

to ensure institutional stability and that she is regarded as someone who would not gain wider support and approval leading to constitutional deadlockthis has prompted lfi to take action saying it is not up to the president to do political horse tradingmathilde panot the parliamentary leader of lfi said a draft impeachment document has been sent to assembly members from other parties in a bid to gain their supportthe assemblee nationale lower house and senat upper house can and must defend democracy against the presidents authoritarian leanings the document saidthe impeachment bid looks to be largely symbolic rather than meaningful however with twothirds of the combined members of the seat national assembly and seat senate needing to support any action for it to be successfularticle  of

dailyprosecutors in italy say the sinking of the superyacht bayesian off the coast of sicily that left seven people dead could results in charges of manslaughter and negligent shipwreckspeaking to journalists ambrogio cartosio public prosecutor in the town of termini imerese where the meter long yacht owned by british tech entrepreneur mike lynch went down said persons unknown were being looked at and names could soon be made publicit could be that we add someone to the list of people being investigated even way before the recovery of the boat he saidit seems to me likely that offences of negligent shipwreck and manslaughter have been committed its about establishing who they can be ascribed tothe yacht had  people on board when it was caught up in extremely violent winds during the early hours of august  and  people including all but one of the crew managed to escape the other seven people on board including lynch his yearold daughter hannah and jonathan bloomer the chairman of morgan stanley international bank diedthe financial times newspaper reports that the boat went down rear first suggesting that compartments at the back of the boat may have become floodeddeputy prosecutor raffaele cammarano said the boat had been caught up in a truly rapid sudden storm and there are reports that the wind reached force  on the beaufort scale which is hurricane strength in his only public comment so far the ships captain james cutfield said we didnt see it coming when talking about the change of weather but the chief of the company that built the boat giovanni costantino told the bbc human error must be a factor in what had happenedat the back of the boat a hatch must have been left open he said but also perhaps a side entrance for water to have poured insidebefore the storm the captain should have closed every opening lifted anchor turned on the engine pointed into the wind and lowered the keelthe bayesian was a model for many other vessels because of its stability and exceptionally high performance… there was absolutely no problem with it if water hadnt surged in it was unsinkablethe vessel whose tanks are still full of fuel is now lying  meters below the surface and to avoid damage to the boat caused by the water that has built up inside it the recovery process could take as long as two months and cost up to  million euros  millionthis is the most delicate part of the operation and needs to be done very very slowly because the bayesian is full of water marine salvage engineer nick sloane told the daily telegraph newspaper adding that around said  expert divers would be neededthe important thing is that when the yacht reaches the surface the sea must be calm so theyll have to carefully check the weather forecasts the yacht should be recovered exactly as it is in one piece with the aim of maintaining it as intact as possible geneva  the world health organization who on monday launched a global drive to tackle humantohuman

clean technology china is the undisputed world leader two decades of consistent and targeted industrial policy combined with the benefits of a huge domestic market mean that china today produces

southwest england came from  kilometers away in northeast scotland surprised scientists said wednesday solving one mystery but raising another how did its prehistoric builders move the huge slab so farthe neolithic circle of giant stones has been a source of wonder and mystery for nearly  years — in the middle ages the wizard merlin of arthurian legend was said to have stolen the monument from irelandmore recently scientists have determined that the sites upright sandstones came from relatively nearby marlborough while the bluestones arrayed near its center came from walesbut the origin of the altar stone a unique metricton slab lying on its side at the heart of the circle remained elusiveit was long thought to have also come from wales but tests along those lines always drew a blank said richard bevins a professor from aberystwyth university in wales and coauthor of a new studythis prompted a team of british and australian researchers to broaden their horizons — and in turn discover something quite sensational he told afpusing chemical analysis they determined that the altar stone came from scotlands orcadian basin which is at least  kilometers from stonehenge according to the study in the journal naturethe researchers were stunnedthis is a genuinely shocking result study coauthor robert ixer of university college london said in a statementthe astonishing distance was the longest recorded journey for any stone at the time said fellow coauthor nick pearce of aberystwyth universitywhether people about  bc were capable of transporting such huge stones from wales had already been a matter of heated debate among archaeologists and historiansthat a bymeter stone made the trip across much of the length of the united kingdom suggests the british isles were home to a highly organized and wellconnected society at the time the researchers saidthey called for further research to find out exactly where in scotland the stone came from — and how it made its way to stonehengeexplaining theoriesone theory is that the stone was brought to southern england not by humans but by naturally moving ice flowshowever research has shown that ice would actually have carried such stones northward away from stonehenge lead study author anthony clarke from australias curtin university told a news conferenceanother option was that the neolithic builders moved the stones over land — though this would have been extraordinarily difficultdense forests marshy bogs and mountains all formed formidable barriers for prehistoric movers clarke saidanother option is that the stone was transported by seathere is evidence of an extensive network of neolithic shipping which moved pottery and gems around the region clarke saidto work out where it came from the researchers fired laser beams into the crystals of a thin slice of the altar stonethe ratio of uranium and lead in these crystals act as miniature clocks for rocks providing their age said study coauthor chris kirkland of curtin universitythe team then compared the stones age with other rocks across the uk and found with a high degree of certainty that it came from the orcadian basin kirkland saidsusan greaney an archaeologist at the uks university of exeter not involved in the study said it established the first direct link between southern england and northern scotland during this timethe placement of this stone at the heart of the monument on the solstice axis shows that they thought this stone and by implication the connection with the area to the north was incredibly important she told afpagencies

very dangerous precedent ewart saidnick ive contributed to this storyshaoxinyingchinadailycomcnon july  the british public voted overwhelmingly to reject the conservative government of rishi sunak and deliver the labour partys keir starmer to office thus bringing labour to power for the first time since  after years of political instability controversy and chaos that have beset the united kingdom as well as economic stagnation and decline it is hoped that the new government will offer a spell of stability sensibility and pragmatism in its policies both at home and abroad with starmer commanding a massive majority he is sure to forge his own vision for the countryit is hoped that the uk will be able to earnestly and productively reengage with one of its key economic partners — china the previous government is guilty of destroying the bilateral relationship with beijing due to its mismanagement of britains foreign policy as a wholeit pursued a highly ideological path with brexit paid excessive subservience to the united states and deliberately whipped up antichina sentiment domestically to distract attention from its failures then there was opposition from certain parliamentary members groups which were subject to the influence of foreign organizationsthe new government therefore offers an opportunity for britain to reset its relations with the world on more sensible terms although we should not expect geopolitical realities to change and while starmer is by no means a radical having purged the antiwar left from his party while in opposition what we can realistically expect is a foreign policy based more on pragmatism national interests and sensibility as opposed to one premised on ideology identity and shorttermismfor example the previous conservative government was obsessed with pursuing a bilateral trade agreement with the us on the sole premise of anglophone exceptionalism as opposed to actual benefitseven as a protectionist washington showed no interest in such a deal and downing street happily sacrificed its other interests on a whim especially those concerning china its routine weaponization of antichina sentiment for shortterm political gain also made it impossible to engage with beijing even as sunak professed that he wished to do so in certain areas becoming a victim of internal party conflictas a result what we are likely to see from a labour government is not a drastic change in policy but certainly a rebalancing that will make it possible for london to have an amicable relationship with beijing again and to compartmentalize disagreements and areas of cooperation already starmers government is pursuing a reset with the european union that has been described as an end to the brexit era in other words an end to the theatrical nationalism and imperialera nostalgia of the conservatives and a return of cooperationfocused policies when the time is right we are likely to see this happen with china toowhile the previous government was subjected to backbench rebellions frequently led by highly ideological antichina members of parliament starmers largescale majority and emphasis on party discipline will mean his agenda will not be disrupted and therefore backbench mps cannot impose costs on the government for engaging with beijing for example owing to factional conflict within the conservative party individuals such as iain duncan smith and liz truss held disproportionate influence over the governments positions on china and threatened rebellion constantly which is what produced such jarring inconsistencieshowever beijing should nonetheless be aware that usfunded groups and organizations as well as the taiwan region will continue to press for influence among the new batch of mps as well as a hostile mainstream media and thus the socalled golden era will not return this however is preferable to the cold warstyle conflict that was actively sought by some in the previous administration ultimately the uk continues to have significant interests in a cooperative open and mature relationship with china one which can be made to work despite ideological and geopolitical differences as britain enters a new era it is time for a mature reset based on national intereststhe author is a british political and internationalrelations analyst the views do not necessarily reflect those of

landmarks — the eiffel towercharles leung ceo of french luxury jewelry brand chaumet shares the intriguing story behind the medals striking appearancethe olympic committee gave us a very special brief — to create a medal that has never been seen before in olympic history one that would make france shine on the global stage leung told china dailychaumets storied history with the french royal family made them the natural choice for this prestigious commission more than  years ago when napoleon was crowned he came to chaumet for his coronation crowns weve had the honor of designing tiaras and crowns for the french royal court over the centuries leung explained so when there was something this important for france the country turned to us againchaumets opportunity to design the medal for the  paris olympics was largely due to its parent company lvmh group a premium partner of the global sporting eventantoine arnault head of image and environment at lvmh emphasized the significance of the  paris olympics its an exceptional event that hasnt been held in france for  years one of the most closely followed in the world and its taking place in the city where most of our maisons were born arnault said he added that as the leading french group being involved in the paris olympics was not only an obvious choice but also a responsibilitychaumets design team set out to integrate the eiffel tower into the medals structure using recycled steel bars from the iconic landmark itself the eiffel tower was originally meant to be a temporary structure for the  worlds fair but it was such a sensation that paris decided to keep it leung saidthe issue was that the material was not good enough to last for so long so what happened was that over the years little by little bar by bar section by section the original metal framework has been replaced with stronger steel to ensure the towers longevitychaumets designers had the idea of cutting the eiffel tower steel into a hexagonal shape as it holds deep symbolic meaning for the frenchthe hexagon represents the shape of france itself said leung adding that it also evokes the image of the humble but hardworking bee which the french have long associated with national unity and industriousnessadding this slice of parisian history into the medals core was a delicate process we wanted each athlete to be able to bring home a piece of the eiffel tower a tangible connection to the host city that would stay with them forever leung explained the team carefully engineered the setting to showcase the recycled metal surrounding it with a sunray pattern that radiates outwardstrict specificationsleung also said the designers had to meticulously adhere to the olympics strict specifications the weight thickness and other technical details had to be perfect this is not just another piece of jewelry — its a prize that carries immense meaning and prestige he saidadditionally the design incorporates frances rich history of world fairs the

in its mining sector transformation push according to a senior government officialthe plans are part of the countrys grander economic diversification plan — vision  — introduced by saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman al saud in  and includes mining as the third pillar of national industrialism saudi arabias abundant mineral wealth is estimated at  trillionsaudi arabias minister of industry and mineral resources bandar bin ibrahim alkhorayef told china daily in an interview in hong kong on saturday that his country could complement the asia region in providing greater opportunities for relocating most of the manufacturing to his country with cooperation in rd and innovationweve all seen the challenges that had been faced in supply chain disruptions and we believe that saudi arabia can be a great place to solve these challenges he addedtheres a lot of commonalities between the two regions and one of saudi arabias ambitions is to grow its manufacturing base to explore its mining capabilities this is not only to satisfy our local market but also to participate in the global market said alkhorayefthe minister was wrapping up his trip to the greater bay area following a weeklong visit to asia including singapore where he said the purpose was to help large players look to saudi arabia as their next production locationexactly a year ago alkhorayef visited the chinese mainland where he met with senior government officials and visited factories and companieschina is a big country and last time we visited five cities this time we visited guangzhou theres a different flavor in each one of these cities and we try to capture the value and what each region of china can offer to saudi arabia said alkhorayefwe aim to focus on two areas one is to help large players look to saudi arabia as their next production location or logistics location because we can offer a mixture of enablers from the raw material to the energy prices to infrastructure great location he addedbusiness modelsand the other side which is interesting he said was innovation and the adaptation of new business models such as industry  and industry  and artificial intelligence other than manufacturingduring his visit alkhorayef invited chinese companies to invest in saudi which was highlighted by the national industrial strategy during a roundtable meeting organized by the federation of chambers of commerce in guangzhouin hong kong alkhorayef met with senior officials of the trade and industry department the innovation and technology commission and the commerce and economic development of hong kong among others according to the saudi press agencychina is saudi arabias largest trading partner according to the ministry of finance of saudi arabia the volume of trade between the two countries reached more than  billion in we believe saudi arabia can offer many opportunities for many global players from different countries china is definitely the number one trade partner to saudi so its only logical that we find areas of collaboration and bring some local content also to saudi arabia localization is key also to our strategy said alkhorayefwhen it comes to the belt and road initiative proposed by china the minister said saudi was greatly located in an area where it can serve to help many regions connect with each otherdefinitely we are also positioned in a way that allows us to access markets that are growing and have high potential to grow said alkhorayefits great to be here i used to be a businessman visiting china also singapore its great to be here with an official eye ive been really welcomed very well and by everyone both private sector and government so its overwhelming and i think there are great opportunities that we can bring together he addedthe

thinks washington is watching the behavior of hezbollah which so far has proved to be very much within the rules of confrontationhezbollah did not hit any civilian targets it did not hit any israeli city or civilian settlements but instead the focus was on some military posts establishments and installments said yousef adding that washington was not ready for any kind of regional confrontation where israel and iran would face offon the ground yousef said he believes israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu will keep on moving militarily in gaza taking advantage of weak opposition at

novemberaccording to yousef netanyahu will be watching the outcome of those elections to see who wins between former us president donald trump and current us vicepresident kamala harrisi think netanyahus going to continue bargaining with the us as hes bargaining with hamas as he is with the mediators including the egyptians and qataris he saidso this is part of his strategy and vision to

continue its operations with each passing day bringing more destruction to gaza she saidits hard to ignore the suspicion that this is a delaying tactic a diplomatic smoke screen behind which israel carries out its military objectivesthe us speaks of progress but the lack of tangible results suggests the talks are more about stalling than stopping the violencethe question of the philadelphi

between the uae and brics countries we believe there is an opportunity to strengthen that through dialogue among the brics nationswang haoran contributed to this storychina rather than the united states is better positioned to be a negotiator and mediator among countries in the middle east a us expert saysthe chinese government talks to everybody in the region said jack midgley principal of the global consultancy midgley  co and an adjunct associate professor in the security studies program at georgetown university chinas role as a convener an advocate a sponsor of all sides will be much stronger as time goes bythe us military said on aug  that secretary of defense lloyd austin ordered the uss georgia a nuclear submarine to the middle east the pentagon said in a statement that austin issued the order after speaking with israeli defense minister yoav gallantits unbelievably powerful midgley said of the ship whose complement includes  tomahawk cruise missiles each of which can carry a kiloton nuclear warheadthe move of the uss georgia into central command is the clearest possible signal that the us will defend israel with nuclear weapons if necessary he said pointing out that the pentagons announcement was a public signal that the firepower could be used to defend israel and also a very powerful deterrent signal to the iranianssince october the us position has moved toward unconditional support for israel and away from a more balanced position that it took in the past midgley saidthe us government and officials have repeatedly made statements supporting a twostate solutionhowever since the recent escalation of the conflict in gaza there is no discussion about any topic really by the us other than how much military support israel needs midgley saidthe americans used to be the convener they used to be the authority that everyone could talk to in the middle eastmeanwhile chinas position is a balanced one he said adding the country is better able to address all the parties than the us ischina is calling attention to the need of the palestinians at the same time china has maintained its position that the key to success is restraint negotiations and a twostate solutionso the chinese government talks to everybody in the region however the us remains an essential military partner for everyone in the middle east that wont be changed anytime soonhardly achieved anythingon tuesday night us secretary of state antony blinken left qatar concluding his ninth tour to the middle east as with his previous eight trips this one has hardly achieved anything xinhua news agency commenteddespite the declared optimism from the american side american mediation could not solve the problem between hamas and israel because reaching an agreement will not be easy due to the fundamental differences between them said kheir diabat a professor of the international affairs department at qatar universitymostafa amin an egyptian researcher on arab and international affairs said the failure of us mediation in the middle east and its inability to solve the problem from the outset until now arise from the lack of real pressure from washington on israel to stop the war while it continues to supply israel with weapons to kill palestiniansisraeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and farright officials in the israeli government had realized that the joe biden administration is unable to apply meaningful pressure on israel because of its preoccupation with the upcoming presidential election and its unwillingness to jeopardize relations with israel amin saidmidgley said the twostate solution currently is much farther away than it ever has been as none of the three requirements for the solution — ceasefire agreement at some level on borders and governance for palestine — are metand i think chinas voice for a twostate solution and chinas economic influence in the region can help keep this idea alive he saidthe us has already taken a position in favor of israel and is providing unlimited military assistance to the israelisthe second fact is that china maintains good relationships with all of the countries in the region including israelthis represents an opportunity for china to consolidate and improve its relationships in the pacific while the united states is busy elsewhere and im sure that chinese policy will reflect that opportunitychina is one of several

afar to tell the stories of peopletopeople exchanges between china and other countries through the vivid narration of the people in the stories readers can get a better understanding of a country that is boosting opennesschina has spent many years developing its automation and robotics industries and it is now the appropriate time to bring that expertise to the member countries of the gulf cooperation council or gcc said saleh al tunaib cofounder and ceo of btrtechthe gcc comprises saudi arabia kuwait the united arab emirates qatar bahrain and omanweve been working with chinese companies for a while and we found there are huge opportunities al tunaib said noting there was ease of working and efficiencies in the way the chinese companies do businessusually when we try to bring technologies from europe to the middle east it takes between nine and  months to bring them here al tunaib said in contrast chinese companies take three months to come in and deploy their technologies he addedal tunaib noted he has been working in the retail industry for almost  years and said he sees a huge need for automation in the sector for instance the value of ecommerce can be expected to reach  billion in the next couple of years in his viewwhen his team built their first automated warehouse they went through a process of trying to choose the right technology we dealt with mainly us and european technologies as the access to chinese technology was very difficult… in  he saidit was only when his team gained more exposure to the chinese market that they realized the existence of many chinese technologies that they could bring to the middle east regionin the middle east there was not enough access to chinese technology he said al tunaibs team seeks to bridge the gap between china and the middle east as there is a huge opportunity for bringing chinese ecommerce technology to the regional tunaibs team which runs a logistics hub out of kuwait operates its own software to integrate the use of robotics in the retail industryafter operating autostore an innovative automated material handling solution for a few years his business gained a better understanding of the chinese market he said then with the help of ewtp arabia capital which provides access to technology from mature global markets al tunaibs team visited china in januarythey visited four cities in china including guangzhou shenzhen shanghai and hangzhou where they interacted with multiple robotics companiesaccording to al tunaib his company is setting up clients with auto parts and ecommerce warehouses in kuwait across  square meters with the help of robotics technology from china one of the companies involved in the project is quicktron robotics a shanghaibased firm in robotic logistics solutions his team has been working with other chinese manufacturers such as megvii and senad since its visit in january he saidtheres no need for any data to prove the need to connect asia with the gcc and europe the integration of crossborder operations will bring in more business and connect us even further he addedsuch an integration of crossborder operations will take us to another level it will change the way we do business al tunaib saidaccording to al tunaib there is great growth momentum in saudi arabia as the nation plans to spend  billion over the next four years to help improve logistics and the ports sectorthe investment is part of saudi arabias vision  and aims to connect asia through saudi arabia to europe by becoming a global logistics hubexpertise in automationby leveraging the chinese companys expertise in automation al tunaibs company aims to transform the logistics operations of ecommerce businesses throughout the gcc regiontoday we represent quicktron shenzhen dbl technology and many other chinese companies in the middle east region he addedal tunaib said an obvious advantage of chinese companies is their focus on a niche area in the logistics sectoralthough there are different segments of robotics including drones or electronic vehicles within each segment of robotics every chinese company has its own focus such as the automated casehandling mobile robot the chinese companies want to be the best in a specific technologyin many other countries what weve seen is that they try to do something of everything he noted in this process sometimes you lose focus al tunaib addedal tunaib collaborates with chinese companies in two ways one is by bringing technology to the region and adopting these for the public and private sectors the other way is bringing relevant technologies and manufacturing partially or entirely in the gccso there are ways for us to innovate together bring our minds and resources together he saidaccording to al tunaib the people of gulf countries and china share similar traits i love china and its people he said gaza  hamas announced on tuesday the selection of yahya sinwar as its

collaboration with palestinian militant group hamas for the cruel massacre that took place in israel on oct the bills will be returned to the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee for

compensation under international lawpremeditated hostilitythe ministry of foreign affairs and expatriates of palestine said the israeli knessets classification of the unrwa as a terrorist organization

professor at the faculty of law at universitas indonesia told china daily that israels policy to categorize the unrwa as a terrorist organization is highly unusual in the context of international

rights in accordance with international and united nations resolutions to regain the palestinian territories seized by the israeli occupation forceshe pointed out that the settlement decisions and

our moral duty to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to all icj decisions in a consistent manner irrespective of the subject in question the statement saidthe icj advisory opinion will need to be

advisory opinion was not only for the question of palestine but for justice and for all the legal system as he believed that this determination will help in achieving justice and stability in the region if its implementedhe stressed this was why it was important to work with the international community with the un and other states toward imposing a mechanism toward ending this israeli occupationour move will be toward countries bilaterally that means that we will be working with states toward taking irreversible steps toward taking actions by putting consequences on this illegal occupation by not assessed or render aid or recognizing the illegality that israel is doing and consolidating in the occupied palestinian territories awadallah told china dailyhe said there were many things to be done whether at the un general assembly or the un security council level or any other organ within the un human rights council and other bodies in the un toward implementing this important and significant and landmark advisory opinionwe believe that the court said that they did what they had to do on moral and legal basis and its time for the international community to act on these moral and legal bases to end this illegality said awadallahhassan ben imran board member at law for palestine a nonprofit human rights organization praised the courts advisory opinion as good as it offered several legal grounds for palestinians to further their legal struggle for freedom and liberationhowever it should be noted that there is no expectation that israel would comply with it israel has given absolutely no reason to believe in a fraction of that imran told china dailytherefore the only way forward is imposing sanctions economic political and military ones on israel israels

sunday some residents were ordered to evacuate to western gaza city while the order on monday included areas that people had fled to a day earlier and instructed them to evacuate to shelters in deir al balahthe two directly affected areas encompass  health facilities that were recently functional including two hospitals two primary healthcare centers and nine medical points ocha said adding that  out of  hospitals in the gaza strip are only partially functionalthe office said that with nine out of every  people estimated to be displaced in gaza new waves of displacement are mainly affecting people who have already been displaced multiple times only to find themselves forced to flee again under shelling they were forced to reset their lives repeatedly without any of their belongings or any prospect of finding safety or reliable access to essential servicespeople especially children spend long hours queueing to collect water each day ocha said access to emergency health care is also a challenge particularly given limited communications coverage to contact emergency services high transportation costs to reach hospitals  us dollars roundtrip and the long walking distance of at least  kilometers to reach the nearest medical pointin northern gaza the aid partners especially highlighted the lack of safe shelters for up to  idps internally displaced persons who were forced to hastily flee from shujaiyeh and other parts of eastern gaza city following evacuation orders in late june many were found sleeping amid solid waste and rubble with no mattresses or enough clothing and some had sought shelter in partially destroyed un facilities and residential buildingsthe israeli military designated these same areas as evacuation zones forcing many of the same families including young children and the elderly to go through successive waves of displacement over the past two weeks the office saidocha said that insecurity damaged roads the breakdown of law and order and access limitations continue to hamper movement along the main humanitarian cargo route between kerem shalom crossing and khan younis and deir al balahthis has resulted in critical shortages of fuel and aid commodities to sustain humanitarian operations in addition to increasing the risk of spoilage and infestation of stranded supplies especially food due to extremely high temperatures the office saidthe humanitarians said the food security sector fss reports that the shortages forced partners to provide reduced food rations in central and southern gaza in june and undermined their ability to keep bakeries and community kitchens runningaccording to ocha only seven out of the  bakeries supported by humanitarian partners remain operational in gaza all in deir al balah and six bakeries already working at partial capacity have now been forced to completely cease operations due to the lack of fuelthe office said that in the absence of cooking gas and a stable flow of food supplies community kitchens are also struggling to operate resulting in a reduced number of cooked meals prepared throughout gaza as of the end of june about  cooked meals prepared in  kitchens were distributed daily to families across the strip compared to more than  in the first half of juneocha said it meant that displaced households rely on burning wood and plastic from furniture and waste to cook exacerbating health risks and environmental hazardsas for cooking humanitarian partners said they continue to distribute wheat flour and canned food that enter northern gaza through the erez west crossing no commercial trucks have been entering the area for monthsa joint assessment by the un food and agriculture organization and the un satellite centre estimated that about  percent of gazas cropland and onethird of its greenhouses were damagedthe fss reported a neartotal lack of protein sources such as meat and poultry on the local market and only a few types of locally produced vegetables are available at unaffordable pricesthe sector reported that continued military operations in rafah and recent displacement from eastern khan younis where significant agricultural production was concentrated before the war have resulted in additional damage to greenhouses it forced more people to leave their farms unattended further destabilizing food systemsocha said that on friday medecins sans frontieres msf reported that its teams at nasser medical complex were running on emergency medical stocks and all departments were overwhelmed by patients far exceeding available bed capacitymsf said the nasser medical complex is the main site on which field hospitals rely to sterilize their equipment and if the facility is left without electricity several field hospitals will also cease functioningit said the hospital has been unable to bring any medical supplies into gaza since the end of april including most recently on wednesday when the israeli authorities denied trucks carrying msf medical aid entry into the gaza strip due to ongoing hostilitiesthe ceasefire talks between palestinian militant group hamas and israel have seen its momentum dented after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu issued a list of nonnegotiable conditions in relation to israels objectives in gaza despite international calls amid heavy casualties and humanitarian disastersthe news came after hamas delivered its acceptance of threephase arrangements to negotiator countries the united states egypt and qatar while israel continued its bombardment in gaza with palestinian families fleeing

of israeli demands just as the israeli negotiating team was preparing to depart for further talks in cairo and doha expected later this weekaccording to a statement published on the israeli prime ministers website it was netanyahus steadfast position against the attempt to halt israel defense forces action in rafah that led hamas to enter negotiationsit noted that any deal would allow israel to resume fighting until all of objectives of the war have been achieved there would also be no smuggling of weapons to hamas from egypt to the gaza border and no return of thousands of armed terrorists to the northern gaza stripalso israel would maximize the number of living hostages who will be released from hamas captivitythe plan that has been agreed to by israel and which has been welcomed by united states president joe biden will allow israel to retrieve hostages without infringing on the other objectives of the war said the statementisraeli opposition leader yair lapid on his

malaysia told china daily that the tough stance taken by netanyahu might risk derailing the talks because hamas will view the new conditions as unacceptablethe more netanyahu insists on continuing the conflict the deeper the enmity grows said abdul wahedhe said hamas willingness to enter the negotiations is aimed at ending the hostilities with an initial ceasefire followed by discussions on issues like blockadelifting and reconstruction aidif those things are not achieved the conflict will continue therefore a more balanced strategy incorporating security concerns with genuine humanitarian

cultural power it was suggested would minimize us dependence on its militaryin the new century however the us aggressively exercised its hard power first in afghanistan then in iraq and libya us prestige waned as each military venture failed to achieve its stated aims in those years also the us was gradually losing its absolute preeminence in the global economy and the appeal of its
