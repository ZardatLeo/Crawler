Zhu Wenjun leans on nostalgia to revive Manchu eleganceIn Jilin Qipao Hall of Jilin city, Jilin province, the employees are tasked with selecting materials, fastening buttons, crafting inlays, cutting fabrics and sewing inlays and trims. They are artists, designers, and keepers of cultural tradition.Jilin city is one of the birthplaces of the ethnic minority Manchu people. The Manchu cheongsam, a type of qipao, integrates multiple intangible cultural heritage techniques.Born into a Manchu family, Zhu Wenjun, the hall's founder, developed a passion for cheongsams during her childhood."In Manchu tradition, all the girls must know how to sew," said 52-year-old Zhu. "My grandmother, who was skilled at needlework, made a living from sewing, so I started learning the skills from her at the age of 5."By the time she was in primary school, she could sew bedcovers with sharp edges and corners."Before major festivals, such as the Spring Festival, my grandmother would make traditional Manchu clothes for me, such as bloomers and tiger-head shoes," she recalled. "Her embroidery, such as pillow covers and door curtains, were welcomed by relatives and neighbors when they prepared for marriage."Zhu still remembers the beautiful cheongsam that her grandmother only wore on special occasions."She never let me touch it, which made me greatly desire to possess one," she said. "As I grew older, I began to understand the significance of clothing in Manchu families, which is not just a necessity, but also represents culture, status and family heritage."After graduating from a local secondary technical school in 1993, Zhu became a civil servant in Jilin city, but she retained her fondness for cheongsams.In 2005, Zhu quit her job and opened a tailor shop with her husband."Together with three tailors, we helped our customers choose suitable fabrics and tailor clothing, and sometimes we collaborated with other shops," she said. "Although I didn't make much money, I found fulfillment."They expanded their shop in 2009 and added more employees. Throughout her success, she never forgot about her dream of owning the perfect cheongsam."While visiting different cheongsam shops, I found it difficult to find one that could provide me with satisfactory fabrics, patterns and tailoring skills simultaneously," Zhu lamented. "I believed it wasn't about the tailors' skills but rather the lack of effective coordination, leading to clothing that fell short of ideal."A fashion company founded in October 2021 by Generation Z students is bringing artificial intelligence to the world of traditional Chinese clothing — known as qipao — and has created a design database that no ancient clothing designer could have imagined.The team of 15 designers is called Lin Chun Jie Qi, suggesting a traditional Chinese poetic aesthetic. "Lin Chun" references "springtime approaching" and "Jie Qi" means "to be both sophisticated and exquisite." They are led by a young founder, 19-year-old Cai Chenhan, an art management major at Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics.All members of the team are from Gen Z. With their youthful vision, they infuse modern elements, patterns and design concepts into traditional qipao, making the clothing more appealing to the younger generation. They employ advanced weaving techniques to imprint intricate patterns and create styles that resonate.Cai comes from a family immersed in the qipao-making tradition, with both her mother and grandmother designing primarily for older women. Growing up in that environment, Cai began learning the craft from a young age."My childhood dream was to become a fashion designer," Cai said. "While my family has been in the business for generations, they never ventured into custom design or design services. That's why I chose to study design — I wanted to carry the tradition forward."Cai's team is mostly stocked with fellow students from ZUFE, particularly those studying graphic design. The university's international school naturally has many foreign students. Cai and her classmates also collaborate with the ZUFE's Oriental College on fashion design projects.They introduce their designs by having international students wear the clothing in Chinese fashion shows on campus. This opportunity led Cai and two of her classmates to embark on the path of qipao design, initially focusing on visual design and user analysis.In 2021, Cai founded Hangzhou Lin Chun Jie Qi E-commerce Co. In just three years, her team won a silver medal in the Internet+ innovation and entrepreneurship competition for college students and a gold medal in Zhejiang province's 14th Challenge Cup entrepreneurial plan competition. They have sold between 3,000 and 4,000 pieces of traditional clothing in one year, with 30 percent of sales coming from abroad.The secret to their success was in creating the largest database of qipao samples in China. Traditionally, qipao patterns were hand-drawn on leather. Cai's team digitized and organized 19,000 examples. These designs are now used to train AI models, which assist in generating altogether new qipao patterns. The team often works late into the night to perfect the designs and build their efficient, automated design database.Using AI was a major breakthrough for qipao. The designs are updated and fresh, yet authentic, based on the accumulated information in the database. By inputting body measurements, fabric types and style preferences into the system, the team can generate custom qipao designs.This revolutionary approach has drastically reduced the design cycle from 10 or 15 days to just two. And the database has significantly improved product turnover."One of our biggest challenges was managing inventory," Cai said.Today, Lin Chun Jie Qi's qipao can be found in eight countries, with 46 stores abroad, mainly in Southeast Asia. Clients can also order custom-made qipao, with details such as fabric, patterns and design elements tailored to their preferences."The customization process involves extensive communication about styles, fabrics and detailed craftsmanship, right down to the height of the slits and the shape of the buttons," said Yu Dian, a student at ZUFE and the head of marketing and supply chains for Lin Chun Jie Qi.The team's success is not only the result of hard work but also the result of support from their school and society.During summer and winter breaks, the team conducted in-depth market research, collecting data on different ethnicities and preferences for clothing patterns. "We mainly focused on analyzing Southeast Asian and Western markets," Cai said. "Western clients prefer qipao with more skin exposure, while Southeast Asian clients prefer knee-length qipao with padded shoulders or cap sleeves. Their dress occasions are also more diverse, ranging from high-end balls to casual gatherings."The team's influence has expanded beyond ZUFE, reaching other universities in Hangzhou. Every quarter, they try to host qipao festivals and cultural exchange events on various campuses."Our goal is to truly extend the reach of the qipao, contributing youthful energy to the promotion of traditional Chinese culture," Cai said.At a Hanfu workshop in Caoxian county, East China's Shandong province, dressmakers are cutting creamy white silk and sewing a dress with golden silk thread.Li Zhen, who runs the company, said that traditional Hanfu are mostly long dresses, making summer the off-season for buying them. However, the company has designed shorter versions this summer, featuring half-skirts and midi-skirts, to meet the needs of customers during the warm weather."We consulted with the designers online, and the designs of our products were adjusted several times to our satisfaction," said Li.As a small county famous for e-commerce and Hanfu, Caoxian is actively exploring new consumer trends to turn summer from off-season into peak season.The willingness of consumers to buy speaks for itself. In the exhibition hall of Youai Yuncang, a Hanfu center, a simple and elegant dress attracts much attention."This is our new product for the season, but it doesn't have a name, because it sold out as soon as it hit the shelf," said Li Zilei, head of the center, adding that the dress is made of acetate imitation fabric. Compared with the traditional horse-face skirt, it has no folds, and is thinner and more of a drape, suitable as daily wear for female consumers of all ages."I like to wear a horse-faced skirt like this with light fabrics in summer. It's cool and beautiful," said Hu Xinyue, a Hanfu fan.With the increasing exposure of traditional Chinese clothing such as Hanfu and the horse-faced skirts, the neo-Chinese style, a mixture of classical attire and everyday clothes, has become a fashionable item for today's young generation.During the graduation season this year, Gao Yanjun, who runs a Hanfu business, worked with a number of universities to integrate elements of Hanfu and school characteristics into the bachelor's uniforms."I like traditional Chinese culture," said Xu Qian from Shanghai. "The neo-Chinese style clothing features traditional Chinese cultural attributes and is suitable for daily wear. When I visit historical and cultural tourist attraction with it on and take photos, I feel I'm a protagonist in a beautiful painting."Kong Fanxing, director of the culture and tourism department of Caoxian, believes that the young generation will provide the impetus for the development of the Hanfu and traditional culture, and thus form a virtuous circle of sustainable development.Hanfu designers of the post-00s generation are injecting vitality into the industry. Zhang Zichen, a new graduate majoring in fashion design, participated in a Hanfu experience activity last October and was attracted by traditional Chinese culture. She decided to return to her hometown to design Hanfu. She has successfully signed a contract with a company."The summer fashion boom is a testament to market approval of us, designers of the post-00s generation," she said.According to data from e-commerce platforms, 1,200 of the top 2,000 online Hanfu stores in China are from Caoxian. At present, nearly 100,000 people are participating in the business. The entire process, from dyeing and cutting to sewing the clothes can be completed here within 5 km, forming a complete industrial chain and brand incubation system.The 2024 Spring Festival Gala's segment "Nian Jin" showcased 20 traditional patterns spanning the Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties through costumes, featuring classic designs like butterfly motifs, orchid motifs, and gourd motifs.This program not only captivated the audience but also ignited a new wave of interest in modern Chinese-style clothing, which is called Xinzhongshi, or New Chinese Style. Data from JD.com reveals that as the Spring Festival Gala live broadcast commenced, transactions for modern Chinese-style clothing on the platform surged by 215% year-on-year, with hanfu (traditional Chinese dress) categories experiencing a 325% increase.As National Fitness Day approaches, lululemon celebrated the successful conclusion of its 2024 Summer Sweat Games Shanghai regional final competition at Jing’an Kerry Centeron Saturday, transforming the street into a vibrant community space.Nine teams, selected through rigorous store-level competitions, gathered on Anyi Road to vie for a spot in the national top eight, and team ‘Sister Wan is right’ secured their place in the national finals to be held in Beijing on Aug 24.China's first F1 driver and lululemon brand ambassador Zhou Guanyu attended the regional final event and presented medals to the winning teams.“I am also participating in this activity for the second year.I am delighted to see numerous sports enthusiasts gathering to challenge the competition...This event emphasizes teamwork,and it's heartening to witness everyone joyfully sweating in this scorching summer weather,” said Zhou.This year, lululemon took over Anyi Road again and transformed the 267-meter street into a community space, buzzing all day with lululemonAmbassador-led sessions in running, HIIT, yoga, dance, and cardio.

It was also the inaugural exhibition of a renovated and extended Palais Galliera, which included a new gallery.The exhibition was then adapted and presented in Melbourne, Tokyo and London.Bottega Veneta launches its 2024 Qixi campaign starring Du Juan, Zhou Yutong, and Mika Hasizume. With photography by Yuan Xiaopeng and film direction by Guo Dongxun, the campaign has been shot at rural locations featuring bridges and bodies of water.Alluding to the origin story behind Qixi, in which Zhinü and Niulang meet on the bridge of magpies over the Silver River, the campaign’s imagery also evokes broader themes of journey, crossing, and encounter. Inspired by its roots in the historic trade city of Venice, Bottega Veneta has long been aligned with movement and meeting points, as expressed through its signature Intrecciato leather weave.The campaign spotlights Bottega Veneta’s Qixi capsule collection, including Orbit trainers; Cabat bag; an exclusive edition of the Kit bag, only available in China; Candy Wallace with woven heart; a small Andiamo and Mini Wallace in a new pink shade of Bliss Washed; and a special heart-shaped edition of the Solstice bag.With wide-angle shots paired with powerful portraits, the campaign — which will run under the hashtag #TheSceneryWithYou — showcases each Bottega Veneta look against the vibrancy and vastness of natural backdrops. The inspiration of nature has been a recurrent feature of Matthieu Blazy’s creative direction, including the brand’s Summer Solstice campaign, shot on location in Lanzarote, and the AW24 collection, which was inspired by the landscapes of Calabria in Southern Italy, in particular the cactus.The campaign film is accompanied by music from Sega Bodega, a regular collaborator with Bottega Veneta. Drawing on Qixi’s themes of romance and yearning, his composition is inspired by popular 1980s Cantopop band, Beyond.Alongside Du Juan, Zhou Yutong, and Mika Hasizume, the Qixi campaign features models Li Chengyuan, Houjing Cui, Liu Han, and Tianqi Zhang.The 18th China Super Model Contest Final Contest concluded at the Shanghai Fashion Center on July 27. Zhao Ziqi was crowned the top female model, while Tian Jiayi scooped the male honor.Since its inception in 2006, this contest has become a significant platform in China's modeling industry, discovering numerous talented models. This year's competition featured participants from 25 provinces and cities and 107 universities across the country, showcasing the professional skills and fashion flair of the new generation of models.Liang Mingyu contributed to this story.On the shores of the ocean, members of the sailing and windsurfing national team are getting ready to embark on a new journey at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Alongside the team is the domestic brand Moution which has crafted a series of professional sunscreen supplies and equipment, showcasing how emerging domestic brands are gearing up for a global stage.From winning the country's first silver medal in women's windsurfing at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics by Zhang Xiaodong to claiming the most medals at the 2023 Hangzhou Asian Games, the Chinese national sailing and windsurfing team has become increasingly prominent on the international stage.Inspired by the passion of Chinese sailing athletes for this sport, Moution, a domestic outdoor brand founded in 2019, is determined to build a solid and beautiful barrier for the team in the arena with its technological strength in the field of professional sunscreen fabrics and a design concept of fashion."Outdoor sports have become a way of life, especially niche sports similar to sailing and windsurfing that attract young people around the world," said Lu Ping, co-founder of Moution."We believe that the sailing and windsurfing team are very suitable for us because they are a young team in China's emerging sports field in recent years, and their application scenarios also require sunscreen. Under these circumstances, we have collaborated with the energetic team," Lu added.In this design concept, Moution adopts exclusive cooling-fresh ice titanium technology sun protection fabric, achieving at least a 98 percent UV blocking rate. Even after 100 washes, it maintains the high efficacy of UPF50+ sunscreen, ensuring that athletes receive sustained and effective protection in strong sunlight.HONG KONG — In a dimly lit exhibition hall at the Hong Kong Palace Museum, exquisitely crafted vintage clothing and accessories are illuminated by spotlights, as clips from classic movies play silently in a loop, creating the sense of traveling through time.Nearly 400 items of French clothing, jewelry, and accessories from the late 18th to the early 20th centuries are on display, telling the story of fashion and attire like a centuries-old scroll.This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. The Hong Kong Palace Museum and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris have organized a special exhibition, Adorned Body: French Fashion and Jewelry 1770-1910 from the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris, to chronicle the evolution of French fashion trends.According to Ingrid Yeung, associate curator of the Hong Kong Palace Museum, French fashion has profoundly influenced the world, and its evolution has been shaped by the integration of multiple cultures."A lot of French fashion design was also inspired by Chinese culture," Yeung says, adding that there was clothing, porcelain and scarves on display that draws inspiration from Chinese elements."The initial goal of the establishment of the Hong Kong Palace Museum was to promote Chinese culture and facilitate cultural exchange," the Hong Kong museum director Louis Ng says.The graduation ceremony of the first batch of older models trained by Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology (BIFT) in collaboration with Hu Sheguang Supermodels, a modeling training platform established by the renowned designer, took place on Sunday in Beijing.Gong Yan, associate dean of BIFT's Continuing Education College; Han Jialu, director of the model training program; and Hu attended the ceremony, where they awarded certificates to the graduates, recognizing them as qualified older models, older model mentors and supermodel examiners."With China's rapid aging population and people's rising demand to entertain themselves through fashion after retirement, we decided to hold this training program for older women who aspire to shine on the catwalk," said Hu."Our collaboration with BIFT aims to give the program more credit and correct the public opinion that older models are not real models," he added.With "joyful fashion" as the core, the training program is designed to not only empower participants with sought-after modeling classes but also instill confidence in each of them.Noting the increasing demand for professional modeling training among retirees and the growing popularity of older models on the international catwalk, such as the 93-year-old American model Carmen Dell' Orefice, Hu set up Hu Sheguang Supermodels in 2018.Over the years since its establishment, Hu's global modeling training platform has garnered nearly 8,500 members with an average of 55 from all walks of life, with bases in more than 100 cities. It has also sent members such as Han Bin to strut on international catwalks such as New York Fashion Week and London Fashion Week."We will make this training program a regular one and keep innovating its courses to nurture more fashion enthusiasts into professional models," Hu said.The Shanghai Museum East is currently presenting the first solo exhibition for a living artist. Wallace Chan: Half a Century, ongoing from Wednesday to Oct 7, includes more than 200 pieces created by the Hong Kong-raised Chinese jewelry designer, juxtaposed against artifacts from the collections of a number of prestigious institutions.The Shanghai Museum has a focus not just on ancient art, but also on modern and contemporary art, according to its director, Chu Xiaobo. It has begun a new exhibition series, Drawing Inspiration from the Past: Masters of Modern and Contemporary Art, that seeks to highlight modern and contemporary artists from both the domestic and international arenas."Ultimately, the goal is for us to explore the unknown, challenge ourselves and embrace the future," Chu said at the opening.The featured artist in the inaugural exhibition was born in Fuzhou, Fujian province, in 1956, and began to work as a gemstone carver in 1973 at the age of 16.French brand Isabel Marant celebrated the re-opening of its flagship store in Beijing last Wednesday.The 170-square meter boutique, in Sanlitun Taikoo Li South, offers a welcoming and immersive experience. The store's design draws inspiration from the 1960s French experimental movement, which emphasized self-expression, imagination, durability and experimentation. The facade, with bright yellow walls and floor-to-ceiling windows, ensures sunlight floods in.Inside the store, warm-toned materials enhance the ambience creating an inviting, cozy and pleasant atmosphere.In addition to its design, the store features several notable works of art and design pieces including a wall tapestry by Ewald Kröner, lamps by Isamu Noguchi and the iconic Terrazza De Sede sofa designed by Ubald Klug.Founded by designer Isabel Marant in Paris in 1994, the French fashion house now has more than 85 stores worldwide including 16 in China. Beijing's new store displays Isabel Marant Mainline, a selection of Isabel Marant Etoile and Men and Isabel Marant Accessories.After 30 years of development, Isabel Marant remains an icon of cool French style, drawing inspiration from all over the world to irreverently refresh the urban wardrobe. Embodying a new vision of cool luxury, the brand has a unique positioning, standing at the intersection between traditional French luxury houses and high-end ready-to-wear brands."Rejecting ostentation and materialism, Isabel Marant offers a relaxed and effortless take on luxury clothing and accessories for men and women, promoting a positive attitude geared towards genuine enjoyment and self-fulfillment," said CEO Anouck Duranteau-Loeper.She told China Daily that Sanlitun Beijing has always been a very important location as it embodies a coll environment. When they updated the flagship store, they decided to do a new concept."We've been working a lot with Isabel on redefining what would be exactly the architecture of her style. We worked the floor, the furniture, the lighting and everything. So we feel it's quite interesting. We feel that here. It's a good match between our brand and the clientele and the environment."I think maybe as European, we've always preferred an open air type of shopping experience. But I think also the mix of brands makes it a bit less formal, a bit more cool."The facade is totally yellow, in a new material. Isabel loves the sun, and for us yellow is the color of the sun, of the energy. And we felt it was quite relevant to the brand to have that vibrant facade."Duranteau-Loeper is satisfied with the brand's performance in China. She said compared to the size of the market, the brand is still super small but is progressing."We have no Big Bang plan and we just want to grow the business steadily."The CEO has visited China more than 20 times since she joined the brand in 2016. Every time she visits China she sees more and more publicity and greater visibility of the brand."We feel that it matches quite well, the Chinese attitude, that mix between femininity and boyishness and then cool but a bit formal. I think it's quite interesting. We always see Isabel as a brand about tension. It's girly, it's femininity, but we twisted with the boyish thing, or it's a bit gypsy, but then you have something very sophisticated next to it," said she."Maybe because of that, it was a bit more complicated in the beginning to express ourselves, because we are not like just one logo or just one product, or like a very simple thing. But I feel that the authenticity of the brand and the attitude and now Chinese girls get it, we've always been the best kept secret of the cool girls in Paris then in New York. And I think now we have been that.""I'm quite happy to see that Chinese girls and women and now Chinese men start to really understand the brand.She says that China is a market that matters to the brand. "It's a market that is very specific. And it's time for really understanding. Well, all the specificity is both in terms of styling, attitude, media, everything is very different and very exciting. "On May 30 last year, the French fashion house Balenciaga released a short film for its 2024 Spring Collection in Paris. Set to the music of French chanson Sous le Ciel de Paris by Edith Piaf, it depicts Parisians basking in bright sunlight.Suddenly, a heavy downpour ensues, but people continue to go about their daily activities unperturbed, clad in their shimmering, expensive evening gowns.Nobody could predict, a year later, the downpour from the film would turn into reality, this time in Shanghai instead of Paris.Balenciaga had planned to unveil its Spring 2025 show on May 30 at the Museum of Art Pudong in Shanghai. During the rehearsal the day before, the outdoor runway on the terrace of the museum along the Huangpu River offered a view of Shanghai's iconic skyline, bathed in the glow of the setting sun.Mamianqun becomes trendy among younger generations as modern iterations reflect self-expression, Wang Xin reports.The mamianqun, translated as the "horse-face skirt", is a type of traditional clothing that is making a comeback as the latest fashion trend, gaining increasing popularity among younger Chinese generations, according to those in the know.The curators of an ongoing exhibition, Splendid Mamianqun, at the Shanghai Textiles Museum, made the above observation, due to the emerging trend of young people's growing sense of cultural pride.Mamianqun is a type of hanfu that features a high, flat front and pleated sides. It originated in the Song Dynasty (960-1279) and maintained its popularity during the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911).Launched on May 18, the two-month exhibition showcases dozens of mamianqun, including over 40 pieces from the ancient dynasties and 12 modified skirts with innovative designs. The exhibition has attracted a large number of visitors, many of which came dressed in mamianqun — both males and females, says Jia Yiliang, curator of the Shanghai Textiles Museum and a curator of the exhibition."There is an old saying — 'You are what you wear'. Mamianqun embodies the aesthetic, philosophy and wisdom of ancient Chinese dressmakers, reflecting the status, thoughts and experiences of the people wearing them," Jia says."Mamianqun, as a type of clothing, is also a language of self-expression and is close to our daily lives. You can either admire them from a professional perspective for the craftsmanship, technique and philosophy, or simply from a personal view and preference."Despite the long history of mamianqun, it was not until recent years that this traditional garment drew extensive focus, gaining international attention on the ancient Chinese skirt.Ma Wenjuan, one of the curators of the exhibition and deputy director of the Journal Center at Donghua University, was among the first to introduce in details the skirt to more people in 2022.As part of the third Shanghai Style Fashion Festival, a fashion show showcasing the city's blend of traditional and modern charm began at Yuyuan Garden on Wednesday.Hosted by Shanghai International Fashion Federation, the show was staged on the garden's Jiuqu (Zigzag) Bridge and Huxin Ting, a pavilion surrounded by a pond.Models were dressed in clothing from local maker Jixiang Yijia, a brand launched in 2012 in Shanghai and that specializes in the delicate mixing of Chinese traditional and modern styles.It is worth noting that this is the second time the Zigzag Bridge has staged a fashion show, following the French fashion house Lanvin's Spring/Summer 2021 collection show in October, 2020.Italian brand Prada announces the appointment of director and actress Jia Ling as its newest brand ambassador. Distinguished by her ability to transition from comedy to directing, she is at the forefront of contemporary filmmaking.Renowned for her consistent creativity, Jia Ling is one of China's most acclaimed actresses. Her extensive presence on stage and on the screen spans several years and includes seven appearances at the Spring Festival Gala. In 2021, her directorial debut and performance in Hi, Mom led her to become the highest-grossing female director worldwide for a single film. Most recently, she worked both as a director and as an actress on the 2024 film YOLO – reaching the top of the Chinese New Year box office.If you ask Generation Z — those born after 1995 and in the 2000s — what the current fashion craze in China is, "new Chinese style" will likely be the answer. After gaining immense popularity during this year's Spring Festival in February, the organic blend of traditional Chinese aesthetics and modern style continues to charm hearts during spring and summer, becoming a buzzword in the domestic consumer market.New Chinese-style clothing is typically defined as seamlessly integrating traditional Chinese elements with contemporary styles. It not only encapsulates traditional aesthetics and cultural heritage but also fuses materials, techniques and technologies stemming from modern science.On social media platforms like Douyin and Xiaohongshu, the "new Chinese style" remains a fervent topic. E-commerce data from short video platform Kuaishou showed that in the first quarter of this year, orders for products of "new Chinese style "increased by 700 percent compared to the same period last year, while orders for hanfu, the traditional attire of the Han ethnic group, increased by nearly 300 percent."Our orders are booked six months in advance, with a compound annual growth rate of over 100 percent in revenue," says Lin Qi, inheritor of the craftsmanship for making mamianqun, horse-face skirts, and the founder of a clothing brand. The horse-face skirt is a type of hanfu, featuring a high, flat front and pleated sides that originated in the Song Dynasty (960-1279) and prevailed in the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.In 2016, Lin started creating unique horse-face skirts, initially selling only a dozen pieces in a year. In just a few years, the annual sales volume of horse-face skirts her company made has soared to an impressive 100,000 pieces. Reflecting on this remarkable growth, Lin says, "The market has undergone notable changes." Currently, a significant portion of her clientele is from the younger generation.Many of those born post-95 say the inherent beauty of the new Chinese-style fashion touches their cultural genes when asked about its appeal. In addition, what excites young people are the stunning designs that exude a stronger sense of style and contemporary vibes.A closer look at the prevailing trends of the "new Chinese style "reveals a captivating blend of trendiness and refinement. Whether it's the exquisitely crafted button designs or the artistry in the embroidery embodying intangible cultural heritage, this fusion always perfectly captures young individuals' aesthetic preferences when seamlessly integrating with contemporary clothing styles and silhouettes.For example, the horse-face skirt has evolved into a more diverse fashion item and has thus gained even greater versatility. To cater to different occasions, it now comes in various lengths, from full-length to midi- and knee-length. To meet the demands of various seasons, the fabric has also seen improvements, transitioning from thick wool knits to lightweight cotton, linen and silk.From the qipao — a traditional Chinese dress for women — to hanfu, almost every popular fashion item is a reinterpretation of tradition. "We have invested a significant amount of time and money in collecting hundreds of traditional Song brocade patterns, studying weaving techniques and innovating to make them more in line with the modern aesthetics," says Wu Jianhua, president of a silk research and development company in Suzhou, Jiangsu province.Wu's company also researched and developed elastic Song brocade, aiming to enhance the fabric's wrinkle resistance, color vibrancy and comfort to make it more suitable for modern wear.Xue Yadi, born in 2000, praises the "new Chinese style" clothing as "not merely visually appealing but also lightweight". She adds: "Wearing these clothes fills me with a sense of pride.""The popularity of traditional clothing is closely related to the growing interest in traditional culture. Consumers not only pay for the clothing itself but also appreciate the aesthetic significance and cultural value it carries. This phenomenon reflects a strong cultural confidence among the public," says Yang Xiaodong, vice-president of the China National Garment Association.An ancient town threads its history to weave new trends among talented clothing designers, Xing Wen reports in Tongxiang, Zhejiang province.Against the backdrop of quaint, intricately arranged old buildings, wooden boats seem to glide on the canal, propelled by gentle oar strokes, while a pair of black swans elegantly accompany the procession, gracefully swimming alongside. Each boat hosts a stunning model displaying exquisite attire, the vivid hues of which are mirrored in the emerald waters. The waterways have been transformed into a unique fashion runway.Puyuan Fashion Week took place in the Puyuan Fashion Resort in Tongxiang, Jiaxing, East China's Zhejiang province, late last month. This location boasts the picturesque charm of a typical water town of Jiangnan region (south of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River), with fashionable elements woven into its fabric. Strolling through the resort, one can spot boutiques, textile exhibitions, millinery shops, jewelry stores and needle felting workshops.Here, any random corridor, alleyway, or square could be easily transformed into prestigious runways for renowned fashion brands, such as Vera Wang, The Atelier and La Mofiel, attracting numerous artists, supermodels, trendsetters and designers to embrace modern fashion in such antique surroundings.Puyuan ancient town originated in the Southern Song period (1127-1279). For the past four decades, it has been celebrated for its production of wool sweaters. The local sweater industry stands as China's largest domestic production base and distribution center for woolen knitwear. More than 700 million sweaters are sold annually from Puyuan to more than 20 countries and regions.In recent years, the town has actively pursued industrial upgrades and integration with the global fashion market. An important initiative in this endeavor has been the construction of Puyuan Fashion Resort, which opened to the public last spring, along with the launch of Puyuan Fashion Week held in the resort.Since its founding, Puyuan Fashion Resort has become the backdrop for numerous crossover events, including Puyuan Fashion Week, the Douyin Creator Conference and the Zhizu GQ Men of the Year Ceremony.Designer uses inspiration from culture to stitch together strands of creativity, Lin Qi reports.Born into several generations of embroiderers, fashion designer Lan Yu remembers that her first piece of Su embroidery was a bib made for her by her mother Lan Tanghua, for use as a child at kindergarten."It was embroidered with red and yellow flowers and leaves, which encircled five characters in the center that read 'for little friend Lan Yu', which my mom wrote out on paper before she stitched them," recalls the designer, now in her 30s. "The other children wore plain white bibs, with no patterns. My bib made me feel special, because I had a mother who was so skillful. It showed her deep love for me."Su embroidery is ranked among the four most celebrated kinds of Chinese embroidery. Originating in Suzhou — after which it is named — and spreading to surrounding areas in Jiangsu province, Su embroidery requires delicate workmanship, as exemplified by its variety of stitches and strong sense of color. For a long time, this form of artistry was passed down through women in the same family.As she studied fashion design, both in China and abroad, Lan Yu has been attempting to blaze new trails for Chinese embroidery and her family heritage, to give the tradition a fresh look more in line with the tastes of the younger generation of customers from around the world.She and her mother are currently sharing the fruits of their explorations at Poetic Charm of Splendid Attire, an exhibition that runs until Monday at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing. On show are dozens of recent designs inspired by classical Chinese poetry and paintings, as well as brocade pieces Lan Yu worked on with her mother, which create chemistry between the past and the present.Puyuan Fashion Week wrapped up on April 28 in Puyuan town, Tongxiang city in East China's Zhejiang province, a place renowned for its woolen sweaters.The five-day event included multiple fashion shows, forums, original design exhibitions and trade fairs, attracting more than 50,000 visitors.The Puyuan woolen sweater market is the largest domestic production base and distribution center for woolen knitwear, with more than 700 million sweaters sold from Puyuan to more than 20 countries and regions annually.In recent years, Puyuan has been actively pursuing industrial upgrades and integration with the global fashion market through the establishment of the Puyuan Fashion Resort and the hosting of various fashion-related events.Nearly a year after opening its first store on the Chinese mainland in Shanghai, Swiss watchmaker H. Moser & Cie unveiled its new product in cooperation with Alpine Motorsports last week.The watchmaker hosted the Shanghai event titled "GET ON THE FAST TRACK" and unveiled the Streamliner Cylindrical Tourbillon Skeleton Alpine Limited Edition together with Alpine F1 driver Pierre Gasly, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the Formula 1 Chinese Grand Prix.Limited to 100 sets, the launch celebrated H. Moser & Cie becoming the first global partner of Alpine Motorsports in February.The cooperation will enable the watchmaker to be present across all of the Alpine Motorsports programme, including the BWT Alpine F1 Team, the Alpine Endurance Team, and the Alpine Academy, according to Edouard Meylan, CEO of H. Moser & Cie."We want to get more visibility, and Formula 1 is an amazing platform. And together with Alpine, they are pushing their brand in very strategic markets for us, like the Chinese mainland, the US, and the Middle East where we want to continue to develop," Edouard Meylan said.He further pointed out that the cooperation, more importantly, gave H. Moser & Cie the possibility of developing a sporty and bold watch that hadn't been attempted before.From its foundation in 1955, modifying Renault cars for racing, Alpine created one of the most iconic rally cars of the 20th century. H. Moser & Cie, with its almost 200-year history, is the challenger in the watchmaking world.Besides being similar in heritage and genetics, there is also a very strong emotional connection between the two brands, since the Meylan family, owner of H. Moser & Cie has a profound history with Alpine cars, owning and racing them.The Autumn/Winter 2024 Shanghai Fashion Week, held in late March, centered around the theme "new Chinese style, new sustainability, and new sports", reflecting the evolving fashion landscape within the city, a burgeoning fashion capital.The event highlighted the emergence and popularity of the new Chinese style, showcasing the innovative designs of young, talented designers and attracting participation from various organizations. Approximately 25 percent of independent brands incorporated Chinese aesthetics into their autumn/winter collections on display at the Mode fashion exhibition.Raxxy, a Shanghai fashion brand, drew attention with designs inspired by Chinese traditional bamboo weaving. Co-founder Shen Weilian integrated Chinese cultural elements with 3D technology, presenting a collection featuring phoenix and dragon patterns, which garnered significant interest in the European market.In an effort to promote innovation on fashion within China, Raxxy previously showcased vibrant Chinese aesthetics at Milan Fashion Week and expressed a desire for domestic buyers to appreciate such creativity at the Shanghai Fashion Week.The Shanghai event also introduced a new Chinese fashion exhibition at the Shanghai Opera House, featuring representative brands, such as Vivienne Tam, Heaven Gaia, and Maying, showcasing their latest collections.The growing popularity of China-chic and new Chinese style-related products among consumers has seen a substantial increase in sales and turnover.Imagine transforming gold and silver into threads as delicate as a strand of hair, meticulously knitting them into intricate lace that represents a blooming flower, with precious gems carefully inset onto the delicate petals — this is the art of filigree inlay, a traditional Chinese court jewelry technique also known as "fine gold art".Zou Xuewen, a young jewelry designer and inheritor of the filigree inlay technique, a designated intangible cultural heritage in China, has been introducing this ancient craft to the United Kingdom through workshops, lectures, and exhibitions."Many of today's Western jewelry-making techniques have royal court origins and are employed by renowned brands such as Van Cleef& Arpels and Buccellati," remarked Zou, who established her brand, Zoey Filigree, in 2021. "I aspire to showcase Chinese jewelry techniques to the world through my creations."In January, Zou unveiled a new collection featuring jewelry pieces that combine Chinese calligraphy characters meaning "today" and "faraway" with floral designs."It is an exploration of the balance between the practical and the ideal," she explained, expressing her intention to incorporate more Chinese calligraphic characters into filigree jewelry.Crafting a piece of jewelry with filigree inlay is a time-consuming process, taking months to complete. It involves a series of intricate steps such as nipping, plaiting, jointing, piling, filling, and knitting delicate gold or silver threads.The history of filigree inlay dates back to China's Warring States Period (475-221 BC). With advancements in techniques for creating thin gold and silver threads, the art matured during the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, reaching its zenith during the Qing (1644-1911) Dynasty.Zou's fascination with traditional Chinese filigree inlay jewelry began during a master's program in jewelry design in London that she began in 2018. Amid a curriculum focused on modern jewelry design, Zou found herself drawn to traditional techniques, discovering filigree inlay through an online video featuring Zhao Yunliang, an esteemed master of the technique in Beijing."When I got into the college, I wasn't so sure what I liked so I studied different jewelry-making techniques on my own until I came across the filigree inlay in the online video," she recalled.In Milan, a town in which the chic and the modern are seemingly inseparable, this was the aging star that simply stole the show: clothing dating back thousands of years gracing the catwalks and awing audiences from around the world.That clothing, on display in the spring/summer collection of Milan Fashion Week in September, was emblazoned with intricate, ornate square patterns.The designs were not simply inspired from the latest trends but also drew on the traditions of the Miao, who migrated across the vast expanses of ancient China, with a mission to safeguard the Miao king's seal. To preserve their identity and connection a rendering of the seal was embroidered onto their garments.That seal has endured through centuries to find itself in the fashion spotlight, as far away as Milan, Italy."Miao embroidery is known as 'wearable history', and the stories of the Miao behind these designs down the centuries truly resonate with me," says Zhao Huizhou, a designer who led the Miao-inspired show in Milan.The Miao ethnic seal features four vibrant squares, meticulously embroidered onto the chest, back and shoulders of those wearing the traditional attire. Miao communities inhabit areas across China, including in Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan and Guangdong provinces.In Milan, designs were unveiled that can be traced to the distinctive attire of Miao groups in Guizhou.The four-square seal is just one facet of Miao embroidery's narrative tapestry. Across intricate patterns, one can discern traces of the Miao migratory odyssey — through winding roads, meandering rivers and rugged terrain — all etched into the rich fabric reminiscent of the challenges their ancestors faced."Through these patterns Miao people record myths and epics of migration, enabling memories to be passed on down the generations," says Jiao Hongxiu, a Miao who is a local embroiderer in Kaili, Guizhou.Liu Rui, a local official dedicated to the preservation and promotion of Miao embroidery and its culture, says embroidery serves as "a unique cultural language" for the Miao people."It's not merely clothing; it's a living history, a cartographic narrative and a badge of identity."The significance of Miao embroidery includes patterns and stitching techniques in which Miao people can discern between their various communities, Liu says.For example, a dragon motif symbolizes the Miao connection to Han Chinese culture but with subtle variations, he says. Miao groups living in Shibing county used a dragon design resembling a centipede whereas along the Bala River it took on the likeness of a silkworm.Over thousands of years the Miao people have also traversed vast territories, from China to Southeast Asia, and later to Europe and the Americas, where they are referred to as Hmong in some areas. Official figures put the global Miao ethnic population at more than 14 million, 11 million of them in China and the rest dispersed across over 10 countries spanning four continents. Embodied in their ethnic attire, Miao culture continues in the diaspora, providing a tangible link to their ancestral heritage.Charlene Classic put on an exhibition The Jewellery Art of Bamboo Fan to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese jewellery brand on March 21, at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.The Bamboo Grove was the centerpiece of the exhibition as it mesmerized the visitors with its circular jewellery display. Those entering the "grove" were welcomed by the gentle rustle of leaves and the whisper of a breeze, evoking nature at its most serene.Within this space was the Bamboo Fan high jewellery collection. This collection was inspired by ink bamboo depicted in literati paintings. It carries on the classic "fan" elements from the "Landscape Fan Collection ", customized for the Palace Museum in 2017, intricately carving out the philosophical charm of Oriental aesthetics. Launched in 2023, this collection was showcased at the Everson Museum in the United States, where it received the Special Award and Designer Award.The history of the Chinese fan can be dated back to over 3,000 years ago, popularised during the Han Dynasty (206BC-AD220) when the simple bamboo fan and the cattail-leaf fan were invented. Encapsulating this long and prominent history, Charlene's Bamboo Fan Collection uses precious emeralds as the main gemstone to enhance the fine craftsmanship. The intricate structure of the jewellery combined with exquisite gemstone recreates the dynamic scene of a bamboo forest.On March 6, Douyin E-commerce released the 2024 Douyin E-commerce Female Consumer Trend Data Report. It unveiled that in the past year, the order volume of horse-faced skirts — a type of hanfu, the traditional style of clothing worn by the Han people — among female users on Douyin, skyrocketed by 841 percent compared to the previous year."I've noticed that there are so many people wearing horse-faced skirts on the streets now, from young women to children; it's unbelievable," said Wang Zicheng, 23, a hanfu enthusiast.He recalled that when he wore hanfu for the first time in 2018 at his coming-of-age ceremony, it was still a minority interest even among young people in China. Now, he is confident wearing it everywhere, even outside of China.While studying at University College London, UK, and now at Boston University, US, Wang has taken pictures of himself wearing hanfu against the backdrop of iconic landmarks in various countries, such as Big Ben, the Egyptian pyramids, and the White House, illustrating a captivating blend of different cultures.Wei Xiaobo, 33, noticed the same change. He is the owner of the Taobao store "Huaibian Xiaozhu", specializing in restored traditional hanfu. He founded the store in 2014 while at university and shifted to full-time entrepreneurship in 2019.It was at that time that he noticed more general consumers were starting to rediscover the attire. "Previously, customers who came to the store to purchase hanfu were mainly fans of it and were familiar with the clothes and their associated terms," said Wei. "Around 2019, however, it was noticeable that many customers had only recently discovered it or had no prior knowledge of it."Since then, sales at Wei's store have continued to climb, with another significant surge recorded in 2023. Currently, over 41 percent of his customers are between the ages of 18 and 25.As a frontline practitioner, Wei experienced the impact of the hanfu trend on production lines. Previously, it was not easy to find Chinese manufacturers for hanfu fabrics; sourcing from neighboring countries was often necessary. "However, an increasing number of Chinese manufacturers now produce such fabrics, and even allow customization of patterns," he said.On Feb 14, Valentine's Day, which fell on the fifth day of the first lunar month as the Chinese were celebrating Spring Festival, Shanghai-based showroom interior designer Huang Weilai found himself unable to sleep after receiving a message from the Milan headquarters of women's fashion brand, Miu Miu.The Italian brand wanted to invite Huang's mother Qin Huilan, who turned 71 in December, to walk their runway show at the Paris Fashion Week for its Fall and Winter 2024 collection show."I was so excited and I couldn't believe it," says the 34-year-old. "I've been following fashion news for years and I know that selecting models for runway shows is very important. I am so proud that my mother, a woman in her 70s, was invited."Qin shared her son's excitement. Born and raised in Liuzhou in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, she is a retired physician. After accepting the invitation, she left for Paris on March 2."The 70-year-old wore a long gray coat with silver embellishments, a pair of oversized metallic gloves, a black scarf, a small brown leather bag and a pair of pointy-toe Mary Janes. … Huilan had plenty of eyes on her while she walked the runway, as the fashion house had a stacked front row. ... But she walked like a pro and brought her love of the house to the forefront," an article on the website of American magazine People said on March 5 after the show.From crypto to construction, the importance of brands embracing sustainability, as well as adding value, to meet the ever-evolving needs of consumers and the planet cannot be overlooked, experts told a design industry panel on Thursday.Italian Design Day 2024, presented by the Consulate General of Italy in Hong Kong and Macao, provided valuable insights into the global need for more industries to adopt sustainable practices.In the crypto world, Italian artist Andrea Bonaceto said that ensuring sustainability in both nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and artificial intelligence (AI) is extremely important for their long-term viability and ethical advancement."In the realm of NFTs, sustainability involves reducing the environmental footprint of blockchain transactions, embracing consensus protocols like proof-of-stake, and promoting responsible energy consumption," he said."Similarly, in AI, sustainability entails developing algorithms that prioritize efficiency and minimize data biases," he added.The artist also said that by integrating sustainable principles into both NFTs and AI, we can create a future where innovation thrives in harmony with our planet and its inhabitants.The construction industry has much work to do, as it is responsible for almost 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, according to Ruffina Thilakaratne, an associate professor at Hong Kong Chu Hai College."When the building density increases, this figure goes up," she said.Thilakaratne's research focuses on the issues that high-density cities will face by the middle of this century and explores prospective directions in responding to the challenges to create resilient cities.One sustainable solution is the potential of mass-engineered timber construction and adaptive reuse, but this is underexplored in Hong Kong, she noted."As an academic, I try to educate the future generation of architects to be mindful of the climate crisis and to make validated sustainable solutions beyond the norm to combat negative impacts," said Thilakaratne, who is also the Royal Institute of British Architects International Council Member for Asia and Australasia.Tiziano Guardini, an Italian fashion designer, said sustainability does not have the concept of waste, rather everything remains in the value chain.He described this as a "celebration of nature", saying that for him there is no real distinction between human beings and nature because we are part of the natural world.Guardini noted that when talking about the circular economy, for him it is about reconnecting with nature and a way of preserving life.To respect life in a broad sense, Guardini said he applies the ancient Indian principle of "ahimsa", or non-violence, to fashion.This allows him to create "peace silk" for his designs, Guardini said. Rather than harvesting silk by the widespread method of boiling the cocoons with the silkworms inside, he waits until the worms reach the next stage of their life cycle and then uses the abandoned cocoons."In this case, the life of another species is respected, a kind of dialogue between living beings is established, and evolution is not interrupted," Guardini said.In light of the pandemic and the significant shifts in people's lifestyles, it has become evident that sustainability alone is not sufficient, said Juliana Lam, chairman of Julius Group Holdings Ltd, a sustainable glove manufacturer."There is a growing demand for additional value in the products and services we offer, while also holding sustainability accountable," said Lam, who is also the founder and president of INNOTIER, a brand that integrates innovation and technology into lifestyle products."There is a growing demand for additional value in the products and services we offer, while also holding sustainability accountable," she said.Gianni Giuffrida, chief architect at Italia Pininfarina, said his company developed a climate-responsive architectural structure unveiled at Fuorisalone 2021 in Milano. The structure was part of an international project that aims to raise awareness around the re-use and recycling of plastic.Sports lifestyle brand Salomon has partnered with creative advertising agency DDB to unveil its new multi-channel campaign — "Welcome Back to Earth''.To broaden global awareness among consumers and connect with younger people in the key brand epicenters of San Francisco, Shanghai, New York and Paris, the campaign invites new audiences and brand loyalists to reconnect with the outdoors.Believing that being active in natural environments significantly improves mental health, overall well-being, quality of life, happiness, and life satisfaction, the campaign hopes to transport tech-overloaded city dwellers to the mountains by debuting a series of films shot in locations such as Ljubljana and Triglav in Slovenia, and Cortina d'Ampezzo and Monte Lagazuoi in the Italian Dolomites.The full 90-second Welcome Back to Earth brand film had its debut on Feb 6, along with three more films for its Outdoor, Running and Sportstyle product categories.In addition, a 30-second version of the brand film was aired to Super Bowl LVIII television viewers in New York and San Francisco. The film will also air to Paris area television viewers during the 2024 Olympic Games in that city."At Salomon, we exist to unleash the best in people through mountain sports. As the world's most authentic, premium and innovative brand for the mountain sports lifestyle, we're on a mission to be the most trusted partner for consumers as they embark on, or deepen, their relationship with the mountains and the outdoors," said Scott Mellin, the global chief brand officer of Salomon.'Digital connections can dominate our day-to-day lives, and the Welcome Back to Earth brand films illustrate the innate value of time in the outdoors for our mind and body. Salomon is proud to offer this invitation to connect with the outdoors through this campaign," Mellin added.During the high-end hairstyle art show hosted by leading salon brand L'Oreal Professionnel on March 1 at the West Bund Art Center in Shanghai, a special guest was invited to display his designs.Zhang Jingwang, the Global Hairstylist Winner of 2023 L'Oreal Professionnel Style& Colour Trophy, took part in this year's Le Hair Show.To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations, the show was divided into three segments that presented the hairstyles of the past, present, and future in both two countries, and showcased their close friendship.Accompanied by music, dance, and on-site painting, Zhang and 59 other leading hairstylists created an immersive sensory feast that integrated art and hairstyles.The finals of the 2023 L'Oreal Professionnel Style & Colour Trophy, hosted at the end of last year at the company's Paris headquarters, invited six outstanding stylists selected from 105,000 contestants to create their own cutting-edge style in nine hours on site.Zhang won the first championship for China. He explains that his winning style was inspired by Bo Yi, an auspicious beast that has the body of a goat, nine tails, four ears, and eyes on its back, and appears in the ancient text Shan Hai Jing (Classics of the Mountains and Seas)."As a beast from ancient Chinese mythology, Bo Yi is gentle, but bold and fearless at heart," says the 29-year-old. "I want to bring Chinese aesthetics and stories to the world."He says that focus, persistence, and constant practice are the reasons for his success. In the half month leading up to the finals, he locked himself in a room and practiced until midnight every day.Zhang grew up in Beijing. He studied hairdressing at a vocational school after graduating from middle school and has participated in many competitions. Involved in the industry for a long time, he says Chinese hairdressing sector has undergone many changes over the years."People are paying more attention to creativity and originality. Everyone wants to do something new and unique, like I did in the L'Oreal competition," he says."Due to improvements to the quality of life, people now have higher requirements for hairdressing and hairstylists, so Chinese hairdressing techniques have greatly improved."French purveyor of luxury goods, Hermès, has invited French artist Hubert Crabières to design this year's spring window displays at Hermès Maison in Shanghai.The designed window, which is themed The Faubourg Curtains Show, reveals astonishing scenes that celebrate a collection of memories and surprising secrets of the Hermès flagship store in Paris, echoing the Hermès annual theme In the spirit of the Faubourg for 2024.The windows present a series of photographs as scenography transcending a standard 2-dimensional format to become a dynamic 3-dimensional installation.Exploring the theatrical nature of curtains, Crabières uses draping, closing, and unveiling of fabric to create a curtain show that flows between reality an fantasy.He has interwoven local stories and imagery from Shanghai into his narrative to reflect how the Hermès Maison in Shanghai has inherited many exciting details from the first Hermès store and source of the Hermès architectural expression.The Faubourg Curtains Show spring window will be on display until June 5.The 2024-2025 Tongkun China Fibers Fashion Trends Conference concluded at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai on Wednesday.Under the theme of "Fusion, Renewal", the event was a showcase of new types of fashionable fibers from 34 companies. Some 500 representatives from domestic chemical fiber companies, the fashion industry, the artistic community and beyond took part in the conference, which celebrated the convergence of expertise and creativity.The focus of the conference was to introduce novel fiber varieties from perspectives including green sustainability, technological intelligence and expansive applications with the aim of offering trend guidance for strategic development across the industry chain.One of the highlights of the event was a fashion show, Blossoms. An array of Chinese and international models graced the runway, modeling 29 bespoke evening gowns made from the latest fiber fabrics around the world. Pianist and singer-songwriter Xiao Ying performed as a special guest, enchanting the audience with songs that wove their way through the show.In an enchanting celebration of artistry and creativity, Christian Louboutin hosted the Loubi Show at Le Trianon in Paris, inviting guests to immerse themselves in an evening of dance, music and fashion. Held at the historic Le Trianon, nestled in the heart of the Pigalle district, the event marked a poignant return for the renowned designer to the neighborhood where his passion for footwear first flourished.Under the creative direction of the talented French choreographer Leo Walk, the Loubi Show unfolded as a captivating narrative of friendship and connection, blending contemporary dance with the energy of street hip-hop.Twelve dancers from Walk's 'La Marche Bleue' dance company took center stage, adorned in crystal-embellished MJ Moc Loafers and revamped Miss Sabina sandals from Christian Louboutin's latest collection, expertly designed to complement the fluidity of movement.Guiding the audience through a visually stunning journey was the esteemed French American visual artist Jan Melka, whose meticulously crafted scenography introduced a three-dimensional element to the stage, inspired by bodies and volumes. Enhancing the sensory experience, Parisian-based duo Clara Cappagli and Armand Bultheel of Agar Agar provided an ethereal musical backdrop, infusing the performance with emotion and energy.Amidst the spectacle, Christian Louboutin unveiled his Women's Fall/Winter 2024 collection within a breathtaking peristyle setting. Exquisite designs were showcased in red niches, seemingly 'levitating' inside a chrome mirrored box, creating an infinite reflection of space.The Loubi Show not only celebrated the intersection of fashion, dance and music but also paid homage to Paris's vibrant youthfulness and Christian Louboutin's enduring legacy as a pioneer in luxury footwear design.Prada released the "Prada for Blossoms Shanghai" capsule collection with a private cocktail at Rong Zhai, Shanghai on Thursday.The set design team from the recent popular TV series Blossoms Shanghai created an exclusive setting characterized by curved mirror installations and vintage props, inviting guests to step into the modern and elegant world of the leading character Lingzi played by actress Ma Yili. The light design — a play between reality and illusion — recalled the captivating atmosphere of the series.Among the guests in attendance were the creative team for Blossoms Shanghai, including actors Chen Guoqing, Du Juan, Huang Jue, Ma Yili, Wang Ju, Wang Yi, Zhu Lin, and Zhang Yulin, directors Cheng Liang, Li Shuang, and Zhang Jianya, artist Chen Yiming, costume designer Dong Zhongmin, and culture, history and culinary consultant Li Shu.Also attending were supermodel Zhao Lei, director Luo Dong, founder of the Start Museum He Juxing, director of Power Station of Art Gong Yan, architect Zhang Bin, and fashion designer Wang Zhi.Inspired by diverse Prada styles from the 1990s as seen in the series, the collection presents a range of coats, suits, knitwear, dresses, and leather goods, including a chemisier dress with a tie-dye print, an orange mohair coat, a green wool cloquet ensemble with a gradient effect, and a camel-colored alpaca double-breasted coat.The Prada for Blossoms Shanghai collection will be available for a limited time by appointment only at Prada Rong Zhai, up to Sunday.Prada works with Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai on his first television drama to dress the character Linzi.  Adapted from Shanghai writer Jin Yucheng's Mao Dun Literature prizewinning novel, the 30-episode series — which primarily takes place between 1993 and 1994 — follows the journey of Ah Bao, an ambitious everyman opportunist who rises to become a legendary figure in the city's most elite commercial circles.Aside from emphasizing his ability to seize opportunities in the stock and foreign trade markets, the plot also follows his subtle, and ambiguously romance-like relationships with three women.In bright sunlight, a 3D-printed blue-and-white twin lotus graces a down jacket, evoking the elegance of fine blue-and-white porcelain.It is a collaborative creation by tutors and students from the Textile and Garment Industrial Research Institute at Wuhan Textile University in Gongqingcheng city, Jiangxi province, where China's first down jacket was made.The design has been made for the 2024 China-France Week, which is scheduled to take place in Paris this autumn."Our objective is to infuse additional traditional Chinese cultural elements into our creations, including the exquisite blue-and-white porcelain of Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province. By showing the wealth of ceramic culture and classical patterns to a global audience, we aim to breathe new life into ancient Chinese civilization through contemporary and stylish clothing," says Wang Qiuhan, head of the institute.These "China-chic" down jackets blend modern design seamlessly with traditional elements. Designers make use of traditional textile techniques, embroidery, and decorations like Chinese buttons and collars, while integrating abstract patterns of ink, mountains and rivers with mosaics. The result is fashionable and distinctly Chinese."We are also promoting cooperation with the inheritors of Xiabu embroidery, a form of intangible cultural heritage, for our down jackets," Wang adds.This year, China and France are celebrating the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties, and are also observing the occasion as the China-France Year of Culture and Tourism. This milestone year promises a plethora of bilateral cultural exchange activities.With captivating images of waterfalls and ridges on its collar and belt, the down jacket resembles a Chinese landscape painting, and blends abstract ink patterns with the serene images of mountains and rivers. The institute made its debut on the fashion runway during the China-France Week in Paris last autumn, with 30 sumptuous down jackets, which took center stage and captivated the audience."The clothes were very pretty. It would be great to see more traditional Chinese elements in fashion, because it's a change from the type of fashion we have in France," one of the spectators says, recalling the show."The down jackets got attention from major European media and fashion magazines, sparking numerous order inquiries after their international debut. This highlights the attraction of traditional Chinese culture, with clothing serving as a powerful medium to share it with the world," Wang says."I really liked the show, especially the cut and fabric of the designs, and some of the elements from nature, such as birds and mountains, are classic Chinese concepts. The mixing and stitching of fabric materials was amazing," says Isabelle Lawson, executive director of the French International Art Salon.One of the designers, 27-year-old Wang Ran, says that, in the 1970s, when down jackets made their way to China, they were humorously known as "bread suits" because of their coarse fabric, minimal down stuffing, unexciting styles and drab colors. Over the years, they have evolved to embrace lightness, fashion and variety."Nowadays, these China-chic down jackets are not only visual feasts, but also embody traditional culture," she adds.High quality and superior design have invested made-in-China products with confidence and strength. The connection between China and France through the fashion industry is becoming increasingly close.French designers are keen on collaborating with China, acknowledging its leading position globally in garment production and processing. With strengths in both design and cost-effectiveness, the fashion industry sees significant potential for cooperation between China and France."In recent years, China has made great progress in the fashion industry. We are very willing to expand cooperation with China," says Xavier Romatet, dean of the French Fashion Institute, a leading fashion institute in France. There is nothing that Peter Pius has not done to survive the harsh life in Kibera, Kenya which is arguably Africa's largest slum. Tucked away in his tin house with a wooden floor and no electricity or running water is a deep freezer from where he hoped to sell cold water to Kibera residents. However, the lack of electricity meant that this business venture did not take off and the deep freezer lies idly in his shack.Pius has tried his hand at different trades including garbage collection and water vending to no avail. Being a creative mind, he also makes art out of recyclable material but due to lack of connections, he has never sold his artwork.As luck would have it, a fashion week event dubbed 'Kibera Fashion Week' was hosted in the slum in October last year and Pius got a chance to include his artwork in the fashion pieces that were exhibited at the event.To celebrate upcoming Chinese New Year, Spanish fashion company LOEWE commissioned three master jade carvers, Cheng Lei, Qiu Qijing, and Yin Xiaojin, to create three limited-edition pendants.Each pendant is meticulously hand-carved and comes with an 18K gold chain. Yin's jade carving showcases natural beauty with a pendant in the shape of a Chinese cabbage, adorned with a cricket. Chinese cabbage has a long history of cultivation and symbolizes prosperity and abundance. Qiu's pendant, in a smoky purple color, is in the shape of an eggplant and resembles a crown of success and happiness. Cheng's white jade pendant depicts a pea pod with a snail, carved from an almost flawless jade stone, symbolizing the traditional meanings of blessings, wealth, and longevity.There is nothing more Chinese than the color red. As a nation who is deeply and emotionally connected with the passionate shade, Chinese people enjoy a feast of red during Lunar New Year. The bold color stands for people's good wishes for a prosperous and auspicious future. Pink, a shade of blossom, echoes spring sentiments that start a new circle of life, a softer alternative to grace the festival.Since it's time to prepare one's wardrobe for the coming Spring Festival, which will fall on Feb 10 this year, here are some dresses and jackets you could dawn in beautiful red and pink in Chinese style.They are a new interpretation of traditional Chinese culture by a young generation of Chinese designers with open minds and imagination. They may bring you some good luck in the Year of Dragon.Chinese Red woolen dressWith delicate embroideries of flowers, the red woolen dress provides not only style but also warmth. What's more, it's very convenient to wear.Chinese women are increasingly prioritizing comfort when it comes to choosing footwear, and it appears that the once well-loved stiletto is taking the hit.For decades, the stiletto heel was, to many women, a symbol of feminine charm, high social status and success.But it appears that the footwear is no longer considered as chic as before, judging by how rare it is to see them worn among the Shanghai crowds — usually considered a fashion barometer for China.The last time Li Ziyan wore high heels was when she attended a job interview a year ago. That same pair of heels, she points out, is currently sitting alongside four others in her closet gathering dust."I generally don't wear heels unless I have to attend a very high-profile business meeting, which rarely happens.

I aspire for my work to convey integrity, to transmit love, and to embody my civilization, along with the culture that flows in my veins," the artist said."In reality, culture and art know no borders; they belong not only to a single nation or ethnicity but to all of humanity. A country's museum represents the culture and refinement of its people," she noted."Much of my learning has been derived from museums, (which) I am delighted to present, in the most beautiful manner, within this art gallery and share with everyone, inspiring and uplifting all."Guo herself also engaged in an exchange by introducing her work to the audience, offering insights into the inspiration behind each creation.The National Gemstone Testing Center hosted an online livestreaming event on Wednesday to cater to the public interest in diamond testing and certification at its Daxing lab in Beijing.The 8-hour event drew 52,000 views on Douyin.

The models presented a heart-stopping visual feast for spectators.The show, featuring the traditional clothing of Shigatse city in the Tibet autonomous region, was held in Gyalze county in mid-September, and showcased the alluring combination of traditional Tibetan clothing and modern design.Locally produced woolen cloth, or nambu, is part of the region's long and deep traditional costume culture. Nambu is woven out of wool and cashmere, and is widely used as a material in Tibetan clothing, including robes, hats, boots and sheets.It not only reflects the folk customs of Tibet, but also demonstrates the harmonious coexistence of all ethnic groups in the region with nature, Guo Xiuling, founder of Chinese brand Sand River, was quoted as saying by Tibet Daily.As the planner of the show, Guo says that under the guidance and matchmaking of the Aid Tibet cadres from Shanghai, Sand River's designs have been integrated with Tibetan woolen cloth craftsmanship, creating a visually impactful collision between traditional woolen clothing and modern fashion design.By introducing Shanghai's traditional craft enterprises and industry leaders to Shigatse, Aid Tibet has been supporting the production of traditional woolen textile products in recent years, helping local craftsmen improve processing, design and quality to make it more attractive to consumers, brands and markets.A range of products with Tibetan elements in line with public aesthetics have been produced, and they have been working to transform this unique advantage into an economic benefit. Sand River acts as a bridge between grassroots material producers and market expansion.All the clothing displayed in the fashion show is made manually by women from the villages of Gyalze county, and the added value of Tibetan clothing has been upgraded by incorporating modern designs.Guo says that her company uses natural, sustainable raw materials like cashmere and yak hair, which are completely biodegradable. It incorporates traditional Tibetan culture into the production process, taking inspiration from elements like Tibetan opera, and intangible cultural heritage handcrafting techniques have been adopted during production.Bosideng, a major Chinese down-apparel maker, brought its latest lightweight jackets to London, England on Wednesday, after its runway show during Milan Fashion Week.The series of lightweight down jackets designed by Pietro Ferragina, creative director at Bosideng, will be on display at the company's flagship store on Bond Street in central London until Oct 11.At the opening of the static show, Ferragina explained the inspiration behind the designs, which boast interwoven Chinese and Italian cultural motifs, drawing elements from Italian lace craftsmanship and Chinese Su embroidery.Ferragina said he was inspired by the flowers at Vinci Manor in creating his distinctive floral herringbone patterns, which break from traditional rib-style fine herringbone techniques.Alba Garavito Torre, a fashion brand consultant based in Paris, came to attend the show's opening and said she was surprised by the way the apparel mixes creativity and utility."I think the creator made magic with the inspiration of the Renaissance and Chinese elements," said Torre, who added it is important for the Chinese brand to step onto the world fashion stages of Paris, Milan, and London as it promotes itself."The current fashion trends are about minimalism and sustainability but with something different in the details," she said. "I would like to see more eye-catching details that Chinese brands bring to the industry."Aminah Ali, a London-based fashion and lifestyle social media influencer, said she really liked Bosideng's flagship store."It's amazing when you come in. There's a lot of space and it's very aesthetic," she said. "I love the puffer materials of the down jacket. But we don't see that enough on the runway. So that's been great to see Bosideng bring it to the Milan show and here."Aaron Hold, manager of the Bosideng flagship store, which was launched last year after a renovation, said: "We are surrounded by some of the world's most leading brands and positioning among them is a statement in itself that we are one of these brands too. We see a lot of customers from all over the world, not necessarily just Chinese, there are customers from Europe, from the Middle East, from the United States as well."They're repeat customers, and they recommend us to their friends, and I think that's so important because it's a true testament supporting the brand."Since its founding in 1976, Bosideng has been focused on the production of down jackets and has participated in numerous international fashion weeks and collaborated with renowned designers to innovate lightweight down jackets.The 2023 Global Apparel Conference will run in Humen, Dongguan city, South China's Guangdong province from Nov 16 to 18.With the theme "Together for a shared future." the conference will feature an opening ceremony, two evening galas, three thematic forums, and various satellite events over a period of  three days.

Zheng had at one point owned over 3,000 brooches.Zheng said her love for brooches stems from the belief that this accessory is a reflection of one's inner self.Vintage brooches manufactured between the 1920s and the 1980s were generally made of alternative and synthetic materials and feature the use of sophisticated jewelry making techniques.The exhibition is divided into six parts, with each documenting a specific period in the development of such brooches.The exhibition opened on Sept 25 and will run till Feb 25, 2024.Zheng Zheng contributed to this story. Ding Lanying, an embroiderer from Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan province, was overexcited when the Milan Fashion Week held a show on Saturday of 2024 spring/summer collection featuring Yi embroidery art and culture.A collection of some 40 trendy designs was presented by catwalk models, creatively applying the black color adorned by the Yi ethnic group and their favorite patterns of clouds, seeds and silver ornaments.Ding, who has been doing embroidery for more than 30 years starting at the age of 8, said she felt fortunate to attend the show, and there are so many women like her back in her hometown who have contributed to the success."The show in Milan will make the village women embroiderers so proud of the Yi embroidery and encourage them to better carry on the culture heritage generation by generation," said Ding, who wore a traditional Yi costume.Ding's South China Colorful Yi Embroidery Company now hires 2,028 embroiderers, including 109 who are physically challenged."It's an amazing collection. I like it very much. Amazing," Fabio Mascheroni, from the fashion company Ludovica Mascheroni, told China Daily after watching the show.Li Wenjuan, head of the publicity department of the Chuxiong Prefecture Party Committee, said that the show carries the greeting from the 2 million plus people in Chuxiong as well as the blessing and wishes of some 60,000 women embroiderers there."We live in the deep mountains, but we always have the fashion genes," she said of the 1,700-year-old Yi embroidery, an intangible cultural heritage.

He said that Shangtex is dedicated to linking designers and intangible cultural heritage and promoting the traditional culture in the fashion industry and marketplace to empower the local economy."The 2024 spring/summer fashion inspired by Yi embroidery has very well blended Yi ethnic group's totems such as tiger, seeds and flowers and luxury Italian fabrics," he said."(It) is a salute to Yi culture,"Besides the Milan Fashion Week and New York Fashion Week, the Yi embroidery had already fascinated the audience at the Shanghai Fashion Week and Beijing Fashion Week in China.Estée Lauder's handmade perfume, Le Labo, launched its second store in the Chinese mainland at Taikoo Li Qiantan, Shanghai, on Aug 11.It's the only shop in Shanghai that supports "Fresh Blending".This means that freshly hand-blend fragrances are developed on-site, and each label is personalized with the date, location, and a message chosen by customers.As a brand that grew up in New York, Le Labo opened its first Shanghai store in the downtown Xintiandi commercial area on June 1, 2023, and unveiled Myrrhe 55, the city exclusive perfume in Shanghai."Focusing on their individual needs and pursuing personalization, Chinese customers are paying increasing attention to brand value.

Kaplan and Susan B. Kaplan curator of jewelry."Feng J's jewelry blends traditional craftsmanship with 21st century innovation. A brilliant colorist, she paints with gemstones," she added.In the Blue Anthurium, Feng J uses colored stones in a "floating" setting to make the metal disappear around the gems. This technique is enhanced by the delicate way the artist applies color – through electro-forming – to white gold.Another piece by Feng J was acquired in 2022 by Les Arts Decoratifs in Paris.

Workers can be seen packaging orders for delivery.At the end of last month at an e-commerce industrial park in the town, a young woman used a livestreaming platform to promote a hanfu outfit bearing a set of yunjian, a type of popular clothing decoration made in the style of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).Zheng Tao, director of Qianwei Hantang Apparel Co, which is situated in the industrial park, said, "These exquisite items attract a great deal of attention from buyers, and they sell like hot cakes."During the past six weeks, the company has sold more than 7,000 of the hanfu outfits promoted by Zheng."We have seen substantial growth in hanfu sales during the first half of this year," Zheng said. "In the past two months alone, these sales have reached 10 million yuan ($1.37 million), a tenfold rise year-on-year."Zheng is not the only one enjoying the sales boom. In the first half of this year, total sales of hanfu in the town sold via e-commerce platforms reached 2.5 billion yuan, Li, the local Party secretary, said."Many hanfu producers in the town are working overtime to meet their orders," Li added.From a 6-meter-by-6-meter dismountable house, to vintage jewelry, to garments and an original Citroen car, the new exhibition at Power Station of Art in Shanghai takes audiences on a retrospective journey through the emergence and prosperity of modernity in the golden age of Paris.Featuring more than 300 objects, such as architectural models, photographs, films, garments and new digital animations, Paris Moderne 1914-1945 Architecture, Design, Film, Fashion was curated by renowned architectural historian Jean-Louis Cohen, architect Pascal Mory, and fashion history expert Catherine Ormen.According to Cohen, Paris saw the pinnacle of its influence on the country, Europe and the world during the period between the two world wars, becoming a laboratory of modern technology and culture.He points out that both cinema and fashion reflected the aspirations of the new urban bourgeoisie and set the stage for modern dreams during this period, which saw craftsmanship as well as new spatial and visual strategies emerge.Meanwhile in China, Shanghai was also going through a period of rapid development, gaining prominence among the cities of China and becoming known as "the Oriental Paris", says Gong Yan, director of Power Station of Art.As such, the exhibition aims to draw parallels between Paris and Shanghai, two metropolises whose cultural and historical trajectories have intersected and influenced each other. Cohen explains the choice of location of the exhibition as the "Paris of the West in the Paris of the East."Gong had, as early as 2016, invited Cohen, one of the leading scholars in 19th-20th century architecture and urbanism in Europe and North America, to create an exhibition about the legendary architect and urban planner Le Corbusier (1887-1965)."We did not expect the curator to not only bring to Power Station of Art an exhibition about Corbusier, but also his city at the time when he lived," Gong said at the opening of the exhibition on July 21.Beneath the surface-level glamour and innovation, the exhibition also seeks to elucidate the deeper sociocultural transformations of Paris in the 1920s.Ormen, the curator for the fashion section of the exhibition, says: "Modernity is the keyword to the exhibition: Live fast, forget about the past, forget about the war."This philosophy, she notes, underpinned the rapid progress and transformation witnessed in Paris during the period, setting the stage for modern dreams and placating the damages of postwar trauma.Chen Leyang contributed to the story.If you goParis Moderne 1914-1945:Architecture, Design, Film, FashionJuly 21-Oct 20, Tuesday-Sunday, 11 am-7 pm (last admission at 6 pm).Power Station of Art, 678 Miaojiang Road, Huangpu district, Shanghai.Swiss independent watchmaker Breitling aims to open more than 20 new boutiques in the Chinese market, said Georges Kern, CEO of Breitling, after announcing new brand ambassadors, Yang Ying and Huang Jingyu in Shanghai last month.Kern pointed out that the Chinese market boasted a significant young consumer base, with Generation Z emerging as the primary purchaser of luxury goods. Moreover, the huge population base also provided more opportunities for luxury brands like Breitling."At present, the Chinese market accounts for about 5 percent of our total turnover, which is still quite low compared to other Swiss watch brands, but it precisely shows that there is much potential of the growth in the Chinese market," Kern said."It is important to acknowledge that China is an emerging market where the luxury industry has thrived for only 20 to 30 years. In other words, while you may see a mix of large and small retail counters in the US, the established retailer network is less extensive in China, leading consumers to gravitate more towards boutique shopping experiences," he added.Kern further pointed out that the export value of Swiss watches reached CHF 23.7 billion ($27.6 billion) in 2022, an increase of 11.6 percent compared to 2021. As an important brand in Swiss watches, Breitling's sales  increased by nearly 25 percent in 2022 compared to 2021.Luxury perfume brand Kilian Paris held an exclusive party in Shanghai last Thursday to celebrate its 15th anniversary by launching a new floral fragrance called "Can't Stop Loving You".Launched in 2007, Kilian Paris made its debut at the 2019 China International Import Expo. It officially entered the Chinese market in 2020 when it opened its first store in Shanghai's IFC Mall."I am genuinely astounded by the rapid embrace of perfumery among Chinese customers. They possess a remarkable desire for individuality, seeking fragrances that are truly distinct — a notion that exudes sophistication and a forward-thinking mindset. It is in this context that Kilian Paris' unique philosophy and creative fragrances seamlessly align with the dynamic Chinese perfume market," said Kilian Hennessy, the founder of the brand."I am incredibly optimistic about the receptiveness of Chinese consumers in embracing our exceptional brand," he added.The 2023 Shengze Fashion Week, part of the fifth Jiangnan Culture and Arts & International Tourism Festival, was held in Shengze township in the Wujiang of Suzhou, Jiangsu province, from May 29 to June 1.This year's event was expected to help energize the fashion industry and accelerate the development of the cultural industry in Wujiang district, as well as to improve the cultural influence of Shengze as an important silk textile manufacturing base in China.The 2023 edition was full of technological elements, such as the three digital fashion experience officers who made their debut together with three "Shengze fashion endorsers". The immersive interactions between the virtual and real worlds helped draw attention to Shengze and its silk and speed up the high-quality development of the local fashion industry.In recent years, Shengze has made great efforts to contribute to fashion, hoping to realize the integration of rural vitalization and fashion development.Shengze is well-known for its world-class fabrics. In recent years, with the accelerated upgrading of the textile industry, the concept of seeking brand-based development has become a consensus of the enterprises in the town, which are gradually shifting from modern textile production to design and brand building.At the opening ceremony for this year's fashion week, Shengze and the China Fashion Association jointly released the 2023 China Fashion Index (Industry) Report to provide a basis for decision-making in domestic and overseas fashion circles.SYDNEY — While big brands often commandeer the spotlight at a fashion week, up-and-coming new faces can also turn heads as they hold the potential to wow the industry with their creativity.Awarded as one of the four Next Gen designers by Australian Fashion Week, Xizhu Wu finished her debut runway show in a refurbished gallery at the Carriageworks in Sydney, beaming with joy and relief."It's my first proper runway show, which I'm very excited about, but I'm feeling a lot more relieved now that the show's over. Now I can relax a little, move on and focus on the next thing," Wu says.For the young Chinese Australian who founded her own label Xi Wu Studio, it took about five months to create a brand-new collection, from sketches to ready-for-runway pieces, with "nostalgia" as the core concept.By reworking her previous designs in new fabrics, including crinkle wool, flannel wool, silk and floral knit, Wu fused pattern-making and garment construction techniques originating from the East and the West. Her well-tailored attire impressed fashionistas with its unexpected detailing."I wanted to start again with some older pieces so that everyone can see what I've done in the past, what I'm doing now, and what direction I might take in the future," the designer says."It's also about my bicultural upbringing," says Wu. "I put everything into the collection to reflect my emotions and how I perceived my upbringing."Wu grew up in South China's Guangdong province until the age of 5 and then moved to Australia with her parents. Both Eastern and Western culture have left their stamp on the aesthetic of the designer's work, which was mirrored in the garments on the runway."For example, in Eastern culture, the garments are flatter with more coverage. There is room for movement and there are a lot of layers, whereas in Western culture, it's more tailored and fitted to your body," Wu says, noting that she tried to keep a balance between the two styles.In her collection, an asymmetrical blazer bonded with a reflective knit was perfectly matched with a pair of loose-fitting, twisted pleat trousers. A green cropped jacket and miniskirt combo featured a Chinese floral pattern, with a jade charm dangling at the model's waist as she strutted down the catwalk.The innovative designer also stitched frog buttons on a layered blazer, made laser-cut acrylic accouterments using the Chinese character fu as a motif, and reinvented traditional cotton textiles for a more contemporary look."When I was researching Chinese traditional garments from the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, I saw elements such as flat, baggy layering, slits and ties. These are the elements that I have incorporated into my designs," Wu says.From quilted clothes worn by people in China, the peony painting hung up on the wall at her grandmother's house, to the decor in tea houses where she had dim sum with her family, all things Wu saw growing up became a source of inspiration. Wu says that as she grew older, she developed a deeper understanding of Chinese culture. What Wu once regarded as "old-fashioned "now looked "actually quite cool" to her. "And I can apply my own style," she says.Meanwhile, Wu appreciates her experience of living in Australia. It was on a textile course in high school that Wu got her first glimpse of the fashion industry. With encouragement from her teachers, who she invited to her show, Wu decided to pursue a bachelor's degree in design at the University of Technology Sydney.After reaching a major milestone at the 2023 Australian Fashion Week, Wu is thinking about extending the collection, having a few pieces available for preorder and creating custom garments.The 25-year-old designer follows a one-step-at-a-time approach to her burgeoning career, saying that she may hold her first solo show next year.XinhuaArmed with the skills and knowledge she picked up at the Shanghai International College of Fashion and Innovation at Donghua University, Vania Limousinea is now ready to return to Indonesia and take her first step into the fashion industry with the launching of her own brand.Inspired by what she has learned and seen in China, Limousinea will create a formal wear collection that combines modernism with ikat fabric, a type of textile made using traditional Indonesian weaving techniques."All the creations will be made in a sustainable manner. What I hope to achieve with this brand is to change the perspectives that the younger generation, particularly those in Indonesia, have about traditional textiles," says Limousinea, who arrived in China in 2019.According to Limousinea, whose grandparents are Chinese, the courses she has taken at the college in Shanghai were very helpful as they taught her important skills like software design, fashion illustration, photography and painting.But the most important skill learned during this journey, she notes, was how to go about starting her own business."The Chinese market is much bigger and more diverse than Indonesia, and this opened my eyes to the fashion world and how it operates. It's difficult to find a fashion market that is as large as China," she says.The configuration of dual brand principals is not common among the array of independent designer brands in China.However, FFIXXED STUDIOS and RE: by MAISON SANS TITRE have successfully struck a harmonious balance by embracing the diverse contrasts between their two partners.To celebrate unofficial Valentine's Day on May 20 (the number 520 sounds similar to "I love you" in Chinese), these two brands, which both have a decadelong history, have joined forces with renowned luxury department store Lane Crawford to unveil exclusive collections.Fiona Lau, who studied fashion design at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, and Kain Picken, who studied fine arts at Victorian College of the Arts, are the founders of FFIXXED STUDIOS. They are both fashion designers and artists.Lau is generally more involved with the production, while Picken handles media relations and other projects.Lau and Picken started working together while living in Berlin. At that time, Picken was focused on his art projects, while Lau was working for a fashion brand called Bless. They were both intrigued by each other's work and began collaborating on a side project for an exhibition to explore mutual interests in fashion and art together. And when they relocated to China, they founded the menswear and womenswear brand Ffixxed together in 2012."I believe that both of us are indispensable to the brand, as it has grown through our ongoing dialogue," says Lau.Picken says: "While we have also many differences, even opposing views and perspectives, we still share some core values about creativity which allows us to explore different ideas and bring them together in a cohesive way. We also have very different personalities but this difference helps to create a balance between us."Due to Picken's background in art, with a specialization in sculpture, and Lau's experience interning at various fashion brands, their creations embody both an artistic sensibility and a practical, comfortable appeal.Their brand won first place at the International Woolmark Awards Asia with a blanket-inspired women's garment in 2013.On the afternoon of April 15, against a backdrop of sea gulls chirping and waves crashing onto the beach, independent designer brand ZI II CI IEN unveiled its spring/summer 2023 collection at the Zen Hall in the ancient water town of Puyuan, Tongxiang city, Zhejiang province.Using floral elements and gorgeous colors matching, Zhi Chen, the 33-year-old founder of the knitwear brand, has tried to get people to notice beautiful things that could fade away in one blink through the collection named The Moment.After the show, Zhi revealed her wish and the concept she wanted to pass on, as if she were toasting with a glass of champagne, "to catch the beauty of every moment, and to live every moment happily".The new collection was inspired by a namesake picture album, which introduced US artist Alex Katz's exhibition Flowers held by the Gladstone Gallery during Gallery Weekend Beijing in 2021. The book included his works and a few words that recorded his understanding of life during the COVID-19 outbreak.Zhi says: "Most of my design inspiration actually comes from the beautiful moments in life that hit me."She recalls that on a breezy evening, with the shadows of the trees spilling gently onto the ground, the picture book with a bright cover caught her attention."It was very much like a crush, a moment of being hit, of romance, of going against the grain of rational analysis," she says.After opening the book with delight, Zhi couldn't take her eyes off the tulips in one of Katz's paintings. Those bright red tulips in round shapes, which are in full bloom, took her breath away.She was also amazed by the orderly arrangement and the close-up composition of the painting. The beige background neutralizes the flamboyance that comes from the extensive red color, and creates just the right amount of retro atmosphere.The designer then spent days drawing her own tulips, and changed the design dozens of times.Zhi mainly struggled with whether to depict them as a bunch or in a row; whether to have the leaves flare out or snap in; whether to have highlights or heavier shadows."I wanted to get the design down to every pixel point," she says.After completing the design of this individual element, the next round of struggle began, mainly about size, sparseness and specific arrangement and superimposition.Finally, it was decided that her tulips, which have pink petals and blue shadows, are going to grow on the irregular black-and-white checkerboard."People would never confuse the sunflowers painted by Vincent van Gogh with the sunflowers painted by Oscar-Claude Monet. The geometric checkerboard pattern is the hint that tells it's a work of Zhi Chen," says the designer.Renowned as one of the country's first sustainable fashion figures, Zhang Na founded Reclothing Bank in 2010, which has showcased more than 1,000 sustainable items at the Shanghai Fashion Week over the past 13 years.Besides upgrading the brand itself in recent years, Zhang has observed significant changes in consumer demands, markets and enterprises in the sustainable development path.The brand specializes in designing fashionable and sustainable items by using old fabrics and items that have been discarded as waste.Its independent research and development have formed a unique closed-loop system of recycling, regenerating, selling, and public welfare, making it a "spiritual lifestyle" brand with sustainable fashion as its core.Earlier this year, Reclothing Bank launched its first concept flagship store at The Inlet in Shanghai."Consumers are interested in the sustainable concept, but many of them believe that it is expensive and boring. One of the reasons for opening the store is to show more consumers that it is a tangible concept and can be actually purchased," Zhang says.Communicating with consumers brings Zhang new insights into the market."Our youngest customer is 14 years old and the oldest is 70, but they all accept and love our philosophy and design. In addition, the secondhand clothes recycling bin outside our store is almost full every day. The donated clothes are washed and neatly folded into the box. I can tell that everyone donates good clothes that are no longer needed," Zhang says.In addition to consumers, the attitude of enterprises is also changing. "More responsible companies are willing to pay for good and eco-friendly designs," she adds.Reclothing Bank has been collaborating with Starbucks since 2016 to sell environmentally friendly designs. During the Dragon Boat Festival in 2020, they manufactured a bag made of recycled plastic bottles and sold about 1.2 million bags."Each bag was made of 33 recycled plastic bottles," she explains.French prestigious beauty brand Sisley celebrated the opening of the Maison Sisley Shanghai, the first establishment in the Asia-Pacific region, on March 29. The launch marked an exciting new milestone in the French family brand's development in China.Located in Jing'an Zhangyuan, a historic community with hundreds of shikumen architectural stylehouses in Shanghai's downtown Jing'an district, the Maison Sisley Shanghai spans 339 square meters and offers a combination of beauty, hair care, well-being treatments and boutique shopping — all under one roof.French leading natural skincare brand Nuxe will continue cooperation with China's leading digital shopping platform Tmall and Sephora stores in China, Muriel Koch, CEO of Nuxe, said as she joined the business representatives of French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to China in April.  Nuxe will also release its firming powdery cream Merveillance Lift in China."As the leading natural brand in French pharmacies, 100 percent developed and made in France, I'm very optimistic about the ability of our brand to attract even more Chinese consumers thanks to our local team and our partner Baozun Inc for the online and Sephora China for the offline," said Koch."Nuxe will continue to develop the star product Huile Prodigieuse in the Chinese market, and at the same time bring more anti-aging products to China," she said.Nuxe opened its Tmall flagship store in China in 2019 and signed a three-year contract with Chinese actress Zhang Jiani as the spokesperson of its best-seller Huile Prodigieuse from September 2020 to attract Chinese consumers.Before entering Tmall, Nuxe has accumulated many fans in the Chinese market through the exclusive cooperation with Sephora for 2 years. Muriel said Nuxe will continue to develop strategic cooperation with Sephora, and will jointly promote Nuxe's Tmall flagship store with Baozun Inc, hoping to seize a new round of opportunities after the economic recovery post epidemic.The brand was founded in 1990 in Paris by Aliza Jabès, a graduate from Science Po Paris, who was particularly interested in the properties of plants, encouraged by her father, a researcher in the field of pharmacy. For more than 30 years, it has become a global group, present in some 60 countries. Each skincare product is formulated and manufactured in France to meet pharmaceutical quality requirements and combines the marvels of nature with the prowess of science.Its iconic product Huile Prodigieuse, containing seven 100 percent botanical oils, was adopted first by French then European women. It is No 1 beauty oil in France and one bottle sold every 9 seconds throughout the world.The term "clean beauty" is gaining popularity in the skin care and beauty industry in China in response to consumers' demands for efficacy, transparency and sustainability. Caudalie, a skin care brand originating in France, has pursued efficacy and clean beauty since its inception in 1995 and is ready to embrace the new era."China is ready (for the trend)," said Mathilde Thomas, co-founder of Caudalie, who returned to China in mid-March after a three-year absence due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. "When I see there is no more pollution in big cities like Shanghai and young generations want to breathe clean air, (I believe) they do not want any substance on their skin that could be a hormonal destructor and cause any irritation."According to Mathilde, who required her first name be used, there is no standard for clean beauty products in the market so far, although the concept has become a buzzword among consumers around the world. As a pioneer clean beauty brand with aspirations of "efficacy, cleanness and sustainability", Caudalie's definition of clean beauty is "clean for the skin" and "clean for the planet"."I created Caudalie so consumers would no longer have to choose among effective products, clean and natural formulas and an eco-friendly brand," said Mathilde.Estée Lauder Companies Inc unveiled its new research centers at its China Innovation Labs in Shanghai's Minhang district on Wednesday.The two new centers, named the Labs' new Global Advanced Technology Center (GATC) and Men's Beauty Center of Excellence (MBCoE), are geared toward both Chinese and worldwide consumers."Through breakthrough products, superior formulations and cutting-edge technology, the China Innovation Labs will enable faster speed to market our products, while also continuing our company's commitment to providing high-quality products focused on effectiveness and safety to consumers in China and around the world," said Fabrizio Freda, President and CEO of the Estée Lauder Companies.As part of the company's commitment to providing breakthrough skincare solutions for Chinese and other Asian consumers, GATC will focus its research on anti-aging and skin science, the study of skin's biological, physiological and morphological characteristics. It will also gather Chinese academic and scientific institutions in materials science to research new skincare ingredients and formulations.By 2025, GATC is expected to become Estée Lauder Companies' largest advanced technology center among its international markets.The company also unveiled that the Labs will serve as ELC's Men's Beauty Center of Excellence, enabling significant advancements in men's skincare science, product and package development, and clinical testing with Chinese male consumers. The center will also focus on the makeup and fragrance categories."Creativity and innovation are at the heart of what we do at Estée Lauder Companies, and we have an incredible 30-year history providing Chinese consumers with prestige beauty products and services that uphold our company's commitment to quality, consumer need, sustainability and innovation," said Joy Fan, President and CEO of the Estée Lauder Companies China."With more local innovation investment, we remain firmly committed to China's consumers, whose expectations we aim to exceed – and whose lives we aim to enhance and touch," Fan added.An urge to make things easier for his wife has surprisingly changed the career trajectory of Jin Yi. With a measuring tape and a pair of scissors by his side practically all the time at his workshop in Suzhou, East China's Jiangsu province, Jin, in his 30s, is committed to restoring the glamour of the qipao, a traditional Chinese dress also known as cheongsam, which features a form-fitting cut, high neckline and the slit on the side of the skirt."We've been extremely busy after Spring Festival, with orders for custom-made qipao piling up," says Jin, from Xushuguan town, Suzhou."Normally, we promised to deliver goods in 10 to 15 days, but now it has to be in 40 to 50 days," he adds.Jin says he and his team have been working for more than 12 hours every day.When Jin receives an order, he goes to great lengths to get to know his customer's needs before coming up with pertinent style, color scheme, embroidery and fabric."The colors and patterns should vary with different occasions," Jin explains.For example, a bride would be recommended to wear a bright red qipao with peony and butterfly images, while her mother would be advised to dress in a darker red with more shiny flowers."After all is settled, I need to communicate and work with master tailors before delivering a qipao," Jin explains.The prices vary from 1,500 yuan ($218) to 8,000 yuan, depending on fabrics and embroidering methods.Lifting a spear, Li Jinqi pulled it across her shoulders and spun it quickly. Following her example, 10 peers in two rows wearing the same kung fu-style garments produced the same movements.Li is a 24-year-old PhD student at Beihang University in Beijing, but she is more widely known on campus as a martial arts master.Though very busy with research and coursework, the PhD student says that, over the past five years, practicing martial arts has become a daily routine.She has studied various styles, including boxing, swordplay, and the cudgel, and won several cross-campus martial arts competitions held in the capital city.She also led the university's martial arts club, which has grown from a team of two participants to over 30 active members.Having performed at the graduation ceremony for three years in a row, Li says the club is now one of the most popular on campus in terms of recruitment."Martial arts has seen a significant uptick on campus, and I heard that my middle school and high school have both opened martial arts courses," says Li.Gao Xiaoya, a junior student majoring in electronic information engineering at Beihang, who also joined the martial arts club, shares that she draws inner peace and strength from the sport.Gao is among an increasing number of young people who were first attracted to martial arts as a way to keep fit, but who found their enthusiasm grew when they realized the benefits stemming from the traditional values and culture the sport embodies."You start to appreciate it more and realize that martial arts are full of philosophical views on how to combat challenges and be confident, while also being modest," says the 21-year-old.On China's video-sharing platform Bilibili, short videos on topics of traditional Chinese culture, such as martial arts, hanfu (a traditional costume), Peking Opera, and calligraphy often receive legions of likes and comments."The fast development of the internet and social media also facilitates communication about traditional Chinese culture, enabling young people to have easier access to previously niche art forms," says Song Yu, an assistant researcher at the Institute of Sociology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Traditional culture also has no national or ethnic boundaries. In Central China's Henan province, the birthplace of Shaolin kung fu, global exchanges and interactions have taken place for years.About 2,000 foreigners visited the 1,500-year-old temple to learn kung fu and experience Shaolin culture every year. Marta Neskovic from Serbia says, "I stayed for two and a half years, I love kung fu so much. Practicing kung fu is good for mental and physical health."Wang Hechen, a designer in Beijing, takes courses on traditional Chinese painting every weekend. "It's like a comfort zone for me to escape from my fast-paced work, while painting also helps improve my endurance and focus," says Wang.For Li, martial arts also means more than fitness training. "I don't think martial arts is about fighting," she says. "Martial arts is about finding the best version of yourself."As younger generations attach more importance to traditional culture, relevant industries and services are expected to thrive as well, says Song.From March 7 to 8, the 2023 Sheguang Hu International Fashion Week was held with six runway shows at the Louis Castle in Chengdu, capital of Southwest China’s Sichuan province.The renowned Chinese-Dutch designer debuted their haute couture collection For Youth. Featuring neat, simple cuts with five classic colors – black, white, red, khaki and army green, the series breaks down the boundaries between haute couture and ready-to-wear womenswear.The event also marked the 5th anniversary of the founding of Sheguang Hu’s Fashion Women’s Army. Also known as Sheguang Hu’s Supermodels, it is a nation-wide community of fashion enthusiasts of all ages as well as a platform offering modeling training and promoting a healthy, fashionable lifestyle.Sporting silver masks, wide-brimmed hats, flowing dresses and leather gloves, more than 500 models – aged between 30 and 80, all from the community - strutted down the runway to celebrate the beauty and power of Chinese women in the new era who refuse to be defined nor limited by their age.“The initial purpose for me to create Sheguang Hu’s Fashion Women’s Army was build a platform for Chinese women who entertain fashion dreams and make fashion no longer a synonym of luxury,” Hu said during the event.Founded in 2018, Sheguang Hu’s Fashion Women’s Army, with its members’ average age standing at 55, the community has spearheaded the fashion and beauty industry’s silver wave. Over the years, Hu’s models have appeared on international catwalks such as New York Fashion Week, London Fashion Week and China Fashion Week.As of March 2023, Sheguang Hu’s Fashion Women’s Army has established bases in more than 100 Chinese cities and cities in Singapore and the Netherlands.From ornaments as small as a brooch to landmark architecture, from a poster to celebrate Chinese New Year, to a logo for national events, design has been even more integrated into the economic and social lives of the Chinese people, reflecting the advancement throughout decades.People have become more aware of the importance of design, not only because it caters to their basic needs on a daily basis — how to eat, what to wear, where to live and the ways of transportation — but also, they have found the greater role of design in forecasting a trend.This motivated the launch of the China Design Exhibition and Public Art Thematic Exhibition in 2012, aiming to investigate the scope and depth of how design changes the country. The event has been held in Guangdong province, one of the most developed regions in China. Its fourth edition is now being held in Shenzhen of Guangdong, long seen as the "forefront of reform and opening-up" and in recent years, viewed as "a city of design".On show are more than 1,300 works that examine new trends in design and public art, especially in serving national strategies and addressing social concerns, over the recent four years — the third edition of the event was held in 2019.The current one, closing on Thursday, is being held at Shenzhen Museum of Contemporary Art and Urban Planning and the Guan Shanyue Museum, themselves two landmark buildings embodying the creative spirit of design in the metropolis.And, for the first time, the event has provided an online tour.For International Women's Day, Tory Burch announced that it will continue to expand its cooperation with the China Women's Development Foundation and jointly launch the "Dream Forward Women Empowerment Specialized Program" for women's empowerment and entrepreneurship.Starting this month, part of the fixed income from the brand's iconic "Embrace Ambition" bracelet will be donated to the China Women's Development Foundation to support this public welfare project, which aims to provide women in ethnic group areas in China with training in intangible cultural heritage and ethnic handicrafts, and venture capital support.This co-sponsored project demonstrates Tory Burch's long-term commitment to women's empowerment and brand vision of supporting women's entrepreneurship, as well as a deep admiration for artisans and global handicraft heritage from the brand's founder. At the same time, this move also shows the brand's firm commitment and continuous development to the Chinese market since it opened its first boutique on Chinese mainland in Beijing in 2011.Tory Burch, Chief Creative Officer and Executive Director, said, "I started our company to make a difference for women, and I have always been inspired by artisans and beautiful crafts from around the world. Working with the CWDF to celebrate China’s tradition of craftsmanship and create impact for women artisans in the region brings together two of my great passions and I am excited to see the impact."This cooperation builds on the friendly relationship between Tory Burch and the China Women's Development Foundation (CWDF).The new program builds on Tory Burch's relationship with the CWDF which launched last year with @Raise Her Business Plan, a project dedicated to helping Chinese women in need start their own businesses. This year’s program provides craftsmanship and entrepreneurship training to women in minority communities.Demand for outdoor clothing, combining fashion and functionality, is growing among urban enthusiasts, Xu Lin reports.A fisherman's hat, waterproof jacket, sports bag, a pair of cargo trousers and hiking boots are all popular outfits for trekking in China today. The style of clothing, combining functionality with fashion, originated in Japan as yama (meaning "mountain" in Japanese).Many Chinese wear such clothes for sports and daily purposes now, and share their fashion tips online. They prefer colors such as shades of green, khaki and gray, and try to match tone-on-tone clothing.The COVID-19 impact has led many people toward nature and outdoor activities such as playing Frisbee, camping, skateboarding and paddleboarding, and they've gradually taken to related outfits.Chinese social media Xiaohongshu released a report on the country's top 10 lifestyle trends that showed last year young people from big cities preferred to join outdoor activities and wear outdoor outfits.According to online marketplace Tmall, when the Singles Day shopping spree started at 8 pm on Oct 31, the sales of camping and climbing equipment during the first hour jumped by 115 percent and 81.2 percent, respectively, compared with the same period in 2021.Bai Yifan, an influencer in the field of snowboarding, carefully chooses his skiing outfit and snowboard each time he sets off to a ski field, and shares images with his online followers. He says "mountain-style" outfits have become popular among ski fans."Designs for camping and mountaineering clothes are increasingly used for ski suits. A regular ski suit is simple but now some have decorative designs," Bai says, adding that he has been on some 200 ski slopes in more than 20 countries and regions, and has attracted about 671,000 followers on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform.He says the multi-pocket vest, a popular outdoor outfit, has also become a favorite of ski fans, who are drawn to its stylish elements.A fashion week will display the latest products in fashion during the China International Consumer Products Expo (CICPE) in south China's Hainan province.As an important part of the expo, the fashion week will feature fashion shows and forums to showcase the latest products, in addition to activities such as art exhibitions, according to the organizer.The event organizer is calling on outstanding designers around the world to attend and present their fashion items to elevate their reputation and promote the ideas of fashion and art.An opening ceremony for the expo, to be held in the city of Haikou, will be held on April 10. The expo will last through April 15.Hermes has recently released a new men's collection that holds a blend of practicality and longing.Cashmere and flannel, lamb wool and different textured leather gently caress the body. The design pays attention to the everyday chic and homage to at-home relaxation with, for example, a hidden pocket on the leather back of a pea coat serving as a symbol of patchwork care done to preserve a well-loved piece of clothing. Colors such as charcoal, gravel, fog, caramel, brown, coffee, camel, navy, ivory and black, reveal muted tones that grow in richness and speak to one another, shot through with a flash of light, intense as winter light.The hand of the craftsman filled these clothes with stories through braided leathers and knits that carry the trace of multiple lives, in the palimpsests of scarves on knitwear, in fragments of leather on a jacket, in an Irish cable knit born in color and asserted in stitching, in framing effects and the silk yoke of a cardigan.Coco Chanel once said: "Slavish followers of inner beauty, who completely ignore dressing up, are also superficial." Jewelry has always lit up people's life, becoming a statement of their taste and thoughts.The advancement of the manufacturing industry and the invention of new materials since the 19th century have greatly prompted the design and production of jewelry. Compound metals and artificial gems replaced the precious and natural ones and, thanks to that, new waves took place in jewelry design and more people could afford the glittering ornaments.These changes can be seen at Imprint, an exhibition now ongoing at Tsinghua University Art Museum, which reviews the evolution of jewels and aesthetics throughout the 20th century.On show are mainly brooches and other types of jewelry made between the 1930s and '80s, featuring Trifari, Coro and Boucher and other brands involving vintage pieces that are highly sought after by collectors today. They are from Zheng Yingyan who has accumulated a collection of vintage jewels throughout the years.The exhibition will last until March 26.At school, Miao Sheng'ai is a grade 12 student, busy preparing for her college entrance exam; at home,she designs garments that don't exist in the physical world.The "fabric" she uses is not made with thread, but generated by computer, allowing the 18-year-old Tianjin resident to fully let loose her creativity and imagination. In the digital fashion landscape, rules are made to be broken and gravity does not exist."With no concerns about textiles or functional needs, I can focus on the visual aspect of my design," Miao says. She learned to use 3D design software on her own and her unique fashion sense has gained her 19,000 followers on Xiaohongshu, a popular Chinese social media platform.Already she has garnered interest from an entertainment star. Xu Yangyuzhuo, a member of pop idol group SNH48, recently posted three digitally altered photos on the platform in which she sports Miao's designs.Digital fashion is gaining in popularity with the tech-savvy younger generation, who live more and more of their social lives online,and influencers and celebrities are following Xu's lead, using the new technology to enrapture audiences.Digital fashion, still a largely unexplored frontier, has grabbed the fashion industry's attention, and circumstances have also forced a market change. The COVID-19 pandemic, which shuttered or restricted the operations of malls and boutiques around the country,accelerated the pace of digitization.Athleisure brand lululemon announced Zhou Guanyu, China's first-ever Formula 1 driver, as the brand’s newest ambassador on Wednesday in Shanghai.Zhou first got behind the wheel at the age of 8 and was already pursuing a professional career in racing by the time he was 15. He has achieved a series of milestones in Chinese motorsport history, including starting his first season as China's much-awaited first-ever Formula 1 driver in 2022. Zhou’s world-class fighting spirit and effortless confidence are typical of the new generation of Chinese athletes.“I love the vibrant energy and professionalism of the brand. Training is a big part of my daily life, and lululemon products give me the comfort, versatility and style that I’ve been looking for,” said Zhou.“People may be more familiar with me as someone who lives life in the fast lane, but in my daily life, I feel it is important to slow down and listen to our inner voice. Through the partnership with lululemon, I look forward to championing a more positive approach to life as we work together to find our own rhythm in these times of uncertainty and challenges," he added.Lynn Cheah, Vice President of Brand Marketing & Community at lululemon China, noted that the brand and Zhou share the same beliefs and values, and are grounded in the same purpose to unlock greater possibility and wellbeing for all.When she was a child, Yue-Sai Kan was told by her father that she should always aim to be the first to walk on the moon because no one remembers the second.What her father said has been a driving inspiration over the years for her to become an Emmy-winning television producer, bestselling author and successful entrepreneur.Her new book Be a Pioneer, which is the tenth she has penned and her first Chinese-language autobiography, was released after three years in the making. It was also inspired in part by her father's words."Actually many people have asked me to write an autobiography. I have been asked numerous times already but I always felt that it was not the right time for me to sit down and give thanks for my life and also I did not think my life was so exciting anyway," says Kan.However, her publisher thought otherwise, telling her that since she lived through interesting times in China, and was both witness and participant, she should write the book as a historical record."All the things I have done — my successes and my failures — can be a good example to young people in particular. I think that's the main reason why I wrote the book," says Kan, adding that the COVID-19 lockdown gave her the unexpected opportunity to do some thinking about her life.In the book, Kan included a lot of pictures taken from her early life. By scanning a QR code, readers are also able to see video clips from the period. "I am a television person, so I thought these videos were a great way to connect with my readers," she says.When writing an autobiography, the biggest challenges are not only how to present one's life, but also remembering it in the first place. To help with reconstructing her story, Kan asked the many friends and colleagues she made over the years to write down their memories of her from earlier times. So besides featuring Kan's own words, the new book is also filled with those of her friends, which gave Kan new insight into herself."My assistant Stephanie wrote about my marriage. I was getting a divorce. She mentioned that I was crying every day, which I did not remember, and she said that I was frantic because we were running out of cash for the company. My housekeeper reminded me that before the launch of one of my events she found that I had fainted in the bathroom. I was so exhausted that I was getting sick. They know more about me than myself," Kan says.Watching activities online, such as scraping soap, rinsing cars and trimming cow hooves, doesn't require much thinking, yet these videos have brought audio-visual pleasure to many people that helps to relieve stress in their real lives.Zeng Xiaoyue, a 24-year-old master's degree candidate in biology at Zhejiang University, likes watching such videos because she enjoys the sounds."The other day, I happened to watch a video showing a man cooking feed for pigs. He doesn't speak, he just chops vegetables. The chopping sound relieved my pressure," she said.Her pressure comes from writing a thesis and seeking a job upon graduation. She used to seek help from a psychological consultant because she was diagnosed with depression at a hospital.Lots of people like Zeng love to watch these types of videos for relaxation. On a video platform, video clips themed "scraping soap" and "repairing cow hooves" have more than 1 million views.In some such videos, people cut, pinch, tear, scrape, squeeze or press objects in which things are being destroyed. Other clips that have similar effects of decompression show manual labor or production, such as washing carpets, cutting cow hooves and repairing cosmetics powder.Their movements are usually simple, repeated and smooth, giving the audience enjoyment from their visual and auditory senses, which meets the needs of obsessive-compulsive-type people.People who are diagnosed with OCD aim to restore chaos to its original appearance or give it a new look. This kind of destruction and reorganization relieves pressure and stress.The videos show a comfortable ending and leave viewers with a satisfied mood and strong before-and-after contrast which maximizes the release.Autonomous sensory meridian response is another popular type of decompression video, which focuses on giving a tingling sensation by amplifying subtle sounds.Video creators whisper, chew, blow or touch something to make smooth and slow sounds.To cater to viewers, videos for releasing stress present various points that satisfy a variety of people.Some people love to see squeezing acne and pulling out blackheads, which others feel is so disgusting that they can't watch. Some people love to watch an excavator work, even for a whole day, but some people find that boring.These videos appeared as early as 2013 on the forum Reddit when someone first coined the term "oddly satisfying" in describing the videos, which has grown into a community of millions.In the era of short videos, these types of videos have become more popular. Last year, videos with the hashtag "Oddly Satisfying" on Tik-Tok received billions of views.L'Oréal China celebrated its 25th anniversary and opened "Beauty Moves – L'Oréal China 25th Anniversary Exhibition" at the Shanghai Exhibition Center on December 16.Lasting for a week, L'Oréal China's 25th anniversary exhibition themed "Beauty Moves" consists of five chapters: "Beauty Is Diverse and Inclusive," "Beauty Is Innovative," "Beauty Empowers Women," "Beauty Is Sustainable," and "Beauty Evolution".It gathers works by renowned Chinese and international artists including Xu Bing, Angélica Dass, Zheng Bo, Web3 Creator Team Black Void and Liu Jiayu, who all expand the boundary of beauty by telling profound stories from multiple perspectives.To celebrate its 25th anniversary, L'Oréal China released a 10-episode micro-documentary series titled Seize the Beauty that showcases Chinese people's pursuit of beauty and inclusive beauty.

The white paper seeks to provide a valuable reference for the industry to explore new trends in the "smell economy".Lin Jing, senior vice-president of Eternal Group, said that although a certain degree of economic downturn has had a certain impact on the cosmetics and perfume markets, compared with the 50 percent penetration rate of cosmetics, the current penetration rate of perfumes in the Chinese market is only 10 percent. There is still a wide space in the market waiting to be developed.Li Xiaojie, senior research director of Innovation & Customer Experience Business of Kantar China, mentioned that Chinese consumers are pursuing more meaningful uniqueness to show their own taste in subtleties. Consumer behaviors have also changed, mainly five areas, namely customer base, emotional value, preference for "pure aesthetics", feeling value and omni-channel connection.Wang Wei, chief operating officer of Eternal Group pointed to the home fragrance sector as the growth driver of the industry — consumers' use of various aromatherapy categories increased significantly in 2022. It is an area worthy of in-depth exploration and research by industry practitioners. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. unveiled its China Innovation Labs in Shanghai on Thursday, aiming to focus on the Chinese consumers more.As a state-of-the-art research and development facility, the 12,000-square-meter center will enable the Estée Lauder Companies to evaluate and prototype skincare, makeup, fragrance, hair care products and new trends.The center houses leading technology, formulation and clinical labs, collaborative workspaces, interactive testing facilities, packaging prototype labs and a pilot plant that will collectively accelerate the companies' ability to move from insight to commercialization.

Yu Jing, a young Beijing woman, juggles professional ambition, family life and uncommon athletic ability, Xing Wen reports.Early in 2015, Beijing native Yu Jing, then a 29-year-old running beginner, registered for the TCS New York City Marathon, just for fun.Yu knew well that one only has a very slim chance of being selected in the draw for such an internationally popular marathon, so she neither made a genuine attempt to secure entry nor cared much about the result.But by a stroke of fortune, she was selected, catapulting her on a life-changing journey.Yu's unexpected luck became an entryway for her to tap her athletic potential and open up new vistas of life.The young woman, who used to live the busy yet sedentary lifestyle of an architectural designer, later managed to conquer a full marathon within three hours and 40 minutes and climb onto a triathlon winner's rostrum."In retrospect, I find that many of the positive changes in my life were brought on by my involvement in different forms of athletics," says Yu.She recalls that at a very young age she was a plain student in class.RGB - Vision Persistence Moment Light BoxThe series of works of RGB - Vision Persistence Moment Light Box is aimed at the full-color screen system.

She is also a jewelry collector of great passion and discernment.Dozens of vintage pieces by renowned jewelers and designers in her belonging will go under the hammer in Hong Kong with part of the proceeds to benefit charitable purposes. Highlights include a diamond ring featuring a 12.46-carat ruby and a jadeite carving showing Guanyin bodhisattva, the goddess of compassion and mercy.They were exhibited at Christie's previews of autumn auctions in Beijing and Shanghai. The items will be sold at Christie's sales on Nov 28.Fashion house showcases traditional appeal with modern elegance, He Qi reports in Shanghai.Alongside the other houses of the LVMH group, Dior is presenting the plurality of its heritage and virtuoso inventiveness at the China International Import Expo from Nov 5 to 10 in Shanghai, a unique event that reaffirms the unbreakable ties between Dior and China.Dior has participated in the CIIE three times since 2019. This time's participation has further deepened the understanding of Chinese culture and continued the indissoluble bond with China.A hearing-impaired couple takes to the business to assist others like them in navigating e-commerce, report Li Yingxue in Beijing and Zhu Youfang in Changsha.Thousands of netizens watched the livestreaming room "rabbit sister Wang Yihan" while waiting for a link to the goods advertised to be updated on the afternoon of Oct 4.Unlike other livestreaming rooms, this was quiet with only background music and the sound of pen scratching paper.It was hosted by a hearing-impaired couple, Yi Sixiong and Wang Xian. In front of the camera, the duo carefully explained the details of the goods and answered questions from viewers, who mostly had hearing difficulties, in sign language.The six-hour livestream received some 74,000 views, with the sales of goods exceeding 700,000 yuan ($99,000).Using multiple WeChat public accounts and a silent livestreaming room, Yi and his wife have attracted over 350,000 online followers, mainly hearing-impaired people like them.Yi, 33, also known as Daxiong, or "big bear", aims to build a platform for people with hearing difficulties to solve all kinds of problems they face, from learning sign language to finding jobs."As we gain more followers with hearing difficulties, I feel more responsibility. I want to try my best to help them, no matter what kind of difficulty they meet," Yi says, his gestures translated by interpreter and teacher Zhang Xihong.Zhang has known Yi for six years and has become a "bridge" between Yi and other people who don't know sign language. When she communicates with Yi, she is often amused. "His sign language is quite expressive and infectious. He can present one small thing vividly," Zhang says.Yi was born in Changsha, Hunan province, in a family where some members had conditions such as congenital hearing loss. Under the careful guidance of his parents and teachers, Yi not only mastered sign language with fluent expressions but also enrolled into the animation major at Changchun University in Northeast China's Jilin province after finishing his high school studies at Changsha Special Education School.In 2016, after graduation, Yi opened a roast duck restaurant in Changsha with his father's financial support. Even though he was busy working from day to night, his first venture didn't succeed. In less than a year, the business lost over 100,000 yuan.Yi didn't immerse himself in depression. After noticing that without hearing ability, he met many difficulties in daily life, Yi got new ideas about what he wanted to do.With the popularization of WeChat, communication among people with hearing difficulties in China has improved.However, as many hearing-impaired people have just started using WeChat or the internet, they often encounter online fraud and suffer monetary loss due to a lack of vigilance. Sometimes they are even tricked into pyramid schemes because of the lack of legal knowledge.Yi says the situation is caused by the lack of channels to get information for people with hearing difficulties. That is one reason he decided to be a "problem solver" and their "ears".Cosmetics giant Amorepacific is present at the 5th China International Import Expo (CIIE) with seven brands, more than 500 selected exhibits and nearly 20 new products under the theme of "Creating a Smart Future Together".This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and South Korea, as well as the 30th anniversary of Amorepacific's entry into the Chinese market."The hosting of the CIIE for five consecutive years demonstrates the Chinese government's firm determination to support trade liberalization and economic globalization, and the steady and open Chinese market provides a strong growth momentum for the sustainable development of the world economy," said Mike Hwang, president of Amorepacific China."We are amazed by the strong resilience and huge potential of China's economy. We will seize every opportunity to continue to iterate on beauty products and research and development technology at the speed of the CIIE, and bring overseas trendy new products, beauty technology, digital experiences and sustainable fashion to the Chinese market, and embrace new opportunities in the Chinese market," Hwang added.Over the years of deep market cultivation and profound Oriental aesthetic insight, Amorepacific brings consumers rich products and advanced technologies.Laneige, a youth skin expert brand under Amorepacific, is globally launching Laneige Perfect Renew 3X series at the expo. Innisfree, which is popular among young Chinese consumers, is launching its Collagen Peptide Essence Cream in China for the first time on the stage of the CIIE.Fashion designers embrace a creativity that is gathering global attention.The fashion design industry in China has been undergoing rapid growth in recent years, and diversified yet distinctive young designers are showing their talent to the world both boldly and liberally.Since 2013, Lane Crawford, a luxury retailer with a global reach, has supported and nurtured more than 80 young brands. For autumn-winter 2022, it is featuring nine selected Chinese designer brands across the categories of fashion, accessories, beauty and lifestyle.Its refreshing selection celebrates the originality, imagination, individuality, and self-expression crucial to the spirit of contemporary Chinese design.The nine brands all carry strong identities among impeccable craftsmanship, boundary-pushing design and contemporary attitude.Yin, a young semi-fine jewelry brand, hides rich cultural deposits in its collections, such as a gold accessory inspired by the Luban lock, an ancient Chinese architecture technique where pieces of wood are exquisitely crafted to interlock without the use of nails.Another design takes its inspiration from the "six arts" — rites, music, archery, chariot-racing, calligraphy and mathematics. These were originally referred to the six basic skills in the aristocratic education system of the Zhou Dynasty (c.11th century-256 BC).The brand hopes that ultimately the Chinese designers will present the world with, not simply, a set of symbols or a direct appropriation of intangible cultural heritage, but a redesigned and reinterpreted contemporary aesthetic, complemented by endearing contemporary forms of expression.Yueqi Qi, a brand established in 2019, draws inspiration from classical romantic love stories, such as Legend of the White Snake and The Butterfly Lovers.The multifaceted Paris-meets-Tokyo brand Maison Kitsune's first boutique store in Southwest China opened on Oct 21 in Chengdu city, Sichuan province, bringing a new experience for the fashion senses.The store is located in Chengdu IFS International Financial Center, a prime location in the city's central business district. The interior of the boutique has been carefully designed to lead consumers through an exploration of Maison Kitsune's aesthetic connection with Chengdu.Located on the second floor of the IFS Mall, the 102-square-meter store features a futuristic sculpture of a fox at the entrance and a vibrant orange tone that highlights the brand's passion and desire for an artistic life.With geometric lines and soft light, the bright and eye-catching shop windows create an elegant atmosphere of French minimalism. Besides, the overall space is designed to interpret the aesthetics of Paris-Tokyo with modern concepts.Maison Kitsune is looking for different approaches to communicate with the local culture and continue dialogue with the public. It has launched a Chengdu City Exclusive Collection to celebrate the first store opening in the southwest region.The design combines Chengdu's signature panda head with the brand's iconic fox head to create a versatile unisex collection, including T-shirts, sweatshirts, caps and canvas bags, meeting the needs of daily wear in multiple scenarios and bring out the relaxed and joyful Chengdu culture vividly."There is no doubt that China is a very important market," says Hua Zhener, the chief operation officer of the brand. "When entering each market, Maison Kitsune will make adjustments according to some characteristics of this market. No matter from the design elements and details of stores, each store presents its own characteristics and differences from other cities".In addition, a wide range of products from Maison Kitsune's new co-branded collection and Fall/Winter 2022 collection are also available in the store, waiting for consumers to embark on a casual, relaxed and modern journey in Chengdu.Alexandre Dam, the brand's CEO in China, claims: "In the coming months, Kitsune will also develop activities, with an exciting upgrade of our food offers in Cafe Kitsune Xintiandi, as well as music activities, with events that are planned throughout the year (Kitsune Superseries, Kitsune Club Nights). Indeed, while our fashion activity is starting to be recognized, we still have so much to say as a true lifestyle brand and share the brand's Art de Vivre with our beloved community".Chinese gold medalist at the 2017 WorldSkills Competition helps train new contestants for a special edition, Li Yingxue reports.In 2008, then-10-year-old Hu Ping was happy to see fireworks in the streets on the night of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing. During the Games, she celebrated China's medal tally and says she felt that people who fight for the honor of their country are quite remarkable.At that time, she didn't think that one day she would be representing China as a champion in a non-sports field.Hu won the gold medal for fashion technology at the 44th WorldSkills Competition held in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates in 2017. The biennial competition is considered the top contest in the sector.In September, China announced its delegation for the WorldSkills Competition 2022 Special Edition. This was the replacement for the competition that was to be held in Shanghai in October but got canceled due to the COVID-19 outbreak there. Hu became the training coach for the Chinese participants to prepare for the competition, passing on her experience and skills in fashion design and production.As an ace in the field, Hu spends her day engaging in handy work such as painting, stitching, sewing, cutting and holding an iron. Although Hu is just 24, her fingers appear to be wrinkled due to their constant use."Applying hand cream will make my hands slippery, which affects my work," Hu says. "My teacher always tells us that people who work with clothing cannot leave any smell on the clothes you make."When Hu was a child, she liked to paint and make clothes for her dolls. In 2013, she decided to turn her hobby into professional study, for which she went to Beijing Industry and Trade Technician College, majoring in fashion designing and production.Before Huang Bilian came to Beijing five years ago, she was a fresh graduate with an interior design major who was still looking for direction in her career.But there was one thing she was sure of, she was no longer willing to stay in her hometown of Chengdu city in Sichuan province.In Beijing, she found a part-time job in a company called deja vu, a newly established outfit selling second hand books online. She was responsible for checking the quality of used books that had been recycled and sorting them out."At that time, I had no idea about the circular economy or the business of recycling second hand books at all. But I was personally in favor of hunting for used pieces of furniture. Sometimes I wondered how previous owners had used these old items," she said.Having worked in deja vu for five years and seen the company expand its business to selling second hand apparel, Huang found that second hand goods not only bring stories with them,but also create new stories when they are resold.She remembered an evening when a very young man walked into deja vu's recycle store in Shanghai. "Wearing a backpack and dressed in a simple manner, he seemed like a fresh graduate who was still looking for a job," Huang recalled.After trying on several suits, the young man finally picked a second hand men's suit selling at 400 yuan and asked Huang whether there was any extra discount."I told him the price is already 70 or 80 percent off from the original price and no extra discount is available, so he left disappointed," Huang said.Surprisingly, the young man returned after a little while and explained that he had a tight budget but really wanted the suit."I thought maybe he needed it for an interview or other important things, so at last I offered him an extra 10 percent discount," Huang said.Huang realized that second hand goods with a low price sometimes can provide dignity for people when they have few options."In the past, when our parents needed something that they could not afford, for example, a decent suit for dating, they might have borrowed it from friends and relatives," Huang said.But today people are not as close as they were in the past and some people are unwilling to reveal their embarrassment to others, she said. So a second hand store will be a good solution for the problem.Huang said that for some people,trading second hand books or apparel is still a new thing that they have never tried so far."It is our hope that people who visited our stores can get a better understanding of the second hand business and will come up with the idea of recycling when they have to cast aside idle items some day," she added.It was a regular Friday in August when Wang An considered taking a stroll around her workplace in downtown Beijing. She chose a nearby recycling shop.After spending half an hour in the second hand books and clothes shop, Wang bought a hardcover original version of Harry Potter Film Wizardry."It was the first time I visited here. I'm quite interested in Harry Potter recently and this book is not found in other places,so I bought one when I happened to see it,"she said.Renovated from an old factory in the Sanlitun area, the store was opened by an online used books trading platform called deja vu early this year. The 1,000-square-meter place displays more than 10,000 second hand books and about 1,300 pieces of used clothes the company recycled.Wang is not only a "buyer" but also a"seller" at deja vu and other online platforms of second hand goods. Through Idle Fish, an online flea market, she has earned about 20,000 yuan ($2,897) from reselling a treadmill, a baby crib and other stuff."For me, trading second hand products is a good option to deal with stuff that I no longer need," she said.Gathering young energy sector practitioners and students majoring in energy-related subjects, the BRICS Youth Energy Summit and International Energy Youth Conference kicked off on Sunday to address the future of sustainable development.Young people from the BRICS countries are the new driving force accelerating the global transition to a green, low-carbon energy structure, noted Wang Sunyu, deputy executive director and general secretary of the International Centre for Engineering Education under the auspices of UNESCO, at the summit, which took place at the Future Science City in Changping district, Beijing.Wu Xiaolin, president of China University of Petroleum in Beijing — a co-host of the event — spoke at the opening ceremony, saying that China is striving to achieve its carbon peak and neutrality goals. It is against such a backdrop that the China University of Petroleum in Beijing attaches much more importance to the development of interdisciplinary studies and the promotion of openness and talent integration at work."The university has been playing an active role in generating ideas to tackle the double carbon goals, cultivating talent in relevant fields and making technological breakthroughs that will help to attain them," Wu said.The university has been expanding the channels through which it seeks to gather high-level talent, as well as international exchanges in the field of energy-related technologies. The latter has been achieved by leveraging platforms such as the Worldwide Energy University Network, a collaboration between more than 30 universities with a shared strategic interest and expertise in energy-related fields.Great efforts have been made by the university to disseminate information and present case studies pertaining to China's efforts to lower carbon output and promote sustainable development on the international stage."I hope the event can build a bridge of friendship between young practitioners in the energy sector from all around the globe, enabling them to gather and help shape the future of sustainable energy," she added.The event has also provided an opportunity for domestic and foreign students majoring in energy-related studies to communicate with representatives from some of China's leading energy enterprises, including China National Petroleum Corp and China National Offshore Oil Corp. They have posed questions to company representatives and inquired about areas in which they are interested, such as the possibility of securing a job at one of those enterprises after graduation and the current status of the transition from traditional methods of energy production to greener and more sustainable means.The inaugural World Design Cities Conference kicked off in Shanghai on Sept 15, showcasing the city's ambitions of becoming a global design hub and the achievements in its design industry.Nearly 300 representatives and industry leaders from home and abroad attended the four-day event, which unveiled hundreds of creative designs.The conference hosted more than 50 forums, two exhibitions and multiple activities that were related to a wide range of topics such as industrial innovation, architecture, fashion, digital and service design.Wu Jincheng, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatization, said on the opening day that Shanghai has implemented a series of measures to promote design as an important driver of development and social sustainability since becoming a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in 2010.The measures have evidently borne fruit — the output of Shanghai's creative and design industry was 1.6 trillion yuan ($231.75 billion) last year, up from 472.46 billion yuan in 2012, according to official data.The Spring/Summer 2023 Shanghai Fashion Show will begin on Thursday with supermodel Lv Yan's fashion brand COMME MOI will lead the opening show in Xintiandi.Over 80 fashion brands will launch their latest collection through online or offline catwalks.The short-video platform Douyin will be the major platform to showcase the online catwalks, including overseas shows of DIOR and HUISHAN ZHANG.Tong Jisheng, director of the Shanghai Fashion Week Organizing Committee, said that the committee and designers had overcome many difficulties to launch the fashion week, which enables many emerging brands with the market potential to enter the show.During the fashion week, several analytic reports in the industry will be released including the McKinsey 2022 China Fashion Industry White Paper.Data confirms that the Shanghai Fashion Week has topped the ordering season in Asia after 20 years of efforts.On Sept 15 in Shanghai, Chinese lifestyle brand Shang Xia announced that it has appointed Sun Leon as its home creative director, responsible for the development of the brand's home collection and brand development strategy.Sun has nearly two decades of experience in the media industry and has served as editorial director and chief content officer for renowned home design media, Elle Decoration, for the past eight years.The professional background and global vision endow him with a forward-looking perspective, keen insight into industry trends, connection with designers, making him an ideal leader of the brand's home creative team.Sun led a series of cultural projects disseminated through media platforms and curatorial activities, echoing the vision of Shang Xia that integrates Eastern aesthetics into contemporary design.As the chief strategy officer of the brand, he will further promote the development of Shang Xia's in the future and strengthen the reach and depth of the brand's influence.This month, Shang Xia will present the 2023 spring summer fashion collection by Yang Li at Paris Fashion Week, to further introduce its understanding of Chinese heritage and craftsmanship. And its new home collection designed by Sun would be available in next April."Stemming from the new Chinese aesthetics of fashion and life, Shang Xia epitomizes the spirit of contemporary China. And I have always believed that it is our mission and responsibility to create an international brand that is rooted in Chinese traditions, internationally oriented and belongs to contemporary China," Sun said.The Spring/Summer edition of China International Fashion Week 2023 recently came to a close in Beijing.The nine-day event, held between Sept 4 and 12, featured 134 fashion shows by some 360 domestic and international designers.Shows by local designers were notable for their blend of traditional Chinese aesthetics and modern elements.Founded in 1997, China International Fashion Week has been witness to the development of the country's fashion industry and become an important platform connecting designers and markets.A few days ago, I began reading a story, in which young people in Beijing are getting or creating digital "companions" to ease their loneliness over a romance gone bad.The avatars are perfect "boyfriends "or "girlfriends". They can hold a conversation, are "cute" and never lose their temper.For someone who just got out of a relationship, the benefits provided by the digital relationship are comforting. Gratifying, even.In a lot of science fiction, visionary writers "explore" a world where cybernetic organisms, which is a fancy way of saying a robot, wed or become lovers to a human being.They see that as the future and the reality is probably closer than we think. The future seems to be already here in Beijing.In the science-fiction TV series The Orville, a series created by comedian Seth MacFarlane partly based on the popular and long-running Star Trek, the ship's doctor marries a robot/cyborg at the end of the third season in the 10th episode finale.The whole thing came off naturally. The groom's family was composed entirely of a robot species called the Kaylon. They all showed up at the wedding.In the movie Ex Machina in 2014, Alicia Vikander portrays an alluring cyborg who flirts with a human programmer in the research facility of a Google-like internet company.The flick ended darkly, with the robots killing their creator.Another fascinating TV series is Westworld, where robots created for pleasure turn on their operators.Changsha, capital of Hunan province, is boosting the digital economy through its ceaseless efforts in constructing key projects and supporting smart technologies and innovation.The city is home to China's third supercomputing center and the first supercomputing center in Central China-the National Supercomputing Changsha Center-as well as the Tianhe supercomputer, Xiangjiang Laboratory and other digital innovation enterprises.In December 2021, the Zhongnan Digital Industrial Park, the largest digital new infrastructure landmark project in Hunan, officially started construction. With a total investment of 12 billion yuan ($1.7 billion), it is the largest digital new infrastructure project in the province.Upon completion, it will become China Telecom's fifth-largest regional data center, helping Hunan to become an information highland in the central region.On July 10, the opening ceremony of Xiangjiang Laboratory was held in Beidou Industrial Park, Changsha High-Tech Industrial Development Zone. It was the first provincial laboratory to be revealed in Hunan. Xiangjiang Laboratory is a major innovation platform for Hunan to strengthen the support for computing power.The laboratory focuses on the fields of advanced computing and artificial intelligence, and is committed to becoming a national advanced computing and AI research center."The construction of Xiangjiang Laboratory is of great and far-reaching significance for Hunan to strengthen computing power, optimize the digital economy and lead the high-quality development of the computing industry, economy and society," said Li Zhijian, head of the Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department.The scale of Changsha's digital industry has created a cluster effect. The total output value of Changsha's subsidized security computing system industry cluster has reached 135 billion yuan.In August, Changsha's Xiangjiang New Area officially launched a demonstration experiment to provide self-driving travel charging services to the public.

A meeting with Fan Liuliu, his former classmate played by Gao, presents Wu with a fresh start as she suggests filming a documentary about him, capturing the societal trend of individuals returning to their hometowns for a simpler life.With Fan's help in directing his unsellable script, Wu assembles a modest crew, including the documentary's cameraman as the cinematographer, his sister as the assistant, an unemployed actor, and his mother as the actress. As filming progresses, Wu faces a series of challenges.After an unexpected setback halts production, Wu undergoes a profound reassessment of life's purpose, leading to a transformative moment three years later.At a Beijing premiere on Sunday, director Long Fei described Gold or Shit as a "genre-defying film", drawing inspiration from the intricate details of his and scriptwriter Huang Jia's lives.Hu emphasized that the film aims not to discourage aspiring individuals facing obstacles but to convey an uplifting message.

Distinguished by her ability to transition from comedy to directing, she is at the forefront of contemporary filmmaking.Renowned for her consistent creativity, Jia Ling is one of China's most acclaimed actresses. Her extensive presence on stage and on the screen spans several years and includes seven appearances at the Spring Festival Gala. In 2021, her directorial debut and performance in Hi, Mom led her to become the highest-grossing female director worldwide for a single film. Most recently, she worked both as a director and as an actress on the 2024 film YOLO – reaching the top of the Chinese New Year box office.In late April, a gentle breeze swept across the serene landscape of Yanqi Lake, nestled on the northern outskirts of Beijing. Despite the picturesque view from his hotel room window, Kris Phillips, who is better known as Fei Xiang in China, had just had a hectic week that contrasted sharply with the tranquillity outside.As a jury member for the 14th Beijing International Film Festival's Tiantan Award, the Chinese-American singer and actor viewed the 15 shortlisted films competing for honors and attended multiple news conferences over the course of a tight 12-day schedule.Describing himself as a movie lover who re-watched golden era Hollywood films, like those starring Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, to prepare for his new comedy Out of Order, the 63-year-old star says he was fascinated by the opportunity to admire movies from a variety of countries, including Argentina and Israel."I think film offers us a window into other people's lives. That's what we want. China has a huge amount of potential in this regard," he tells China Daily. "I feel like the Chinese film industry is now at a fascinating moment and entering a golden period of filmmaking. It's going to be like America between the 1970s and 1980s, a period when there was a huge expansion of talent, and dedication to film as an art form."For Chinese people born in the 1970s and '80s, Phillips was the pop king of their era.After graduating from Stanford University, the performer, who has an American father and a Chinese mother, returned to Taiwan and began his showbiz career in the TV series Eleven Women, paving his way to stardom as a heartthrob in several movies adapted from novels by Chiung Yao, a well-known romance novelist from Taiwan.However, it was his musical talent — exemplified by the release of a series of albums and a successful tour of 60 sold-out concerts — that catapulted Phillips to fame for millions of fans in the Chinese mainland following his dynamic and charismatic performance of the song, Dongtian Lide Yibahuo (Ball of Fire), at China Central Television's 1987 Spring Festival Gala.Reflecting on his early years, and seemingly experiencing a nostalgic moment, Phillips says that he believed he lacked the experience to excel as an actor at the time, and questioned whether he wanted to settle for being an average actor, or strive to become a top-notch pop singer."When I saw my (early) films, I said to myself, 'Well, I'd better just stick to singing.' That was my reaction. And that's exactly what I did. I pulled the plug on my film work. I released album after album, did concerts, and performed in theaters in America," he says.Over the following two decades, he dedicated himself to music, establishing a presence in the United States despite the then challenging environment for Asian performers, through a series of high-profile performances, beginning with his role in the original Broadway cast of Miss Saigon, and culminating in appearing in Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Music of the Night.Taiwan singer-songwriter Faith Yang captivated audiences in Beijing with a spellbinding concert on May 1, marking a pivotal moment in her Muse tour.Under the evocative theme of Light, the concert unfolded as a visual odyssey, commencing with Yang's poignant ballad, We Across, and guiding spectators through mesmerizing chapters like Sunset, Midnight, and Dreaming.Throughout the evening, Yang enthralled the crowd with renditions of her beloved hits, including Stars Fill The Sky and Tomorrow, before culminating the night with a performance of her emotive piece, Through You (Open the Door to the World).Hailing from Taipei and shaped by her upbringing in Sydney, Yang first soared to prominence with the release of her debut album, One, in Taiwan in 1997. Renowned for her Gothic-inspired rock anthems like Silence, Fear, and Monster, she has amassed a devoted following over the years. In 2000, Yang clinched the prestigious Taiwan Golden Music Award for Best Female Performer, a testament to her musical prowess showcased on the album Silence.Yang's musical journey continued to evolve with the release of Continuation in 2007 and her English album, Self-Selected, two years later, solidifying her reputation as a versatile and dynamic artist whose creative vision knows no bounds.Celebrated A-list actress Yang Mi has taken on her first villainous role in a career spanning over two decades, propelling the espionage drama In the Name of the Brother to soaring popularity since its Sunday premiere on satellite TV channels in Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu province, with a viewership surpassing 1.9 percent. The series has quickly emerged as one of the most sought-after shows in late April.Set in 1944 Harbin, during the Japanese-occupied puppet state of Manchukuo, the narrative unfolds around a Communist Party of China underground agent who infiltrates a local spy organization, assuming his twin brother's identity to gain the trust of the organization's leader. Risking his life to gather crucial information and simultaneously searching for his missing brother, the story delves into the complexities of espionage in a tumultuous historical period.Helmed by acclaimed director Zhang Li, the drama showcases veteran actor Qin Hao portraying two distinct characters — an undercover CPC agent and his outspoken twin brother — each characterized by differing personalities. The former embodies caution and fortitude, while the latter exudes outspokenness and directness.The production team's commitment to historical accuracy is evident through meticulous research, including the creation of period-accurate props based on newspapers from the era and the construction of authentic architectural replicas to evoke the historical ambiance of the time.The drama has sparked widespread interest, with related topics amassing 510 million views on Sina Weibo, a testament to its resonance on one of China's most popular social platforms.Beijing is set to host the renowned Strawberry Music Festival, one of the country's largest outdoor music extravaganzas, from May 2 to 4, coinciding with the upcoming May Day holiday.Over the course of three days, both domestic and international singers and bands will take to four stages, with standout performances featuring the debut of veteran singer Wei Wei at the Strawberry Music Festival and the return of the award-winning UK rock band, Travis, marking their second appearance at the festival since their debut in 2013.The festival will also showcase the talents of prominent Chinese rock bands such as Miserable Faith, Second Hand Rose, and Queen Sea Big Shark, promising an eclectic and vibrant musical experience for attendees.In addition to the Beijing event, the Strawberry Music Festival will also unfold in Wuhan, Hubei province, on May 1 and 2.

Ana Martinez, producer of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, said in a statement.Lang recalled his upbringing and memories of Los Angeles, saying that music is the common ground for people from different cultural backgrounds.Music is an important part of the cultural exchanges between China and the United States, the pianist told Xinhua. He hopes that more musicians and artists from China can serve as cultural bridges in the future and bring the elegance of Chinese culture to Western audiences."The world communicates through music," Lang said, adding that he hopes to inspire as many people as possible to learn a musical instrument.There's an old saying in the West that you should never meet your heroes, they'll only disappoint you. Fortunately, Wang Hedi didn't grow up in the West.He grew up in Leshan, Sichuan province. It was there, around 15 years ago, as a primary school student, he found himself flicking through a basketball magazine. Inside was the story of a man who would become a sporting legend, LeBron James.Like the young student, James was born in a small city, in his case Akron, Ohio. Raised by a single mother, James defied the odds by rapidly rising to prominence, from high school success to entering the NBA at the age of 18, before being crowned "King "of the court.The tale of James' early resilience and triumph deeply moved Wang, who began eagerly tracking his newfound hero's career, only to be further inspired by the fearless manner in which James played."The forceful and aggressive way James slams the basketball through the hoop is visually striking, and it really pumps me up," Wang says.This devoted fan, much like his idol, grew to venture beyond the confines of his hometown, emerging as one of China's hottest young acting prospects.Fast-forward to a few weeks ago, Wang found himself not only living his childhood dream after being invited to participate in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Feb 16 — scoring 18 points in just 21 minutes, setting a new record for the highest points scored by a Chinese celebrity in the process — but finally got to meet his hero, exchanging first a handshake, then an embrace before finally procuring the highly sought-after autograph of basketball royalty, King James himself."That was undoubtedly a dream-come-true journey for me," Wang said during a break at a recent photo shoot in Beijing.The 25-year-old's display on the NBA court, transitioning from a substitute player to the second-highest scorer for Team Shannon — named after head coach, legendary NFL tight end, Shannon Sharpe — delighted a multitude of Chinese basketball fans, especially when he sunk a spectacular four-point shot to cap his stellar performance."Wang really stood out in the game. He became the game's best sixth man," said Su Qun, Tencent Sports' basketball commentator.While not so proficient in English, Wang sees basketball as a means of cultural communication.Prada released the "Prada for Blossoms Shanghai" capsule collection with a private cocktail at Rong Zhai, Shanghai on Thursday.The set design team from the recent popular TV series Blossoms Shanghai created an exclusive setting characterized by curved mirror installations and vintage props, inviting guests to step into the modern and elegant world of the leading character Lingzi played by actress Ma Yili.

The thematic focus stood out as a highlight, providing viewers with an insightful perspective into the landscapes and traditions of the countries visited.For instance, before embarking on their journey to Saudi Arabia, participants were given an opportunity to undergo a pre-trip course at the embassy of Saudi Arabia in China. During this session, cultural counselor Ahmed Al-Zahrani introduced them to the language and customs of Saudi Arabia. He also introduced some of the Sino-Saudi cooperation projects that are under the BRI framework, such as the Haramain High-Speed Railway, which is also known as the Mecca-Medina Railway.Upon arrival in Saudi Arabia, participants had the chance to ride the railway for themselves, and learn from the train crew about the impact high-speed rail travel has had on the lives of residents following its inauguration. One woman invited the group to visit her home, where the participants were able to enjoy homemade delicacies and exchange gifts.Rob 'n' Roll, in which Hong Kong superstar Aaron Kwok plays a toothy bandit, has emerged as one of the highest-grossing domestic films over the weekend.Since its release on Jan 19, the movie has earned around 90 million yuan ($12.5 million), making it the highest-grossing film on the single-day box office charts over the weekend, following the hit comedy, Johnny Keep Walking!With Albert Mak as director and veteran filmmaker Derek Yee as executive producer, the movie stars Kwok as a ruthless thief, who devises a grand heist. However, his plan takes an unexpected turn when it is disrupted by two frustrated middle-aged men — a taxi driver and a social worker. This leads to a series of comedic moments, as the unlikely trio are forced to evade both the police and other criminals.During the premiere in Beijing earlier this month, Kwok, who is normally known for his portrayal of handsome characters, said that he found the script refreshing to read. "As an actor, I always seek a chance to make a breakthrough in my performance. I have never been in a dark comedy before," he said."Additionally, I have played many serious roles, including police officers. When imagined myself as a bandit, I immediately pictured a toothy guy who smiled at me and said, 'thank you'. So, I suggested to the director that my role be created with this kind of image in mind," he added.The movie has so far received a high score of 9.1 points out of 10 on Taopiaopiao, one of the country's largest ticketing services.As the sun dipped below the skyline, the Auckland Art Gallery sparkled with the presence of celebrities and dignitaries, who came to celebrate the exquisite symphony of art, fashion and heritage, as the Chinese couturier Guo Pei unveiled her exhibition Fashion, Art, Fantasy.The six-month exhibition, from Dec 9, will showcase over 60 striking garments from Guo's two-decade-long career, inviting New Zealanders to immerse themselves in the grandeur of her art couture.The opening ceremony commenced with the soul-stirring resonance of a Maori Karanga, a ceremonial call of welcome to the artist and her family, followed by traditional blessings and songs.The exclusive exhibition not only displays Guo's representative masterpiece, the Yellow Queen gown and outfits never seen before in any other gallery or museum, but also features a series of unique public events, including an interview with the artist, the Chinese New Year Festival and a fashion fantasy ball."It is a privilege to present the magnificent work of Guo Pei to New Zealand, for the very first time," says Kirsten Lacy, director of the Auckland Art Gallery.Describing Guo's creations as more than fashion, she coined the term "art couture" to capture the essence of the exhibition.Guo said in her speech that she wishes to share her love and inspiration in her work with the New Zealand audience."Art transcends all the boundaries we impose. I aspire for my work to convey integrity, to transmit love, and to embody my civilization, along with the culture that flows in my veins," the artist said."In reality, culture and art know no borders; they belong not only to a single nation or ethnicity but to all of humanity.

Standing before a classroom filled with eager students, she humorously said, "Princesses, please take your seats." This video swiftly went viral on social media, igniting a fresh wave of academic discourse known as "princess literature".A quick search on social platforms revealed that this term isn't limited to teachers and students. Even the catering industry and the labor force have adopted it, with cafeterias proudly displaying slogans like "Princesses, please savor your meal", and workers cheerfully proclaiming, "Princesses, let's get to work".For Gen Zers, nurtured on "princess" stories and films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Frozen, the term "princess" carries profound significance. Traditionally, a princess was seen as self-indulgent and immature, often characterized by the infamous "princess syndrome". However, many of today's "princesses" are independent, striving for self-worth, and promoting positive values.The whimsical catchphrase, "Princesses, please xx", deeply resonated with contemporary youth, not only for its humor but also for the emotional value it offered. This phrase serves as a form of self-deprecating jest and as a means of resistance against the internal struggles they face.Much of recent Chinese internet slang, including terms like tangping, or "lying flat", and foxi, or "Buddha-like", reflects the discouraging attitude of young people who tend to stand idle or remain indifferent when facing challenges. However, "princess literature" introduces an intriguing twist as young individuals choose a positive perspective when confronting various pressures in their lives.Hong Kong pop diva Karen Mok staged Karen: Reign of MOKnificence, a pop-up exhibit at UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing on Oct 12, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of her debut in showbiz.Featuring photography, video, music and installations, the show, curated by UCCA Lab, sheds light on Mok’s illustrious career; her concern for animal rights and ecological protection; and the star’s reflection on consumerism, ageism and gender issues.A two-time winner of Best Female Mandarin Singer at Taiwan’s Golden Melody Awards, Mok has released more than 30 music albums.

We are confident to say that Chinese films have now become more attractive to mainstream audiences," he said.China's film industry had undergone three difficult years due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The classic text denotes that chun (spring), is originally a verb that embodies the meaning of "sprout".The explanatory notes conjure up a lively annotation of the word: The grass feels the call of the sun, vibrates in response to the time, pushes the earth away, and starts to grow.Lichun falls on Saturday this year, and was the namesake Spring Festival in ancient times. The first day of the Lunar New Year was called "yuanri (the starting day)", or "New Year's Day". After China adopted the Gregorian calendar in the early 1900s, the term "New Year's Day" was assigned to Jan 1, and "Spring Festival" was given to the first day of the Lunar New Year.Despite being robbed of the grand Spring Festival title, lichun, a product of an ancient farming civilization, takes on an extremely important role in the foundation of China's traditional culture.The first solar term has an intimidatingly long, swirling list of confusing nicknames: yingchun (greeting spring), songchun (sending spring), dachun (beating spring), yaochun (biting spring), tachun (outing in spring) and taochun (begging for spring). The different verbs in front of the word chun all reveal the joy and eagerness for the arrival of spring."I have never seen a solar term with so many descriptions as lichun. It is almost like a chorus of spring symphony," says folklore expert You Guoqing.With a stellar cast team up of Hong Kong giant Tony Leung and heartthrob Wang Yibo, the upcoming espionage thriller Hidden Blade has topped the presale box office charts during Spring Festival, the most lucrative period for domestic film industry within recent years.Currently followed by iconic director Zhang Yimou's Full River Red and the sci-fi epic The Wandering Earth II, Hidden Blade, which will open domestically on Jan 22, has raked in around 68 million yuan ($10.02 million) from the presale tickets, according to the live tracker Beacon.The film held a promotional event in a downtown Beijing cinema on Tuesday, gathering all the major cast stars, with some attending via online video talks.Interweaving suspense, the tale centers on a group of underground workers in Shanghai who risked their lives to send intelligence and defend the motherland during the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1931-45).Director Cheng Er revealed that the movie's script has been revised many times, even during shooting, and thus interestingly gave him the inspiration to create a new character, played by actor Huang Lei.Cheng also revealed that most of the details in the movie, varying from a tie to the dishes set on a dinner table, could be important clues that will reveal the authentic identities of all the "mysterious and complex" roles in the movie.Athleisure brand lululemon announced Zhou Guanyu, China's first-ever Formula 1 driver, as the brand’s newest ambassador on Wednesday in Shanghai.Zhou first got behind the wheel at the age of 8 and was already pursuing a professional career in racing by the time he was 15.

I have been asked numerous times already but I always felt that it was not the right time for me to sit down and give thanks for my life and also I did not think my life was so exciting anyway," says Kan.However, her publisher thought otherwise, telling her that since she lived through interesting times in China, and was both witness and participant, she should write the book as a historical record."All the things I have done — my successes and my failures — can be a good example to young people in particular. I think that's the main reason why I wrote the book," says Kan, adding that the COVID-19 lockdown gave her the unexpected opportunity to do some thinking about her life.In the book, Kan included a lot of pictures taken from her early life. By scanning a QR code, readers are also able to see video clips from the period. "I am a television person, so I thought these videos were a great way to connect with my readers," she says.When writing an autobiography, the biggest challenges are not only how to present one's life, but also remembering it in the first place. To help with reconstructing her story, Kan asked the many friends and colleagues she made over the years to write down their memories of her from earlier times. So besides featuring Kan's own words, the new book is also filled with those of her friends, which gave Kan new insight into herself."My assistant Stephanie wrote about my marriage. I was getting a divorce. She mentioned that I was crying every day, which I did not remember, and she said that I was frantic because we were running out of cash for the company. My housekeeper reminded me that before the launch of one of my events she found that I had fainted in the bathroom. I was so exhausted that I was getting sick. They know more about me than myself," Kan says.The fourth Hainan Island International Film Festival opened Sunday in Sanya, a resort city in South China's Hainan province.This year's film festival features 3,761 films from 116 countries and regions for the Golden Coconut Awards, with over 80 percent of the films from overseas, said the organizing committee.Eighty to 100 films are expected to be screened during the festival scheduled from Dec 18 to Dec 25, and nine forums will also take place.Zhang Jun, secretary-general of the event organizing committee, said the festival is committed to strengthening international film cultural exchanges and cooperation, promoting the development of the film industry, and fostering the prosperity of film creation.A total of 11 feature films, eight documentaries, and ten short films were nominated to compete for the various categories under Golden Coconut Awards this year, Zhang added.First held in 2018, the film festival is jointly hosted by the China Media Group and the Hainan provincial government.

The town assumes that she kills the young man even before they have evidence about what really happens. They look at her as the outsider. All of those things make me feel it would bring a lot of emotion to the audience," said Gabler.The tale is set in North Carolina between the 1950s and 1960s, but the movie was shot in Louisiana for its natural landscapes, scattered with swamps and marshes, that matches the depictions in the novel more.The film, which had a comparatively small cast and wasn't affected by the pandemic, was unfortunately caught in some big storms with one even forcing them to suspend filming for one day, Gabler said.On a sand-swept road in a war-torn Western Asian country, a white jeep with a medical sign whizzes past.

Deer Squad, a children's animation presented by iQIYI in cooperation with Nickelodeon, was aired on Nickelodeon International in August 2020. Foreign movie and TV studios also choose to buy remake rights for some popular domestic dramas, in addition to pre-purchasing exclusive overseas distribution rights.At the same time, Chinese companies have been exploring new channels for movies and TV series to reach global audiences through the internet.For instance, StarTimes has established subsidiaries in more than 30 African countries, including Rwanda, Nigeria, and Kenya, and has begun digital TV and online streaming operation in most of them. And in July 2020, iQIYI designated its Beijing office and the Singapore office as the duo-headquarters for iQIYI's global operations."The increasing number of Chinese movies and TV series going overseas reflects the improvement of China's overall national strength, cultural soft power and cultural influence," said Rao Shuguang, president of the China Film Critics Association."Audiences not only see kung fu but also a modern China and its development," said Coulibaly.Two concerts by pop icon Jay Chou were re-screened through online platforms under Tencent Music Entertainment Group, including QQ Music, Kugou and WeChat, attracting over 70 million viewers in total.Screened during the weekend from May 20 to 21, the concerts, taken from Chou's 2012 Ferris Wheel tour and 2019 Strongest on the Surface tour, won applause from nostalgic fans, especially amid the coronavirus pandemic when clubs, bars and outdoor music festivals are forced to close.Chou has been enjoying a large fan base in Asia ever since he released his debut album Jay in 2000.

They deal with many troubles during the journey.Directed by Li Junlin, a graduate from Beijing Film Academy, it shows the youngsters' cleverness and kindness as they deal with adults from different backgrounds.Li says that he hopes the film can draw the public's attention to the spiritual world of young ones and inspire them to care more about left-behind children.A ceremony was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on the morning of April 8 to honor those who have made outstanding contributions to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics.President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, delivered a speech.Xi said that a great cause nurtures a great spirit, and a great spirit promotes a great cause.

Entrusted by professor Albus Dumbledore, he establishes a team to bring together some brave wizards, witches and his friend Jacob Kowalski, a baker, to fight against the powerful dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald.The film held a premiere in Beijing, releasing a recorded video of Jude Law and Mads Mikkelsen, and launching a virtual live talk with stars Eddie Redmayne, Jessica Williams and Dan Fogler.Aside from the stellar cast, the magic creatures are widely deemed as another draw to provide audience a visual feast.With the movie set in six countries from three continents, an investigation team was sent to Guilin in Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, selecting two iconic attractions — Detian Waterfall and Lijiang River — as the inspiration for one of the movie’s pivotal settings, where Newt Scamander discovers Qilin, a Chinese mythological creature, which is believed as an auspicious sign in Chinese legends.Phoenix, a mythological creature which was once widely used by royal families to symbolize the noble hostesses in the palace, is also a "fantastic beast", which is depicted to have a subtle connection with a young wizard struggling with his pains caused by a traumatic childhood.Although only 43 percent of all domestic cinemas are open due to pandemic situation, the new movie has grossed more than 11 million yuan ($1.72 million), propelling it to be the latest highest-grosser on the country’s box office charts.On the campus of the Zhenlong Primary School in Guangde, a county-level city in Anhui province, there is an enclosure that has a stable for two ponies and some cages for rabbits.During a break between classes, some students volunteer to care for the animals."Personally speaking, I don't like hairy animals, but the kids love them," says Hong Liu, 36, the private school's principal.When she takes a stroll on the campus, many students approach her and greet her without any hesitation or fear. In fact, while some address her as "Teacher Hong" in Chinese, others prefer to say "Hi Apple" in English."I know Apple sounds silly, but it is an easy name for the students to remember," says Hong, who began teaching English at the school in 2007 and became the principal in 2018.Just then, some students, among them Hong's daughter, rushed past her to the sports ground for their kung fu class.The school was founded in 1999 on the premises of an abandoned factory. It started as a martial arts school, with just seven students at first.It transformed into a regular primary school and moved to its current location in 2004. It now has more than 1,000 students.At the school's entrance is a famous quote by Chairman Mao Zedong: "Civilizing one's spirit and savaging one's body"."We still make use of the martial arts tradition to improve students' physique," says Hong.Governed by the province's Xuancheng city, Guangde has many rural areas. However, in the eyes of the principal, Zhenlong is just a small school. "But a small school can also do big things, right?" says Hong.She says proudly that the school focuses on imparting four major lessons-filial piety, martial arts, English and equestrian sports. "Many of the students are from rural areas, some of whom are the so-called left-behind children, meaning children who are left behind when their parents migrate to big cities for work," says Hong.These children may lack confidence and a competitive spirit to do well in exams, like in the national college entrance exam.Throughout her career, Hong has always wanted to help such children.In 2017, when she became the school's deputy principal, she established a non-profit English-speaking corner in the school, which is free and open to all teachers and students in Guangde.Until the pandemic struck, Hong used to organize face-to-face communication activities every two weeks, giving the participants an opportunity to speak up and become more confident.In a rural area of Guangde, the school runs an equestrian training center, which has readied two horse riders for the China Youth Equestrian Team.The walls of the school's buildings are decorated with many sentences from Chinese classics promoting filial piety.An important part of Chinese tradition, filial piety involves codes of conduct guiding people on how to behave with their older family members. Hong says its essence can help students better understand and respect their parents and receive the family's affection, which is crucial for a child's development.The caped crusader swoops into the Chinese market to give domestic theaters a welcome boost amid ongoing challenges caused by the pandemic, Xu Fan reports.Amid the country's ongoing COVID-19 resurgence, more than half of China's cinemas have been closed since last week. But in its latest cinematic reboot, Batman, one of the most iconic American comic book heroes, has found a way to captivate Chinese audiences.As of Thursday, the movie, which was released domestically on March 18, had grossed around 120 million yuan ($18.9 million), usurping Tom Holland's adventure epic Uncharted to grab the top spot in the country's box-office rankings in its opening week.Currently earning a score of 7.6 points out of 10 on the review-aggregation site Douban, The Batman, aside from being a dark avenger, has become a sort of "rescuer", giving a boost－albeit not as big as industry insiders had hoped－to a sluggish market that is struggling from a shortage of blockbusters and the effects of regional theater closures due to the pandemic.Two years after the war epic Midway, Roland Emmerich, hailed as the "king of disaster movies", has returned to Chinese cinemas with his latest directorial effort, Moonfall, to set the Earth on the brink of being destroyed again.From its opening day on March 23, the sci-fi movie starring Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson has knocked Robert Pattinson-led The Batman out of the top of China's box office charts, becoming the latest highest grosser.Amid the current harsh environment, with less than half of the country's cinemas still operating — the others have been closed due to the pandemic — the movie has so far grossed around 64 million yuan ($10.04 million), according to the movie information live tracker Beacon.For fans of Emmerich, known in China from his early blockbusters in such movies as Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow, the new movie feels somewhat like a familiar formula.Fictionalizing that the moon is knocked off its orbit by a mysterious force, the story follows two former astronauts to join hands with a discredited genius conspiracy theorist to embark on an unlikely mission to rescue Earth.Throughout its 130-minute running time, the film features a lot of visual-effects shots, varying from massive floods and tsunamis caused by the change in the moon's gravity and civil unrest, to the space spectacle.With Chinese Canadian singer and actress Kelly Yu playing an international student, a supporting character, the film has several lines spoken in Chinese, a somewhat standardized practice for Hollywood blockbusters casting Chinese actors in recent years.Huayi Brothers, one of China's major privately owned studios, is on board with the movie as its Chinese distributor and one executive producer, according to the American entertainment magazine Variety.As one of the most popular TV dramas this month, The Oath of Love — a romance starring idols Yang Zi and Xiao Zhan — has seized widespread attention online since it started its run on Hunan Satellite and the streaming site Tencent Video on March 15.Adapted from the novel of the same name by Bolin Shijiang, the series follows Lin Zhixiao (Yang), a third-year college student majoring in music, as she stumbles upon Gu Wei (Xiao), a promising young gastroenterologist. After experiencing a string of coincidences, Lin discovers Gu is the attending physician for her father, who has been diagnosed with stomach cancer. In the torturous days spent helping her father fight the disease, Lin develops romantic feelings for the young doctor, who reciprocates in kind.In the beginning, the protagonist plans to enjoy a joyful reunion with her friend at a bar, but the gathering is soon upended by her father, a demanding high-school teacher.According to the producers, the series examines the confusion and stress felt by most young people in modern society, as well as raise public awareness about a pattern of parenting.Interweaving romantic scenarios with a reflection of typical Chinese parents — most of the time criticized as overly tough, strict and disciplinarian, the drama aims to resonate with young audiences as depicting their pressures and yearnings in the story.Currently, the drama has obtained 8.3 points out of 10 on the fan-driven Asian content-specialized review site MyDramaList. It is also available overseas.As the latest cinematic retelling of one of DC Comics' most iconic characters, The Batman — starring Robert Pattinson in the title role — opened across domestic theaters, including over 750 IMAX cinemas, on March 18.Despite the COVID-19 resurgence in China, the film grossed nearly 14 million yuan ($2.2 million) on its opening day, overtaking Tom Holland's Uncharted to top the country's box office charts.A virtual premiere gathering director Matt Reeves and three actors, including Pattinson, was held in a downtown cinema in Beijing on March 16.Reeves said the new film, set in the second year since Bruce Wayne became the Batman, shows a fragile side of the superhero as he struggles with his own pains and confusion while facing off evils in the fictional Gotham City.The movie has quickly accumulated a slew of positive feedbacks, exemplified by its score of 7.8 points out of 10 on Douban, one of the country's most popular review-aggregation sites.The 2022 Winter Games help host city create more opportunities for its disabled residents in work and play, Xing Wen reports in Zhangjiakou, Hebei.An array of stuffed chipmunks, snowflake-shaped handmade soaps, embroidered ornaments and other cultural and creative products populate the shelves of Chen Suqin's workshop.Next to the shelves are some physically impaired men and women who are occupied in packing the stuffed toys into boxes.Chen, the workshop's founder, is a 58-year-old local woman with visual handicap.She used to run a studio which produced and sold handmade shoe pads, embroidered slippers and straw-braided coasters in Chongli district of Zhangjiakou, Hebei province.Since 2015, when Beijing won its bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, Zhangjiakou, as a co-host city, has attracted a growing number of tourists, who flock to its ski resorts and historical sites."The tourists who came to my studio told me that they wanted to buy handicrafts with local cultural characteristics," she recalls. "That inspired me to gather a group of people with disabilities and establish a workshop where they could make cultural and creative products based on the uniqueness of Chongli."In April 2018, Chongli district released its mascot named Chong Chong, which is inspired by the chipmunk-a vibrant, nimble member of the squirrel family.Supported by Chongli district's disabled persons' federation, Chen's workshop won the chance to produce plush toys of the new mascot. More than 40 local people with disabilities make up the workforce, and sew the outer fabrics, fill the toys with cotton and other stuffing materials, and then package them."As some of the Winter Games venues clustered in Chongli, the district drew global attention. The sales of the chipmunk mascot have been rapidly rising in recent weeks," says Chen.Uncharted, a forthcoming blockbuster starring Hollywood star Tom Holland, who has a huge fan base in China for his incarnation of Spider-Man, is scheduled to open across domestic theaters, including over 750 IMAX cinemas, on March 14.As the first movie adapted from PlayStation's popular video game series of the same name, the adventure epic follows a street-smart thief alongside a seasoned treasure hunter to recover a fortune lost by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan around five centuries ago.A premiere jointly held by Sony Pictures, IMAX and PlayStation was held in a downtown Beijing cinema on Thursday night, bringing together a lot of fans.According to the event's presenters, Holland got interested in playing the game series when he was shooting Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2016, which made him excited when he was invited to be cast in Uncharted.During a promotional video tailored for the Chinese market, Holland jokingly said he should tell his mother that spending all his spare time on video games was not "in vain".A visual feast studded with arresting scenes set from sky to sea, the movie, which opened in the United States on Feb 18, had secured the top seat atop the global box office charts consecutively for two weeks before The Batman overtook it earlier this month.Review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes has seen the movie's popcorn index given by audiences currently reach 90 percent, signaling its popularity accumulated by the stardom and visual effect.Veteran DJ recalls his experience of playing music at the 2022 Winter Games, Chen Nan reports.When Su Yiming, 17, won a silver medal for snowboard slopestyle on Feb 7, during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, with his stellar performance of a triple cork 1800, he soared into the sky over the Genting Snow Park in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, to the hearty Chinese song Flying Higher.When well-known athlete Gu Ailing was enjoying jiucai hezi (pan-fried dumplings stuffed with chives) while she waited for her score in the women's freeski slopestyle qualifying round at the same venue on Feb 14, she was shown on camera as the Chinese song Your Smile Is So Beautiful played in the background.The man who played the songs is Li Honglei, one of the 30 DJs working at the Winter Games. Li was in charge of music for two courses-halfpipe and slopestyle-held at the venue."It's not like being a DJ to make people dance. It's totally different from playing music in a nightclub. It's more like you're there to create a vibe, an atmosphere and a musical experience for the athletes and everybody else, both for the spectators at the events and those watching on TV at home," Li says.A week before the 2022 Winter Games, Li, who lives and works in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, arrived in Beijing to prepare. He got up at 6 am and worked at the venue till midnight.During the Games, he played up to 5,000 songs, which were selected from more than 16,000 songs in different languages.Sometimes that meant choosing songs to ramp up or relax the competitive tension or to cheer up athletes who failed, or to build up an atmosphere when some important moments were about to take place, such as the award ceremonies and the appearance of the mascot Bing Dwen Dwen."The right music was as important as the Games. The second the music was heard, the atmosphere was bursting with energy to the songs," says the 38-year-old DJ.Like thousands of people working behind the scenes at the Games, DJs did jobs that are often invisible yet important. Li says he felt happy about sharing great moments in sports with people by contributing with music.With strong word-of-mouth percolating online, We Made a Beautiful Bouquet saw its box office surpass director Shunji Iwai's Love Letter as the highest-grossing Japanese live-action romance on the Chinese mainland on Tuesday, according to the movie information tracker Beacon.As the champion of all imported romance titles released on the Chinese mainland this year, We Made a Beautiful Bouquet has so far grossed 66.5 million yuan ($10.5 million) since it opened domestically on Feb 22.Directed by Nobuhiro Doi, the movie stars Masaki Suda and Kasumi Arimura in a bittersweet love story between two young people who fall for each other after discovering they share a lot in common. However, as time goes on, the stress from life and work causes cracks in their relationship, casting a shadow on the two lovers' four-year romance.Currently, the film has obtained 8.4 points out of 10 on the popular review site Douban, with a lot of netizens saying the movie is realistic, detailed and reminds most youngsters of their shift from college life to stressful workplaces.A Lifelong Journey, an epic drama chronicling China's unprecedented transformation in over half a century, has earned widespread applause, shattering records and becoming the most-watched TV series on State broadcaster China Media Group in the past five years, according to producers during a recent symposium held in Beijing.The TV series, consisting of 58 episodes, is adapted from renowned writer Liang Xiaosheng's novel of the same name which won the 10th Mao Dun Literature Prize, one of the country's top honors for local writers.Starting in late 1960s, the story follows the ups and downs of three siblings in a working-class family in northeastern China, striking a chord with viewers for its details vividly bringing them back to old times.Interestingly, Liang, regarded as a representative writer of the "educated youth literature" genre, revealed he was originally unwilling to sell the adaptation copyright as he believed it would be difficult to bring the story to life on TV.However, the turning point emerged after Cheng Wu, vice-president of Tencent and CEO of its subsidiary China Literature, urged producers to convince director Li Lu, a veteran known for the anti-corruption-themed hitIn the Name of the People, to helm the project.Liang has also made his onscreen debut as a presiding judge in one episode featuring a trial that will change the fate of the protagonist.Liang also praised the cast, which features native actors from northeastern China, as instilling a localized and distinctive flavor to the TV series, which is hard to be rendered merely through literary depictions in a novel.Li, director and chief producer, said the novel has laid a solid foundation for the adaptation, with its successful building of a group of convincing and relatable characters.First published in December 2017, the novel — which sold its adaptation copyright to Tencent Pictures in November 2018 before it took the Mao Dun award the following year — shows a wide range of Chinese people from different walks of life, from constructors to start-up founders, to examine the huge influence brought by China's societal changes.Tie Ning, chairwoman of the China Writers' Association, said the overwhelming popularity of A Lifelong Journey exemplifies the "intimate bond" between literature and television."While taking a retrospective look at history, we could see the mutual influence of literature, film and television to boost and inspire each other, which has shaped a strong bond between writers and filmmakers," she added.Cheng, a vice-president of Tencent who attended the symposium remotely, said an appealing TV program or film should take a quality literature work as its "starting point".With popular TV series or movies, the stories that have inspired such screen works will also benefit and see their influence grow even further, thus making it possible to form a franchise, he added.Spending Valentine's Day with the one you love to watch a romance blockbuster sounds like a sweet idea. However, it can also create a difficult choice.Last week, Valentines' Day – also deemed the first box office season following the fiercely contested Spring Festival holiday – grossed 527 million yuan ($83.2 million), propelled by three new romances according to movie information tracker Beacon.Ten Years of Loving You, adapted from a popular online novel with the same title, sat on the top of the country's box office charts for romance movies on Valentine's Day, followed by the fantasy film 0.1% World. The third-highest romance is Don't Forget I Love You, marking the third cooperation between actress Gulnazar and actor Jasper Liu.Valentine's Day became a prime box-office season and draw for new films roughly 10 years ago, with the blockbuster Beijing Love Story ushering in the trend.Over the past decade, nearly 30 new movies have been released particularly for Valentine's Day, but most have received mixed reviews, according to domestic media reports.Despite grossing a sizable amount of box office, the three new movies released on this year's Valentine's Day have also received mixed reviews, making a lot of theatergoers yearn for more quality works in the post-Spring Festival period, usually a relatively bleak period for big-budget movies.With nine new movies opening this week, two imported romance films, We Made a Beautiful Bouquet from Japan and A Rainy Day in New York from the United States, are estimated to attract audiences interested in the genre of romance, as both have accumulated word of mouth praise online, some industry analysts said.A costume drama that tells the story of a young woman who devotes herself to carrying on traditional Chinese cuisine and works her way up to become a head chef in the imperial palace will be released on Tuesday.Starring actor Xu Kai and actresses Wu Jinyan and Wang Churan, the 40-episode drama, titled Royal Feast, also tells a romantic love story between the Emperor Zhu Zhanji of Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and the female protagonistThe drama aims to promote traditional Chinese food as a gateway into Chinese culture.

Ltd, revealed the crew traveled to multiple cities to shoot the series over five months, with the last scene filmed in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region in November 2020.Director Zhang Li, known for hits such as the historical drama Ming Dynasty in 1566, said his new works explore the struggle between market competition and ethical standards in an internet economy-driven society.With the drama touching on the fresh concept of the internet of things, Zhang added they hope the drama could make audiences think more about ethics in the digital world.Yin Hong, vice-chairman of the China Literature and Art Critics Association, said the show has expanded the scope of domestic office dramas with a setting in line with the rapidly transforming era, making it a window into modern society.Technology enables a futuristic interpretation of traditional Chinese elements, such as the solar terms, to kick off showpiece event, Xu Haoyu reports.The opening ceremony of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics was widely praised for its creativity and innovation. Through teamwork, guided by famed filmmaker Zhang Yimou, many directors and choreographers created the show together.Tao Wenting, a lecturer from the College of Military Culture at the PLA National Defense University, was a member of the creative team that directed the first several sections of the ceremony.The ceremony was held on the day of li chun, the beginning of spring, the first of 24 Chinese solar terms. And the namesake opening show presented the charm of the season with 10-meter tall luminous poles simulating green grass and white dandelions.Tao claimed that in order to present this show perfectly, in addition to the precise selection of materials, supported by projection onto the floor of the stadium, the biggest difficulty was actually the simulation of the two plants.A team from Beijing Institute of Technology offered a helping hand, creating a detailed manual with markings on the longitude and latitude, and from various angles, to make rehearsals more efficient and the overall visual effect more vivid.A total of 393 students were selected from two martial arts schools in Laizhou and Yuncheng, Shandong province. They trained for about four months to practice holding and waving the poles in the right place, at the right time and at the right angle.Tao also directed the raising of the national flag, which involved 176 people, including representatives of China's 56 ethnic groups, people from different industries in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region-from an astronaut to a deliveryman-model workers and outstanding members of the Communist Party of China.As a military officer herself, Tao says she felt deeply moved."They are all the backbone of the country and they make something great from ordinary life. I think their feelings for the flag are deep and heartfelt, and they can express their love for the nation on behalf of the people," says Tao.Modern artistic installation techniques and technology were also highlighted at the ceremony.At one point, a cube of "water "appeared on the stage thanks to augmented reality and the application of an artificial intelligence image processing algorithm.Urban developers are seeking to transform public areas through a people-centric approach, Xing Yi reports in Shanghai.Despite living in a city that has one of the highest population densities in the world-more than 23,000 people live per square kilometer in the downtown area-the residents of Shanghai have seen public spaces mushroom over the past five years as the campaign for micro-renewal of urban spaces continues to gather pace.But with few open spaces, developers have had to get creative with their approach. For instance, public amenities such as sports equipment, activity rooms, benches and jogging trails have been introduced in formerly underutilized and sealed off spaces like beneath overpasses, deserted warehouses and basements of old housing communities.The title of a design contest on urban renewal aptly describes these pockets of development in the city as "a metamorphosis at your doorstep".Organized by the Shanghai Commission of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the recent contest saw dozens of participants submit proposals for renewal plans for 101 locations in the city.Zhu Weikun, a master's student of urban planning at Tongji University, is part of a team that saw its proposal accepted. Sixty-four teams had their plans approved for implementation."I was thrilled when the organizer told us that we will get a chance to implement our design and turn the blueprint into reality," says Zhu, who participated in the contest in November with her classmates.Ancient wisdom divided the year into 24 Solar Terms and they still remain relevant today, Yang Yang reports.The opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics on Feb 4 presented a visual feast, displaying Chinese people's understanding of the Games and the relationship between humans and nature. On taking a closer look, one may find many ingenious designs-the countdown included.On the Chinese traditional calendar, Feb 4, 2022 happened to be the Start of Spring, the first of the Twenty-four Solar Terms. Director Zhang Yimou used them to "greet the arrival of spring". The countdown to the ceremony started from Rain Water, the second solar term (which falls on Saturday) and ended with the Start of Spring. After a desolate winter, the world comes back to life and enters another life circle.Drawing its curtain on the day of the Start of Spring, the Games auspiciously foretold a vibrant spring for not only athletes but the entire human race.The solar terms, having been developed throughout Chinese history since about 3,000 years ago and listed on the UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2016, are so important to Chinese people that it appears both creative and natural for Zhang to employ and showcase them as a unique part of Chinese civilization to the world.It was noon time on Sunday, two days after the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, which was directed by Zhang Yimou and held at the National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest.The excitement of choreographer Wang Yuanyuan was still clear, even showing in her voice.As one of the creative teams for the opening ceremony, Wang directed a 5-minute dance piece, titled Forming a Snowflake. She says she can finally sleep well."We were very nervous and concerned. We were not sure whether the audience would love the dance piece and we were also worried about making mistakes during the show," says Wang, during a telephone interview with China Daily from her home in Beijing. "After it was over, we got many messages of appreciation, which finally made us feel relaxed."Viewers shared their excitement and praised the dance on Chinese social media, saying it was "romantic" and "beautiful".When the 2022 Winter Olympics kicked off on Friday night in Beijing, Komani Mayentao, an international student at the Beijing International Studies University, strutted onto the glittering stage of the National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, together with other foreign students and professors.Since being selected last year as a performer at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, Mayentao, a 24-year-old student from Mali, has visited the Bird's Nest for rehearsals no matter rain or shine."I'm very lucky to participate in the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. I really value this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," says Mayentao, whose Chinese name is Zhang Yisheng.The name was given by his Chinese teacher at the Confucius Institute in Mali. Yi means clothing in Chinese and sheng is a traditional Chinese musical instrument.Enthralled by Chinese culture and kung fu since childhood, Mayentao took part in Chinese Bridge, a worldwide Chinese proficiency competition for overseas students, and won a scholarship to study in China when he was 18 years old.After getting a bachelor's degree at the BISU, the young man from West Africa decided to pursue a Master of Business Administration program, also at the university in Beijing."It's definitely an honor of life for me to take part in the Beijing Winter Olympic Games," he says, citing the rapid development of Beijing since he arrived in the Chinese capital six years ago.At an event held on Dec 5, for the application of international volunteers to the Games, the Malian student said, "I'm looking forward to participating as an overseas volunteer."Thirteen years ago, Beijing successfully hosted the 2008 Olympic Games with impressive multicultural interactions. Beijing will surely deliver an even more splendid sports event for the world in 2022," he said.Mayentao, who speaks Chinese fluently, was picked as a performer for the opening ceremony. "Although I did not get to serve as a volunteer, it's a great honor to be able to perform at the opening ceremony. I realized my Winter Olympic dream in Beijing," he says.Mayentao made friends with performers from other countries when they rehearsed at the National Stadium. Eight international students and lecturers from the BISU, including Mayentao, who came from the Central African Republic, Suriname, South Sudan, Mali, Venezuela and Romania, performed at the spectacular opening ceremony.As the Year of the Tiger approaches, a slew of tentpole releases are preparing to contend for the Spring Festival holiday, one of the most fiercely coveted box office seasons.Currently seeing its presale box office surpassing 130 million yuan ($20.4 million), The Battle at Lake Changjin II - sequel to China's highest-grossing film of all time - has far surpassed its rivals for the country's presale ticket receipts during the Chinese Lunar New Year.Nice View, about a young man's life in Shenzhen, is sitting in second place with its presale take at around 40 million yuan, followed by the comedy Only Fools Rush In in the third slot with 37 million.The first Battle at Lake Changjin film was jointly directed by Chen Kaige, Tsui Hark and Dante Lam, but the sequel - with most scenes shot by Hark - credits Hark as the sole helmer. Chen and Lam both serve as executive producers.Retelling a lesser-known yet extremely brutal mission that almost changed history during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-53), the sequel - with the Mandarin title Shuimen Qiao (Water Gate Bridge) - recounts how Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers endured the bitter cold and sacrifices to demolish the titular bridge near the Funchilin Pass - then a very important route - to cut US force' withdrawal to the 38th Parallel.All the major actors who played Chinese soldiers of the heroic 7th and 9th companies will reprise their roles the new movie, with actors Wu Jing and Yi Yangqianxi returning as a pair of siblings, respectively a veteran and novice.A short musical to promote the official slogan of Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games has attracted 100 stars, including kung fu giant Jackie Chan and iconic actor Andy Lau, and will be released on Feb 1, the first day of the Spring Festival, according to the producers.Named after the Olympic slogan, Together for a Shared Future, the film, with its lyrics written by Wang Pingjiu and music composed by Chang Shilei, will also be broadcast on China Movie Channel, the sole State-level channel specializing in broadcasting films.The stellar singers' cast encompasses a lot of A-list stars, such as Chen Kun, Huang Bo, Li Bingbing, Zhou Xun and Yao Chen, who boast some of China's highest-grossing blockbusters to their names.Within a short span of around 20 days, the major producers had traveled to multiple cities and regions, including Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macao, to reach those stars, who were then working for their new projects or living there.Fu Jie, the movie's chief director, said the short film is 10 minutes longer than the original song, also titled Together for a Shared Future, which was first released in September last year. Two months later, a new version sung by pop idol Yi Yangqianxi was released.With two editions - respectively wrapped up the final procedures in Beijing and Hong Kong - the song's latest remake is aimed to showcase China's top showbiz talent reunite to appeal every people to cheer up for the upcoming great sporting events, according to the producers.Winning acclaim for portraying a couple in the hit tv series Nothing but Thirty, actor Yang Le and actress Mao Xiaotong have been reunited on the silver screen with their latest acting effort Lost and Found.Starting from New Year's Eve in 2018, the film follows a hotel manager played by Mao who encounters Yang's startup founder, and the two quickly fall for each other. But as time goes on, their understanding of love and life regularly diverges, pulling the two young people into quarrels and conflicts.So far earning 8.5 points out of ten and 8.9 points on the two major ticketing platforms Taopiaopiao and Maoyan, the movie has obtained positive feedback, with most saying the film vividly showcases the nuances of relationships, reminding them of their own love stories.The movie opened on Dec 31 and has at present grossed more than 120 million yuan ($18.8 million).Chinese costume drama Song of Glory recently won the best telenovela award at the 49th International Emmy Awards, becoming the country's first drama series to win the honor.The story is set in the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-581). It's about how the courageous heroine falls in love with a wise official who cares about the masses' well-being. They work together amid all the hardships to protect their country and people, ushering in a period of peace and prosperity.The drama, starring Chinese actor Qin Hao and actress Li Qin, is produced by Huace Group, a film and television production company based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, which has been actively promoting cultural exchanges among countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. The company has sold high-quality Chinese dramas it produces to more than 180 countries and regions around the globe."It's our mission to produce drama series that enjoy world-wide popularity," said Zhao Yifang, founder and president of the company.A star known for excelling in hilarious comedies, Xu Zheng has recently toned down his trademark style to bring audience a little bit plain yet thought-provoking work, B for Busy.Starring Xu and his fellow Shanghai actors, the film set in Shanghai is all in the city's local dialect, an endeavor that Xu wishes gives the film a special "flavor".The tale recounts Xu-starring painter trying to romance with actress Ma Yili-starring Ms Li, an advertisement employee who raises her daughter alone after filing for divorce from her British husband. But his plan to enjoy a romantic night is disturbed by several unexpected visitors, a troublesome student, his still jealous ex-wife, and a nosy neighbor.More interestingly, Italian actress Sophia Loren - the Hollywood legend whose classic The Cassandra Crossing has captivated many fans in China - is mentioned in the movie many times as a pivotal clue about another fictional "romance".Xu, who also serves as the executive producer, said during the Beijing premiere that the film aims to expand the diversity of movie genres in domestic industry, which is currently dominated by actions-packed tentpoles.Unlike most of Xu's previous films, which travel from China to foreign destinations, B for Busy is set in a much smaller area within a radius of 2 kilometers in western Shanghai, giving audience a delicate perspective to savor the distinctive flavors of the city, observed some critics at the premiere.A genre securing a distinctive seat in Chinese literature landscape over decades, wuxia - or martial arts - has fascinated several generations of fans with its epic creation of building a world dominated by chivalry-spirited swordsmen. Reflecting the genre's charm even in today's digital era, Sword Snow Stride, a 38-episode martial arts series, has quickly racked up millions of clicks since it started to run on the streaming site Tencent Video on Dec 16.The series is adapted from writer Chen Zhenghua's popular novel with the same title, which won the Silver Prize of the first Online Literature Biennial Awards in 2015. Starring actor Zhang Ruoyun in the lead role as Xu Fengnian, the son of Northern Liang King, the tale chronicles how the protagonist grows up from a dandiacal prince to a legendary martial artist and a prestigious general to defend invaders and safeguard the country.Chief producer Yu Wanqin said during a recent event that the New Classics Media - a Beijing-based television and movie production company - purchased the novel's adaption copyright when Cao Huayi, the company's chairman, stumbled upon to read and developed a love of the tale in 2017.The story skillfully interweaves palace schemes, complex personalities and a distinctive depiction of "jianghu" - a typical term in wuxia referring to the world outside the mundane society but obeying the principles established by martial art clans, said Yu, explaining the elements that drew her company to shoot the story.With Song Xiaofei, known for partaking the cinematography work of Wong Kar-wai's The Grandmaster, joining to serve as the director, the series started shooting in July last year, taking around six months to finish due to occasional suspension caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, said Yu.Wang Yichuan, deputy chairman of China Literature and Art Critics Association, said depicting the growing-up of a hero has been a widely-employed technique in many popular wuxia novels in the like of Guo Jing and Xiao Feng, respectively, protagonists in late martial arts novelist Louis Cha's classics The Legend of the Condor Heroes and Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils.But Sword Snow Stride has its special characteristic to write an unlikely "growing-up" - the protagonist starts from a rebellious, wild young man who tries hard to escape from his father's control, but the harsh experience - after he is "exiled" from the king's luxury residence to live with grass-roots people - made him finally understand his responsibility for the country, said Wang.In the rapidly-transforming Chinese movie market, word of mouth comment sometimes plays the pivotal role in deciding the "destiny" of a new film, thus makingI Am What I Am - a forthcoming animated film - half way to be a winner.The Chinese film has accumulated a high score of 8.3 points out of 10 on Douban, one of the country's most popular review aggregators, since it started multiple rounds of test screenings earlier this month.Besides, the film, which will open across domestic theaters -including all the over 720 IMAX cinemas - on Friday, has also obtained 9.4 points out of 10 on the ticketing platform Maoyan, the highest of all domestic animated films released this year.Under the helm of director Sun Haipeng, the film has Zhang Miao - known for several of China's top blockbusters such as Wolf Warrior 2 and The Wandering Earth - as its executive producer.Unfolding from a visually arresting scene to brief the history of lion dancing, a centuries-old folk art mostly to celebrate Lunar New Year, the tale fictionalizes an underdog teenager joins hands with two of his intimate friends, overcoming a lot of odds to pursue their dream - becoming the best lion dance performers.Currently, the film has grossed around 18 million yuan ($2.83 million) at the ticket bookings for its official opening day, propelling it to top the country's presale box office charts on Dec 17, according to the live tracker Beacon.With guochao - or the rising tide of China's homegrown brands- becoming a buzzword in the fashion circle, it has also inspired some film and TV series creators. A new project exemplifying this trend is Rising With The Wind - a metropolis-set workplace series - which started shooting in Shanghai on Dec 7.Adapted from writer Wei Zai's novel with the same title, the tale returns to the taking-off phase of China's e-commerce business, following a young entrepreneur sensitively capturing the new opportunities brought by internet expansion to revitalize a traditional homegrown shoe label.Under the helm of director Zhao Yilong, the series has joined hands of actor Gong Jun, known for this year's martial arts drama Word of Honor, and actress Zhong Chuxi, who shot to fame from director Feng Xiaogang's 2017 blockbuster Youth. Zhong plays the only daughter of the late chairman of a traditional domestic label struggling with a financial crisis while Gong portrays an investor who plans to acquire the label.LOS ANGELES -- Director Zhang Yimou's spy thriller Cliff Walkers is the Chinese mainland's entry for Best International Feature Film at the 94th Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars.Featuring a star-studded cast of China's leading talent, including Zhang Yi, Yu Hewei and Qin Hailu, Cliff Walkers, set in the 1930s in China's northeast during the Japanese invasion, follows four Chinese special agents who return to China to embark on a secret mission after receiving training in the Soviet Union.A total of 93 films from around the world were submitted for the coveted prize, including three Chinese-language films, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Monday.The tally tied the all-time record high from last year in the category, previously known as the Best Foreign-Language Film. Somalia is a first-time entrant this year.An international feature film is defined as a feature-length motion picture (more than 40 minutes) produced outside the United States with a predominantly non-English dialogue track.Zero to Hero, a biopic based on the true story of medal-winning Paralympian So Wa-wai, was submitted in the category by Hong Kong, China.The shortlist of 15 films in the category will be announced on Dec 21, 2021. The 94th Oscars will be held in March next year.The ending of the thrilling drama, The Twelfth Second, aired on the video-sharing platform Mango TV recently.The drama, starring actress Wan Qian and actor Ren Zhong, tells a story about how a policeman named Zhao Yichen tracks down the whereabouts of his wife Hu Jiaying, who disappeared when she was six months pregnant. She leaves behind nothing but an 11-second emergency call. However, the call's lack of key information about her situation makes her rescue unlikely. The truth doesn't come out until nine years later, when Zhao receives an anonymous letter that leads to the hidden criminal gang linked to his wife's disappearance.The story uses a realistic approach to depict how Chinese police deal with cases involving such social issues as human trafficking, domestic violence and school bullying. Meanwhile, the TV drama's production unit actively conducted online activities to instruct people on how to make proper, efficient emergency calls containing useful information that would help police break the case.For instance, Wan and Ren participated in a livestreaming show to interact with grass-roots policemen in charge of receiving emergency calls. They discussed how to give useful information within a short time while facing dangers, attracting more than 32,000 to join the discussion online.When actor Cao Bingkun was shooting a film in 2017, he got a chance to be more involved in the creative process and developed an interest to go behind the camera. Cao's directorial debut, My Son, (with a comma in the title indicating the protagonist's unwritten regret) is scheduled to open across the country on Dec 3.The film stars Cao as the widowed father, a delivery man who is diagnosed with late-stage brain cancer. Struggling with financial burden and an uncertain future, the protagonist endeavors to find an orphanage that will continue to care for his young son after his demise. However, a family secret kept for many years makes the situation complicated."Some filmmakers regard their works as a love letter to pay tribute to the silver screen, but for me this movie is like a letter of apology," said Cao during the film's Beijing premiere on Nov 30.Growing up in an old-school family, Cao recalls having a tough relationship with his father, a man who was shy to express his love for his son. As a way to remember his father, Cao created a movie to articulate the words he should have said years ago.A veteran actor with a career spanning 20 years, Cao revealed how he prepared for the role -- from experiencing the daily life of delivery workers to losing roughly 25 kilograms of weight in one month.The film was nominated for the competition sector of the 13rd Macao International Movie Festival.Scheme in Antiques, an upcoming film adapted from writer Ma Boyong's best-selling novel of the same title that's been referred to as the Chinese equivalent of the Indiana Jones' adventures, is set to open across the Chinese mainland on Dec 3.With a stellar cast led by actors Lei Jiayin, Li Xian, Ge You and actress Xin Zhilei, the movie has raked over 5 million yuan ($785,500) in presales, becoming the country's latest presale box-office champion topping the forthcoming weekend charts.Set in the 1990s, the film unfolds with the return of the lost head of a Buddha statue -- once placed in Empress Wu Zetian's royal temple during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) -- from Japan. A descendant from a prestigious antique business family is required by the Japanese side to carry out the handover, but it pulls him into a complex situation, followed by a series of bizarre and dangerous events.To appear realistic, around 10,000 props were made for an epic scene featuring the protagonists who were on a search of the priceless treasure in a fictional city. The Buddha's head took seven months to complete – using a mix of hand-crafted and 3D printing methods, according to producer Liang Lin. Nearly 30 genuine antiques were also used in the production.Liang also wished the film's appealing storyline will raise awareness about the culture and history of China's antiques among the younger audience. Ma, the novelist who served as the literature consultant for the movie, said the film adaptation is "creative and smartly grasps the original story's core message".Entitled "On the Road", the 2022 Pirelli Calendar showing photographs by Canadian musician Bryan Adams was released on Monday.

There is so much we can accomplish when we work together," says US Congresswoman Judy Chu.Zhang Ping, Chinese consul general in Los Angeles, points out that China's strict COVID-19 prevention and control measures enabled China to reopen cinemas.In 2020, for the first time, China ended the year as the world's biggest movie market with 20.4 billion yuan ($3.1 billion), surpassing North America's $2.2 billion.Although China and the US are facing challenges, Zhang says, from "unprecedented difficult relations", there are still huge opportunities to work together in the future in "a win-win, mutually beneficial way".He says, "Film and television industries play active roles in the cooperation between our two countries."Adam Presser, executive vice-president of WarnerMedia International and head of WarnerMedia China, Australia and New Zealand, advises producers who consider a coproduction to "make sure there is a story to be told that both audiences will enjoy".He points out that the precondition for any coproduction is the willingness of both countries to undertake them and "to find a good partner to openly discuss all these issues as friends".Presser says, "We are planning numerous Chinese-language productions in China."Andre Morgan, an industry trendsetter who has been making films in China since the 1970s, praises the Chinese for showing "a clear path back to financial success" for the global film industry, despite the pandemic that "the US is still struggling with".He contends that it is primarily Netflix, Amazon and Apple who are calling the shots in Hollywood now, with the studios following their lead."It's a change in emphasis in how the American public is consuming content," he says.He sees this as an escalating problem for theater owners. "There will be a shortage of filmed content that can be seen in theaters first, because they will have already shown it on Netflix."But that could present an opportunity for imported Chinese films to step into the void."The opportunity for China to export content has never been better," he adds.Bob Underwood of the Writers Guild of America's Foreign Employment Task Force points out that "not many Americans have been to China, but if they can't spend a month with a Chinese family in China, they can spend two hours with them in a film and find common ground."Richard L. Anderson, Oscar and Emmy Award-winning producer and director, points out that while US audiences are now more willing to read subtitles, a way to lower the barrier to entry for Chinese-language films into the US market might come from dubbing Chinese films and TV shows into English using an exciting new AI graphics program he likes, called Flawless Neural Network, that morphs the actor's lips to match the English words, so they are not frustratingly out of sync."It's important to understand that we are all the same underneath," he says."And the more American audiences see Chinese films, the more comfortable they will be."Hangzhou Weinian, a multi-channel network behind the stardom of vlogger Li Ziqi, said it has never controlled any accounts related to China's most famous YouTuber in a first public response released Nov 1 about a business dispute between both parties.Li, who raked in more than 2.4 million views and 16 million subscribers on YouTube, holds a Guinness World Record for "The most subscribers for a Chinese-language channel on YouTube" as of Aug 21. The vlogger has captured the tranquility of life in rural China and offered viewers around the world a picturesque escape from the urban bustle.To date, three months haves passed since Li's latest update: Firewood, Rice, Oil, Salt, Soy Sauce, Vinegar, and Tea. Prior to that, Li had updated her channel roughly once every month. The 31-year-old has been busy, not working in the fields, but resolving legal issues.On Aug 30, Li posted a photo of herself filing a report at a police station, and wrote a reply under the post: "I have asked lawyers to keep records, this is so scary! Capital indeed has its good tricks!" Her words hinted at a legal dispute between herself and the company that helped catapult her to stardom, Hangzhou Weinian.The reply was later deleted.On Oct 25, Li filed a lawsuit against Hangzhou Weinian through her company Sichuan Ziqi Culture Communication.Li and Hangzhou Weinian joined hands in 2016. Through this partnership, Li unleashed her talents through content creation, and Hangzhou Weinian helped her promote them to the world.The two worked together yet separately, but it seems irreconcilable disagreement arose. In its official statement, Hangzhou Weinian said it has "never interfered, or thought about interfering with any accounts related to Li Ziqi", giving insight into a dispute over what Li publishes in her creations.Tianyancha, an enterprise search engine, shows Hangzhou Weinian owns a 51 percent share of Sichuan Ziqi Culture Communication, while Li has the remaining 49 percent stake. This led to many speculating the dispute arose from Li's minority ownership of her own company.Li herself has refrained from elaborating since Aug 30, but her assistant has voiced her own opinion through her verified Sina Weibo account on several occasions.On Aug 26, Li's assistant said the vlogger had "neglected many real-world problems" while devoting herself to content production, and needed some time to resolve issues. On Sept 13, the assistant said Li was dealing with a problem involving her own company and a third-party company, without providing further details.Yesterday, an hour after Hangzhou Weinian released its statement, Li's assistant denied equity as the source of dispute in a Sina Weibo post."I really don't understand who has been leading the public opinion on an equity dispute? Who? Who dares to take the shares of a company that has not even disclosed its practice contract to investors and shareholders?"There is no point fighting a war of words, we need to fight with a lawsuit!" she added.Although Li has not made any comments on the lawsuit, she did mention she wanted to protect her name and her content during a recent interview she gave to China Central Television."I don't want to give it so-called very high commercial value. I believe it's a double-edged sword, and I just want to protect this name."She also mentioned three things she hoped to do in the near future: do her part in rural revitalization, help pass on intangible cultural heritage and traditional Chinese culture, and guide youth on the right path."When asked 'What do you want to be when you grow up?', I hope our children won't answer 'I want to be an influencer' or 'I want to be a celebrity'. That's not what I hope to see. I hope they can possess the right values, study hard, and truly become a person who is able to grasp every opportunity," Li said.James Bond's latest epic No Time to Die, the 25th installment of the world's longest-running spy franchise, will open across more than 720 IMAX theaters in China on Oct 29.The first 007 movie shot with IMAX film cameras, the advanced cinematography equipment ensures audience can see 26 percent more of the frame than a normal venue.As Daniel Craig's final outing as legendary MI6 agent 007, the new film reveals more about the inner struggles and emotions of Bond after the famous spy turns in his license to kill.

A native of South China's Guangdong province, Zhang felt quite cold one day and opened Liu's closet and saw a red-cover notebook, with the writing, "Work log from the shooting of The Story of Qiu Ju".In 1992, the film, starring Gong as a rural pregnant woman who stubbornly seeks justice, won the Golden Lion, the top award at the Venice International Film Festival, and also earned her the best actress award. The film was helmed by China's top director Zhang Yimou, with Liu playing a major character in it.Concluding with a stunning haul up to 4.39 billion yuan ($680.9 million), the box office for this year's National Day holiday has pulled in its second-highest gross of all time during the same period, according to the live tracker Beacon.The Battle at Lake Changjin, the 176-minute epic about the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-53), dominated the holiday box office charts with an absolute advantage. Raking in 3.45 billion yuan, the war-themed blockbuster landed far ahead of My Country, My Parents, which garnered over 1 billion yuan to sit in the No 2 position.Largely propelled by The Battle at Lake Changjin, which hit eight records for IMAX China including the highest-grossing film during the National Day holiday, IMAX China earned a record-breaking 168 million yuan, up 30 percent from the same period in 2020.But this holiday has seen the polarized performances between big-budget films and comparatively smaller titles. None of the other seven new films released for the holiday surpassed 50 million yuan, putting them well below the 100 million yuan threshold for blockbusters in China.To celebrate the Mid-Autumn and National Day festivals, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese recently launched a project to distribute 10,000 digital movie tickets for free to overseas Chinese.The tickets can be used on Smart Cinema, a mobile cinema app, to watch nine popular Chinese films between Sept 18 and Oct 15.

Du says she is battling a major depressive disorder.Since then, more than 30 young women, some of whom are under the age of 20, have come forward online claiming to have had similar experiences of varying degrees, or to have been lured into having sex, and Du alleges that there have been several "underage victims" unwilling to speak publicly.Usually, it would start by being invited to audition for a part in one of Wu's music videos, or to attend a party with a small gathering of fans.According to New York-based Chinese language media outlet uschinapress.com, California-based attorney, Wang Jing, claims that a former fan of Wu, turning to her, alleges that she had a sexual relationship with the singer when she was under 18, which according to California state law is below the legal age of consent and can be considered statutory rape.The attorney says she's evaluating the details of the claim and encourages other potential victims to come forward.The talent show Call Me by Fire, which brings together 33 veteran entertainers to vie for a spot in a 17-member performance group, premiered on the video-sharing platform Mango TV on Aug 12.The first episode has notched up more than 606 million views on the platform.

However, as he always had a desire to perform singing and dancing onstage, the show has given him an opportunity to test the waters.Hong Kong singer and actor Julian Cheung, 50, has also joined the show."I'm growing older year by year. My physical strength declines with age. I want to give the audience good performances in the show before my strength has waned," he says.With major scenes shot in Guizhou province's Shuanghe Cave, the longest of its kind in Asia, the disaster film Cloudy Mountain is set to open across domestic theaters on Sept 17.Teaming up actors Huang Zhizhong and Zhu Yilong, the film casts them respectively as a father, who is also a former soldier specialized in constructing railways, and son, a geological engineer.Set in a fictional town, the nerve-wracking story follows a series of natural disasters taking place after a severe ground collapse, which pulls the father and several bus passengers into an underground cave.In order to rescue his father and other people, the son enters the cave but the rescue mission becomes more dangerous after weather monitors discover that an upcoming mountain collapse will create an unprecedented catastrophe, threatening the lives of the 160,000 locals in the town.Earlier this year, the crew trekked deep into Shuanghe Cave, which is around as long as 240 kilometers, to take some of the most visually arresting scenes.

Rather, the viewpoint, tone and emotion of the speaker also need to be conveyed. The identity of the speaker and the composition of the audience must also be taken into consideration," she says.A total of 119 foreign language majors at 26 Chinese universities gathered for the final of the Third Multilingual Relay Interpreting Contest hosted by SISU on July 4.Nine languages-Chinese, Arabic, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish and English-were involved in the contest.During the contest, participants interpreted a dialogue from a foreign language video played in real time into Chinese, while their schoolmates interpreted the Chinese into the specialist languages in which they are majoring.Jiang Feng, Party secretary of SISU, says, "This simultaneous interpretation contest is a very meaningful event to help tell China's stories and is in line with China's growing international status."According to experts, an increasing number of large-scale international conferences have been using Chinese as the relay language in simultaneous interpretation, a testimony of the rising influence of the language.Contest sees students recount stories centered on the nation's development to demonstrate their proficiency in English, Zhou Wenting reports in Shanghai.Winners of a contest recounted, in English, the historical narratives related to the Communist Party of China and the country's development, showing off their talent during an award ceremony on July 20.The students employed the English language to describe what they see and feel in their daily life, reflecting how the country has thrived in recent decades under the leadership of the Party, which last month celebrated the centenary of its founding.The contest was organized by the Shanghai Student Moral Education Development Center and Shanghai International Studies University, under the guidance of the Party committee of the Shanghai Education and Health Working Committee and the Shanghai Education Commission.Organizers say the contest was intended to help youths in Shanghai, birthplace of the CPC, draw strength from the fighting spirit of the Party throughout its growth, cultivate a global vision while having full confidence in their own culture, and contribute their vitality and wisdom to national rejuvenation and a better future for mankind."The goal of foreign language education is not merely to cultivate talented people who master the language. On top of that, we aim to cultivate young people with excellent intercultural communication skills and profound knowledge in a certain field. They must also have the capability of shouldering important tasks in the new era," said Jiang Feng, Party secretary of SISU."Ultimately we hope the youngsters can avail of the power of languages to enhance the appeal of their speeches and eventually the discourse power of the country," he said.The first round of the contest kicked off in May, and more than 3,600 students from primary school to university age participated and just dozens of them made it into the final.International group visits the cradle of Chinese revolution, Zhou Wenting reports in Yan'an, Shaanxi.Teenagers took a step into history when they visited Yan'an, the cradle of the Chinese revolution, in Shaanxi province.

We hope the series will help young people born in the 2000s and 1990s to better understand the history of our country," added Liang.With preparations lasting over two years, the upcoming epic film The Battle at Lake Changjin recruited more than 12,000 actors, crew workers and extras, making it one of the largest Chinese films in recent years according to producers who spoke at a recent event in Beijing.The film held a promotional event at the China National Film Museum on Aug 1, the 94th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.Gathering directors Chen Kaige, Tsui Hark and Dante Lam to jointly helm the film, the tale retells the title battle, a turning point for the Chinese People's Volunteers who entered the Korean Peninsula to fight in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-53).Actor Wu Jing and pop idol Yi Yangqianxi respectively play a Chinese soldier and his 19-year-old younger brother who join the Volunteers.Yu Dong, president of Bona Film Group, revealed the script written by Lan Xiaolong is the longest he's ever seen."Lan originally penned over 130,000 characters, which was later condensed to a 60,000-word version. With the three directors leading three teams with a cumulative 7,000 members in the preparation phase, the film is probably the largest in terms of the usage of costumes and props," Yu said.The film is set to open across Chinese theaters, including 710 IMAX cinemas, on Aug 12.China has made progress in creating a wholesome fan culture after special operations against law-breaking and improper acts in the world of entertainment fandom.The country's cyberspace watchdog has removed over 150,000 pieces of harmful information from online platforms and chat groups amid efforts to create a clean internet environment for starstruck web users, said the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission.The commission urged websites and online platforms to disable functions that would induce fans to boost some certain star's popularity in a dishonest manner and to restrict underage fans from irrationally adoring stars.The National Radio and Television Administration also carried out a one-month operation against online variety shows in a bid to curb irrational worship of viewership and money in the fandom world.As director Leste Chen's latest outing, the coming-of-age film Upcoming Summer has grossed nearly 150 million yuan ($23.2 million) during its opening weekend and is currently the second highest-grossing film in China.The film tells a heartwarming, sweet, yet a bit of a sad story about two high-school students, arousing nostalgia of campus life for many viewers online.Chen Chen, played by actress Zhang Zifeng, stumbles upon her mother's affair with a fruit businessman on the eve of the gaokao, or the national college entrance exams. Struggling with her parents' problem, she falls into a swimming pool, suffers a fever and fails to get ideal scores during the important exams.Returning to school to study one more year to again take the exam, Chen is accidently "stuck" in a lie, forcing her to pretend to be the girlfriend of a handsome classmate, who dreams of becoming a professional DJ.The film marks actress Zhang and actor Wu Lei, who plays the classmate, cinematic reunion after their last film, Adoring (2019), in which they starred as a couple of teen lovers.Director Chen, who shot to fame in the 2006 youth film, Eternal Love, said during the Beijing premiere last week that the tale examines adolescent moods."Sometimes you believe you really love someone, but actually you may just love the lifestyle he or she leads. That universal yearning and longing makes up part of youth for most of us," the director added.In the crowded theater where even the aisles were full, there was one empty seat in the center with a bouquet placed on it. The theater in eastern Beijing was the venue of late Hong Kong director Benny Chan's last film Raging Fire's premiere.The film is set to open across Chinese mainland theaters, including more than 710 IMAX cinemas, on July 30.Bringing together kung fu giant Jackie Chan and eight renowned directors as well as major cast members, the film's premiere was held on July 28, with Jackie Chan and director Wong Jing sitting next to the empty seat specially "left" for Chan.An influential figure known for his distinct style in action blockbusters, Benny Chan passed away at 58 due to nasopharyngeal cancer in August.His disease was diagnosed during the shooting of Raging Fire, which teams up actors Donnie Yen and Nicholas Tse to play a police officer and a ruthless criminal, who was once the former's fellow cop and friend.Calling Benny Chan's passing away as a big loss for Hong Kong film industry, Jackie Chan said he once discussed with Benny Chan to shoot sequels ofLegend of Drunken Master (1994), New Police Story (2004), and Rob-B-Hood (2006). "I never imagined that he would leave us before we could shoot these sequels," he said visibly upset.Actor Tse said he cooperated with Benny Chan in seven of his directorial films, with the 1999 action movie Gen-X Cops -- when Tse was 19 years old -- their first movie."I spent most of my acting career with director Benny Chan.

But a new online film gathering a string of A-listers exemplifies the rules of the game are changing, thanks to the burgeoning expansion of streaming platforms.Wo Men De Xin Sheng Huo (Our New Life) is set to be released July 23 on China's three largest streaming sites: Youku, iQiyi and Tencent.The film consists of five standalone tales, respectively directed by five young talents -- Shen Ao, Yao Tingting, Zhang Luan, Lu Zhengyu and actor-turned filmmaker Bao Bei'er.All unfolding from grassroots perspectives, the stories touch on multiple aspects of the new changes in modern society, varying from how elderly people's daily lives have been influenced by the widespread use of 5G to locals in mountainous areas able to pursue their dreams thanks to China's convenient transportation network.Interestingly, director Zhang's tale -- perhaps the most attractive to young netizens -- stars pop idol Yang Chaoyue and Tamdrin (whose Mandarin name is Ding Zhen), an online celebrity who was previously a Tibetan herder in Sichuan province.Director Yao says they hope the film will raise the bar for online movies, and help internet series and films gain more recognition in the domestic industry.A tale of parental persistence and personal willpower, coupled with a greater understanding of pediatric cancers and government initiatives to improve accessibility to treatment, is providing encouragement to families affected by the disease, Wang Qian reports.After recovering for 27 years, liver cancer survivor Li Pengfei is on a mission to inspire others to beat the disease.The 29-year-old man from Datong, Shanxi province, has joined various support groups on social media platforms to connect with people who are on a similar journey. Last year, he became a volunteer at the Shenzhen Shiyu Children Foundation, a nongovernmental organization focused on promoting awareness, patient education and drug discovery for pediatric cancers."I hope that by sharing my survival story, I can help more people," Li says.Li's cancer journey began in 1995, when he was only 1 year old. The local hospital detected a mass in his liver through an X-ray and doctors suggested further tests at top hospitals in Beijing. Although some relatives began to accept giving up treatment as an option, Li's parents took all their savings and decided to save their son's life, no matter how far they had to go. In the coming three years, they had traveled many times between Datong and Beijing.At Beijing No 301 Hospital, Li was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma, a type of pediatric liver cancer, and, due to the critical situation, a doctor recommended Zhang Jinzhe, chief physician at Beijing's Children's Hospital, to Li's parents. Zhang suggested that he be treated with chemotherapy and when the tumor was under control, a surgery was possible. Although it meant a lot of money and a high risk of failure, Li's parents forged ahead in a bid to save their son."I cannot imagine how much of a struggle it was and how much pressure my parents had endured, especially my mother who was just 22 years old at that time," Li says with tears in his eyes."Luckily for me, the surgery was successful and I began to grow strong like other boys," Li says. He spent his second birthday in hospital with a long scar on his abdomen.Today Li is a 27-year liver cancer survivor who stays busy and positive. He got married in 2018 and his daughter was born one year later."People in a similar situation are surprised to learn my story, which brings hope to their life. I want to do more for them," Li says.As one of the most anticipated animated movies in summer, the sequel of 2019 sleeper hit White Snakehas topped the presale box office charts on its opening day, or July 23, according to the live tracker Beacon.Titled as White Snake 2: The Tribulation of Green Snake, the new tale takes place around 1,500 years after the story of the first film, which is loosely inspired from China's household folk legend about two beautiful "women" who are actually two snake spirits.Unfolding with an epic action-studded scenario featuring the two characters summoning a flood in order to face off a powerful Buddhist monk, the new film follows one of the two snakes -- the green-skinned one -- sucked into a fantastic world on the edge of being beaten to death.In this weird yet brutal world, which is frequently hit by disasters and monsters, an ox demon leads a gang of demon villains to hunt and eliminate the other residents, all human beings or spirits sucked into this world by accident.

Major geothermal renewable energy partnership between China and Iceland lauded as natural extension of CPC's focus in putting people first, Scandinavian environmental expert and former diplomat tells Alexis Hooi.When Icelandic scholar and diplomat Ragnar Baldursson first arrived in China in the 1970s, it felt like his own country a century earlier."In the winter, there was coal smoke over the city. It was like Iceland 100 years ago, in that sense. All the peasants in the surrounding areas and a large part of Beijing were being heated with coal. So even though there were no cars on the streets, there was a lot of pollution," he says.But four decades later, China has become a leader in tapping renewable energy, with Ragnar (Icelanders address everyone by their first names) himself part of a pioneering partnership on geothermal heating that brings the two countries together on the path to sustainable development."It has been extremely successful," says the 65-year-old."In Iceland, the houses are heated with renewable energy, almost all of them with geothermal resources. But our contribution to combating climate change is actually more in China than in Iceland because our population is small."The environmental seeds of success were planted in 2006. That was when Iceland-based professional geothermal company Arctic Green Energy Corp's subsidiary co-established with a counterpart at Chinese oil and gas giant Sinopec Group the heating joint venture, Sinopec Green Energy Geothermal Development Co Ltd.The online reality show Play! Fridge which uses the refrigerator as a good conversation starter to lead into heart-to-heart talks with celebrity guests has aired on Tencent's video platform since June 22.The show's production unit believes that the food and ingredients stored in the domestic appliance would more or less reflect the owner's lifestyle and even his or her personality. Examining what's inside one's refrigerator could help get closer to the person. Hence, the show, which combines elements of both a talk show and gourmet program, uses the appliance to explore the diversity of people's lifestyles and their attitudes toward life.The show, hosted by renowned anchorman He Jiong and Hong Kong pop idol Jackson Wang, has also invited pop idols Liu Zhang and Chen Ziming as well as Thai singer Nine Kornchid Boonsathitpakdee, who started his career in Chinese entertainment circles, as assistants for the hosts.In its first episode, actress Zhao Liying, 33, and actor Wu Lei, 21, have been invited to share with the hosts their eating habits, cooking styles and useful tips to relieve stress.A-list movie star Zhou Dongyu's first fantasy romance drama, Ancient Love Poetry began streaming on Tencent Video from June 17, becoming one of the most popular series over the weekend.Adapted from writer Xing Ling's online novel Shang Gu, the fictional tale chronicles the bittersweet love of two powerful celestial beings over a course of thousands of years.Zhou, who shot to fame with director Zhang Yimou's 2010 movie Under the Hawthorn Tree, he has since acted in some critically acclaimed films, such as Better Days -- which was nominated for the best international feature film at the 93rd Academy Awards.Aside from Zhou, the cast features model-turned actor Xu Kai as one of the two lead characters, a god chosen alongside another three gods to safeguard and rule a fantasy world co-existing with celestial beings, monsters, spirits and gods.The series has also caught attention overseas, exemplified by earning 8.8 points out of 10 on Mydramalist.com, an overseas aggregator for Asian drama fans.Yang Xiaopei, the drama's chief producer, said the crew traveled over 2,000 kilometers from Hengdian in Zhejiang province to Dunhuang in Gansu province, obtaining aesthetic inspirations from flying apsaras -- celestial dancers flying in air in mural paintings found in historic sites such as Mogao Grottoes, according to New Series Review.In order to bring to life the fantasy world depicted in the novel, the prop and setting departments constructed several soundstages and outdoor facilities covering a total area of 90,000 square meters.Currently, hashtags of the series have accumulated 650 million clicks on the popular social platform Sina Weibo.From the 2016 hit Dangal to this year's box-office champion Hi, Mom, touching tales about family affection have demonstrated their market potential as a popular genre.On Your Mark --a new film also delving into the theme -- opened across the mainland theaters today, two days before the Father's Day,Under the helm of Malaysian director Chiu Keng Guan, the film casts veteran actor Wang Yanhui and rising star Zhang Youhao in a story about a taxi driver and his son, a marathon enthusiast who's struggling with a visual impairment disease.In order to help his son to realize his dream, the father helps his son to join a marathon competition, serving as his son's personal "assistant" to run together on the 42-kilometer-long route.Adapted from a true story, the film was shot in Southwest China's Chongqing.Director Chiu said during a recent premiere held in a downtown Beijing cinema that Chinese people are restrained and shy to speak out their love to their children, wishing the movie can serve as a gift to enhance family ties on the Father's Day.As one of the most celebrity-studded events during the ongoing 24th Shanghai International Film Festival, which will end on June 20, the 2021 Weibo Movie Awards Ceremony -- an influential event jointly organized by Sina Weibo and China Movie Channel -- recently gathered around 100 filmmakers and A-list stars.Jackie Chan - the iconic kung fu giant -- took home the Outstanding Contribution by an Actor for Chinese-language Film Award, the top acting honor of the event, for his career spanning over 50 years and making over 200 movies.Chan said he is busy working on projects that were postponed by the COVID-19 outbreak earlier last year, with his major effort focusing on the post-production of a new arthouse film.The glamorous event also presented Zhang Yimou, one of the best of China‘s influential fifth-generation directors, with the Outstanding Contribution by a Director for Chinese-language Film Award.It's a work of sheer magic.Wen Shipeng -- a young director who graduated from Columbia University in New York -- discovered a unique method to achieve a distinctive look for his directorial feature Are You Lonesome Tonight?.During a recent promotional event held in Beijing, Wen said his cinematographers installed an antique camera lens and covered it with pantyhose, as they believed the blurred images that resulted convey the movie's themes of regret and atonement.The movie, which took Wen and his crew four years to produce, will be released in Cthe hinese mainland in multiple formats on June 12, including IMAX, and it is currently the second highest-grossing picture in the country's presale box-office charts for the Dragon Boat Festival holiday.Set in Guangzhou in South China's Guangdong province in 1997, the tale examines an air conditioner repairman's efforts at atonement, as he believes he caused the death of a pedestrian. However, the truth is thornier than he thought, and complications ensue after the repairman tries to get close to the victim's widow.With a stellar cast, the film stars A-list actor Eddie Peng as the repairman and award-winning actress Sylvia Chang as the widow, as well as veteran actor Wang Yanhui as a police officer.Peng, previously known for tough guy characters in blockbusters like Operation Red Sea (2018) and The Rescue(2020), lost 16 kilograms to play this character, a skinny young man struggling with guilt.Are You Lonesome Tonight?, the title song performed twice in the film with greater significance each time, has a long history. It was originally created in 1926, before winning more popularity thanks to cover versions by some American singers in later decades, including Elvis Presley.A few years ago, a stellar cast backed by a popular online novel usually guaranteed the market success of TV or film adaptation, but the rules of the game have now changed, said insiders during a forum held in Beijing on June 8.Under the theme titled "new wave", the forum -- organized by the social media platform Sina Weibo -- brought together the major creators behind five of the most popular online dramas in the first five months of this year, respectively Word of Honor, Rattan, The Imperial Coroner, You Are My Hero, and My Heroic Husband.Deng Ke, director of You Are My Hero, said his scriptwriters spent several months to break the original novel -- which consists of up to 5 million words -- into many sections with each containing necessary twists, as an effective way to draw audience with new episodes.Wu Xingyan, producer of Rattan, listed casting as one of the key elements to make a successful work, explaining that actors should be selected based more on whether their appearance and temperament are suited for the role than their popularity.Deng Xiaohua, producer of You Are My Hero, said the unprecedented expansion of China's market for internet entertainment content has laid the foundation for the fast development of online series, which have improved storytelling skills in recent years.Latest statistics from China Netcasting Service Association show that 944 million of the 989 netizens in China watched videos or listened to audio content online as of December 2020.As one of the fastest stars on the popular variety show Keep Running, actor Zheng Kai has obtained the nickname "little cheetah" from his fans.Interestingly, his sports talent will be fully employed in the upcoming film Never Stop, which casts Zheng as a legendary sprinter.Also Zheng's first work as an executive producer, the film will open across the Chinese mainland on June 12, estimated to be one of the biggest films during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday.The film's stars, including Li Chen, and industry celebrities such as director Feng Xiaogang, attended the movie's premiere in Beijing on June 7.Under the helm of Han Bowen, the film follows a national 100-meter champion -- played by actor Li Yunruo -- returning to his hometown to seek his idol, a former sprint legend played by Zheng.However, the sprinter is now out of shape and struggling with a midlife crisis after experiencing a series of failures in pursuing a new career. The champion's visit arouses his memory of his golden years, propelling them to team up to fulfill a new goal.As an attempt to accurately play the protagonist at different ages, Zheng recalls he had to lose weight at first and then gain 20 kilograms in two months.As a treat for track and field fans, Su Bingtian -- the first ever Asian-born sprinter to break the 10-second barrier at the 100-meter dash -- shows up in a scene to guide actors in short races near the end of the film.Winner of competition promoting the capital gives US executive more reason to pound the streets as she relishes chance to meet city's residents, Li Yingxue reports.The first day after moving to Beijing from New York, Ella Kidron shook off her jet lag with a run at 4 am in her new city home. That was in July 2016. She still clearly remembers seeing the sun coming up, almost shyly, over the city and its sweeping streets.That started a passion for exploring the city through running. This was the way she wanted to see, feel and hear the city and it allowed her to meet new friends."For me, running in Beijing is about juxtaposition-it's enjoying the quiet in a bustling city and shuttling back and forth between history and modernity," she says.Kidron, a senior manager of international corporate affairs at e-commence platform JD, put her running story into a video titled Discovering Beijing's Limitless Possibilities. That video, which runs just over two minutes, won her the top award for the "100 Reasons to Love Beijing" short video and essay competition."Running in Beijing means treasure hunts, mystery and surprise," she says in the video. "It's a reminder of the unlimited possibilities of this city. It makes this place, which is more than 6,000 miles away from where I grew up, feel like home."The Glory of Youth, China's first TV drama to tell the life of the Rocket Force of People's Liberation Army, recently concluded the first run, drawing major creators and experts to sum up its highlights at a recent symposium in Beijing.Adapted from military writer Feng Jie's novel Join the Army after College, the 49-episode series follows four new university undergraduates to join the Rocket Force, striving to become elite soldiers after undergoing a series of harsh training and tests.Scriptwriter Ying Liangpeng recalled that he alongside several another creators lived with several brigades of Rocket Force unit for around six months to experience the military life and get the first-hand information.Zhou Jihong, director-general of the TV drama department at National Radio and Television Administration, said the series has lifted the "mystery mask" of the Rocket Force, helping more audience to know how the force carries out regular training and military exercises.Li Xingwen, a Beijing-based critic, said the series has expanded the subject range of military-themed tales, and managed to appeal a wider viewership of youngsters thanks to its stellar cast led by Li Yingfeng, a pop idol-turned actor followed by more than 61 million fans on the popular social platform Sina Weibo.The crab was eaten and The Dance of the Storm was produced. The relevance of that remark will be explained shortly but suffice to say for most showbiz industry insiders, 2016 was a watershed, as the number of online series produced surged 196 percent year-on-year."At that time, the market was brimming with creative ideas, and many production companies were testing the water of new genres," recalls Gao Feng, a veteran producer with Ciwen Media known for costume hits such as Journey to the West and Princess Agents.This is where the crustacean comes in. Recalling that he wanted to be "the first person to eat a crab", a Chinese idiom describing individuals bravely trying fresh, yet risky, things, Gao and his longtime scriptwriting partner An Zhiyong had their opportunity that year.Ciwen Media purchased the copyright to remake the popular South Korean espionage drama, Iris, with a plan to adapt the story to one about a Chinese spy who saves the world. The result? The Dance of the Storm.In the fall of 2002, Chinese film director Jia Zhangke attended the New York Film Festival for the screening of his film Unknown Pleasures. He was in demand-journalists and other directors wanted to interview and talk to him. Events were organized, such as post-show discussions, interviews with the media or meeting other directors such as Martin Scorsese. To make sure nothing was lost in translation, he needed an interpreter. Enter stage right, Michael Berry, a postgraduate student from Columbia University, who was hired for the role.Berry knew Jia's work and was a huge fan of his films, especially Xiaowu (1998) and Platform (2000), which are "true masterpieces of contemporary cinema", Berry says.Berry found these two films unforgettable, not only because of the director's mature cinematic technique and poetic framing, but also because every time he watched them, he would be immediately transplanted, as if in a time machine, back to 1993 and 1994, when he was a sophomore in college undergoing intensive Chinese language training at Nanjing University in East China's Jiangsu province."At that time, I watched a lot of films, but most seemed unreal. Although the two films were set in Fenyang, Shanxi province, they are the only two films that remind me of my experience in Nanjing, Jiangsu province-the sound, the music, the faces, the clothes and of course, the views," Berry writes in the introduction of his book An Accented Cinema, which has been published in China.A promotional event for the online drama My Dear Guardian was held in Beijing in May, and the drama has since started to run on the online streaming site iQiyi on Tuesday.Adapted from an online novel, the production starring Huang Jingyu and Li Qin tells a romantic tale about a soldier named Liang Muze and military doctor named Xia Chu, showing how they fell in love with each other while fulfilling their duties.The crew members made meticulous preparations for the drama. In order to reflect the professionalism of doctors and soldiers, they did interviews and research in the army and hospitals to collect information for their production."Professionals offered medical and military guidance to us, and part of our story was shot in the army," says Ji Tianyi, director of the drama."We want to show the lives of a group of soldiers, especially their emotional expressions, and hope to strike a chord with the hearts of audience members," Ji adds.Their ancestors helped build the country, and they continue to do so, yet it may be that Asian Americans have never felt so ignored, unwanted and often despised. Now many are speaking out, with 2,388 signing a letter to New York's mayor suggesting that education is an answer to the problem.One morning in February last year Alice Tsui, a music teacher at an elementary school in Brooklyn, New York, was climbing the stairs toward her school's sunlight-filled auditorium, where she was about to unveil what she believed would be a beautiful day for her mostly black and brown students, with music."That was when a fifth-grader stopped me and said, 'Miss Alice, someone said you had coronavirus," recalls Tsui, who was born to Chinese migrant parents in New York in the early 1990s."I later found out that it was another one of my fifth-grade students whom I had taught for many years."On March 21, five days after the shooting in Atlanta, Georgia, in which Robert Aaron Long, 21, killed eight people, including six Asian women, within half an hour, Tsui took to the platform at a rally against Asian hate, her voice trembling with rage."I am so mad at the toxicity of systematic racism that we breathe in, and specifically white supremacy, for dividing my black children and I, an Asian American teacher in this world," she told the crowd as she was overwhelmed by another surge of emotion."My call to action to you, everyone here, is to find those emails, the contact information of principals, teachers, and the educational institutions that are supposed to serve us," Tsui said. The goal is to "acknowledge and teach Asian American history, lives and arts including and beyond the Lunar New Year".Her impassioned words fell on fertile ears. On April 26 five parents, all Chinese Americans, sent a letter to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and the city's Schools Chancellor, Meisha Porter."The recent surge in anti-Asian hate crimes and violence has highlighted the woefully inadequate education pertaining to Asian American history that our children receive. As parents of Asian American students in NYC public schools, we urge you to ... establish and promote a curriculum that is inclusive of Asian American history and culture," the letter began, ending with 2,388 signatures from concerned parents, students, educators, and those who identify themselves as a "graduate" or simply "a resident".Citing Tsui as an inspiration, Xia Li, who has a 13-year-old daughter and wrote the first draft of the letter, said she was jolted into action by the sheer amount of violence, some committed against those close to her."A colleague of mine, whose parents were originally from China and the Philippines, believes that she has lost her father to Asian hate, after having the pandemic claim the lives of several other family members," said Li, an education professor at Brooklyn College who describes herself, before the pandemic, as "the opposite of an advocate"."The old man was found at a bus stop, apparently having been assaulted and unable to speak. He was taken to hospital by passersby, stayed there for nearly a month in a coma and died on New Year's Eve," she said."It (Asian hate) won't be on the news until more people die," one of Tsui's 4th-graders told her. "What does this say about what my students know about our society and have already internalized?""The best antidote", Li and her fellow parents believe, lies with education, one that "must start in the earliest grades"."Invisibility-the word popped up in my mind as I walked through my daughter's school corridor with pictures of famous people lining both sides of the wall, not seeing a single Asian face," Li said. "The children of Asian descent have grown so used to it-used to seeing neither themselves nor their ancestors-that the issue barely registers for them."Lulu Song, also from Brooklyn College, was at the same Zoom meeting with Li when their Chinese-Filipino colleague reduced both to tears with her family tragedy. Joining Li to push for the education proposal, Song said the idea has been at the back of her mind since her daughter, now 10, was 4. "One day she came back from kindergarten looking sullen. 'Chinese are short. Chinese houses are flat.' – she said to us," Song recalled. "I was upset, almost furious, only to realize at a later time that my anger was misplaced."Graduating from one of China's top universities before moving to the US to pursue her studies in the late 2000s, Song herself had no idea then that it was the 12,000 or more Chinese laborers who built the western section of the Transcontinental Railroad in the 1880s. (The other half was built mostly by Irish workers.)Linking the country from coast to coast, the railroad that built America, as it is known today, would not have been possible without these men who were poorly fed, who lived in flat houses-makeshift tents-for seven winters while the track was being laid, and who helped shape the country's future through their sheer endeavor."The absence of that history in our education means that my daughter hasn't been allowed to take pride in the accomplishment of her ancestors in this country," Song lamented.Even worse, on occasions when the event does receive a fleeting mention in its "bare minimum", to quote Aiden Tan, 14, a New York high school student, the effect is often toward reinforcing the existing stereotype, rather than challenging it in a way that promotes understanding and appreciation among students of different ethnic roots."All we learned was that they (the railroad workers) were cheap laborers who had had a tough life in China," Tan said. There's no mention of the lives lost as the men blasted through the granite mountain face at Sierra Nevada, or the amazing speed at which they laid the tracks.Similarly, as anti-Asian hate raged alongside the pandemic last year, one public school in the New York borough of Queens taught its second-graders about the 19th and early 20th immigration history of the Chinese, Italian and Irish in the city. Students learned, in bullet points, that the Chinese "worked in the city's laundries and sweatshops" and routinely "sent money back home to support their family in China", according to a mother who is Chinese American and whose daughter attended the school."A Jewish proverb goes: a half truth is a whole lie," said the mother, who requested anonymity. "In this case, the students, both of Asian and non-Asian descent, have been failed by the teacher's-and to be more exact our education system's-failure to contextualize what they teach."Under the casual, almost indifferent light, they appear as sojourners who were here to take, and who never engaged seriously with the country they had crossed oceans to reach, sometimes at the risk of their lives," she said. "This is completely untrue: Heaven knows how they had struggled to sink roots into a land whose soil was rendered arid by rampant racism."In April the same elementary school, in teaching reading comprehension to students, chose the 2006 book The Earth Dragon Awakes-The San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, by the Chinese American author Laurence Yep. Focusing on two families-one white (the Travis family), one Chinese (the Chin family)-affected by an earthquake that destroyed more than 80 percent of San Francisco, the historical fiction is known more for its descriptive language and interesting seismic facts than for shedding light on the reality of the era, and what it meant for Chinese living on the American West Coast at the time.Near the end of the book the Chin family, whose father was a house boy at the Travis household, had no choice but to leave after the earthquake because "the people of San Francisco don't want to let us go back to our old neighborhood", said Ah Sing, the Chin family son, in resignation."The students walk away with no more than a vague sense of inequality," the mother said. "In real life the Chins probably wouldn't have left their homes until it was totally burned down, not during an earthquake but as a result of hate crimes."During the teaching of the book, which lasted for about two weeks, no complementary materials were provided. There was no talk about the notorious San Francisco riot of 1877, three days of racial violence that swept Chinatown, resulting in many deaths and the destruction of property worth more than $100,000. Nor was there any mention of the fact that the Chinese immigrants, with their rich agricultural expertise, helped make the San Francisco Bay Delta one of America's prime areas of farmland, often by reclaiming swampland.The direct result of such an approach, said Tsui, is that "our teachers and students are not empowered to engage in meaningful discussion about racism, let alone speak against it." Instead, it leads to ignorance, an ossified perception of Asians as being alien, and "any subtle form of racism" all too familiar to her and others.A TV series that aims to spotlight the anti-poaching efforts of rangers and police has recently premiered on Hunan Satellite TV and the video-streaming platform Mango TV.The TV drama Hunter tells the story of a veteran ranger, played by actor Qin Hao, collaborating with a young policeman, portrayed by actor Yin Fang, to fight against the illegal trafficking and killing of wildlife in a nature reserve.To prepare for his role as a policeman, Yin went through intensive physical training.

The birthplace of the CPC Constitution was reopened just in time for the upcoming centenary of the Party's founding in July.Located in downtown Jing'an district, the site is where the Second National Congress of the CPC took place from July 16 to 23, 1922. The CPC Constitution marked the completion of the Party's founding.The second national congress also marked the first time an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolutionary program was put forward. The public declaration of the CPC Manifesto, the decision to join the Comintern, and the "Long Live the Communist Party of China" slogan were also unveiled at the congress.That congress was attended by just 12 members. Today, the Party has grown to become the world's largest political party with more than 91 million members.Officials say that the facelift given to the shikumen-a typical Shanghai house with a courtyard and black gates encased in stone frames-and upgrades to the exhibits were meant to showcase how the century-old Party is now in its best years."The renovation over the past six months is intended to enrich visitors' experience and restore the original look of this venue that has a special place in history," says You Wei, Party branch secretary and deputy director of the memorial.Changes to the format and some items of the exhibition hall are evident following the renovation work.In the oath-taking area, a Party flag has been added. Here, visitors who are Party members can pose for a photo with one of the many Party emblems affixed to the wall."Many Party branches come here for educational activities and some would like to renew their oath to the Party at such a historic venue," You says. "A better atmosphere helps to create a more solemn feeling."In the main hall, there is a wall showcasing the 12 attendees of the 1922 congress. When looking at this wall from afar, the background of the photos appears white, but up close, it becomes transparent, allowing visitors to view the outdoor area and the architecture of the shikumen.The change in the degree of transparency is made possible with electricity control. This special feature is meant to improve light flow in the exhibition hall and help create an illusion that the 12 attendees are present in the room.On Tuesday, more than 20 members of a Shanghai society branch researching the history of the New Fourth Army visited the memorial. Many of them are the descendants of soldiers from a unit led by the CPC during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45).Zhu Xiaorong, head of the branch, says the visit helped enrich his understanding of Party history. Zhu's parents were members of the New Fourth Army.In February, President Xi Jinping wrote a letter to more than 40 centenarian veterans of the New Fourth Army in Shanghai.We may still be charmed by the presence of Tong Liya among the Spring Festival Gala hosts.

He takes a moment to sweep his gaze over the auditorium before raising his baton to begin the performance.This is a culmination of years of hard work and a dream — to establish his own professional orchestra in China.The 37-year-old conductor's journey, beginning in Shanghai, has been an unconventional one. Growing up in the tropical Central American country of Costa Rica, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in conducting in 2017."In 2018, my professor advised me to go to China because there was a good teacher from the Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory teaching at Shanghai Conservatory of Music," Montealegre recalls. "It was an opportunity I couldn't pass up."So, he took the plunge, arriving in Shanghai later that year to first learn Mandarin — no easy feat when learning it simultaneously with English. However, the challenge was worthwhile when he gained admission to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music's master's program in 2019.During his studies, he became enthralled by Shanghai's vibrant arts scene and the wealth of opportunities for musicians. "Here is one of the most beautiful places in the world, especially if you're a musician. There are so many important musicians from around the world here. You have opportunities at every turn," he says.Jin Junfan, entrepreneur and vlogger from South Korea who has been living in China for more than 10 years, is dedicated to introducing the real China to netizens in South Korea through documenting his life in the capital. Lu Jiaojiao, a 29-year-old from Yunnan, turned her challenges as a rural mother into a successful business that empowers over 30 women.Lu Jiaojiao, a 29-year-old from a village in Yunnan province, Southwest China, has transformed from a rural girl into a thriving businesswoman.Over the past nine years, she has led over 30 women in rural employment and built a successful business.Lu's entrepreneurial journey began with a common challenge faced by many mothers. In 2015, to address her child's picky eating habits, she came across a social media post about making colorful noodles using vegetable and fruit juices and decided to try it at home.To her delight, her child enjoyed the noodles, so Lu shared them with other mothers. Some of them, feeling it was unfair to receive the noodles for free, began purchasing these brightly colored noodles from Lu regularly, marking the start of her financial success.As Lu's reputation grew, she attracted customers beyond her immediate circle. Being a mother herself, she continually improved her products to better meet children's needs.In 2016, after her child suffered a bowel obstruction from overeating and required hospital treatment, Lu turned to an experienced traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctor for solutions.Since her child was too young for TCM herbs, the doctor recommended a formula made from medicinal and edible ingredients — natural substances that offer both health benefits and nutritional value and are safe for long-term use. However, like many TCM herbs, the decoction was hard for young children to swallow and keep down.Lu started experimenting with enhancing its flavors and textures by adding more sugar and hawthorn, and she concentrated the decoction into a paste for easier storage and use."After testing dozens of formulas at home, I finally developed one that was both effective and appealing to children," she said.When Lu introduced this final product to her customers, it quickly gained popularity and eventually became a flagship product of her future company.Today, Lu's company specializes in medicinal foods, including handmade snacks, desserts, health pastes, and sugar-free lollipops, all of which are highly popular with both children and mothers.Cyclists hit the road to explore other cultures, meet new people and enrich their souls, report Wang Qian and Zhu Xingxin in Taiyuan.For Zhang Zhaoliang, who lives and breathes cycling, there is no better way to explore a country than by pedaling. Within 106 days, the 29-year-old man from Pingyao county, Jinzhong, North China's Shanxi province, has cycled more than 8,000 kilometers across seven countries in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand."For me, cycling is a way to discover the world, understand myself and find my purpose in life," Zhang says, adding that during his recent adventure, he has tried to know more about the history of Chinese migration and localization in Southeast Asia.Preparing a kit that included a tent, a sleeping bag, a rain jacket and some clothes, Zhang set out from the China-Vietnam border port of Dongxing in South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region on Jan 1 on his solo pedaling trip.Cycling is becoming an increasingly popular way to travel in cities with a growing number of people swapping four wheels for two. However, a small group of people like Zhang do not stop at the city limits but decide to travel across countries by bike. On social media, many have shared their stories, indicating a thriving cycling culture taking hold.For 38-year-old cycling vlogger Zhu Zhiwen from Ruijin, East China's Jiangxi province, his ultimate dream is to cycle across all seven continents. His latest adventure has been the super successful Olympic ride from Beijing to Paris, which took about 16 months, traversing 18 countries with a total distance surpassing 15,550 kilometers."Cycling is a part of life and after realizing my ultimate dream, my journey will continue, with more experiences to be gained, not only on two wheels," says Zhu, who has been hitting the road on his bike for the past 12 years.Enjoying the freedom of cross-country tours on bikes, avid cyclists such as Zhu and Zhang discover an astounding diversity in landscape, people, culture, paths and experiences.Qiubi finds her niche snapping shots of rural lives, polar excursions, starry nightsAdorning the walls of airport rail links and subway lines in Beijing are thousands of captivating photos. What many may not know is that over 1,000 of these images are credited to a single person: talented photographer Wang Wenyan, better known by her pen name, Qiubi.Covering a range of subjects — from documentary work and aweinspiring pictures of landscapes to snapshots of wildlife in Antarctica and images from the intriguing realm of astrophotography — her photos showcase her broad interests and remarkable versatility."I'm mainly a documentary and Antarctica photographer," Qiubi told China Daily. "Astrophotography is more like a hobby born from my childhood fantasies about the galaxy and cosmos."Birth of a shutterbugBorn in 1987 in Sanming, Fujian province, Qiubi said that she got her first Canon compact camera, a gift from her father when she was in university. She received her first single-lens reflex camera when she started working for an automobile manufacturer's overseas marketing department in Xiamen, Fujian, after graduating from university in 2008.She used it to take photos for the company's newsletters.She worked with the company for four years, during which she met her future husband. They married and moved to Beijing. In order to further study in France, she attended a French training course at Beijing Foreign Studies University.During a 2013 outing with friends in the capital, she discovered her passion for photography while capturing candid moments of her friends' children with her camera. Impressed by her photos, her friends said it seemed she had a knack for the art.Their praise didn't surprise Qiubi, who had shown artistic prowess in her younger years. "I used to love and excel in painting during my school days," she said. "I even contemplated studying fine arts for a while."Still, she was motivated by their encouragement and decided to make something of her gift.The photos she took of the children led to her receiving her first commercial photography commission. More commissions followed, propelling her from a part-time to a full-time commercial photographer."My focus wasn't on typical commercial portraits but on capturing candid, documentary-style family moments," she said.Her distinct style and artful approach began to attract more attention. In 2014, she received an invitation to document an international company's environmental project in a village nestled at the base of the Qilian Mountains in Gansu province. Immersing herself in the village life for a week, she trained her lens to capture images depicting how modern cooking stoves had transformed the villagers' traditional way of life.Following the success of the project, she received more commissions from various entities, including corporations, nonprofit organizations and universities, all seeking her photographic expertise for their diverse projects.These projects, ranging from environmental and biodiversity conservation and agricultural heritage protection to women's empowerment, climate change and sustainable community development, have brought her to remote communities in China and abroad, especially in areas inhabited by many of the country's ethnic groups.Amateur photographer utilizes buildings to capture A to Z from the top down, Zhou Wenting reports.Visitors from home and abroad may be familiar with three iconic skyscrapers in Shanghai — the 127-story Shanghai Tower, China's tallest building, the 101-story Shanghai World Financial Center, and the 88-story Shanghai Jinmao Tower.The buildings' architects say that the rounded facade of Shanghai Tower embodies the future while the other two represent the city's present and past.But have you ever wondered what the buildings look like from the top down? Shu Bin, an amateur photographer from Shanghai knows the answer — the three super skyscrapers resemble the letters D, I and X.The 37-year-old Shanghai native, with impaired hearing, discovered this while looking for the 26 alphabet letters from the rooftops of the city's buildings with his drone from January to March.In a 32-second video clip Shu produced, 26 of the city's buildings show the letters A to Z when viewed from the top down. The video was recently released by the official video account of the Shanghai Municipal Government, gaining more than 8,000 likes instantly.Internet users describe the video as "postmodern" and "revealing the magic of Shanghai". The city is widely dubbed "a city of magic" and "unlocking the hidden romance of the city", and many left messages speculating about where these buildings are.Shu tells China Daily via a sign language translator that the idea of taking the photos came to him after he collected the numbers one to nine from the rooftops of buildings in September 2022. He says the numbers did not take too much effort and the buildings were all located in Songjiang district on the outskirts of the city's southwest."I became fascinated with the drone in 2019 and found that the shapes of some roofs resemble familiar symbols through its camera. I wanted to collect all 26 letters of the alphabet. The photography procedure allowed me to dive deeper and more broadly throughout my hometown," says Shu, a licensed drone operator."This way, I could also share with people a unique perspective of the city, where dramatic changes have taken place over the decades. Also, people can see another layer of the city that is hard to imagine when standing on the ground," he says.Shu's first step was to check online platforms to find buildings that look similar to letters. "If there were more than one representing the same letter, I'd choose the one with more colors, a better shape and more significance to the city," he says.For example, many buildings show the letter C. He chose the swimming pool of the Shanghai Oriental Sports Center for its bright color and unique style, and because it is a famous public facility.Shooting at one spot usually lasted nearly an hour, as he needed to control the drone in the right direction, avoid light reflections, wait for clouds to move away, and sometimes wait until the drone had better reception.The most difficult picture to capture was the letter D, which is the 127-story, 632-meter-tall Shanghai Tower, as his drone can only fly to a maximum of 500 meters from the starting point."After several attempts, I found a high spot on the rooftop of a high-rise on the North Bund, about 500 meters tall and across the Huangpu River from Shanghai Tower in Pudong New Area. I stood on top of the high-rise and let my drone fly across the river to capture the photo," says Shu, adding that the drone needed to make a one-way trip of around one kilometer."As the building is a Shanghai landmark, I never thought to search for a substitute, let alone looking for a replacement outside the city," he says.When Meng Jintao was a child, power outages in his rural hometown sparked his curiosity: Why can't we store electricity during regular times and use it when the power goes out?Now 29, Meng has turned this childhood curiosity into reality with his advanced iron-based flow energy storage system.Distinguished by its substantial storage capacity, high safety standards, and long-term durability, this technology represents a major advancement in energy storage.To further develop his innovation, Meng founded JA Energy Storage Wuhan Technology Co., Ltd. in Central China's Hubei province.In 2013, Meng began his studies at Hefei University of Technology in Anhui, East China, majoring in new energy materials and devices.During his university years, he traveled to Qinghai and Gansu provinces in Northwest China for research, where he observed the initial successes of wind and solar power projects. However, he learned from power station staff that much of the energy generated by wind turbines was unstable and could not be effectively used.It was during this period that Meng recognized the urgent need for advanced storage solutions to stabilize energy supply and release it steadily to the grid, thereby increasing efficiency.This realization led him to develop the iron-based flow energy storage system."This system functions like a large power bank for cities," he explained.According to Meng, while lithium batteries are well-established, there is a growing need for a more affordable and safer storage solution.He chose iron for its cost-efficiency and the abundant availability of iron resources in China. Iron-based flow energy storage systems are also more economical and use water as a solvent, making them fire-resistant and safer.Hiker retraces route of Marco Polo as she continues her mission of inspiration and benefits from kindness of strangers, Yang Feiyue reports.On the surface, Vienna Cammarota is a simple grandmother in her Italian hometown. But initial impressions can be misleading. The mother of three in her 70s is a well-known hiker, who intrepidly explores what the world has to offer.Beginning in Venice on April 26,2022, Cammarota arrived in China last month, the last stop of her journey to the East, trekking more than 20,000 kilometers.The moment she set foot in China on Aug 29, she was warmly greeted by people who presented her with a wreath, symbolizing friendship and blessings, and put on traditional dance and singing performances for her arrival via Irkeshtam, the country's farthest-west land port in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.Inspired by Marco Polo, who traveled to China along the ancient Silk Road in 1275, Cammarota set off from the legendary explorer's hometown of Venice to retrace the route on foot.Marco Polo lived in China for 17 years and in his travelogue provided detailed descriptions of the country, which allowed Westerners to learn about the allure of this Eastern nation for the first time, Cammarota says.She adds that she hopes to see more of modern China by following in Marco Polo's footsteps."I want to compare the China described by Marco Polo over 700 years ago with the China of today through my journey. I also hope to share my experiences and observations in China with my fellow Italians," she says.Briton in Hong Kong helps connect local community through nostalgic book and music shop, Hou Chenchen reports in Hong Kong.Rickshaws run along the streets and pass by the colorful advertisements of small shops.

"Compared to London, Hong Kong is not regimented into a certain way of living. There is an open mindset, that you can start any job you want to," he said.More than 20 young entrepreneurs from 12 countries, including Djibouti, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya, Malaysia and Pakistan, finished their tour of educational facilities on Monday.The group visited well-known enterprises and institutes of higher learning across the country to exchange ideas and explore business opportunities.It is part of the C Star program that was funded by the China Merchants Foundation, established by the State-owned China Merchants Group.The program aims to empower the innovation and entrepreneurship of young people in Africa and around the world by leveraging China's industrial incubation and venture capital resources, enabling them to work together to promote high-quality co-construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, said Li Baian, deputy general manager of China Merchants Group.Li said that with the upcoming Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the continuous deepening of China-Africa cooperation, he hopes that the program will continue to grow and expand, establishing project collaborations and resource connections with more outstanding enterprises and universities both domestically and internationally.Babagana Wakil, charge d'affaires ad interim of Nigeria's embassy in China, said today's era is shaped by the creativity, resilience, and ambition of young people, and fostering and supporting the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship among youth is essential for national economic growth, job creation, and addressing social challenges.He believes that the power of youth will have a profound impact on future industrial innovation and business strategies.Kelvin Umechukwu from Nigeria said he was impressed by his experiences during the program, which has let him see China's achievements and the importance of vision, action and values.In the future, the program will continue to provide more support for the incubation of entrepreneurial projects for international youth, further advance China-Africa cooperation and global development, according to the authorities.HAIKOU — In the turquoise waters and along the stunning coastlines of the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea, a crucial mission has been quietly taking shape, namely the protection of sea turtles.Conservation efforts are showing tangible results, with 115 nests discovered in the islands between January and mid-August this year, according to the marine reserve management bureau of Sansha city in Hainan province.After years of protection and environmental restoration, 1,734 nests containing green sea turtle eggs were found between 2017 and 2023, according to bureau officials.The islands are an important habitat for green sea turtles. Ninety percent of China's sea turtle population are found in the South China Sea, of which green sea turtles account for more than 80 percent.Since the 1980s, global populations and habitats have experienced a sharp decline due to long-term overfishing, illegal trade, marine pollution and human activities, compounded by climate change.To address these threats, Sansha has implemented a protection system for sea turtles that is based on 24-hour monitoring and the protection of nesting turtles, as well as the development of key conservation policies.A sea turtle protection center has been set up on Beidao Island, which is part of the Xisha Islands, where research teams from a number of universities have set up labs and research centers. The teams are conducting studies on the status of green sea turtle populations, the sea turtle environment and conservation biology."With the support and help of local government, we did research on 11 islands and reefs in the Xisha Islands," says Zhang Ting, a researcher from Hainan Normal University."We surveyed the situation facing sea turtles, and obtained a lot of precious data and samples," Zhang adds.Sea turtles have been listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, signaling their endangered status.In February 2021, China's revised national list of key protected wild animals included five species of sea turtles as top-priority protected wildlife.Rickshaws run along the streets and pass by the colorful advertisements of small shops.

The initiative seeks to equip TFC teachers with enhanced professional skills and provide them with opportunities for learning, development, and employment.As a key event of the program, 31 youths from TFC have been invited to L'Oréal China's Shanghai office from Friday to Saturday for a two-day immersive experience focused on exploring beauty tech in L'Oréal.Launched in 2008, the TFC recruits individuals committed to two years of full-time teaching in underprivileged areas across China. The NGO aims to bridge educational gaps by offering quality education opportunities and cultivating young leaders with strong social responsibility and innovative spirits.According to Liao Qinan, president of the TFC, more than 90 percent of TFC teachers are recent graduates dedicating two years to providing valuable educational resources to rural areas. However, they often lack access to real work environments and career resources during their volunteer service, posing a shared concern for their post-volunteer career development.To address this challenge, the Beauty for Youth Program will empower volunteer teachers through online classrooms, youth pioneer summer camps, and employment development to equip teaching professionals with essential workplace skills and enhance their core competencies for future employment.Moreover, the program collaborates with L'Oréal China's information technology and sustainable development team to donate 200 laptops and 50 tablets to TFC, aiding more youths in acquiring relevant skills through technological empowerment.The 2024 Spartan Kids World Championship kicked off on Saturday at Genting Ski Park in Chongli district, Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, drawing 186 young athletes from across the globe.Competing in four categories, China's young warriors once again took the spotlight, securing a podium finish for the third consecutive year and continuing their success on the world stage.This marked the first time the Spartan Kids World Championship has been held outside North America, with its inaugural event in Asia attracting participants from 15 countries and regions.In the Girls 12-14 category, Eliana Silverman, representing China, claimed the championship title while Yang Xizi captured gold in the Girls 9-11 division.

Meanwhile, Japan's Seiryu Shirai took the crown in the Boys 12-14 category, with China's Yang Zhishan finishing third."I did it! The championship is mine!" Liqian exclaimed as he crossed the finish line, unable to contain his excitement. "Winning has been a lifelong dream. Before the race, I constantly visualized different scenarios. When the moment came, I stuck to my plan, stayed calm and gave it everything in the final push," he said.He also credited his parents for their unwavering support during his training, which he said was crucial to his success.With obstacle racing set to debut in the modern pentathlon at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Liqian, inspired by his victory, said he will continue to refine his skills with hopes of representing China on the Olympic stage.Zhang Haoyang, a Spartan Race representative, highlighted that the championship attracted the world's top young racers, providing a platform for Chinese youth to compete and connect with peers from around the globe."They made friends through competition and experienced the rich diversity of different cultures," he said.ZHENGZHOU — When Daniel Welker delved into Asian studies as an undergraduate back in the United States, he had no idea that the seemingly casual interest would later bring him across the Pacific to start a life in China.Welker hails from the US state of Kentucky and has lived in China for 12 years. He has found his second home in Luoyang, one of the cradles of Chinese civilization and the capital of 13 dynasties.Over time, Welker has immersed himself in the local culture, enjoying specialties like spicy soup, wearing traditional Chinese clothing to feasts and even picking up some local dialects.In recognition of his contributions and love for the city, Welker was officially appointed as a "city ambassador" by Luoyang."I'm grateful for the opportunities China has allowed me to have," he says, reflecting on his experiences and the bonds he has formed with a country over 10,000 kilometers from his hometown.Welker majored in anthropology and minored in Spanish and Asian studies in the US. "East Asia has some differences that I wanted to understand better, so I added Asian studies. At first, it was seemingly a casual interest, but then it grew stronger," he says.In 2011, he embarked on his first trip to China and came to Henan the following year to pursue a Chinese certification program in the province. Initially planning to stay for just one year, Welker found himself learning so much that he extended his stay for another year and eventually met his future Chinese wife.After finishing his studies in 2014, he moved to Luoyang to work as a foreign language teacher at Luoyang Normal University and Luoyang No 2 Foreign Language School. What was originally intended to be a one-year stint turned into two years, then three and ultimately 12 years now.As a teacher, Welker is well-liked by his students, though he occasionally needs to be strict. He carefully observes their performance and grades them based on their English fluency and effort.Each school year, Welker prepares gifts for the top three students, including books that he greatly enjoyed during his middle school years.Speaking of his Chinese students, Welker says most of them have clear goals for the future and are actively pursuing them. He was deeply impressed by the English proficiency of some students."These kids are really driven, and they crave knowledge. They want to affect the world in a positive way, being a good representative of their own country," Welker says.He adds that he was also captivated by Henan's profound historical and cultural heritage. "If you want to see the beginnings of China, you should go to Henan."Luoyang's rich history and cultural depth, from landmarks like the White Horse Temple, the first Buddhist temple in China, to its distinctive local customs, are incredibly impressive, Welker notes.He believes this is a land where tradition and modernity converge, with fresh air prevailing most of the time and infrastructure, such as subways, continuously being developed.When discussing cultural exchanges between China and the US, Welker sees great potential.In his spare time, Welker enjoys creating videos of his city tours in China and sharing them online to promote Chinese culture."Luoyang is getting more cosmopolitan than it has been in centuries since its heyday in the Sui and Tang dynasties (581-907). It's getting more international ties. I hope the world sees more of Henan," he says.Speaking about the relations between China and the US, Welker says the two countries have had their commonalities and differences. "If we can focus more on the commonalities and keep improving our relationship, I think that we can do some really great things."Xinhua  Rural residents are adding to their income by giving visitors printmaking experience and souvenirs during the tourist season, Tan Yingzi and Deng Rui report in Chongqing.Qijiang Farmers' Printmaking, an intangible cultural heritage of Chongqing, has been spiritually and financially enriching the lives of thousands of residents in the city's Qijiang district for decades. Now, through collaborative efforts among the art's inheritors, artists and the local government, it is empowering rural revitalization.Qijiang Farmers' Printmaking originated from woodblock New Year prints and murals during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties and thrived in the 1980s. Since 1985, the local printmaking artworks have been exhibited in more than 40 countries and regions, including the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany. Over 60 foreign art groups and individuals have visited local art studios, according to a local official."Back in the 1980s, my folks would never have imagined a poor rural girl like me would later find a decent job and turn into an artist," says 59-year-old Li Chengzhi, a national first-grade artist and a representative inheritor of the cultural heritage.URUMQI — Ma Hongmei, of the Hui ethnic group, has been working in a multiethnic residential community in Northwest China for 15 years. Over the years, members of one Uygur family have grown from being complete strangers into those she considers closest to her.When she first met Tuniyaz Dawut in 2009, his wife's polio meant she was physically challenged and unable to work. With two children to take care of, the Uygur couple relied solely on Tuniyaz's meager income.The family became a great concern for Ma, and she helped them apply for a subsistence allowance and other aids to alleviate their financial difficulties.In 2016, a paired assistance program was launched by the Guyuanxiang Community in Urumqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. Ma volunteered to pair up with Tuniyaz's family, and has been offering them care and assistance ever since.Both sons in the family have had a passion for music since they were young, Ma says, but their parents couldn't afford musical instruments. Ma reported their situation to the community, and its then Party secretary, Liu Bo, decided to give his electronic piano to the family, giving the all-important push to the boys' journey into the world of music.The paired assistance program is among the various activities that have been initiated by Guyuanxiang since 2001, according to Zhang Yaowen, the community's incumbent Party secretary. Zhang says that the community has some 4,800 residents, over 95 percent of whom are members of ethnic groups such as the Uygur, Kazak and Hui.With the support of the community, Tuniyaz has obtained two job certifications through training, which have expanded his opportunities and improved his family's standard of living. He has also helped other residents facing difficulties.One of his sons is studying at an art university, and the other has established his own music studio where he teaches the tanbur, a stringed instrument. Over the years, his sons have also participated in community volunteer services, repaying the favors they once received.Today, mutual assistance between neighbors is a customary practice in the community that has become a platform for emotional exchange and integration among different ethnic groups.According to Zhang, the community has created 41 WeChat groups to establish an on-demand network, aiming to improve its services and management. "When residents voice their complaints, or express their difficulties or demands, the community staff members follow up promptly and provide a solution for each specific matter."During the summer vacation, for example, when parents have to work through the day, the community has provided nursery services for children aged 3 to 5, and launched interest-oriented classes for children aged 6 to 15, with focuses ranging from intangible cultural heritage to soccer.The community has also created a stage for its senior residents, enriching their lives in retirement, he says, adding that various art groups for seniors have been formed, including a choir, a modeling team, an instrumental ensemble and a dance troupe. And each year, the community organizes an average of over 70 cultural events in which all residents can participate.Feng Yanxiang, 66, once a resident of the community, is now head of the Xingguang Choir, whose name translates into "starlight", with members ranging in age from 56 to 81. She established the choir after retiring from her job as a road passenger traffic announcer, hoping to help its retired members with their social lives and hobby development.Over some 14 years, the choir has not only become a platform for senior residents to explore their talent, but also turned the members into a close-knit family.Choir member Rizwangul Abduriyim was diagnosed with gastric cancer in 2019. That year, Feng mobilized other members to provide assistance and encouraged her to continue participating in the choir's activities after her surgery.Today, Rizwangul is recovering well. She prepares meals at her home during the Corban Festival, and she has invited Feng to spend this festival with her.Currently, the community has about 740 volunteers and eight volunteer services teams in fields such as transportation, medical services and cultural exchange.XinhuaTheater immersion training provides an opportunity to those not used to the spotlight, Yang Feiyue reports.Jiang Yisen headed out from home at 5 in the morning of July 18, and spent more than 10 hours switching between a bus and the high-speed train before arriving in Huichang county, East China’s Jiangxi province, to pursue his dream in theater.Jiang is about to start his second year at a middle school in Congjiang county, Qiandongnan Miao and Dong autonomous prefecture in Guizhou province, and has been bitten by the stage bug since he watched the classic Chinese play Thunderstorm online a year ago. The play has been widely described as one of China’s most enduring stage plays of the 20th century.Jiang didn’t show any signs of fatigue and got right into a 10-day theater immersion training during the Mailang Teenage Theatre Competition that was jointly hosted by the organizing committee and video-streaming platform Bilibili and received support from the International Council for Film, Television and Audiovisual Communication, a UNESCO advisory body.Jiang says his dream came true when stage professionals held his hands all the way through.“Here, teachers give us guidance at various workshops every day,” Jiang says, adding that now he better understands directing, traditional Chinese opera, and key stage elements, like movement and lighting.Jiang and nine other schoolmates received a fund from the event’s organizers to join the competition and training, which had not been available back in school.Although he didn’t enter the final, Jiang says he has picked up many practical skills.“Many thanks to Mailang for giving us kids from the mountains the opportunity to experience theater, enriching our spiritual world. When I return to school, I want to organize a theater performance so that more students can feel the charm of theater,” Jiang says.He is among more than 80 teenagers from 50 middle schools across the country who joined the competition.They worked in groups of five to create a dozen 20-minute original plays based on given keywords in eight days. Those plays explored multiple themes, including education, relations and the future.A total of six plays entered the final for the top three prizes during the competition that concluded on July 28.The competition aimed to bring together teenagers from all educational backgrounds and enable them to express their ideas, says Yang Ruoran, the event’s initiator.“Many children are from distant mountainous regions and some of them went out of their city for the first time, but their performance was nothing but sincere and complete,” she notes.“I cried several times when watching them perform,” Yang says, adding that many drew inspiration from their hometown experiences.Yang got full measure of theater’s charm in her middle school in Suzhou, East China’s Jiangsu province.“We did many original plays, as well as some classic ones, and in the process of preparation and performance, I found we actually recorded and conveyed many of our ideas and got them across to a broad audience,” Yang says.It prompted her to do a national event and spread the charm of theater among her peers.She then approached stage experts who she met during her theater engagement, including playwright and theater director Stan Lai and his wife Ding Nai-chu, theater producer and CEO of Theater Above, who readily agreed to join her cause.With approval and support of professionals, Yang called upon like-minded classmates and friends and launched a carpet search of schools, looking for candidates.“For example, we might look for a school with very distinctive art education or the one with the least emphasis on art education. We hope to identify schools that represent different education systems,” Yang says.The goal is to have teenagers receive professional theater training, such as play appreciation, preparation, performance, stage design and theater history and culture.The first competition was successfully held last year in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, and managed to attract 80 students from different parts of the country.Lu Haoxin from Foshan city, Guangdong province, joined the competition this year, to explore answers to her current state of life.The 18-year-old just graduated from middle school and finished the college entry examination.She joined the competition to further her interest in stage play, which she says opened her up to a new world during a campus event a few years ago.“We were randomly assigned to teams during the competition, and given keywords of fire, text, and erasable pen,” Lu says.“Initially, we wanted to tell a grand story, but found the idea difficult to materialize. After repeated discussions and rehearsals, we decided to bring the script back to ourselves and our lives, telling the story of the confusion and choices faced by students preparing for the college entrance exam,” she says.Several of her teammates went through the same process, so they settled on the theme about choices and named it Left and Right, which won the third prize.“We used our experiences as a source of inspiration for creation. We had collective discussions, as we brought out parts of each person’s story ... and then expanded on them to create this play,” Lu says.During the creation, Lu says she comes to believe there’s no need to be afraid about confusion, because it is a course of nature.“I think theater represents a kind of vitality for me. It transmits energy to me when I create, discuss and stage it with others,” Lu says.Ding says she was very impressed when Yang approached her to organize such a theater competition, which has been rare among middle school students.“They are willing to put in so much effort and dedicate their time. The joy and happiness they derive from theater are something they are eager to share and promote. For someone who has been working in theater for many years, I feel obliged to encourage and support it,” Ding says.Liu Xiaowei, a tutor at the competition, says he was surprised by the teenagers’ performance.“Their works are full of imagination and creativity, which deeply inspired me. In just 10 days, I witnessed their growth. They even did their own makeup and made their own props, which is so cool,” Liu says.Shao Zehui, who has been tutoring young theater talent for years, says the lectures he gave to those middle school students are the same as those for college undergraduates.“However, middle school students need to focus more on developing their psychological resilience. By practicing their expressions, they can become more accurate and confident on stage, and also gain a better understanding of themselves and connect with society through theater,” Shao says.He believes theater is a lab of life.“The dreams sown by the children today will take root and grow in the future, helping them become outstanding figures in the field of Chinese theatrical art creation,” Shao says.Outstanding performers of the Mailang competition will visit the headquarters of the United Nations and communicate with officers there to promote their art works and tell China’s stories, according to the competition’s organizers.As National Fitness Day approaches, lululemon celebrated the successful conclusion of its 2024 Summer Sweat Games Shanghai regional final competition at Jing’an Kerry Centeron Saturday, transforming the street into a vibrant community space.Nine teams, selected through rigorous store-level competitions, gathered on Anyi Road to vie for a spot in the national top eight, and team ‘Sister Wan is right’ secured their place in the national finals to be held in Beijing on Aug 24.China's first F1 driver and lululemon brand ambassador Zhou Guanyu attended the regional final event and presented medals to the winning teams.“I am also participating in this activity for the second year.I am delighted to see numerous sports enthusiasts gathering to challenge the competition...This event emphasizes teamwork,and it's heartening to witness everyone joyfully sweating in this scorching summer weather,” said Zhou.This year, lululemon took over Anyi Road again and transformed the 267-meter street into a community space, buzzing all day with lululemonAmbassador-led sessions in running, HIIT, yoga, dance, and cardio. Simultaneously, fun activities such as air bikes, flying disks, football ping pong, tug of war kept participants engaged and energized all day.Over the past three years, Summer Sweat Games have evolved into a much-anticipated signature event of lululemon. At its heart are three core themes: Fun, Team Sweat, and Connection—each interwoven into every facet of the event to foster an atmosphere of joy, energy, and healthy competition. This year, the impact of Summer Sweat Games expanded across over 70 stores in nearly 40 cities, drawing more than 10,000 people to sign up and 1,000 teams to participate in both local store-level and city-wide challenges.To date, winning teams have emerged from regional championships hosted in Tianjin, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Wuhan, and Shanghai. In the upcoming week, the excitement continues as competitions kick off in Nanjing, Wuhan, and Shenzhen. Ultimately, the top eight teams will gather in Beijing to compete for the overall national championship title. Even at 80, Mei Jingtian continues to patrol the Shixiaguan section of the Great Wall. With over four decades of experience under his belt, he skillfully taps the overgrown ground along the way with a wooden stick, alerting wild animals to his presence to ensure his safety.Mei lives in Shixia, a village nestled near the 8.6-kilometer stretch of the Shixiaguan section of the Great Wall in the suburban Yanqing district of Beijing, the oldest part of which dates back to the Northern Qi Dynasty (550-577).Shixia village residents have a deep affection for the wall. Mei remembers when he ran and played hide-and-seek with his friends on the imposing structure as a child.However in 1979, when he returned to Shixia after working outside for years, he was stunned by the destruction to the ancient wall. "Some residents even took bricks from it to build their houses," Mei says.To help protect the wonder, Mei volunteered as a guardian, patrolling 20 km each day to dissuade people from taking bricks, scribbling on the wall or dropping litter."My family worried that it would be dangerous to hike in the mountains by myself, so I always took a wooden stick with me to drive the wild animals away," Mei says.In 1984, a Great Wall protection campaign was launched in Beijing and was quickly picked up by villagers in Shixia. Realizing the significance of heritage protection, more and more of them returned the bricks they had taken and joined Mei on patrol.In 2006, and then head of the village, Mei helped set up a local volunteer protection association, and about 80 of the village's 100 or so residents joined as guardians.Inspired by her uncle, Mei's niece Liu Hongyan, followed in his footsteps and officially became a Great Wall guardian in 2019."When I was a child, my uncle always told me his patrol stories and talked about the history of the Great Wall," Liu says. "It is my mission and responsibility to protect cultural heritage."China has continued to step up efforts to protect the Great Wall. From 2015 to 2023, the country approved 289 protection and maintenance projects, and more than 6,800 guardians nationwide are dedicated to protection work.Today, more advanced technology has been adopted for protection. At the Badaling scenic area, which is one of the most popular sections of the wall, a drone patrol platform and intelligent scenic area management platform play vital roles in this effort.According to Liu Manli, deputy director of the Yanqing cultural heritage bureau, the two platforms will be upgraded in terms of resource sharing, process coordination and data analysis.The Shixiaguan section of the Great Wall has not yet been opened to the public. "It is my biggest wish to see heritage well-preserved and available to visit, encouraging more people to join us in protecting the Great Wall," Mei says.HONG KONG — With straight bangs, a pair of gold-rimmed glasses and a soft voice, Rebecca Lee looks more like a teacher than an explorer.The 80-year-old has many identities: photographer, polar researcher, graphic designer, and most importantly, Hong Kong's first female explorer to have set foot on Earth's three extremes — the North Pole, the South Pole and Mount Qomolangma.Now, having hung up her explorer boots, Lee is ready for the next expedition, one that would last a lifetime: environmental protection and education.PARIS — With a pair of spectacles perched on his nose, 66-year-old Han Hua told tales of his illustrious table tennis coaching career, brandishing photos that captured his triumphs in China, Tunisia and France.Born in 1958, Han's passion for table tennis started at a young age. A mix of raw talent and relentless dedication propelled him to junior tournament victories and eventually, to a coveted spot in the national team.China has dispatched coaches in sports like table tennis, badminton, gymnastics and diving to bolster the competitive prowess of nations far and wide since the 1950s. As one of them, Han embarked on a 12-year coaching odyssey in Tunisia in 1984. He swiftly acclimatized to the way of life, relishing the flavors of Chinese and Tunisian cuisine with equal gusto."I immersed myself in Tunisian culture, embracing their cuisine and even mastering French," says Han, recounting his two-year stint at a language school and the rapid progress he made through daily interactions with his team.Under his tutelage, Tunisia's table tennis team dazzled the African continent, culminating in a historic milestone when four Tunisian players clinched spots in the 1988 Olympics, a quarter of the continent's quota at the time.After the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in the United States, Han returned to China to coach the national team, tutoring a generation of prodigies who would go on to clinch international titles and Olympic glory, including Wang Hao, Kong Linghui, Guo Yue and Chen Meng.Known for his language proficiency and deep understanding of the sport, Han has earned accolades from peers and athletes alike."He is very talented. If I coached abroad, I wouldn't get past the language barrier," says Li Sun, head coach of the national table tennis team. "He also has a deep understanding of table tennis and is greatly loved by colleagues and athletes."In the 1990s, France was basking in a golden era of table tennis spearheaded by the indomitable Jean-Philippe Gatien, whose rise as Olympic runner-up and world champion heralded a period of French dominance in the sport.The French team, comprised of Gatien, Patrick Chila, Christophe Legout and Damien Eloi, achieved remarkable feats in the World Cup and World Championships.However, as they retired in the early years of this century, a lull descended on the once-mighty squad, prompting the French Table Tennis Federation to seek a savior in 2013 to restore the nation to its former glory.Han, with his plentiful experience, coaching acumen and fluency in French, stood out as the ideal candidate."From Monday to Saturday, my training regimen in France mirrored the intensity of my days in China," Han says. "I always stood tall during training sessions. No matter how tired I was, I never sat down throughout the six-hour daily session. I came to improve their prowess, so I needed to spare no effort to help them improve as soon as possible."After three years of relentless dedication, Han finally achieved his goal as the French men's team delivered its most outstanding performance in four decades — Emmanuel Lebesson clinched the men's singles title while Simon Gauzy secured the silver medal at the 2016 European Championships.After successfully leading the team to the 2016 Rio Olympics, he transitioned into an assistant coaching role, paving the way for aspiring young French coaches.However, fate took an unexpected turn before the 2018 World Championships when he suffered a cerebral infarction.He returned home to China after the Tokyo Olympics and embarked on renovating his long-abandoned house. "I was at a crossroads. Despite numerous coaching offers from many countries, I realized the importance of prioritizing my health," Han says, reflecting on his journey.As this year marks the 60th anniversary of China-France diplomatic relations, Han emphasizes the significance of the enduring bond between the two nations in table tennis."The old generation of Chinese players competed and coached in France, bringing out many top players. I hope China and France continue to collaborate in the future and experience cultural exchange together," he says.URUMQI — For many visitors, Muztagh Ata, the "Father of Ice Mountains" in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, is appealing for its stunning scenery. However, for Li Yuan, the mountain vistas are both a passion and a purpose.Situated at an altitude of 4,500 meters, the Muztagh Ata base camp has limited oxygen and basic amenities — just a few tents shaking in the wind and simple meals. Despite these conditions, Li, a seasoned mountaineering guide, finds immense joy."With its gentle slopes, Muztagh Ata is relatively easy to climb and is one of the most popular mountaineering destinations in Xinjiang. Some enthusiasts even consider it a sacred site for ski mountaineering," says the guide with the Xinjiang Mountaineering Association.Every year since 2007, Li leaves his bustling city life behind between June and August to embrace the serenity of Muztagh Ata and welcome climbers from all over the world. The snowcapped peak has opened up new possibilities for him.Before he became a guide, Li was working in the clothing industry but felt dissatisfied with life. "I had no way of making breakthroughs or improving myself," he says. He turned to outdoor activities for solace and came to realize that mountaineering could open up a wider and more passionate world and eventually, he decided to resign.At that time, commercial mountaineering was just starting in Xinjiang. Then in his 30s, with neither funds nor a stable source of clients, Li had to start out doing basic jobs, such as working as a porter."In the beginning, I earned only 1,600 yuan ($220) a month and couldn't afford breakfast. I never imagined mountaineering would grow so much," Li says. "But I was content because it gave me more opportunities to climb."These days, the 52-year-old sees mountaineering as much more than a sport. Even though he knows his routine by heart, he still analyzes routes and makes detailed plans for every trip."Everyone starts from scratch on the mountains. They have to fine-tune their skills to push onward. This challenging process changes your perspective on life," Li explains. "Mountaineering showed me that there are many ways to live and it's up to us to choose."When Ouyang Lijuan was a young girl in primary school, she longed for a proper school bag like her peers had.However, growing up in a fisherman's family with three daughters on a remote island in Ningde, Southeast China's Fujian province, money was tight.So, her mother sewed a shoulder bag for her daughter, using a common material in fishermen's households — fishing nets.Carrying this unassuming handmade "school bag", Ouyang would face ridicule from her classmates, who would mock her and toss the bag around the classroom."Back then, I hoped the bag would break quickly. But ironically, while other students' decent bags wore out, mine remained intact," Ouyang recalls.Today, the fishnet bag that Ouyang once wished to discard has inspired her to create a product that represents both the fishing culture and the essence of her island — a handcrafted tote bag, made from recycled materials, such as fishing nets, woven and patched with denim fabric salvaged from old clothes and adorned with shell decorations.The bags are displayed in a coffee shop Ouyang runs on the island as cultural and creative products. The coffee shop was transformed from her grandmother's old brick house, which holds cherished childhood memories."When I was young, many elderly villagers lived in this area. When our parents went to sea to fish and there was no one to cook for us, the elderly would invite the kids over to share a meal," Ouyang recalls.For Katherine Olson, a 29-year-old American from a small town in Virginia, living in China's countryside is like a long-cherished dream come true.In a picturesque town called Baizhang, about 60 kilometers west of the city center of Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province, environmentalist and vlogger Olson lives in a two-bedroom bungalow with a yard planted with trees and bamboo.The tranquil and breathtaking scenery surrounding her home, with its lush green mountains and dense bamboo forests, brings her both peace and serenity."I really love seeing how life is different in different parts of the country," Olson says, sitting in her living room as she talks about her exploration and discoveries in rural China.Describing herself as a nature-loving and adventurous soul who always wants to "experience something different", Olson sees her future outside her home country."I love the whole idea of living my entire life in a different language, marrying someone from a different background, living in a completely different culture and geographical location to what I'm used to," Olson says.Olson's China story began during her college days at Virginia Tech, where she joined a laboratory run by a Chinese professor and made friends with her Chinese peers.This exposure sparked her zest for learning Chinese, which she did through self-study and daily interactions with her Chinese counterparts. She even adopted the Chinese name Yanglizi, the Chinese word for positive ion, which indicates a positive and outgoing personality and links to her major in environmental science.Armed with a name and a grasp of the language, Olson knew what she wanted next: to experience China firsthand.Her first visit to the country was thanks to a college internship in 2016, which brought her to East China's Shandong province and Shanghai. She was impressed with the vastness, diversity and unity of the country, especially the charming rural areas."I thought 'this is great. This country is so cool, so interesting'. It's such a huge country and you can get around basically the whole country speaking one language, which is just really amazing," says Olson.After graduation, Olson came to China to pursue a postgraduate degree in environmental engineering at Nanjing University in Jiangsu province. She now works at an environmental organization based in Hangzhou.During her time as a postgraduate student and after starting her career, Olson took every opportunity to travel. While she appreciates the vibrancy and convenience of cities like Shanghai and Hangzhou, she gradually discovered her true passion for small towns and villages.In her opinion, big cities in China, as well as the rest of the world, are becoming increasingly similar as a result of economic development and urbanization. But small towns and villages still preserve many traditional customs and cultures. China boasts almost all types of ecosystems on Earth, but these can only be truly experienced in rural areas.Olson started making vlogs recording her daily life during the COVID-19 pandemic.She runs the YouTube channel Katherine's Journey to the East, with the name inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, as well as accounts on Chinese video-sharing platforms Bilibili and Douyin.She introduces herself in her profile as a cycling enthusiast who has a deep affection for rural China and aims to share the most authentic and objective portrayal of China with the world.Since September 2020, Olson has posted over 140 videos on You-Tube, with content ranging from campus life to travel and entertainment. She captures the lives of fishermen in a coastal village in Fujian province, films Uygur weddings in rural Turpan in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, and documents a house completion ceremony unique to Baizhang.Last year, she completed a 2,000-km bike tour of Zhejiang and recorded what she saw of China's environmental improvements and cultural charm in a series of vlogs.The environmental organization she works with has an office in Baizhang and offered her a chance to work and live in the village, which she did not hesitate to accept.To Olson, the merits of living in a rural area include close contact with nature and interactions with her neighbors. "We have these beautiful mountains all around us, this bamboo and these creeks and things. So you're really a part of the environment," she says.What Olson presents to the world about China is quite distinctive as few foreign vloggers root themselves in China's rural areas to discover the country off the beaten path.This has gained her nearly 130,000 followers on YouTube, with individual videos amassing views as high as 400,000 and generating hundreds to thousands of comments."Your videos are a great testament of the true nature of the Chinese people: peace-loving, hardworking, family-oriented, law-abiding and kindhearted," says another viewer.Apart from interest in China's countryside and natural environment, foreign viewers often inquire about Olson's living conditions in the comments."They're asking questions like electricity, water supply, roads, internet … People seem to really think that … conditions are not good here. That's how it was 10 or 20 years ago. But for the foreign audience, they may just be unaware that this has changed so quickly," says Olson."I just think China is endlessly fascinating. I've traveled here so much, but then when I look at the map, I feel like I've barely seen anything. There's still so much more," she says.     Recollecting his experience on a jury at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in Cannes, France, in June, Li Chao finds it difficult not to share the groundbreaking ideas he came across at the event. He hails the award-winning works, yet feels regretful for those not awarded but presented equally in innovative spirit and humanitarian issues.The annual festival and awards are a get-together for those from the advertising and communications industries. Li and his team won a Bronze Cannes Lions award last year for their Alibaba Healthy Fonts Project.The project is a Pinyin-based keyboard input method automatically translating Pinyin text into Braille.Zhang Shuangmin might look a bit haphazard as she drips pigment onto a square container of water. The pigments immediately disperse into small circles once they touch the surface of the transparent liquid, and without wasting any time, Zhang swirls them with an awl in seemingly casual movements.As minutes pass, the random arrangement of pigments begins to take shape and eventually evolves into stunning floral patterns.A bigger surprise comes when she gently places a white porcelain plate into the water and lifts it in slow motion. The pattern then magically transfers onto the plate.This procedure never fails to elicit a gasp of amazement from her audience.This type of printing art is known as tangliucai (Tang flowing colors), and Zhang, 53, has practiced the craft for more than three decades."It requires calculation and precision every step of the way," says Zhang, who was born and raised in Xi'an, Shaanxi province."I need to have a design in mind before execution. If I want a pattern to appear in warm colors, I need to plan ahead and use cool colors for the background."I also have to consider beforehand if I will place it on a folding or round fan, a porcelain plate, silk, leather, or any other medium, which will determine the composition of the pattern and ultimately the success of the work."Years of practice has seen Zhang develop a strong leaning toward bringing out Tang Dynasty (618-907) elements when practicing the craft of tangliucai, which was named an intangible cultural heritage in Xi'an in 2020."I want it to match the historical thickness of the art, which boasts a long history," Zhang says.Zhang was first attracted to a rough version of the craft from her grandmother, who would steep various fabrics into dyes, resulting in intriguing patterns.This childhood predisposition to the dyeing art prompted her to pursue design and environmental art at a local art institute in the 1990s, when she got to know her grandmother's daily life production might be associated with the ancient water-printing technique.In Youyang Zazu (The Miscellaneous Morsels From Youyang), a compilation of diverse social and folk narratives by Tang Dynasty writer Duan Chengshi, an ancient technique of coloring paper on water was detailed.Experts regard this collection as the earliest documentation of the historical roots of the practice.Then, in the compilation titled Four Treasures of a Scholar's Study by Song Dynasty (960-1279) scholar Su Yijian, a kind of decorative paper called liushajian, meaning flowing-sand notepaper, was mentioned of being made in what is now Sichuan province.According to this collection, the process of notepaper production involved pulling a sheet of paper through a fermented flour paste combined with an array of colors, resulting in spontaneous and asymmetrical patterns.Furthermore, the compilation described an alternative method using a paste derived from a regional plant blended with croton oil and diluted with water.Ginger extract was subsequently employed to scatter the hues. Then a hairbrush was used to create designs resembling human figures, clouds or flying birds.These intricate designs were then transferred onto a paper surface, showcasing the artistry and skill of the creators."It was so fascinating, yet a great pity," Zhang says about the fact that the art form failed to prosper and was almost on the brink of extinction in the country.As she delved further into her research, she discovered that this art form had transcended borders and acquired unique local characteristics, such as in Turkiye, where the marbling art known as Ebru was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO in 2014.She made a point to pursue the art through scraps of information from historical documents."Many people said it had died. It is not true since we can still find the water-printing technique continuously being applied in marbling Xuan paper," Zhang says.Handmade Xuan paper, or rice paper, was originally produced during the Tang Dynasty in Jingxian county in today's Anhui province, and calligraphy and painting artists have put a premium on it ever since.With an art background, Zhang managed to piece together bits of information and restore the craft through consultations from experts and her own expertise.HAIKOU — In Kuznetsova Aleksandra's studio in Haikou, the capital of Hainan, a tropical island province in South China, an oil painting of St. Basil's Cathedral hangs beside a portrait capturing the grace of a woman from the Li ethnic group, symbolizing two distinct aspects of the artist's life.Raised in a family of artists, the 24-year-old Russian woman developed a profound love for painting from an early age. Six years ago, she relocated to Hainan and set up her studio there.Her enchantment with Chinese culture ignited when she was just 10 years old."I didn't have Mandarin teachers," she fondly recalls."I picked up the language through the internet, books and TV. I simply adore Chinese culture."In 2018, driven by her passion, Aleksandra journeyed to Hainan to study, where she was captivated by the island's tranquil natural beauty and unhurried pace of life."It's an incredibly beautiful place, and the people are kind, charming and authentically simple," she reflects. "Life unfolds at a leisurely pace, allowing them to harmonize with nature."Living in Hainan enables her to immerse herself in nature and humanity, two beloved themes in her artwork. The local people and culture have become essential to her life as she and her husband, whom she met on the island, have ventured through its landscapes together."We ventured into the heart of Hainan. It was during these journeys that I first encountered the Li people," she recalls.The Li brocade has left a lasting impact on her. This traditional textile of the Li ethnic group in Hainan is revered as a "living fossil" of the textile industry, boasting a history of over 3,000 years."When you witness a woman weaving this brocade, she is narrating a tale passed down through generations, such as that of Dalishen, the God of Strength, watching over us. It not only inspires me but also empowers me to create," she says.She strives to capture the intricate patterns of the brocade in her paintings, seamlessly weaving local culture into her creations — a process that has brought her profound satisfaction.Throughout her stay in Hainan, Aleksandra has observed the evolution of the local culture.She expresses delight in the emergence of new cultural landmarks, such as the serene Wormhole Library and the coastal structure Sky Mountain. The latter encompasses bookstores, cafes, galleries and an outdoor stage.Aleksandra highlights the flourishing artistic landscape in Hainan, emphasizing that the island's welcoming atmosphere offers a wealth of opportunities for artists."In recent years, I've crossed paths with numerous artists, designers, filmmakers, photographers, musicians and architects on this island. …The artistic community here thrives on sharing art, music and the simple pleasures of life," she says.In the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Russia and the commencement of the 2024-25 China-Russia Years of Culture, cultural exchange events are underway in both nations."Art transcends borders and possesses the ability to connect disparate cultures," Aleksandra says.With the intention of fostering mutual understanding between the people of China and Russia through her art, she envisions curating an exhibition that showcases the rich tapestry of Chinese and Russian culture."I will stay in China for as long as I can. It's my second home," she says.Xinhua  ALESUND, Norway — In 1963, French geologist Jean Corbel established a small hut near Ny-Alesund, sparking modern research in the high Arctic of the Svalbard Islands in Norway. Since then, the former mining town has evolved into a global center for science, attracting countries like China to its research efforts."It was a very fine event," recalls Kim Holmen, special adviser at the Norwegian Polar Institute, reflecting on the founding ceremony of China's inaugural Arctic research station. China's Arctic Yellow River Station is located on the far east side of the town.According to Hu Zhengyi, the current manager of the station, the institute mainly serves as a support for China's scientific monitoring and research work in various specialties. Hu's research centers on meticulously tracking glacial dynamics which is crucial metrics in understanding the impacts of climate change.Glaciology is a young and relatively niche major in China, Hu says, adding that choosing it normally means that one would be working far from home in what sometimes can be a backbreaking job as it includes field research work on glaciers and trudging across frigid ice while carrying equipment weighing dozens of kilograms."This job is not for everyone," he jokes about the workload.The Chinese station has been carrying out field research on glaciers for over 10 years, including monitoring and research on glacier material balance and movement.Such studies help reveal the glaciers' response to global warming and provide an important basis for predicting the rise of the sea level, Hu says.Other research on the changes in terrestrial ecosystems and studies on marine life contribute to a better understanding of the common challenges faced by humanity.By gathering critical data on the Arctic ecosystems, the research efforts could contribute to developing better conservation measures."The problems we have in front of us are so big that none of us, regardless of how clever we are, could do it alone," Holmen says, stressing the significance of more scientific cooperation between countries.Currently, scientists from over 10 countries are based in the town.Holmen says this is a research town where scientists from all over the world meet, make friends, and build trust, which are essential for dealing with global issues."I believe it can make a difference in the world," he says.As the tour bus zigzagged its way up the hill, the valley below was shrouded in mist.It was around 10 am, but the light rain had dabbed just the right coat of fog to the windows, and the haze made the world appear supremely beautiful, just like the landscape we were about to marvel at.We were a group of about 30 travelers headed to the Wulong karst region, part of the UNESCO World Heritage Property of South China Karst, which comprises seven karst clusters.The karst terrain of Wulong is situated about three and a half hours away from Chongqing, a bustling metropolis famed for its spicy hotpot located at the confluence of the Jialing and Yangtze rivers in southwestern China.Visitors throng to Wulong to see its giant sinkholes, natural bridges and caves; it has a prehistoric charm and a pristine beauty all its own.We had come to experience some of its famed attractions, including tiankeng, or the three natural bridges, and the Longshuixia gap, a deep gorge surrounded by sheer cliff, natural waterfalls and stalactite formations.Our uneventful trip started at 7:30 am sharp from the downtown area of Chongqing, with a break for a sumptuous, yet simple Chinese-style brunch at 10:30 am and arrival at the ticket counters by 11:30 am. A few meters past the entrance is an oversized modern glass ledge that extends a good few meters from the rocky outcrop to offer a spectacular first view.Standing on the transparent structure and considering with quickening breath a drop of several hundred meters is certainly not for the fainthearted, I thought, as I started taking pictures and recording videos. Soon, we embarked on a 45-minute walk along well-cut steps, hugging the cliff face at times, to an elevator for a bottom-up view of the unique bridges as well as to a remarkably well-preserved small outpost that served as a way station and post office for travelers several hundred years ago.In fact, the local authorities have gone the extra mile to ensure that the whole exercise is a hassle-free one for tourists, especially the elderly.The three natural bridges — Tianlong, Qinglong and Heilong — have, we were told, formed stunning backdrops to scenes from Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction and Zhang Yimou's Curse of the Golden Flower.Standing in awe a little distance away from each of the three bridges and clicking quite a few pictures in the rain, I made a mental note to watch these movies once again to admire their grandeur on celluloid. Absorbing the sights and sounds of the bridges was an unforgettable experience and the intermittent drizzle through the day made it even more memorable; their breathtaking scope is sure to blow your mind, too.Two hours later, some of us were hopping on to a minibus to Longshuixia gap, a subterranean world that gradually slopes down to depths of over 250 meters, with steps winding all the way down the craggy limestone gorge to the exit about 2 kilometers away, leaving me wonder-struck at its untamed charm and tranquillity.This is as marvelous as the three natural bridges and a must-see if you plan on visiting Wulong. I was reluctant to leave, I must confess.Our return journey began at 3:45 pm and by the time we reached the city at 6:45 pm, I was already missing the stillness and majesty of the ancient karst.One day in September 2020, Liu Ailun met two little girls in Laos. They were sitting in a tuk-tuk, a common form of public transportation in Southeastern Asia.Captivated by their cheerful smiles and bright eyes, the 31-year-old Chinese photographer asked their father, who was the driver, if he could take photos of them.While chatting, Liu learned that the two sisters were of school-age, but their family couldn't afford their school fees. Liu offered to provide financial support for their education and arranged to meet them the next morning, but the father didn't show up.Determined, Liu managed to locate the family by the end of the day, but they were initially hesitant to trust him. With a local friend vouching for Liu, the family eventually accepted his generosity. Just four days later, the sisters were enrolled in a primary school."I found comfort and inner happiness in helping the girls, so I didn't want to stop," Liu said.In October 2020, Liu initiated a long-term public welfare project called Hope Vision under his own photography brand — "Hope" is also his daughter's name. The project cooperates with a center for disabled children called Hands of Hope in Vientiane, the capital of Laos.Each month, Liu gathers a group of volunteers to visit the hearing-impaired children at the center, providing both material support and emotional companionship.They bring items such as stationery, drinks, food, toys, and other necessities. They also spend half the day engaging with the children by playing games, attending classes, or "chatting" with them using sign language.When the Songkran Water Festival approaches, they would buy a water gun for each child. "This idea came from my daughter and son, who enjoy playing with the kids there," Liu said.In fact, Liu and his two children have set up a family project called Pay it Forward. Occasionally, they help one person in need and suggest that this person also help someone else in whatever way they can, ensuring that the kindness continues and doesn't stop with them."When you see water dripping like this, it usually means there's something wrong with the rubber hose," Lulu (pseudonym) explained in a video on fixing faucet leaks.The video was posted on her channel, "Tutorials for Independent Girls", on the Chinese platform Bilibili. Since May, Lulu has been regularly updating her content, and her subscriber count has grown from a few dozen to over 430,000.Focused on maintenance and improving functionality for women living alone, Lulu primarily shares videos catering to this demographic. She has been creating similar content on other platforms for several years, but the topic has only recently gained significant popularity.According to the 2023 China Statistical Yearbook, one-person households now make up 16.77 percent of all households. A 2021 report by the Beike Institution, which studies the internet and housing market, projects that the number of young adults aged 20 to 39 living alone is expected to increase from 18 million in 2010 to between 40 million and 70 million in 2030."There's a growing demand for tutorial videos of household repair tasks," Lulu said. "I've been living alone for 13 years, and I've learned how to fix many things. My hope is to help as many people as possible, especially girls."However, Lulu faces controversy because some criticize her for potentially stirring gender divides by only targeting "girls" as the channel's name indicates."I didn't choose this name to attract attention or create gender division but to make sure that my videos reach my target audience more easily via algorithms," Lulu clarified."Even if you want to believe women are no less capable than men, the reality is that women often face distinct and sometimes greater challenges in society."Lulu drew from her own experience as an example. She has had a passion for dismantling machines and gadgets since childhood, though her parents had different ideas. "Growing up, my parents often told me what girls should or shouldn't do. However, I believe I should be the one choosing what to learn," she said.She decided to teach herself useful skills that her parents and society hadn't encouraged her to learn. Although video platforms weren't as vibrant 10 years ago as they are now, there were still basic instructional videos available online.Lulu feels a strong sense of responsibility as a content creator."Most of my followers are Gen Zers who are just starting out in the world. Although not all repair tasks are familiar to me at first, I'm committed to learning and practicing so that I can master them and confidently teach my followers," she said.A few weeks ago, Guangdong Machinery Technician College held a job fair for its students, attracting over 152 companies offering more than 3,600 job positions. These opportunities spanned various industries, from intelligent manufacturing to automotive technology and early childhood education.All class advisors for graduating students attended the event, offering detailed guidance.Liu Juan, advisor for the school's computer numerical control (CNC) program, noted that each student in her class had already received an average of five job offers, with internships starting at a minimum monthly salary of 5,000 yuan, including free meals and accommodation.Such scenes are common during the graduation season, with June and July being peak months for university graduates transitioning from campus to the workforce. Job fairs during this time serve as platforms for them to launch their careers.According to the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Guangdong Province, there is a particularly strong demand for blue-collar workers.At a job fair hosted by the Guangzhou Huangpu District Federation of Industry and Commerce, the job supply-to-demand ratio reached an impressive 6:1, indicating that for every job seeker, there were six job opportunities available.In addition to offering over 100 traditional roles in fields like automation control, modern logistics, and graphic design, more than 20 new positions have been introduced, such as AI technology application engineers, data security engineers, and game trainers, providing students with more choices.For manufacturing enterprises that focus on blue-collar workers, the expansion of technology in recent years has led to greater demand for skilled and high-quality talent. Many companies now proactively contact schools to engage in school-enterprise cooperation for recruitment.The "Belt and Road Customized Training Program", launched jointly by Wuhan Huazhong Numerical Control Corporation in Central China's Hubei province and Shenyang Institute of Technology in Northeast China's Liaoning province, is a prime example of this kind of cooperation.Since September 2023, 42 Chinese senior students have been selected for this class, receiving training in both professional skills and Russian. After graduation, these students will work at Huazhong Corporation and other related companies. These companies export a significant number of CNC systems and machine tools to countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, such as Russia and Belarus, where the graduates will work as CNC technicians, performing system debugging and after-sales maintenance.The program includes over 600 hours of customized Russian courses, taught by more than five Russian teachers. The curriculum covers language, cultural etiquette, and local customs.As of this writing, all the students in the class have secured their job placements, with companies eagerly recruiting them even before graduation.Yan Liang, 22, from Qiqihar, Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, is a student in this project. He said the program has made him a versatile talent with both language and technical skills, making him highly sought after in the industry.Another student, Zhai Shengkai, from Dandong, Liaoning, shares similar feelings. "In our mechanical industry, finding a job is not difficult. I didn't feel any employment pressure or anxiety. Even before joining the customized class, I had already received offers from more than three companies," said the 23-year-old. "After the training, the prospects became even better. I now feel particularly competitive."In March, the class also included students from Russia and Belarus to study CNC technology and Chinese. Rychkov Rodion, 20, is one of them. He comes from a town near Lake Baikal in Russia, where young people mainly work in the manufacturing and machine industry, coal exploration, and animal husbandry. He studied petroleum exploration at a university back home and joined the training program because he "really likes China and wants to experience Chinese culture firsthand"."China and Russia have maintained a long-standing friendship. The history lessons I learned in middle school mentioned that China and Russia have supported each other through significant historical moments. The Belt and Road Initiative can enhance the economic development of participating countries and improve people's living standards," Rodion said.He highlighted that the program's curriculum is particularly well-designed, aligning with the most advanced social needs, ensuring that the knowledge system matches real-world demands, and providing students with internship opportunities. "I feel very optimistic about my employment prospects," he said.Jan Kerekes, a Canadian who has lived in South China's Hainan province for six years, traveled extensively around the world before making this island his home.In the latest episode of China Daily's Youth Power, which aired on June 30, Kerekes shared what led him to settle down in Hainan.Although Kerekes was an experienced traveler, he knew little about Hainan before arriving. Over the past six years, he has witnessed the island transform into a popular destination for global adventurers."Hainan is really opening up. The whole world comes here, and you see the opportunities right in front of you," Kerekes said. "It is a place where you can pursue your dreams."One of the eight young guests in this episode, Andreev Aleksei, a 30-year-old Russian, found Kerekes's story particularly resonant. He visited Hainan in 2017 and gradually fell in love with the place."When I went back to my country, I missed the island so much that I had to come back," Aleksei said.Now a teacher at Hainan University in Haikou, the capital city, Aleksei highlighted the island's promising opportunities and abundant natural resources."Hainan not only hosts the Boao Forum for Asia but it is also the best place for windsurfing and parachuting," he said.Aleksei also noticed that the road he used to ride his motorcycle along the Mulan Bay coastline in Wenchang, which was narrow and in poor condition four years ago, is now in excellent shape. Additionally, several new highways have been constructed."At the end of last year, the Hainan Coastal Scenic Highway opened. It's a road that goes all along the island," he said.To encourage international talent to come, Hainan has introduced 16 measures to streamline living and working conditions for foreigners. These measures cover various areas, including entry clearance, accommodation and residency, healthcare, investment, professional qualifications, and business development.For example, Aleksei mentioned that Hainan offers numerous benefits and advantageous policies to assist global talents in establishing businesses in the region."[The application process]takes just three days, and it can be completed entirely online, even for foreigners," he said.Melina Gisela Weber, 31, a German student at Beijing Foreign Studies University who started her business in Beijing, emphasized the importance of getting professional assistance to obtain essential information when launching a business venture in a foreign country.The young guests also visited the Haikou Municipal Government Service Center to learn more about these measures. There, they met people from around the world with different needs — whether for visas, education, or business."I think it's a testament to the inclusivity of the entire province," said Jood Ghazwan Sharaf, a 27-year-old Bulgarian student at Tsinghua University.Dylan Walker, 27, from the United States, was impressed by the efficiency of the "one window for all" system, a comprehensive service approach."It's like a one-stop service," he said. "You don't have to run all over the place."Anne Jing Ping Wen, a 24-yearold from the US studying at Peking University, was surprised to see international signs throughout the hall."A lot of the signs are in English, which is rare and makes it extremely understandable for foreigners," she said.In addition to aiding tourists and residents from around the world in their daily lives and business activities, Hainan has made significant economic progress.One notable example is the Yangpu Economic Development Zone, which has evolved from a small port into Hainan's largest international port.Established as a state-level development zone and approved by the State Council in 1992, it benefits from free trade zone policies and is recognized as the "showcase" of the Hainan Free Trade Port.In the zone, the young guests explored the Yangpu Offshore Wind Power Industrial Park, where they discovered Hainan's commitment to developing its marine economy and striving for a harmonious coexistence with the ocean.Lin Qingsong, the park's general manager, highlighted Hainan's leading role in wind power development, citing its vast sea area and abundant wind resources.According to him, while Hainan's wind power utilization is still in its early stages compared to coastal regions like Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces in East and South China, this project stands out as a pioneering model for future large-scale offshore wind power initiatives."What caught my attention is that this is the very first model used on the island," said Sergi Drago, a 30-year-old Spanish student from Tsinghua University. "The success of this model here will be replicated in other parts of the island. I'm really looking forward to seeing the next steps in development."Sharaf was impressed by China's innovative economic experiments and its hands-on approach of "crossing the river by touching the stones"."We can see that China is not an economy that goes within itself. It goes outward to benefit the rest of humanity," she said. "The experiments that are done here are not limited to Hainan. They also demonstrate that China is willing to work for the future."As a global resident of Hainan, Aleksei encouraged international tourists to explore the region.He believes that this island is not only a dynamic free trade model with great potential and various opportunities for the future but also a natural paradise with picturesque coastal views and a laid-back lifestyle that strikes a balance between work and leisure."This is quite a unique place in China," Aleksei said. "No matter what purpose brings you here, whether it's tourism, starting a business, or work, just come here, and you will fall in love with it."LHASA — Every Monday evening, just before 7 pm, Kelsang Lhundrup begins to close up his coffee shop in Lhasa, capital of the Xizang autonomous region, even though the summer sun still has a couple of hours before it sets.The 25-year-old isn't just a cafe owner; he's also a passionate member of Xizang's only amateur American football team, and for the past two years, Monday nights have been dedicated to practice.The sport was both familiar and alien to the young man. During college, Kelsang Lhundrup discovered it through the movie The Blind Side. Michael Oher's story struck a chord with him, igniting a desire to play American football, even though he didn't have the chance at the time."American football always seemed so cool and thrilling, but no one around me played, and there were hardly any games when I was in school," he recalls.Upon graduating and returning to his hometown, he learned through a friend that there was an American football team in Lhasa. After watching a few practices, he couldn't resist joining. Despite their makeshift training grounds and challenging conditions, the team's passion for the sport was unshaken.In June 2023, Kelsang Lhundrup and his teammates traveled to Chengdu, Sichuan province, to compete in the China National Football League, one of the country's top amateur leagues for American football. It was their debut game and they faced a crushing defeat, losing 60-0. "It was our first game, and we realized the gap between us and the other teams. But our goal was to enjoy the game and learn from the experienced teams," he says.Back in Lhasa, the team intensified training, driven by the loss. Three months later, they returned to Chengdu for another game, this time against the runner-up from the previous year.Kelsang Lhundrup and his team held off fierce first-half attacks with solid defense. Although they lost again and Kelsang Lhundrup was seriously injured, the team knew they had made significant progress."American football was never just a sport. It was a way to prove ourselves to the world," Kelsang Lhundrup says.As he recovered, his coffee shop became a place of solace. He has named it Huddle, inspired by the term in American football."I hope my coffeehouse will bring young people in Lhasa who have dreams and passions together to enjoy coffee and life," he explains.The young Tibetan man finds peace in his coffeehouse and releases stress on the American football field. "It has changed me. I used to be quite introverted, but the sport has made me braver and more outgoing," Kelsang Lhundrup says.Now, the only American football team in Xizang has grown, expanding from its seven initial members to 56.Kelsang Lhundrup and his team are determined to aim for their first victory. "Our goal is to win the first game for Xizang's American football team and to spread American football culture to the young generation here," he says confidently.A "bucket list" is a personal list of goals and activities someone wants to accomplish before the end of their life. Fortunately, I've been able to check off quite a lot of mine, an achievement that many people I know never get the opportunity to do.While most of us don't like to ponder our mortality, the hard fact is that it will come eventually. After the loss of several loved ones, I decided to make my bucket list so that, when I reflect on my life, I'll smile and know that I grabbed every chance at happiness that I could.Some of the things on my bucket list that I've achieved — hiking the Plank Road in the Sky on Mount Huashan in Shaanxi province; diving off the highest platform of 15 meters (50 feet) into the sea at Ariel's Point in Boracay, the Philippines; doing the world's highest commercial bungee jump at 233 meters off Macao Tower in the Macao Special Administrative Region; octopus fishing in the Yellow Sea off South Korea; and much more.The top item on my bucket list, however, is much more difficult to achieve. Being adopted from South Korea to the United States in 1976, I have been searching for my birth parents for the past several years. I can't help but worry that they may not still be living. But having this item at the top of my list urges me to keep trying and I'm planning to visit Seoul in October to continue the search.Rural area benefits from graduate's return and her business acumen, Yang Feiyue reports.With short, neat hair and tan skin, Qi Xiaojing beams with a glow of energy that seems to have her ready to hit the ground sprinting at anytime.In a simple sport suit, the woman, 40, can't help smiling as she introduces a group of guests to her agricultural tourism complex.Tomato murals and sculptures embellish the facility that the group visited late last month. The facility covers an area of 49,000 square meters in Ping'an village, Horqin Right Wing Front Banner, Hinggan League, North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region.The facility, established in 2022, has been filled with laughter since summer arrived as children from across the country have beaten a path to Qi's happy farmland to spend their vacation.They are seen running around and playing sports on the grasslands or engaging in craft projects under professional guidance, such as painting pebbles, creating clay sculptures or making from scratch steamed buns of various shapes and sizes."There's so much fun and learning in our village, from the pastures to the grasslands, where students can pull cabbage, dig celery, pick corn, and shell sunflower seeds," Qi says."This way, they can not only learn from outside the school but also help with farm work," she adds.Qi has been busy these days developing short videos of her renewed summer learning tours and promoting them on the livestream platform Douyin."We have introduced a five-day trip and more than 300 students have come," she says, adding that she expects the number to reach 5,000 this year, about 1,600 more than last year.TAIYUAN — A video of acrobat Niu Rong's performance at an NBA game has gone viral online recently, garnering widespread attention on major video platforms.In the video, Niu, dressed in a bright outfit and high heels, performed to the traditional Chinese song Bridal Sedan Chair. She rides a unicycle over two meters high with one foot, expertly kicking a stack of white porcelain bowls onto her head, which drew applause and cheers from the audience.Known by her stage name "Red Panda", Niu chose the name because red symbolizes China and the panda is the country's treasured national animal, making her a memorable performer to audiences.Niu is one of the most popular halftime show performers in the NBA, with American media hailing her act as "the best halftime show in basketball". Since her debut in 1993, she has performed for 30 NBA teams, showcasing her high-altitude porcelain bowl-balancing acrobatics for 21 seasons. Her journey began in Shanxi province.Born into an acrobat family in Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi, Niu began practicing acrobatics at an early age. "When I was young, I practiced somersaults and handstands but found that I was not good at them. So I chose to practice unicycle bowl-balancing when I was 7," she recalls.Niu's NBA debut came the day before Thanksgiving in 1993 when she performed on the Clippers' home court in Los Angeles, California. Her five-minute performance received four standing ovations."During the performance, four bowls fell steadily on my head one after another. There was applause almost every time I flipped a bowl. I couldn't believe it," Niu recalls.Since then, Niu has become a fixture in NBA halftime shows. "She is the most dominant performer in the NBA, and her bowl-balancing technique is even more accurate than Curry's three-pointers," said an NBA head coach, praising Niu.However, Niu's career has not been without challenges. She once fell from a stool over two meters high, fracturing her arm. "During that time, my father had passed away and I was down for a while. When I tried to go back on stage again, I thought I was ready but I wasn't focused enough," Niu says.In October 2015, Niu overcame her injury and returned to the NBA court, once again becoming a fan favorite.Speaking of her hometown Shanxi, Niu says: "I used to go back to Shanxi at least once a year but I haven't had time to go back in recent years. I must make it this summer."After working overseas for many years, she misses Shanxi's vinegar noodles the most. "When I left Shanxi, it didn't have a professional basketball team. If there is a chance in the future to perform in my hometown, that would be great," Niu adds.XinhuaAs the latest hit TV show To the Wonder has made Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region a trendy travel destination, Zhou Fangyi, a 23-year-old fashion designer, hopes that beyond enjoying the stunning landscape, the lifestyle and fashion of the Kazak ethnic group can be appreciated by more people.At just 33, Zhan Chunpei has already achieved several significant milestones in her maritime career. She is the captain of the Haixun 01, a 5,000-ton patrol vessel belonging to the Shanghai Maritime Safety Administration, and manages a 35-person crew, making her the first female captain of a public oceangoing ship in China, and she has participated in 20 major search and rescue missions, including the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370."I call myself a real 'sister who makes waves'," she tells China Daily in an exclusive interview, referring to the popular reality show Sisters Who Make Waves, in which female celebrities, mostly over the age of 30, are challenged to stage performances that defy Chinese showbiz stereotypes about age.Zhan began her maritime career at the Shanghai Maritime Safety Administration after graduating from the Shanghai Maritime University in 2013. Despite having a variety of opportunities open to her, she chose to dedicate herself to life at sea.When she heard that the Haixun 01, one of the country's largest and most advanced maritime patrol and rescue vessels at the time, was being commissioned, Zhan set her sights on it."I requested a shipboard position several times until a chance finally opened up," she says.Her opportunity came in 2014 when the Haixun 01 was dispatched as command ship for the Chinese fleet taking part in the search for Flight MH370 in the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean. The ship was in urgent need of rescue personnel and Zhan volunteered, becoming a trainee third officer. The experience gave her a passion for maritime rescue operations."I would say the starting point of my maritime rescue career was quite high," she says. "As the on-site command ship for the Chinese fleet, we demonstrated China's technical prowess, and our commitment to international search and rescue efforts."Shi Feng, a determined female distiller, challenges gender norms by mastering the craft of distillation and progressing from apprentice to workshop director.At a workshop of the Yellow Crane Tower Distillery in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, numerous large steel barrels are filled with fermented sorghum mash — the essential ingredient for producing baijiu, a Chinese spirit. Next to these barrels, giant steamers and pipes aid in the distillation process, transforming the grain into liquor, which is then stored for aging.At 30 years old, Shi Feng possesses the ability to tell the moisture content of sorghum simply by squeezing it, with an accuracy margin of less than 1 percent. By handling the mash, she precisely assesses the temperature within a deviation of just one degree. After distillation, she can also determine the alcohol content by observing the size, dissipation rate, uniformity, and longevity of the baijiu's bubbles.It took Shi five years to master these skills. Joining the distillery in 2016 after graduating from university, she started her journey from the ground up, eventually rising to become workshop director by 2021.Proficient in every aspect of the brewing process, she supervises the entire production workflow. Among the 36 employees in the workshop, Shi is the only female distiller and the youngest, yet she now serves as a mentor to all the other distillers.Historically, distillation was considered a "man's job". "Distilling was once physically demanding, so women were not typically involved," Shi explained. "However, with technological advancements, more women now participate in the craft. But still, female distillers are rare."Every morning, distillers must inspect each step of the brewing process to ensure everything follows the set standards. Shi walks over 20,000 steps daily in the workshop's high-temperature environment. On one occasion, she even fainted while working because she was too busy to eat breakfast.Recently, the United Nations Global Compact convened representatives from China, Japan and South Korea, alongside guests from various sectors like business, academia, and media, both online and offline, to deliberate on the creation of family-friendly workplaces with a focus on promoting gender equality.The event witnessed enthusiastic support and active involvement from approximately 50 companies across the three nations. Liu Meng, the head of the China Office at the UN Global Compact, highlighted the pivotal roles of China, Japan and South Korea in regional economic advancement and the shared challenges they face, including gender equality, aging populations, and low birthrates.Liu emphasized the significance of addressing these challenges to ensure the future sustainability of businesses in these countries, underscoring the UN Global Compact's commitment to fostering enhanced cooperation among companies from the three nations to serve as a model for sustainable human development on both regional and global scales through corporate innovation and action.She stressed the importance of achieving comprehensive economic gender equality, including the establishment of gender-inclusive, family-friendly workplaces for working parents. "We urge more business leaders, including men, to take tangible actions," she emphasized.Sawako Shirahase from the United Nations University highlighted the pivotal role that companies can play in driving changes to enhance workplace productivity and innovation. She said that creating family-friendly workplaces is a critical standard that can lead to broader social sustainability.Yeonchul Yoo, the executive director of the United Nations Global Compact Korean National Network, warned about the implications of rapid population decline on the future labor market and business stability, calling for united efforts from businesses in these countries to address the population crisis and align demographic structures with the workforce.Additionally, Liang Xiaohui, an expert in the textile industry, advocated for promoting a more appealing public workplace culture and market environment, especially in traditional manufacturing sectors. He emphasized the importance of factory workers feeling comfortable and at ease in their workplace, achieving personal growth through their work, and supporting children's development to enhance workplace flexibility and attractiveness.Young women in China are reshaping beauty ideals, moving beyond traditional norms toward embracing strength and self-empowerment through sports and fitness, Gui Qian reports.Narrow faces, waists as slender as an A4 sheet of paper, and legs as slim as an iPhone 6 — these were once celebrated beauty standards on Chinese social media, highlighting people's — especially young women's — strong desire for a skinny figure.Yet, these internet-driven trends seem to be fading away as girls engaged in sports and bodybuilding are gaining increased visibility and popularity."I've noticed that more girls are now prioritizing their own happiness and well-being over their body image. Our previous beauty ideals were heavily influenced by idol dramas, favoring pale, slender, and youthful looks. But as we mature, we strive to take control of our own lives," said Zhang Xiao, a 26-year-old from Jinan, East China's Shandong province.Having graduated from the School of Business at Beijing Sport University, where she majored in sports industry and management, Zhang now works at an internet company. Like many young women, she too went through a phase where fitting into Brandy Melville's clothing seemed like the ultimate aspiration.She recalled the brand's arrival in China in September 2019, known for its short, tight, and revealing designs available only in the smallest sizes — creating the phenomenon of "BM girls" on social media, making the "BM style" a coveted trend among young Chinese women.Identifying herself as a "BM girl "at that time, Zhang remembered, "I felt proud wearing it and looking good in it. I enjoyed being one of those attractive girls who could fit into BM clothes as portrayed on social media."However, reflecting on those days, Zhang was startled by the harsh standards she once imposed on herself to conform to the "perfect girl image" depicted online.To achieve her desired figure, Zhang restricted herself to one meal a day — usually a light hotpot without oil or carbohydrates. She used leg slimming massagers daily until her skin turned red and even seriously considered liposuction to achieve the slender waist and neck she wanted, which exercise alone couldn't provide."There was a time when I scrutinized every flaw on my body. I suppose I must have had some kind of psychological issues back then," she confessed.Despite standing at 170 cm and weighing slightly over 50 kg, Zhang managed to trim down to 48 kg through these extreme measures.Zhang's experience is not an isolated one.Dai He, a 34-year-old jewelry designer from Shenyang, Northeast China's Liaoning province, and a national champion in freediving, also resorted to extreme weight loss approaches in pursuit of societal beauty ideals.She experimented with acupuncture, sauna sessions, the Copenhagen diet, and even tried eating only apples for a week.Such experience is also familiar to Yu Jiayue, a 28-year-old from Tonghua, Northeast China's Jilin province, who is now a model and sports influencer with over 270,000 followers on the Chinese lifestyle-sharing platform Xiaohongshu.Owning a fit and muscular physique now, she underwent a period of both physical and psychological torment around nine years ago when she first joined her university's modeling club due to her height."At that time, I felt deeply inadequate compared to other models, so I went to extreme lengths to lose nearly 10 kg," Yu recalled."I wouldn't step outside my dorm room without makeup, not even just to take out the trash. If I had to, I'd wear a mask. It's only in the past two years that my body and appearance anxieties have begun to ease."Reflecting on the painful struggles these women face with their bodies, Zhang said, "How did weight loss become such a dominant focus for so many women aged 18 to over 30? Unbelievable."Winds of changeZhang's transformation began during the COVID-19 pandemic when she came to realize the paramount importance of health. She started eating well and exercising, eventually joining a rock climbing club where she discovered a newfound passion for sports.Currently, she visits climbing gyms more than three times a week and engages in daily strength training. Her hands have toughened with calluses, her body has grown more muscular, and she feels stronger each day. Gradually, her focus shifted away from the pursuit of slimness."Many girls simply lack the initial push to start their fitness journey. Any sport can be enjoyable if it resonates with them, motivating them to dedicate time each week," she said.Dai has also witnessed a significant change, noting a decline in body shaming. "Several years ago, wearing leggings in public would draw stares. Nowadays, regardless of body shape, more girls confidently wear whatever they choose. In workplaces, gyms, and various other settings, you can see more self-assured women embracing their unique styles," she said."It's not that being slim and fair-skinned is no longer desirable, but beauty standards have diversified and become more inclusive. Chinese girls with darker complexions and more muscular physiques can now take pride in symbolizing strength, speed, and athletic prowess."Yu's modeling journey may indicate shifts in the market. While mainly collaborating with sports brands, even these brands used to criticize her for being "too muscular" just a few years ago. However, in recent years, the criteria for models have become more flexible and diverse."Today, many brands prefer a wide range of models: from slender to muscular, slightly curvy, and more. Instead of merely showcasing body shapes, brands want their models to convey a vibe — a relaxed, joyful energy with contagious enthusiasm," she said.However, Yu acknowledges that the pressure to lose weight remains a prevalent trend. Even as she shares numerous videos online about fitness and self-acceptance, she continues to receive comments from girls anxious about why they haven't lost weight despite regular exercise.Possible remediesYu describes herself as a "developmental" influencer. Since starting her fitness journey and becoming a vlogger about seven years ago, she has experienced emotional highs and lows similar to those of her followers. She firmly believes in the transformative power of exercise."For me, working out is life-changing. It has shaped both my inner and outer self," she said.According to her, the positive impact of exercise on the body is immediate and noticeable, creating a sense of continuous progress. The joy and confidence gained from achieving fitness goals can also extend to other aspects of life, boosting self-esteem, patience, and inner peace. At the same time, a better physique naturally follows as a byproduct.For Zhang, developing a deeper sense of self-awareness is crucial in easing concerns related to appearance and body image. Through rock climbing, she has learned to use her body more effectively and discovered her potential and capabilities."The critical gazes and self-doubt many girls direct toward themselves often stem from a lack of strong self-awareness, leaning too heavily on the approval of others," she said. "Products that promise to 'enhance beauty' exploit this insecurity. Once girls transcend this, they can appreciate their bodies without constantly seeing flaws."While Dai no longer struggles with appearance-related anxieties, she remains "attentive" to her physique. "I don't care how others see me, but I maintain my own aesthetic standards and strive to uphold them," she said."When I was overweight or weak in the past, I felt disconnected from my body, less sensitive, and constantly tired. Through exercise, I began to appreciate the strength and intricacies of my body, finding joy in rediscovering and understanding myself."Dai believes an ideal woman is someone with a unique style and confidence. For her, style reflects a person's inner stability — whether sporty, traditional Chinese, nature-inspired, or casual, she embraces her distinctiveness. Confidence, she asserts, arises from having "a little world of her own" — be it professional accomplishments or dedication to hobbies."Our country is so vast that people's lifestyles and states of living are very different. So why should beauty standards be the same?" said Dai. "I hope those who still hold narrow views on beauty and excessively scrutinize women can catch up and evolve."Sports educator helps lead hockey-like game to greater heights, Hou Chenchen reports.Eight months remain until the 9th Asian Winter Games in Harbin, capital of Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, yet in May, most parts of China were in the midst of spring, with natural ice surfaces rare sight.Because of this, an "alternative ice sport" from Europe is gaining popularity in China. The story began in 2002, physical education teacher Chen Xin, then 27, stepped into a Swedish sports club in Shanghai.The Shanghai International Studies University (SISU) teacher had felt there was a significant decline in student enthusiasm for sports and wanted to find out about activities that might appeal to young people.At the club, Chen witnessed a spirited game amid towering Swedish athletes, a petite girl held her own, moving about her competitors with fervor and determination and using her stature swiftly and effectively in defense and offense.It was Chen's first encounter with floorball, and she found it exhilarating, engaging and, crucially, safe and easy to grasp."That's the sport I'd been searching for," Chen recalled.Floorball, also known as indoor bandy, is a type of floor hockey with each team consisting of five players and a goalkeeper wielding blade-topped sticks to hit a plastic ball. The game was invented in Sweden in the late 1960s and quickly became popular for its minimal equipment and space needed. By the 1970s, formalized rules were established, signaling the advent of floorball as a competitive sport and ensuring it was increasingly played across the world.On top of a growing number of fans like sports teacher Chen, floorball is also offering a way for many athletes to focus on an activity that can allow them to train during spring and summer.Compared to hockey, floorball is designed to be safer with its lightweight sticks made primarily of carbon material together with hollow plastic balls perforated with holes to reduce injury risks. The sport requires speed, agility and teamwork.Convinced of its potential, Chen resolved to introduce and popularize it within the university. The first step was to garner interest among her students."Since nobody knew about this sport, I wanted to draw students in by associating it with something more familiar. This sport bears similarities to ice hockey, but without skates," Chen said."Thus, 'land-based ice hockey' (handi bingqiu in Chinese) became its name in China."In February 2018, China unveiled the Olympic Education Programme for Primary and Secondary Schools in preparation for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, including plans to introduce non-ice variations of winter sports in select southern cities. The move aimed to cultivate the interest of young people in winter sports and facilitate a gradual transition to traditional ice-based activities.In February 2019, the General Administration of Sport of China officially recognized floorball as one of the promotional projects for winter sports leading up to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.Since 1998, the Fondation L'Oreal and UNESCO have annually honored five exceptional female scientists from different regions. The program promotes their work globally and empowers them as role models. Laureates are recognized for their scientific achievements and contributions to global research.One laureate is selected from each of the five major regions: Africa and the Arab states, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and North America. The program has recognized 132 winners from more than 110 countries and regions, including seven Nobel Prize recipients and eight scientists from China.2024 LaureateYan NiengChinese Academy of Sciences academician, university professor at the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University, founding president of Shenzhen MedicalAcademy of Research and Translation, and director of the Shenzhen Bay Laboratory She was awarded for discovering the atomic structure of multiple membrane proteins that mediate the traffic of ions and sugars across the cell membrane, revealing principles that govern cross-membrane transport.2022 LaureateHu HailanProfessor and executive director of the Neuroscience Center of Zhejiang University School of MedicineShe was awarded for major discoveries in social and emotional neuroscience.

Her research promotes the development of related disciplines and provides crystal structure information of new materials, which helps to draw the laws of the relationship between material properties, structure and technology.Driving ambition fuels the passion required for success, Li Yingxue reports.During high school, Yan Nieng envisioned a career in journalism. Even today, she jokes on her Weibo account that writing short tweets undermines her dream of becoming a literary giant.However, after more than two decades in scientific research, Yan, now 47, finds the field of science to be an indispensable part of her life."I could not imagine myself not being a scientist," she remarks.Yan likens her research to playing video games, where each step leads to new questions and challenges."I pursue scientific research because it's fun," she says, highlighting her passion for the ever-evolving nature of scientific discovery.Yan, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a professor at the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University, also serves as the founding president of the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation and is the director of the Shenzhen Bay Laboratory.Yan balances her demanding roles with a strict schedule: administrative duties during office hours and scientific research in the evenings.She often reads and writes essays late into the night, relying on numerous cups of coffee to stay alert for early morning commitments.The past two weeks have been as busy as ever for Yan. She presented reports at Stanford University and the University of California in the United States, fielded questions about China, and even made a trip to Paris. This time, however, the trip was not for a science forum but to receive an award.On May 28, at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, Yan was honored with the 2024 L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science International Award for the Asia-Pacific.Yan was recognized for her groundbreaking research in structural biology, which has shed light on multiple disorders, including epilepsy and arrhythmia, and has informed on the treatment of pain syndromes.As the eighth Chinese scientist to receive this prestigious award, Yan discovered the atomic structure of several membrane proteins responsible for the transport of ions and sugars across cell membranes, uncovering fundamental principles that govern cross-membrane transport."We aim to push the envelope of human knowledge," she says. "Using pioneering technology, I have transformed my work from the exploration of physiological and cellular processes to achieve a more precise view of potentially effective health solutions. Ultimately, I'd like science to understand the universe, the origins of life and the basis of consciousness."In particular, Yan is exploring voltagegated sodium channels, which control the electrical signals that enable rapid responses to various stimuli in the body. For these channels to function effectively, they must open and close quickly.In 2017, Yan used cryo-electron microscopy to reveal, in high resolution, the structure of a sodium channel isolated from electric eels.This breakthrough allows scientists to observe the active mechanisms of medicines and toxic substances, paving the way for new therapeutic solutions."In structural biology, we always proudly say that seeing is believing," she says."Observing the structure at an atomic resolution allowed us to solve the puzzle immediately — I felt it was a miracle created by nature," she adds.For Yan, winning awards used to be a matter of pride when she was younger.However, this time, she feels a stronger sense of duty."Firstly, it's about sharing scientific knowledge with the public. Secondly, although I've tried to avoid it, I now see the importance of being a role model for younger scientists," she explains.There's also the responsibility of being an ambassador for international exchange and communication, she adds.Esteemed academician makes dream of building a world-class university in Shenzhen a reality, Xing Wen reports.When a scientist with entrepreneurial experience makes establishing a world-class university in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, a thriving industrial center, his life's ultimate goal, anticipation swells — what kind of institution will emerge?At 61, Fan Jianping, an esteemed academician of the International Eurasian Academy of Sciences, started this endeavor in 2018.That year, Fan assumed the position of director of the preparatory office for the establishment of the Shenzhen University of Advanced Technology.On June 5, the Ministry of Education announced the founding of SUAT, which is set to officially begin enrollment this September. The ministry hopes that the university will focus on serving the development of national strategic emerging industries and future industries. It aims to promote the integration of industry and education, as well as the convergence of science and education.Additionally, the university expects to attract a top-tier faculty, develop world-class disciplines, cultivate talent, produce outstanding achievements, and actively explore new models for operating research-oriented universities.Fan's expertise spans high-performance computing, cloud computing and parallel and distributed computing.Fan's illustrious career, marked by significant contributions to the development of China's renowned "Dawning Series" supercomputers and the founding of the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, underscores his capabilities for this venture.After earning his PhD from the Institute of Computing Technology at the CAS in 1990, Fan was engaged in the development of the Dawning I high-performance computer.As a key founder of the "Dawning Series" supercomputers, he played a pivotal role in driving the large-scale industrialization of high-performance computing in China.In 2006, his leadership extended to his role as the founding dean of the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, which has fostered close collaborations with enterprises in Shenzhen, addressing industrial challenges and pioneering key technological breakthroughs.SIAT was jointly established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Shenzhen government and the Chinese University of Hong Kong in February 2006.Chen Xue's podcast "Rich-Minded Girl" aims to empower young women to pursue financial independence, encouraging a mindset of exploration and action.Living in an era brimming with opportunities and challenges, an increasing number of young individuals are striving for financial independence through their own efforts.Last year, a podcast named "Rich-Minded Girl" emerged as a true "electronic energy boost" for many of these youths. Over the course of about a year, this show, featuring interviews with around 60 young women, garnered a following of over 600,000 subscribers online, including more than 230,000 followers on the Chinese podcast platform Xiaoyuzhou.Among the two hosts of the podcast is Chen Xue, a "rich-minded girl" herself and the driving force behind the podcast's inspiration. At 30 years old, she not only diligently pursues financial success herself, but also shares stories of hardworking women and unveils wealth-building strategies that ordinary people can learn from.Originally from a modest county in Lu'an, East China's Anhui province, Chen began her wealth-building journey during her university days in Shijiazhuang, the capital of North China's Hebei province.She made her first significant earnings by leveraging information gaps in her work as a purchasing agent. Progressing to organizing campus events, she transitioned from a mere executor to a team leader, gradually gaining expertise and income through collaborative efforts.Upon graduation, Chen joined a prestigious advertising firm as a staff member. However, the monotonous routine left her feeling lost without a clear sense of purpose in life. So, in 2019, she bravely resigned from her job without a backup plan. Since then, she has explored various avenues of generating income, including roles as a sneaker vendor, community manager, and provider of paid online courses.After three years of freelancing, Chen earned her first million yuan.At the invitation of her friend Xiaohui, she recorded a podcast episode to share her wealth-building stories, which deeply resonated with the audience. In March 2023, the two decided to evolve "Rich-Minded Girl" into a stand-alone podcast.Reflecting on the podcast's Chinese title, which translates to "moneymaking girls", Chen said that the term "moneymaking" once carried a stigma and was considered tacky. People preferred expressions like entrepreneurship, business models, and financing. However, as she pointed out, with growing societal acceptance, people have begun to understand that making money isn't pejorative."It's about taking actions, not just the outcome, which gives it power," she said.But why the focus on women? Over the past decade, Chen has witnessed the increasing influence of women, observing them carve out spaces in various fields. Drawing from the motivation she received from watching women's talk shows and participating in women's support groups early in her career, she solidified her determination to spotlight women."There have always been remarkable women passing the torch, inspiring others like a spark. I was ignited by these individuals, and now I want to ignite more," she said.The "moneymaking" girls Chen has interviewed come from varied professions, age groups, and social backgrounds. They range from entrepreneurs, students, and office professionals to factory workers and stay-at-home mothers. Chen aims to showcase a diverse array of examples and positive energy, demonstrating the many possibilities available to young women.Chen even interviewed three guests born after 2000. Xiao'e, an AI artist, takes orders on the lifestyle app Xiaohongshu to create avatars and illustrations for clients. Ningning uses memes to attract traffic on social media and collaborates with businesses to monetize the traffic. Huya, driven by her passion for fandom, ventured into moneymaking through WeChat shops and online premium courses."I've noticed distinct traits among the moneymaking girls born after 2000: they are more daring and less constrained," Chen observed.Chen recognizes that while some may see her as highly active and agile, she still maintains a disciplined approach, which might stem from her upbringing. The older generation taught her the importance of securing a stable, respectable job and proving herself to others. "However, the post-2000 generation seems less obsessed with finding a traditional job, displaying a greater sense of freedom and ease," she added.Regardless of age, Chen has noticed some common characteristics among all the moneymaking girls she interviewed. "They share a restlessness, a bias toward action, and a refusal to waste time on internal conflicts," she explained.Reflecting on her own journey, Chen realized she had engaged in many activities and experimented with various projects. Likewise, her interviewees also achieved their current success after going through a series of endeavors and preparations. "Therefore, I believe in the value of exploration. This is the advice I consistently give: stop doubting yourself, take the leap first, and evaluate the results afterward," she said."We often hear people say, 'I noticed this opportunity before but hesitated to act. Now, seeing others seize it, I feel envious and regretful. If only I had taken action at that moment, things might have been different.'"According to Chen, being proactive means seizing opportunities promptly, and during the process, developing transferable abilities like communication and sales skills."The essence of making money boils down to selling, whether it's oneself or a tangible product," said Chen. She explains that selling oneself involves personal branding, like becoming an influencer on social media, while selling products leads to e-commerce. Selling knowledge translates to offering paid content. "Various business models can be broken down in this way," she added.During the process, particularly when faced with challenges or setbacks, individuals often fall into self-doubt — getting stuck in emotions or overthinking. "How will others think of me if I do this? What if I don't do it well? Even after completing a task, self-blame may arise, focusing on areas where one could have done better," Chen explained."This significantly affects one's ability to take action — just like a computer slowing down or freezing when running multiple programs. Therefore, I consciously avoid self-doubt and channel my energy into the task at hand."After a year of dedicated effort on the podcast, "Rich-Minded Girl "stands out as a defining accomplishment for Chen, serving as her "calling card and signature work", as she describes it.However, much like these ambitious young women she introduces to her audience, this latest venture represents just a phase in Chen's exploratory journey. She has decided to entrust the program to her co-host Xiaohui and embark on an exciting new chapter.Chen has personally pledged to "support 1,000 'rich-minded girls' in their growth and help them find their value and places in the business world". She will still be committed to fulfilling this promise, as her essential goal in life is to "make a mark on herself and the world".Many people believe that special education teachers for hearing-impaired children primarily teach sign language. Meet Li Hongjia, 33, who works at Xiaokuihua Rehabilitation Center in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, specializing in hearing recovery and language acquisition. She doesn't know sign language.Having dedicated over 15 years to assisting hearing-impaired children, Li has helped more than 600 of them learn to speak.According to her, although many adults with hearing impairments use sign language, for people who don't know sign language, communicating with them can be challenging. This is why Li's been dedicated to teaching listening-impaired children to speak. "Most listening-impaired children have healthy vocal cords," she said. "And with technological advancements and proper and early intervention, they can speak and have various options for their future."Li points out that with the use of hearing aids and cochlear implants, most children will regain their hearing, except those who have auditory nerve disease or severe cochlear malformations. "Hearing sounds is just the first step, they need to learn to identify and understand these sounds," she said.Li stresses that the golden period for listening-impaired children's language acquisition is 2 to 6 years old, which is also the common age range for her students."In many facilities, they tend to follow hearing recovery with language acquisition, but I usually do them simultaneously. I want to make sure even if they have severe conditions that may not allow them to hear as well as others, they can still speak," she said.To help children identify and understand sounds, Li uses various methods, such as having them touch her throat while she speaks, using instruments like triangle irons and drums for sound recognition, and asking them to hand her objects in the room, such as a cup.Li highlighted that imitation is crucial in language acquisition, listening-impaired or not."If they don't have the basic ability to imitate, we cannot begin speech training," said Li. "I've had students with developmental delays, and I would start by asking them to imitate my movements while ensuring they maintain attentiveness and eye contact."For the speaking part, Li initially encourages laughter. "The vocal cords are most relaxed when we cry or laugh," she said. "When a child laughs, I would praise them and tell them 'Yes, you've just made a sound!'"Nowadays, Li's schedule is packed with classes from 7 am to 8 pm with a half-hour lunch break in between. Most of the recovery classes are one-on-one sessions lasting 50 minutes, with Li leading for 30 minutes and her assistant teacher staying for the rest. This is how she could help 24 children in one day.Li faced countless challenges, especially in the first few years. There were moments when she cried and suspected that the students were failing on purpose in her most fragile times. Once, she had to repeat the process of getting a cup 200 times before the child finally got it right. Another time, she had a student with facioplegia, requiring her to massage the child's face repeatedly with hot and cold water.Li shared a touching story about a student with congenital underdeveloped cochleae, who doesn't have any cochleae at all, making her unable to receive an implant. The little girl hails from South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. Being far from home, she would cry and cling to Li when it was time for Li to get off work."I took care of her both at school and at home for a year and a half," Li said. "It took her six months to identify the sound of the triangle iron and I felt close to a mental breakdown. However, the moment she handed me the lollipop I asked for, I realized that we shouldn't give up on any child."Despite her experience and expertise, Li still tears up and gets sentimental every time a child utters their first words. The sense of fulfillment never gets old for her."My nickname is Rongrong, and the children affectionately call me Rongrong Mama," said Li.Reflecting on the past, Li noted that there were no specialized majors in special education when she first started. "Now, more and more Gen Zers are pursuing careers in special education," Li said. "I hope more will join us because helping one child recover means healing an entire family."Regarding what others can do, Li suggested maintaining an open mind and exercising patience."When you see one of these children, please don't act surprised or point. While talking to them, be patient and repeat your words when necessary," she said.Explaining the nuances of history captures more attention by using a unique approach, Yang Feiyue reports.Zhang Bin, a tour guide in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, recently changed his working approach. Widely known as Bingdan ("ice egg"), an influencer in his 30s with more than 8 million followers on short-video platform Douyin, he released a tour guide video with English subtitles late last month."Riding a bike on the ancient city wall is certainly a nice tourist experience, but why not see the Terracotta Warriors now that you are here," Zhang comments in the video about a video posted by an international tourist who recently visited the city.In the video, Zhang also recommends local specialties travelers shouldn't miss out on and demonstrates how to make digital payments using their mobile phones.It's his latest endeavor to convey the city's charm to inbound travelers, as he has witnessed the country's commitment to welcoming international tourists.Last month, about 400 representatives of governments, institutions and tourism-related enterprises of two of the world's biggest economies attended the 14th China-US Tourism Leadership Summit held in the ancient Chinese city of Xi'an. Zhang accompanied them to several well-known tourist attractions during their stay, including the Grand Tang Dynasty Ever Bright City, a 2.1-kilometer street where Tang-style architecture, featuring flying eaves and layered pavilions, abound and the glorious culture of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) is presented in modern style.Carrying a distinctive local accent, Zhang rose to fame with his humorous delivery on the Terracotta Warriors at Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum. "I tend to use humor to pique more curiosity about the history and culture of Xi'an, maintaining tourists' enthusiasm," Zhang explains.He often interlaces the Shaanxi dialect and anecdotes about the museum with technical explanations to liven up the trip, which usually lasts more than two hours.Zhang has a bag of tricks to enhance his delivery of those cultural relics. He jokingly shows the resemblances between certain Terracotta Warriors figurines and entertainment celebrities.This is always widely appreciated.Recognized for her research in structural biology, academician Yan Nieng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been honored with the 2024 L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science International Award for the Asia-Pacific region.What does this recognition mean to her? What unique qualities do women possess that enable them to contribute to the field of science? With these questions in mind, we talked to Yan Nieng to find out. National May 1 Labor Medal winner goes above and beyond to overcome obstacles, committing to the development of his hometown, Yang Feiyue reports.Lhalung Dorje, a 17-year China Post staff member in his hometown Ruo'ergai county in Sichuan province, has not only overcome the demanding conditions of the plateau over the years to deliver to residents, but also helped promote the area's produce via livestreaming.He recently drove five hours from his hometown to Wenchuan county in the northwest of the province to sell cherries."It's the season for local cherries and I go there at this time each year to help promote their sales through livestreaming," says the 40-year-old man.During preparations for the broadcasts, he is a man of few words who appears to be a bit reserved when meeting strangers.Yet, once the camera rolls, he is charged with the energy to vigorously explain the details of the local specialty.The five-hour drive late last month didn't seem to deter his enthusiasm. "I'm used to being on the road," he says.Years of delivering packages across the county and interactions with the residents have given him a deep understanding of the local produce and knowledge to find high-quality products at affordable prices.In March 2021, he started his first livestreaming sales event, selling dried yak meat, milk powder, local pickled vegetables, dried mushrooms, buckwheat noodles and fruits."I tried to help my fellow villagers in pastoral areas sell their high-quality products so they can receive extra income," he says.To date, he has broadcast about 10 livestreaming sessions, with sales reaching approximately 4 million yuan ($552,000).Yet, Lhalung Dorje's main responsibility still lies with his postal service.Ruo'ergai sits in the Aba Tibetan and Qiang autonomous prefecture on the northeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.The special geographical conditions make for stunning landscapes, yet pose challenges for travelers, especially postal service workers like Lhalung Dorje.His routine routes are on average 3,500 meters above sea level and run more than 100 kilometers in their entirety through pastoral and forest areas that are full of hazards.To date, he has covered more than 500,000 km and delivered more than 5 million documents and packages, without a miss.His dedication to the industry has won him numerous awards, including the National May 1 Labor Medal in 2021, one of the most prestigious awards for working people in China.Influenced by his father, who also worked as a postal delivery man, Lhalung Dorje considers it a huge honor to live up to his responsibilities."I felt like my father was a hero, wearing the uniform, carrying his bag and traversing the mountains and valleys," he recalls.He remembers loving to sit on the front of the bike as a child and feeling the warmth of his father behind him, even during the wintertime.The sight of the villagers sharing joy with his father when receiving their letters and packages has long been etched in his mind.In 2007, Lhalung Dorje followed in his father's tracks."He told me on the first day that now that I had made my choice, I had to see it through," Lhalung Dorje says.Two Gen Zers from across the Taiwan Strait unite to craft a humorous sketch blending mainland and Taiwan culture, highlighting the power of comedy to bridge divides through laughter.Comedy has a unique way of bringing people together. This is a belief shared by many comedians, including Wang Zongnan and Zhu Dunhua, two Gen Zers from across the Taiwan Strait.Wang, hailing from Chengdu in Southwest China's Sichuan province, is a graduate student at Tsinghua University and a devoted enthusiast of stand-up comedy. Zhu, originally from Taipei in China's Taiwan region and now also studying at THU, serves as the president of the THU Comedy Club.In just seven days, the two collaborated to create a comedic sketch based on a topic related to Taiwan. Their performance on March 29 at THU's i-Center was met with resounding applause and laughter.Their creative process is featured in the latest episode of China Daily's Strait Forward, a program that focuses on youth from both the Chinese mainland and Taiwan.Their show, titled Free for Hometown Folks, told a story set in a barber shop in Chiayi county, Taiwan, in 1999.Wang portrayed the barber, a Sichuan native who had lived in Taiwan for over 40 years and decided to offer free haircuts to his fellow Sichuanese. Zhu played a 25-year-old local woman who, in a humorous twist, attempted various schemes to pass herself off as a Sichuanese, setting the stage for a delightful farce.Wang introduced the concept for this sketch, explaining, "For a sketch, we typically need a comedic premise, something absurdly funny. It could be a character quirk or a particular setting. The humor escalates as the sketch progresses."Speaking about the elderly man in the Taiwan barbershop, Wang said, "He relocated from Sichuan. So, when he encounters someone from his hometown, he becomes nostalgic. He gets really excited and offers them a free haircut."Zhu agreed with his idea. "I find it quite plausible," she said. "It resonates with the feelings of homesickness that mainlanders in Taiwan experienced during that time."Zhu herself also identified with these sentiments. "My name, 'hua', was given to me by my father because he wanted me to remember my Chinese heritage," she explained. "My sister's name also contains 'hua' in it."Now that Zhu's family has moved from Taiwan to Beijing, she aims to pursue her career there. "Beijing feels like my second home," she said.Reflecting on her comedic journey, Zhu remembered listening to many mainland radio comedy programs during her childhood, such as The Merry Teahouse and Laugh Your Way in the Wild West, as well as traditional crosstalk, which significantly influenced her comedic personality.If life is like a long hike for everyone, then Wang Guihong has encountered a few "bumps" at the starting line.Wang, 23, comes from a farming family in Sihe village, Laifeng county in Enshi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture, Central China's Hubei province. At the age of 3, she lost her right leg in a traffic accident.Even after the amputation, Wang wasn't completely out of danger. Several hospitals issued critical illness notices, but her mother never gave up hope. "If it weren't for my mother, I wouldn't be standing here today," Wang said.Wang's father hired a carpenter to make crutches for her because she needed a new pair almost every month.This was just the beginning of her many challenges. During her second year of high school, Wang was diagnosed with severe hydronephrosis. Opting for a conservative and temporary measure, she used a renal drainage bag until after her college entrance exam, when she had the diseased kidney removed.Despite facing health challenges, Wang was admitted to the School of Foreign Languages of Wuhan University of Biotechnology in 2019 to pursue an associate degree in Business English. Even while using crutches, she enjoyed a vibrant school life, encountering warmth and kindness."My classmates genuinely respected me, treating me like they treated everybody else. Sometimes I even forgot that I was different," said Wang.Wang ran for the position of psychological commissar in her class. Her speech and positive energy deeply impressed Wang Keyun, who later became one of her closest friends. "She never complains about the challenges she faces or is sensitive about her disability. She simply walks at a slower pace than most people," said Wang Keyun.The prolonged use of crutches caused Wang to develop scoliosis. During high school, one of Wang's classmates got a prosthetic leg, which sparked hope in her. However, the price tag of over 100,000 yuan was astronomical for her family at the time.Her parents saved, borrowed, and finally raised the funds needed.After getting the prosthetic leg, a period of adaptation and practice followed. Wang lost count of the falls and scars accumulated in the first six months before saying goodbye to the crutches she had relied on for the past 19 years."The prosthetic leg company offered to coat the metal in flesh-colored paint, but I declined. This is the real me, a part of me," said Wang.The school administration and staff have also gone the extra mile to enhance Wang's college experience and ease financial burdens. They relocated her to a sunnier dorm due to her rheumatism condition, and helped her apply for various programs and scholarships.Multiplayer challenges are not just for the young as older generations join the action, Wang Qian reports.Communicating over a headset with her fingers flying across the keyboard, Yang Xiurong, 53, is a formidable participant in the popular multiplayer online battle arena Honor of Kings, also known as Arena of Valor.Teamed with her daughter Wu Sijia, 29, Yang made a name for herself in a suitably combative tournament held in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan province, in 2022.She was awarded the title of the most valuable player in a match for her outstanding performance operating the support hero Yaria during the event."Just like square dancing, mobile games are a way of entertainment, which should not be limited by age. For people who are getting old, like me, we can still feel young," Yang says.She has gone viral on microblogging platform Sina Weibo after her passion for the video game made national headlines. The story was viewed more than 35.6 million times. A netizen named Chenxi comments that it is "the ideal life after retirement".Early last year, sponsored by food delivery platform Meituan Waimai, Qin Yuliang, 53, Ge Xiaoxiang, 56, Zou Xiaodong, 60, Fang Weihua, 56, and Yang as the captain, set up their team called Xiyanghong (Sunset Red) to play against young gamers across the country. Receiving a month's training from coach Zhou Haoqi, they were invited to compete against a professional team — the Hero Jiujing E-sports Club in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, in April last year.Although they lost the game, Xiyanghong's performance on the online battlefield still challenged the competitive gaming stereotypes of esports seen as a young man's game, with professional players considered "over the hill" in their 20s.For Yang, "what matters is not winning or losing, but the happiness that the team enjoyed together in the game".With gaming selected as an official medal event at the 19th Hangzhou Asian Games, the country's video game player population grew to a record 668 million by the end of June last year, according to statistics from industry association China Game Industry Group Committee.There have been long-standing arguments about whether or not children and adolescents should be allowed to play video games. While many Chinese parents strictly control their children's screen time in the internet age, Yang's case provides a different perspective on how parents and children can bond through video games.In a bustling self-service restaurant, the atmosphere pulsates with energy as African youth and Chinese volunteers sway to the rhythm of music, their colorful and diverse attire creating a kaleidoscope of hues.Amid the joyful ambiance, the air is filled with a symphony of greetings spoken in languages ranging from the melodious tones of Mandarin, the crisp articulation of English, the elegant flow of French, and the richness of the African tongue.This lively moment encapsulates the essence of the 8th China-Africa Youth Festival.The event, organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the China Soong Ching Ling Foundation (SCLF) and the provincial government of Zhejiang, brought together 64 young representatives from various African countries on a trip from May 19 to 26 to Beijing and Jinhua, Zhejiang province.During the trip, participants experienced traditional Chinese culture, engaged with Chinese government departments, took part in China-Africa youth dialogues and visited historical and cultural sites.The historical legacy of the country's most internationalized port city continues to imbue its home decor with a unique chic that blends East and West, Wang Xin reports.Ke Haiqi has been captivated by the enduring charm of Shanghai-style furnishings and, consequently, committed to bringing them back into fashion for about two decades.The 44-year-old was born in Ningbo, East China's Zhejiang province, and came to Shanghai before 2000.He specializes in old Shanghai-style villa restoration and decoration. Shanghai furnishings have continued showcasing the city's unique charm and have remained popular since early last century."The old Shanghai-style furniture, typically referring to pieces from the 1920s to '50s, presents a perfect blend of Eastern and Western cultures, and has amalgamated various styles, such as art deco, minimalism and modernism, and such features as practicality and inclusiveness," says Ke.The development of Shanghai-style furniture is said to date back to 1843, when the city opened its port and Western culture and people poured in, leading to a blend of furniture, ranging from Western imports to local pieces featuring traditional elements. Ke explains that the category is not defined merely by certain materials, patterns, structures, decorations or craftsmanship but is more like a general, overall style.Its biggest characteristic is the mixture of classic and modern, and Eastern and Western elements.In a recent initiative, the China Soong Ching Ling Foundation orchestrated a drama education class at the China National Theater for Children, drawing nearly 100 participants, including educators and students from primary schools in Beijing alongside foreign children residing in China.The primary objective of this program is to immerse participants in the allure of drama, fostering cultural appreciation and creativity through interactive and stimulating activities that spark imagination and insight.Guided by Feng Li, the theater's director, attendees delved into an exhibition chronicling the rich history of the China National Theater for Children, tracing the evolution of Chinese children's drama across the 75 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China.Mao Ernan, a seasoned drama director, shared invaluable insights into the world of drama, imparting fundamental theater knowledge encompassing set design, costumes, and makeup. By showcasing clips from the beloved children's play Journey to the West, Mao provided a hands-on experience for the young participants, allowing them to explore stage effects and character makeup while actively participating in engaging interactive sessions.This drama education class forms part of the esteemed "Future Classroom" series of activities launched by the China Soong Ching Ling Foundation. This innovative program is designed to nurture both the moral and intellectual development of children. Since its inception in 2018, the initiative has invited distinguished figures from diverse domains to educate and engage with children on various subjects, including virtues, intelligence, physical fitness, arts, and practical skills. With its interactive and enlightening approach, the Future Classroom initiative has garnered popularity as a dynamic and effective extracurricular educational platform.Hua Yong wins recognition with Sino-French crafts exchange program award, Cheng Yuezhu reports.After graduating from Tsinghua University's Academy of Arts and Design, Hua Yong arrived in Nantong, Jiangsu province, in 2008 to follow her passion for traditional Chinese handicrafts by studying woodworking.There, she learned hands-on skills from veteran artisans and visited collectors of wooden furniture, delving deeper into the structures of antique pieces and the wisdom behind traditional Chinese woodworking craftsmanship."For ancient Chinese, objects were considered carriers of wisdom. Because the users would constantly interact with them, the selection of materials followed a certain pattern, allowing the objects to exhibit vitality over time," Hua says."Wood, for example, can develop patina over time, resulting in a fine, smooth texture when it's touched, which can instantly bring people and objects closer to each other."The 41-year-old artisan now owns a woodworking brand that aims to bring traditional Chinese furniture back as a part of contemporary life — a quiet companion for everyday use, with philosophical connotations that nurture people from afar.Her efforts were recognized on April 20 with the Hand of Wisdom prize, a Sino-French crafts exchange program.Founded in 2019 by the Golden Phoenix Science and Art Fund, and Yishu 8 Association, an art platform that boosts Sino-French cultural exchange, and sponsored by French cognac brand Hennessy since 2020, the program annually highlights a genre of craftsmanship and selects a Chinese artisan as the winner.Following the previous years' themes of felt, metal and lacquer, this year's program highlighted woodworking. The nomination and selection process began in January, with 19 nominated artists and three short-listed by a jury comprised of Chinese and French art experts and professors.Coral conservationist Huang Wen and his team spearhead efforts to restore and protect coral ecosystems off the coast of Weizhou Island in South China.At nine in the morning, Huang Wen begins his day by diving from a ship into the waters off Weizhou Island in Beihai city, South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. There, he carefully attaches broken coral branches to seedbeds as part of his daily routine for coral reef restoration.As a 36-year-old associate professor at the School of Marine Sciences at Guangxi University, Huang has been leading coral reef restoration efforts on Weizhou Island for nine years.Under his guidance, the team has so far successfully propagated more than 10 coral species and over 50,000 individual corals, marking significant progress in their restoration work.Huang earned his doctorate at the Institute of Oceanography under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, specializing in aquaculture and molecular biology techniques. "I knew nothing about coral reefs before taking this job, but once you start something, you must strive for results," he said.CHANGSHA — When Joyce Jonathan sang Les Champs-Elysees in both French and Chinese, many people in China learned a new word — chanson, a poetic and romantic genre of music from France.Jonathan is participating in Ride the Wind 2024, and has become the first French singer-songwriter to take part in the hit Chinese music competition formerly known as Sisters Who Make Waves. Produced by Mango TV, the show challenges female celebrities, mostly over the age of 30, to stage performances that defy showbiz age stereotypes in China.Jonathan says that her foray into Chinese reality shows is driven by her love of Chinese culture and wish to "show a possible bridge between French and Chinese cultures"."I haven't participated in reality shows back in France," she says. "I accepted this invitation because it is a huge challenge, and because I want to learn more Chinese and learn to sing in Chinese."Jonathan's parents both have a love of Chinese culture, and her mother runs a travel agency that began promoting tours to China in the 1990s. She visited China with her mother for the first time when she was 10 and has since formed a lasting bond with the country.As a child, Johnathan was given her first scooter and guitar in Beijing. As she grew up, she gravitated toward Chinese philosophies like Taoism and Confucianism. Since her first album was released in 2010, she has translated several songs into Chinese and has returned to China regularly to perform.Now at 34, Jonathan is learning Yueju Opera, a traditional style of opera that features male roles played by women, as part of the competition."Even my mother didn't recognize my voice when I sang Yueju Opera. She never imagined that I could do that one day," Jonathan says."I really like this image of the modern woman who, at any age, can still learn things and show that she's very strong."Jonathan already had a sizable following among Chinese students of French before the show, but broader Chinese audiences have since been delighted by her performance."France and China have a lot in common," she says, remarking on the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. "The 60-year friendship between China and France is just the beginning for a new wave of mutual learning."Farmer Liu Jingyi would play at the family chestnut tree just outside their yard when he was a child, climbing up its branches and into the hollow of its trunk."It was a big tree, the trunk about a meter wide, probably more than 600 years old and very much a part of our lives," says Liu, now 79.Liu is a fifth-generation cultivator of chestnut trees in Aiyukou village of the Kuancheng Manchu autonomous county in Chengde, North China's Hebei province.The village is a center of chestnut cultivation. More than 400 Aiyukou households covering nearly 700 hectares of farmland together yield about 1,000 metric tons of the nuts a year, with many of the trees hundreds of years old. About 50,000 hectares in Kuancheng are used to farm chestnuts, with an annual output value of 860 million yuan ($119 million), according to latest industry figures.Jin Ming, a freediver from Shanghai, set a new world record by swimming 311 meters underwater on a single breath, highlighting his dedication and China's growing prominence in the sport.How far can someone swim underwater with just a single breath? For Jin Ming from Shanghai, that distance extends to an impressive 311 meters.The 31-year-old freediver recently achieved a remarkable feat by setting a new world record in DYN (Dynamic Apnea with Fins) at the Ultimate Freediving Challenge in Singapore on May 4. This accomplishment of 311 meters surpassed the previous record of 301 meters, held by French athlete Guillaume Bourdila two years earlier.In the realm of freediving, divers rely solely on their lung capacity rather than any scuba equipment. Competitive freediving encompasses two primary categories: "depth" competitions, which involve descending as deep as possible in open water on a single breath, and "pool" competitions, which require athletes to hold their breath underwater while remaining stationary or swimming horizontally.Having competed in both categories, Jin prefers DYN, which falls under the pool category. He considers DYN to be the fastest discipline among all freediving events, providing a sense of water flow and speed."It's like piloting a submarine or living out The Fast and the Furious beneath the surface," he said.In addition to his recent DYN achievement, Jin has a history of making significant strides in the sport. He holds an impressive tally of 46 Chinese national records and 22 Asian records in freediving, establishing himself as the highest-ranking Asian athlete in pool competitions."Effort, perseverance, and talent are Jin's defining traits, but it's his relentless effort that truly sets him apart. When given a task that requires 100 percent, he always puts in 120 percent to complete it," said Jin's coach Zhao Lei, also known as Enzo Zhao, founder of One Freedive Club in Beijing.Unlike many other sports where athletes start training at a young age, freediving is relatively new, especially in China, which is why Jin didn't kick off his career as a professional athlete until his 20s. In 2018, during the fourth year of running his tech startup, he stumbled upon the 1988 French film The Big Blue. At that time, he was struggling with immense work pressures and was captivated by the tranquillity and serenity of the ocean depicted in the film, which prompted him to explore freediving."Freediving proved to be an excellent stress reliever," Jin said. "Immersing yourself underwater for extended periods while holding your breath puts you in a state of flow. It also allows you to engage in meditation and relaxation techniques that you can't normally practice on land."According to Jin, the key to success in freediving lies in one's ability to handle pressure. Among mental, cognitive, and physical skills, freediving requires more mental strength than most other sports. Keeping calm underwater also leads to a lower heart rate and reduces oxygen consumption.After a year of consistent training, Jin's performance could rival that of professional athletes. So, in 2019, Zhao encouraged him to compete in international events.But Jin wasn't just competing for himself. "Back then, Japan held most of the freediving records in Asia. At that moment, a spark ignited within me — a sense of national duty, aspiring to propel China to the forefront of Asian freediving," he said.From late 2019 to mid-2021, Jin dedicated 18 months to achieving this objective, training and participating in competitions, setting three Asian records in the process.He then aimed even higher: to elevate China to the pinnacle of global freediving.At the 30th AIDA Pool World Championship in 2023, Jin secured China's first gold medal in the DYN event, positioning China alongside traditional freediving powerhouses like France, Italy, Russia, Poland, and Croatia.Jin's achievements have left the international freediving community in awe, leading them to coin his training and competitive tactics as the "China Style", diverging from the conventional methods employed by Western athletes.Explaining his approach, Jin pointed out that since Chinese athletes are not as proficient in breath-holding as some Western counterparts who can endure up to 10 minutes underwater — Jin's national record for Static Apnea (STA) is 8 minutes and 56 seconds — they prioritize speed to cover more distance in less time."Our pace surpasses that of most Western freedivers. I maintain an underwater speed of approximately 1.3 meters per second, exceeding the typical one-meter-per-second pace of top athletes from other countries," said Jin."Also, our muscle training doesn't emphasize bulking up, but rather focuses on developing lean, highly efficient muscles with strong explosive power and a high lactate threshold for endurance," he explained.Not being a full-time athlete means Jin must juggle work and freediving training, while also facing the same challenges as professional athletes, including fluctuating performances and self-doubt.The 2024 Beijing Junior Sudoku Championship, which featured five age categories spanning from U6 to U18, concluded successfully on Sunday. The inclusion of the U6 category, specifically designed for children under 6, underscores the increasing involvement of younger players in the Sudoku community. This addition aims to maintain fairness in competition by providing age-appropriate tools tailored to the cognitive development of this age group, ultimately enhancing the game's relevance and accessibility.Co-hosted by the Beijing Sudoku Association and Beijing Gehua Cultural Centre, the championship also doubled as a qualifying event for the upcoming National Junior Sudoku Championship. Exceptional young contenders from this tournament will have the opportunity to earn a spot on the prestigious Beijing Youth Sudoku Team, representing the capital city at the national level.Sudoku, a widely popular intellectual sport globally, has earned accolades from educators and parents alike for its straightforward rules, stimulating logic, and its capacity to foster skills such as observation, memory, and logical reasoning in children.Beijing, at the forefront of promoting Sudoku in China, has witnessed a remarkable surge in Sudoku's popularity over the last decade. With more than 300 schools offering Sudoku programs and a participation base exceeding 1 million in the city alone, the Sudoku phenomenon has captivated millions nationwide, boasting an estimated 20 million Sudoku enthusiasts across the country.Hamza al-Sal is grateful to Shanghai for the opportunities and experiences it has provided him, as well as the hope of realizing his dream of becoming a professional actor.The 24-year-old Yemeni student at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, shot to fame for his portrayal of Alexander, a foreign tenant in the hit film B for Busy (2021), in which his remarkable performance, toned physique, and fluent Shanghai dialect captivated audiences."I have a passion for acting. I want to continue doing what I like," he tells China Daily. "I hope to create my own opportunities in Shanghai, and shoot my own movie."Al-Sal moved to China in 2000 as a toddler when his father, Mudhar al-Sal, seeking to take advantage of reform and opening-up, moved his family to the bustling, globalized commercial hub of Yiwu in Zhejiang province, where he gradually developed a trade in daily necessities. In fact, Mudhar al-Sal's connection to China dates back to 1990 when he studied Chinese at the Beijing Language and Culture University before pursuing a degree in civil engineering at Shanghai's Tongji University."My father suggested that I study finance and economics in Shanghai so I might continue to develop the family business," he says. Hamza al-Sal moved to Shanghai when he was 19 and started a course in Investment Studies.Thanks to his father's stories of Shanghai, he found the city familiar and the time he has spent there is very important to him, as he finds it a source of inspiration and endless possibility."I have made many friends, and most of them are from Shanghai. Much of my experience, including meeting people in the film industry, is right here in Shanghai."Hamza al-Sal had his first taste of the spotlight at 14 when he landed a role in the Jackie Chan film Dragon Blade, which ignited his passion for acting and led to a number of small roles in TV dramas and commercials. While studying at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, he uses his spare time to audition, taking on minor roles as an extra or an assistant whenever given the opportunity, simply out of a desire to learn.In Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province, Xiaorehun, a pear processing business, has introduced a unique pear tree adoption program in Luniao town since mid-April, captivating participants from diverse backgrounds.This innovative initiative encompasses pear tree adoption, care, and harvesting, offering adopters a comprehensive experience that includes study tours, rural tourism activities, farmhouse entertainment, and access to agricultural product sales.Participants, upon payment of an adoption fee, receive an honorary certificate, the privilege to name and showcase their adopted pear tree, and a minimum of 50 kilograms of pears at no additional cost. Moreover, adopters are encouraged to engage in the nurturing, maintenance, and picking of their pear trees, fostering a deeper connection to the agricultural process.The event has drawn interest from individuals across various professions, resulting in the adoption of hundreds of pear trees by the conclusion of April. This collaborative effort between Xiaorehun and Luniao town serves as a pilot project, aiming to leverage rural resources, establish rural tourism brands, stimulate the diversified growth of the rural economy, and bolster farmers' incomes.Jerry Lindenstraus is a 95-year-old Holocaust survivor who lives in an apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side in New York. People around him sometimes find it odd that the elderly Jewish man can speak a few Japanese words.Whenever the topic arises, Lindenstraus tells the story of how his family fled Germany and traveled to Shanghai in 1939 to escape the Holocaust.After Japan fully occupied Shanghai, all schools in the city were obligated to teach Japanese, and the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association School where Lindenstraus was living was no exception.In 1939, one month before the outbreak of World War II, the 10-year-old Lindenstraus arrived in Shanghai from Gumbinnen, a small German town in what was then East Prussia.Stepping off the boat, the young boy was sweating profusely under the layers of his heavy German suits and shirts. More than 80 years later, he still remembers Shanghai's brutally hot and humid summer.Arriving with Lindenstraus were about 18,000 Jewish refugees who fled Nazi-occupied areas of Europe, settling in Shanghai from 1933 to 1941 to escape the Holocaust, as the Chinese city was among the few places that Jewish refugees were guaranteed acceptance in the early days of the war, according to the Shanghai Jewish Museum.In the bustling China Photo Studio, Wang Xin swiftly changes his position, moving the camera to find the best angle, occasionally pausing to adjust the lighting and help his subject attain the "right" posture and lift his/her mood through to the decisive click of the shutter."Lean a bit to the left, chin up, and give me a smile," the portrait photographer's soft tone put to ease his subject, who asked to be called by only her surname, Jia. "Good, very good, perfect," Wang said.Such words of encouragement are effective in helping people who are camera-shy to feel less nervous. Jia's slight facial paralysis can cause her mouth to skew when she is nervous, Wang said, adding that he tried to make her feel relaxed while clicking the photograph. He chatted with Jia about life in general, her daily routine, trying to put her at ease and make her smile."Sometimes, it's just about capturing that perfect moment when the smile is just right," he said.Jia, 72, said the moment she saw the studio while strolling down the street, she was reminded about a photograph she got clicked here in the 1980s. "I decided to recreate the experience, take some photos and keep them as a memento," Jia said.Jia praised Wang's skill and amiable behavior, saying she felt relaxed and confident, and was happy with the photographs."In fact, the photographer is the director," Wang said. "We have to guide the customers to express themselves in front of the camera." The experienced photographer has the ability to win the trust of his subjects. "I try to be their friends, because for a portrait photographer, skills are fundamental but communication is more important." By asking the customers about their lives, the purpose of taking a photo, photographers can figure out how to click their photographs, he said.What he has been pursuing through the lens, Wang said, is capturing authenticity, natural expressions. "I'm trying to show who this person is through my photos."Wang has been a portrait photographer for nearly 36 years. "It is interesting to translate their emotions onto the photographs," Wang said, adding that he enjoys the interaction with his subjects and the connection that comes with it.Liu Lingli has been a teacher for hearing-impaired children for 33 years, and thanks to her help and dedication, more than 20 of the over 80 students she has taught have received higher education.Liu, 51, was born in Hengyang, Hunan province, in 1973. And her first interaction with people with disability was with one of her neighbors, surnamed Wang. Liu was a child then.One day in the winter, when Liu was playing in her house, Wang used sign language to communicate with her. But Liu could not understand what she was trying to say. It was Wang's husband who told Liu that she wanted to make her a scarf."Even as a child, I was moved by her kind gesture, and thought it would be great if she could speak," Liu said. The incident left an indelible mark on Liu. At the age of 14, she decided to major in teaching hearing-impaired students, and enrolled in Nanjing Normal University of Special Education. After four years, she graduated with a secondary vocational degree and became a teacher at Hengyang Normal School of Special Education, and taught Chinese language to first graders.She remembers clearly that there were 14 students in her class, from 6 to 12 years old, with several of them being intellectually challenged. "Some of the students had snot on their face; some even wet their pants. I was at a loss and thought about quitting," she said. She then thought about her neighbor Mrs Wang and the pain on her face when she could not make people understand what she was trying to say. That made her determined to pursue "special education".Although she was only 18 at the time, she treated the students as her children, and practiced sign language in front of the mirror for one to two hours every day till she mastered it. With great care and patience, she also taught the students how to wash their face and clothes, and clip their nails, gradually becoming the "mother" of the students.In 2005, at the age of 32, Liu gave birth to her own child. But the child, a boy, was diagnosed with congenital hearing impairment when he was seven months old. Concerned that she would need time to overcome the shock, Liu's colleagues requested her to take a break from teaching and take her son to Changsha, capital of Hunan province, for treatment. But she refused to do so, partly because such treatments are a long-drawn process.Instead, she began teaching a new class, because she didn't want to leave the students alone, and decided to provide therapy for the child herself after work.After becoming the mother of a child with hearing impairment, Liu said she could better understand the difficulty families with a special child face. "I felt that I was not doing enough for the children I teach. I should put more efforts to help them better integrate into society," she said."If the children receive early training and therapy, they could probably speak and thus have a better future." So she started auditory and aural rehabilitation training for her son after work. She self-taught herself the methods of imparting such training. And to help her students speak, she put her lips against their hand to let them feel the movement of the lips and the flow of the air, while allowing the students to put their hand around her neck and on her nose so they could feel the vibration of the vocal cords.Apart from teaching her class together, she also has one-on-one sessions with each student for 20 minutes every day. As a result, she usually has a sore throat at the end of the day and her voice becomes hoarse.ABIDJAN — "When I was young, I told my mother that I would go to China to learn Kung Fu one day. She didn't believe it at the time. When I got there, I immediately called her and said, 'Mom, guess where I am, I'm at the Shaolin Temple!'," says Max Yollando, a young man from the Cote d'Ivoire, sharing his affection for Chinese culture.Yollando is also known as Yanming, the Chinese name he was given by his teacher at the Shaolin Temple, the Buddhist monastery where the "Shaolin kung fu" was born, and which today is a magnet for fans from all over the world.At the time, Yollando was a student at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny University in Abidjan. Motivated by his passion for Chinese culture, he enrolled at the Confucius Institute to study Chinese. In late 2016, he had the opportunity to visit the temple in Henan province on a three-month exchange.This experience defined his engagement with traditional Chinese culture."The spirit of martial arts displayed by my fellow disciples deeply impressed me. I truly fell in love and felt sure that this was the place I had dreamed of since childhood," he says.After returning to the Cote d'Ivoire, Yanming continued to practice Chinese and study traditional culture.In July 2017, he returned to Shaolin and remained there for six years.His years at the temple reading, exercising, practicing martial arts, and meditation greatly changed him, and allowed him to better understand and appreciate traditional Chinese culture.He says the most impressive things he noticed that rooted in Chinese culture are the love of work, respect, and recognition."Coming to China to study made me more disciplined and hardworking. Before, I was a little lazy, but the Shaolin Temple taught me to be punctual, respectful and grateful."At the end of 2022, when he completed his studies at the temple, he began working at a Shaolin cultural center in Zambia. The first of its kind in Africa, the center is home to 30 orphans, who are taught Chinese language and traditional Chinese culture, including kung fu, as part of the curriculum.For Yollando, the purpose of studying Chinese culture was to be able to return to Africa to introduce Chinese values to his compatriots."The culture fascinated me because in China, people make an effort to work better, and they are very respectful and grateful to their family and country," he says."When I make connections between Chinese and African culture, it seems to me that they have a lot in common," he says.Zhao Shiwei and his team have bred and rescued more than 200 red-crowned cranes and released them into the wild after ensuring they will be able to survive in the wild. Despite doing this for 30 years and loving every moment of it, Zhao's greatest wish is to see his enclosure in Panjin city, Liaoning province, free of cranes.The red-crowned crane is a national first-class protected wildlife, with the coastal wetlands of Panjin city being one of its important resting, wintering, and breeding grounds in the East Asia-Australasia Flyway for birds.But due to environmental and ecological damage, the number of red-crowned cranes migrating to the Liaohe River estuary had been continuously declining when Zhao joined work at the Zhaoquan River Management Station, which is part of the Liaohe River Estuary National Nature Reserve in Panjin, in 1992.Artificial breeding of red-crowned cranes became an important part of Zhao's work. Three red-crowned crane chicks hatched at the station through artificial insemination in 1996. The sight of red-crowned crane chicks emerging from the eggs was extremely exciting for Zhao. "At that moment … I felt that I had found something very meaningful in life," Zhao said.But despite tasting success in 1996 and receiving encouragement from senior officials, Zhao and his team encountered setbacks the following year. In 1997, not a single red-crowned crane chick hatched. And in 1998, only one red-crowned crane chick hatched through artificial insemination, but it died soon after."Was I suited for this work? At that time, I had many confusing thoughts," Zhao said.The station director at the time noticed his emotional state and told him that artificial breeding of red-crowned cranes at the station was pioneering work that required continuous exploration, and asked him,"How could we give up in the face of difficulties?"In 1999, the station rescued several injured red-crowned cranes from the wild.That prompted Zhao and his colleagues to check the incubator, brooder, temperature control devices and voltage, go through a huge amount of data, seek advice from experts in Shenyang, the provincial capital, and improve the incubator, hoping to achieve a breakthrough in artificial breeding."We tried every possible method, even consulting technicians from nearby chicken farms," Zhao said. Thanks to such efforts over the years, the artificial breeding program has continued to improve.Last year, a record 85 red-crowned crane chicks hatched at the station through a combination of artificial insemination and natural breeding methods. Over the past 30 years, Zhao has trained many apprentices, but he has always been personally involved in the hatching process. "This part is the most crucial; there cannot be the slightest mistake," he said.Zhao has set 12 alarms, one for every two hours, on his phone, because during the incubation period, the eggs have to be turned, and ventilation and temperature checked every two hours, whether it's day or night.Zhao has extensive experience in feeding red-crowned crane chicks, too. "For chicks aged 1 to 20 days, they are fed five times a day; for those between 21 and 30 days old, they are fed four times a day; and for those more than 30 days old, they are fed three times a day," he said.In 2005, Zhao realized that with the number of artificially bred red-crowned cranes increasing, the bond between the cranes and humans was growing stronger. But "they are the spirits of nature and hence should return to nature",Zhao said.Hence, Zhao applied to the higher authorities to provide outdoor "training" to artificially bred red-crowned cranes in the reserve in order to increase the number of wild red-crowned cranes. "After feeding all the red-crowned cranes every morning, I take the young 'trained' ones 'out for a walk' when they can forage and practice flying, and bring them back to the enclosure in the evening," Zhao said.Once, due to an emergency rescue of other birds, two cranes "undergoing training" did not return to the enclosure on time. In the evening, Zhao searched for them in the reed marshes for seven hours, and finally found the two lost chicks. And only then he realized that the soles of his shoes had come off during the search.Starting in 2010, during the bird migration season, stray cranes have been flying into the reserve and staying for a long time. That prompted Zhao to release several artificially bred adult male red-crowned cranes into the wild every year so they could form families with their wild partners and increase the wild crane population in Panjin."The method has proved quite effective. We often see two pairs of cranes leisurely foraging by the roadside or riverbank, and they are not as afraid of people as a totally wild pair or flock would be. Sometimes, they even fly with their chicks to visit the station," Zhao said, calling himself not only a trainer of red-crowned cranes but also a matchmaker.yandongjie@chinadaily.com.cnAll baby animals are cute. Seal pups are no exception.One such pup, a spotted seal pup, about 20 days old, was found on an offshore oil extraction platform in Panjin, Liaoning province, by nearby residents in late February. Among those who rescued the cute, but initially angry and somewhat aggressive, pup was Li Yue, of the Fisheries Law Enforcement Command team, and volunteer Tian Jiguang."The seal pup was found with a fishing net entangled around its neck. Seals, even seal pups, have a strong temper. So when we approached it to remove the fishing net from its neck, it thought we would harm it and turned aggressive like an agitated dog. But the more it struggled, the more the net tightened around its neck. Eventually, it realized that we meant no harm, and allowed us to remove the net from around its neck," said Tian, founder of Panjin Wetland Protection Association.Spotted seals' intelligence is roughly equivalent to that of a four-year-old child and even young seals can survive on their own in the wild, Tian said. But since the rescued pup was just about three weeks old and hence wouldn't have survived the harsh environment of the open sea without its mother, it was not released into the sea.Spotted seals are relatively shy, difficult to approach and generally solitary, though they are gregarious and form large groups during pupping and molting seasons when they haul out on ice or on land when there is lack of ice, which nowadays is often the case. Perhaps that's why the pup was aggressive when approached, Tian said."We took care of it for a day, and then sent it to the Liaoning Ocean and Fisheries Science Research Institute in Dalian for treatment and examination. Only after we were sure the pup had developed the ability to survive in the wild was it returned to the sea," said Li, captain of the FLEC team in Panshan county, Panjin. Li generally rescues several spotted seals from the sea or shore every year.Over the past decade, Li and his teammates have been patrolling the resting areas of spotted seals in the Liaodong Bay by boat. "There are five landing points that spotted seals favor in the bay area. The seals at different locations belong to different extended families," Li said.He is familiar with every group of spotted seals in the Liaohe River Estuary National Nature Reserve in Panjin; he knows the heads of the families and those with scars that have been wintering in the bay area for years.As the spring arrives, migratory birds are heading to their annual breeding grounds. The Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve in Shanghai, which is located in the middle of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, is a major stopover point for migratory waterbirds making the long journey.These wetlands on the eastern coast of Chongming Island are also home to the reserve's staff and research teams from Fudan University, who are busy banding birds, a decades-long task that involves attaching identification tags to the birds to track them and their routes."About 1 million visits by migratory birds — including those that fly past as well as stop over — are recorded at Dongtan every year," says Ma Zhijun, in his early 50s, a professor at Fudan University's School of Life Sciences, adding that an increasing number of waterbirds have been observed."We have been working together for more than 20 years. Through bird banding, we can better monitor the birds and carry out in-depth research on migration, getting to know more about them, conserving them, and protecting the whole ecosystem," Ma adds.Zhao Yexi, 22, a doctoral student at Fudan University, says that bird banding involves fitting a small ring and a colored leg flag to a bird's leg. The ring is stamped or engraved with a unique code, and each colored flag represents a specific region.The bands are usually loose enough to turn around the leg but not so loose they slip past the ankle. In addition, the banding process also involves identifying and recording each bird's basic information, such as species, age, sex, as well as morphological measurements of the length of wings and weight. The banding data is linked to the bird with its identification number. It is then registered on a database, and shared around the world for use in large-scale, long-term studies to track migratory movements, population dynamics, life span and behavior.Newer technology also permits placing a positioning tracker on select birds, which allows researchers to precisely track the bird's continental, hemisphere-wide or even global movements."Bird banding is a common and effective means of monitoring the movement of birds, charting their migratory patterns, and supporting conservation," Zhao says."Over the past 20 years, more than 50,000 birds have been banded at the Chongming Dongtan reserve," Ma adds. "We are able to collect firsthand data and study their migratory routes, major stopover sites and timings. The data also helps us gain in-depth understanding, as well as new understanding of the natural history of migratory birds, and their link to the environment."A 36-year-old mother of three in Northeast China's Liaoning province was diagnosed with late-stage cancer in 2019. After successfully receiving chemo and radiotherapy, her cancer returned in 2020, and before she underwent surgery, she invited photographer Wang Naigong to take family photos.As her condition deteriorated, Wang captured the precious moments Jiu'er (named after her birth month, September, the ninth hence jiu) spent with her family. The resulting series of photos, titled I Am Still With You, won the photographer the Long-Term Projects, Asia category, at the 67th World Press Photo Contest, which announced the winners out of more than 61,000 entries earlier this month. The award is given in recognition for the best photojournalism and documentary photography from the past year, and the prizewinning stories will be showcased at the World Press Photo Exhibition in Amsterdam next month."The project did not aim to address the complicated issues of the disease, or its relationship to society, but rather to document the emotional and spiritual journey of a young woman as she faced death," according to the introduction to the series on the contest's website.As a private visual record exploring the concept of family photos, Wang used a large-format camera, which offers exceptional detail in low light, as well as better control of perspective and depth of field, to capture emotions and relationships within the family. Jiu'er then added her own interpretation of each shot.The Miyun Reservoir in suburban Beijing, one of the largest water conservancy projects in North China, plays a significant role in providing water to the capital. But not many people know this major project was actually designed by a group of university students as their graduation project.In 1959, under Jiang Nanxiang, the then headmaster of Tsinghua University, who encouraged his students to combine theory with practice, students from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering undertook the project under the guidance of Professor Zhang Guangdou, who helped with prospecting and design.As a result of the efforts of two groups of graduates, the design was completed. Graduation projects at Tsinghua were revolutionized, and mere words and images on paper were turned into actual, practical design tasks.This is one of the stories told in the new season of Century Masters, which focuses on 11 noted educators, among them Peking University head Cai Yuanpei, promoter of mass education Tao Xingzhi and physical education advocate Jiang Nanxiang, which aired on China Education Television in March.Produced by the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Century Masters is dedicated to people renowned for their mastery in different areas. Earlier seasons focused on famous artists, architects and writers.According to Chen Hong, deputy head of CETV, and also the general director for the series, the new season seeks to preserve and protect the educational practices, ideas and progress of the subjects, and nurture young people in the process."During the course of the development of education in China over the past century, many diligent, knowledgeable and accomplished master-level educators have driven the social and historical development to varying degrees," says Chen."We want to crystallize the wisdom and sweat of countless educators, a precious legacy for future generations, and open a window to showcase the country's progress," he adds.Chen says they mostly choose educators who were early headmasters of universities, or who promoted educational revolution and development in China, adding that other educators will feature in future seasons.Many of them also made great achievements in other areas. This series, however, focuses on their contributions to education.Children between the ages of 7 and 9 were the most active young users at public libraries in Shanghai, followed by those in the age brackets of 10 to 11 and 5 to 6, respectively, according to a report released on Tuesday on the World Reading Day.There were altogether more than 284,000 active users aged below 16 at such libraries in the municipality, which provides library service at 257 institutions for minors at sub-district, district, and city levels and includes reading as an indispensable part as its efforts of building a child-friendly society is quickly gathering pace.The 2023 Shanghai Public Library Children's Reading Report, which was jointly released by several institutions, including Shanghai Children's Library and Shanghai Library, said young readers borrowed books for a total of over 15 million times from the public libraries in the city.The report stated that literature books were most frequently borrowed by minors, followed by art and language books. It also calculated that expat readers at the libraries hailed from 47 countries and regions.Moreover, the report showed that more than 80 percent of the minor readers in Shanghai spent half an hour or more on reading on a daily basis.A big move regarding children's library service in the city was that Shanghai Children's Library launched an online book borrowing service in January during students' winter vacation.The platform provides a home delivery option that makes book borrowing and reading more convenient for children. Next-day delivery for orders placed before 4 pm is guaranteed.Norpal Gyal often loses himself in the beautiful sights of Qinghai Lake, like its flying water birds, rippling blue-green waves and meandering flocks of sheep, which look like pearls scattered on the grasslands.Norpal Gyal is a herder and poet from Qinghai province. The 63-year-old lives in Yermo village in Gangca county in the Haibei Tibetan autonomous prefecture, which is located beside Qinghai Lake, the country's largest inland saltwater lake.Every morning, he sets out with a book, a tablet computer and a camera bag slung over his shoulder. Following the gentle rhythm of the herd, he makes his way toward a winter pasture not far from home, to start a day of grazing and writing poetry by the lake, which has been dubbed a "cradle of poetry"."Like music and painting, poetry is a form of expression," says Norpal Gyal. "When you feel that life is difficult, read poetry. When you get bored with herding, read poetry."He has loved reading since he was a child, especially books about philosophy and history, and says his love of reading and understanding life blossomed after reading Stray Birds, a collection of poems by Indian writer Rabindranath Tagore.He was eventually forced to drop out of school because of illness."When I was stuck at home, a sense of gloom enveloped me. I would often look at the sheep on the grasslands in a daze, wanting to say something, but I was the only one in that vast space," Norpal Gyal recalls."That's when I thought I would chronicle the changes to each blade of grass and every dewdrop through poems."One of those poems reads as follows: The bright flowers bloom into the sky in the summer, and the seeds in the autumn become full. The white robes sewn in the winter are taken away as gifts by the spring breeze.Norpal Gyal not only captures observations of everyday life in his poetry but also documents the changes to his own life and hometown.In 2010, his family of six moved into a new home. Although they no longer depend solely on herding, he holds onto this way of life, as he believes that herding is his source of inspiration for poetry.To date, Norpal Gyal has written more than 200 poems. Last June, his third collection of verse was published by the Qinghai Ethnic Publishing House, the summation of nine years of work.According to Gyumey Dorje, vice-chairman of the Qinghai writers' association, Norpal Gyal has been breaking through boundaries in poetry for more than 40 years, articulating his reflections on life with a blend of quiet contemplation and incisive language.He is not alone in delving into poetry in the Qinghai Lake area. Local herders say they often chant verses to one another during breaks as their flocks graze.Last June, the biennial Qinghai Lake Poetry Festival was launched in Gangca county, attracting 80 poets from China and abroad in pursuit of inspiration.According to Medrup, vice-chairman of the Qinghai provincial federation of literary and art circles and chairman of the Qinghai writers' association, the rapid development of rural writers in Qinghai has both fostered and pooled creative energy for the production of work focused on the theme of rural vitalization in recent years.The work of the poets encapsulates the beautiful scenes of harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature in the province, Medrup says. How do you typically spend your weekends? For many, it might involve gathering with friends, dining out, watching movies, or shopping.This was once the routine for Chen Lingyi, a 27-year-old from Shanghai. But three years ago, fresh out of university and starting her career, Chen was startled to find that even after trying to save money for several months, her bank account was still basically empty.Reflecting on her spending habits, Chen realized that every aspect of city life seemed to demand money, and "leisurely weekends "had practically become synonymous with "consumption"."Walking on the streets, it felt like every shop window had its own price tag," she said.However, cities are abundant with resources, so Chen started to wonder whether there were alternative ways to utilize urban spaces beyond consumerism.Driven by curiosity and a determination to make a change, Chen and 26 friends established The Gratis interest group in May 2022. They launched a social experiment project titled "100 Ways to Enjoy a Weekend in a Big City Without Spending Money".The group members dubbed themselves "free-range chickens", drawing inspiration from chickens that naturally forage for food, living off farm leftovers or pecking at small insects in open grasslands, resulting in a firmer meat texture due to their constant movement."When we came across the term 'free-range chicken', we were thrilled because it aligned perfectly with our identity," Chen recalled.Organized and initiated by the Wuhan Youth League Committee, a variety of classes, including latte art, makeup, African drumming, and calligraphy, have been offered in district cultural centers and community hubs since last November. This initiative follows extensive research into the needs and interests of young people.Wang Chengcheng, 26, is a student attending the latte art class at the Night School for Youths at a community hub in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province. She heavily relies on coffee to get through the day, explaining that her coffee intake varies depending on her workload: once or twice a week when things are light, but increases to one cup a day when she's busy."I've tried frothing milk myself, but I've never attempted latte art before. Our instructor could craft intricate designs like lions, pandas, and monkeys. It's truly an art," she said.After a few classes, she can now draw a heart on her latte. "I've discovered there's so much more to coffee than just a beverage," she said.Zhang Cheng, a 38-year-old middle school art teacher, joined the calligraphy class. "When I was a child, I studied to improve myself. But now I'm studying for pleasure and relaxation," she said.Zhang had minimal practice in calligraphy, mostly with her amateur father during her childhood."I'm basically a beginner, but there's no pressure in these classes. We're not forced to study here or have any requirements to fulfill; the whole environment is lighthearted and relaxing," she said.Zhang also mentioned that her instructor, Cheng Weihong, was very patient and provided individual guidance to each student.Cheng is a member of the Hubei Provincial Calligraphers Association with over 20 years of teaching experience."A friend introduced me to teach here, and I was told that a lot of young people are eager to learn more about traditional Chinese culture and calligraphy," he said.According to Cheng, the majority of his students are eager and focused young women in their 20s and 30s, most of whom were beginners in this subject."I believe that practicing Chinese calligraphy not only allows them to explore Chinese culture and aesthetics but also offers a meditative experience," he said.Wendelou, also known as Wende Mansion, the former residence of late premier Zhou Enlai and his wife, Deng Yingchao, has been unveiled to the public in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, adding a new red tourism attraction to the southern metropolis.Situated in the bustling Yuexiu district of the provincial capital, the century-old Western-style Wendelou was a key locale in the revolutionary history of Zhou, as highlighted by Zhou Xiaojin, vice-president of the Guangdong Institute of Southern Red Culture and Research.Comprising five interconnected three-story residential houses, Wendelou was the marital home of Zhou Enlai and Deng, with photographs from their wedding adorning the walls of the main rooms.In the U-shaped yellow residence, the couple resided in a 40-squaremeter room on the second floor of Wendelou's No 3 building in 1925. A striking black-and-white portrait of a youthful Zhou Enlai graces the center of the living room.The room also showcases personal items used by Zhou Enlai, such as furniture, writing implements, documents, and letters, providing visitors with a deeper insight into his life in Guangzhou, where the Huangpu Military Academy was located. In 1924, Zhou Enlai was appointed as the director of the political department of the academy, which was established by Dr Sun Yat-sen, the esteemed Chinese revolutionary and statesman.In 1925, the Guangdong Committee of the Communist Party of China leased a portion of the rooms in Wendelou for its members.Alongside Zhou Enlai, who was then a member of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Committee of the CPC and secretary of the Military Commission, Li Fuchun and his wife, Cai Chang, resided in another room on the second floor of Wendelou's No 1 building.Liang Ying, a staff member of the memorial hall at the former site of Huangpu Military Academy, says Zhou Enlai served as the third director of the political department of Huangpu Military Academy. "He advanced revolution through artistic performances and was embraced by students and teachers," says Liang.According to Zhou Xiaojin, who is also Zhou Enlai's grandniece, in China, only in Guangzhou's residential houses, restaurants and schools can tourists see wedding photos of the celebrated couple, which evoke long-lost warmth and familiarity."Wendelou was where their married life began," says Zhou Xiaojin.With a focus on preserving the original appearance of historical buildings to the fullest extent, authorities have undertaken the protection, restoration, and revitalization of the cultural relics of Wendelou in recent years.The renovation work was completed in March, coinciding with the anniversary of Zhou Enlai's birth. Tourists and locals can now visit Wendelou for free after making advance reservation online.Huang Yi, a 72-year-old local resident, says the mansion looks more beautiful than ever following the completion of the renovation work.Peng Yi'an contributed to this story.Almost every March since 2018, Jiang Shengnan's name has appeared in the hottest topics section on micro-blogging platform Sina Weibo. The 51-year-old member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was a deputy to the National People's Congress from 2018 to 2022, and has been a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference since 2023. She often made headlines for the motions and proposals she submitted to the two sessions and other political meetings.In 2020, Jiang suggested dropping the "cooling-off" period before divorce mentioned in the draft of the Civil Code, because the rights of the weaker side in a marriage — more often than not the women — could be further harmed. For example, one party might use the period to hide assets, maliciously incur debt, escalate abuse or destroy evidence of misconduct, leaving the other party in an even more dire situation, she told media.For the two sessions in 2022, she proposed a motion to improve maternity and paternity leave. In interviews, Jiang said that people should remain alert to the discrimination against women in the job market as a result of prolonged maternity leave, and suggested increasing paternity leave for fathers.Her proposals have provoked wide discussion. Other suggestions have included reducing the workload for grassroots civil servants using big data, canceling the upper age limit of 35 for the employment of civil servants, and employers strictly observing the 8-hour day, instead of making employees work long hours."What we NPC deputies and members of the CPPCC care about is often what the people care about. What we should do is to deliver on what concerns people, and propose more targeted and feasible solutions to solve problems and implement policies," she said during this year's two sessions, which ended on March 11.Born in 1973 in Wenzhou, East China's Zhejiang province, Jiang is the third and youngest daughter in the family and her name, Shengnan, translates as "better than men". She was a bookworm as a primary school student and often spent what she calls "a colorful day" at the school library, reading one or two books a day, nourished by steamed stuffed buns and a bottle of water.Jiang began reading Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) author Cao Xueqin's Dream of the Red Chamber in the second grade, when she did not even fully understand all the characters. She also loved reading history, and the first historical books she read were the Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Kingdoms, stories that are more than 2,280 years old.In 1996, she wrote her first martial arts novel Modao Fengyun (Magic Sword Tempest) to entertain herself. In 1997, she bought a computer and typed in the manuscript, but with nowhere to publish, only family and friends read the book.At the suggestion of a friend, Jiang posted the novel on a bulletin board system, starting her career as an online writer, and became witness to the development of China's online literature sector.With people from all walks of life able to write online, internet literature thrived, and diverse genres and themes catering to popular tastes emerged one after another, offering more possibilities for writing.Jiang focused on women, who were usually overshadowed and presented as simplified characters in Chinese literature, particularly important historical women. She realized that Chinese historical novels tended to focus on emperors, kings, generals and ministers, and women often featured as vehicles, either as virtuous wives and good mothers, or as beautiful women who caused mayhem.However, she knew that major figures like the empress dowagers Mi Bazi in the Warring States Period (475-221 BC) and Xiao Yanyan in the Liao Dynasty (916-1125), and Empress Liu E in the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), possessed political savvy equal to that of men and shaped history with their wisdom and actions."In them, I saw patriotism and an elegant demeanor as they fearlessly pursued the value of life despite difficulties," she wrote in a recently published article. "They should be seen, remembered and studied. I wanted to change this situation in my writing."By combing through historical texts to unearth the contributions and achievements of women to the history of civilization, I wanted to bring them to the surface, pave the way for a more harmonious, equitable and insightful perspective on gender relations and historical understanding, and shed light on the indelible impact of women on the tapestry of human civilization."In her novel Mi Yue Zhuan (Legend of Mi Yue), one of her most well-known books, which is based on the life of China's first empress dowager Mi Bazi, who ruled the Qin state under the name of Empress Dowager Xuan at the age of 30, she imagined the empress dowager's life, from her first cries to her parents, mentors, brothers and sisters, as well as her romances, as there are few historical records about her actual life.Among the 2,000-odd ratings on Douban, a major review aggregator in China, nearly 70 percent of readers gave Jiang's most famous novel four stars or more out of five. One reader, nicknamed Yinrendeponiang, who gave the novel four stars, commented that, "The book narrates the life of China's first empress dowager, through a blend of fiction and history. It details her journey from birth to reign, and how the changes in her life influenced her, shaping her into a kind yet cunning individual with talent and ambition. She resists others' control over her.… This book not only informs us about her path to growth, but also shows how a woman can achieve success through her own efforts".In her another novel, Yanyun Tai (The Legend of Empress), Jiang presents the historical changes to the Liao Dynasty through the life of her hero, Empress Dowager Xiao Yanyan.Jiang has not limited her aspirations to improving the social status of women — who account for half of humanity — to novels. As a writer, she also keeps a keen eye on the real-life problems of people, and tries to realize their aspirations."As a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, I represent the grassroots, so when I have the chance to improve their lives, I grab the opportunity," she says.Her first proposal related to the problem of protecting the intellectual property of online literature. As a contributor for over two decades, she has not only seen her own work plagiarized, but also that of fellow writers. Following further investigation, she discovered that it was difficult for creators to defend their rights because of a lack of people involved in IP protection.As even IP-related majors at university were more focused on theory rather than practice, Jiang proposed a motion to promote the training of application-oriented talent in IP protection, which not only received a great response from the industry, but was later implemented by the government in 2020. She was greatly encouraged by the result and expanded her areas of investigation, making more suggestions.Jiang's proposals frequently resonated with many people, and often rose to the top of Sina Weibo's trending topic list. Her greatest concern remains women and children and she has posted her email address online to collect issues of different people."I believe that society's awareness of protecting women's rights has continued to improve. What I need to do is to bring people's opinions to the two sessions, to the public, for solutions," she says.Over the past few years, her proposals have included promoting nationwide, multi-department action to combat human trafficking and subsequent rescues, classifying surrogacy as a criminal offense, and protecting the private information of juvenile criminals.As she continues to tackle deep-seated problems concerning the rights of women, she discovers new ones. During this year's two sessions, one of her proposals was about promoting the protection of rural women's land rights to advance gender equality and facilitate rural vitalization.Although the law requires that women enjoy equal rights to men when it comes to land, in reality, the traditional practice of depriving women of their land when they leave home after getting married means that rural women either lose their land or own less land than is mandated by law. Even if they later become single, most cannot reclaim any land previously lost, Jiang says, adding that even if they sue, winning is difficult.This greatly harms women's rights and leads to many problems. Jiang says that one of the consequences is that unequal rights distribution between genders directly affects rural birth gender ratios. If these problems can be solved, she says, maybe more women will want to stay to work on their own land rather than leave for cities to make money. This may then solve the problem of rural men being unable to find wives, some of whom turn to marrying abducted women, which in turn will address problems like human trafficking and high bride prices.Speaking of the relationship between her gender and her political proposals, Jiang says that a female perspective will make the world better. "In the age of the internet and the future age of artificial intelligence, physical difference is no longer important, so women can better use their strengths," she says. "The more you take part in social activities, the greater your speaking rights become."Every day, we consume food, but do these meals merely fill us up or truly nourish us? Renowned French gastronome Nicolas Kenedi prompts us to ponder this question.During a recent visit to Beijing, Nicolas shared his philosophy on food with China Daily. "Good food is the food that feed you. A lot of things can fill you, but don't feed you ... You stuff yourself with unhealthy things that neither feed you nor nourish you," he said. "The bad food creates an imbalance in your body and results in disease such as obesity, diabetes."Nicolas urged people to leave their phones alone and care more about their bodies by preparing nutritious meals themselves rather than relying on unhealthy delivery options. "To live a good life, you have to take care of your beauty and health, go to gym and stay fit," he emphasized. "Use 20 percent of the time you spend on your phone and you will find time to cook."As a board member of the International Academy of Gastronomy, Nicolas is dedicated to advocate the concept of healthy eating, which includes reducing sugar intake, eating less, particularly less animal protein, and opting for minimally processed foods.These principles are reflected in the 10 proposals put forth by the AIG on its 40th anniversary in November last year. The manifesto asserts that "Gastronomy is about eating, preserving your health, understanding what you're eating, and having fun in a friendly environment." The proposals also encompass ecological respect of our land, protection of its biodiversity, preservation of local cuisine and the development of comprehensive educational program.In an effort to raise awareness about healthy eating, Nicolas is currently working on a comic book which will be published next year. It will cover engaging topics such as how you enjoy things with people, how you drink like a French, and how to cook simply and fast.With a history spanning thousands of years, it comes as very little surprise that China is home to a myriad of holidays and festivals, both old and new, sprinkled throughout the year. Most prominent of these is doubtless the Spring Festival holiday which is celebrated nationwide.Yet, due to the sheer scale of the country, traditions surrounding Spring Festival vary from province to province, so those traveling during the holiday period can experience new and interesting ways to enjoy the festival and its customs.My first experience of Spring Festival was in Changchun, capital of Jilin province in Northeast China, where I spent the holiday with the family of a friend, eating far too many dumplings and watching (but not understanding) the China Central Television's Spring Festival Gala with the constant explosion of fireworks going off in the background.What I didn't realize was these traditions, though similar in many ways, vary across the country. For example, the southern regions of China have a number of customs and celebrations that differ from those in the north, in particular those in Guangdong province and nearby Hong Kong where I spent the recent Spring Festival holiday.Among the lion dances and temple fairs, a common tradition for the locals of Hong Kong is to ring in the New Year at Wong Tai Sin temple. Wong Tai Sin, a Taoist temple, was constructed in 1921 in the Kowloon district of the city and is dedicated to Wong Tai Sin, or the Great Immortal Wong, the deified form of Huang Chuping, a Taoist hermit who lived during the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420). He is a popular figure in the south of China, and was said to possess the power of healing.The temple is a popular place of worship and tourism throughout the year, but during Lunar New Year, the crowds swell beyond measure, with eager visitors impatient to get inside and make their offering as soon as possible, due to the belief that the earlier you enter the temple to offer your incense, the better luck you will have for the coming year.Once they enter Wong Tai Sin, visitors are ushered through the complex at a constant pace just to keep the vast throngs of worshippers moving. Those entering with the purpose of praying find their fate using Chinese fortune sticks, where supplicants ask questions and receive answers on the flat sticks they choose that are inscribed with text or numbers.Seeing the crowds embrace this Spring Festival tradition at Wong Tai Sin is a remarkable experience and shows just how differently one holiday can be celebrated. It is this variety that keeps my life in China filled with countless new experiences and adventures, no matter where I go.Hailing from a remote mountainous village in Shidian county in the city of Baoshan, Southwest China's Yunnan province, Dong Meihua juggles two roles — entrepreneur and food vlogger.However, it's her passion for the latter that garners the most attention, as her videos not only tantalize taste buds, but also evoke a sense of nostalgia.Known as Dianxixiaoge — or Yunnan foodie — on social media since 2016, the 34-year-old now has around 40 million online followers in China and abroad, with her videos receiving up to 50 million views each.In the bamboo forests of western Yunnan, she demonstrated the joy of cutting bamboo and making it into different products; in sugarcane fields, she filmed the traditional process of making brown sugar; and wading through deep water, she immersed herself in the joy of harvesting fresh lobsters."I film whatever reflects Yunnan's uniqueness," Dong says, while also mentioning her first video documenting the process of harvesting and frying bamboo worms. She often favors short videos that are visually captivating, allowing her to swiftly secure the attention of her viewers."When I was young, I was determined to leave my hometown and pursue opportunities in the city," she says."However, upon returning after my adventures elsewhere, I discovered a newfound passion for exploring and presenting the beauty of my home province, as Yunnan has a unique cuisine and a wealth of specialties."Dong's dedication to her rural explorations has driven her to film daily and publish weekly for seven years, resulting in over 600 short videos to date."Food isn't just for filling our stomachs. It's also integral to our memories," she says, adding that her audience loves to see the ordinary happiness of her family as they share three meals a day.In late 2018, Dong's videos began to be posted on overseas video platforms and social media, and many Chinese students abroad volunteered to translate the video subtitles into multiple languages. Currently, she has over 10 million overseas followers.In late 2019, she was invited to speak at the University of Oxford, where she shared her journey as an ambassador for Yunnan cuisine and culture.Dong is also devoted to leading more villagers in Yunnan toward shared prosperity. She has collaborated with food factories and promoted over 120 local agricultural products on her social media accounts.She has also used livestreaming to endorse local delicacies, such as rice noodles, small coffee beans, cured meat, red tea, persimmons and green broad beans.Dong says that combined daily sales on her platforms reach as much as 200,000 yuan ($28,200), which in turn supports over 1,000 jobs.A more diverse and enriched image of contemporary China is presented through numerous engaging online content offerings made by social media influencers such as Dong Meihua, says Wang Ning, secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in an address to the opening ceremony of the China Internet Media Forum that kicked off Saturday."Life in Yunnan is a lifestyle worth seeing," Dong says. "I will continue to use my camera to capture everything here, truly allowing the world to see my beloved home province, and I also welcome more friends from home and abroad to visit Yunnan and Baoshan."A garden in Xiamen, Fujian province, is famous for its exquisite landscape bonsai, including many varieties that were introduced from Taiwan island, across the Strait.The garden is managed by Chen Hsiu-yu and her younger brother Chen Tai-ming, two second-generation Taiwan entrepreneurs.One can gauge its quality from the fact that the highest bid for one rare bonsai here exceeded $200,000."But we don't sell the most expensive one because it has been meticulously crafted over generations and has a history of over 100 years. It's a priceless inheritance," said Chen Hsiu-yu, general manager of Mark Agronomy, which her late father established in Xiamen in 1993. They sell others, though.Chen Hsiu-yu's father Chen Yanhuan arrived in Xiamen sometime in the early 1990s, in search of opportunities like many other business people from Taiwan. During his visit he found that there were hardly any large-scale nurseries in Xiamen; also, the city did not have much to show by way of landscape greening. So, he decided to introduce Taiwan's horticultural and landscape design to the coastal city.It wasn't until 30 years after her father died that Pan Yuping fulfilled his wish to be buried in his hometown, on Taiwan island.Being born into a family with a cross-Strait background, Pan has a profound understanding of the tragedy of separation among people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.Her family history and experience have increased her longing for the island's reunification with the motherland.As a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Pan has long been focused on the Taiwan question and has provided proposals and suggestions to government departments.She is also a member of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, one of the eight non-Communist political parties on the mainland.Despite her deep ties with Taiwan, Pan grew up in the southwestern province of Sichuan, where her mother is from. She speaks Mandarin with a Sichuan accent and enjoys spicy food such as hot pot, which Sichuan is famous for.Her father, who grew up in Taiwan, moved to the mainland with the military in December 1946, where he served as a military doctor. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, her father was assigned to work at a school in a remote area."Because of the hostile relations between the two sides of the Strait, my father was unable to return to his hometown in Taiwan," Pan said.Her father passed away in 1980, and before his death he had expressed his wish that his ashes be sent back to Taiwan. However, because of the unique circumstances, his ashes remained at their home in Sichuan for 30 years.During the late 1940s, many people, like her father, came from Taiwan to the mainland, for education, military service, or business. Because of the hostile cross-Strait relations, they were unable to return, remaining separated from their families for decades. Some were fortunate enough to return after cross-Strait exchanges resumed in the 1980s, but by then her father had died.After over a decade of cooperation with Chinese people and companies, Klaus-Dieter Merz from Germany has gained confidence in the country's scientific and technological development level.Merz, 70, first came to Gucheng county in Hengshui city, Hebei province, in 2012.Since then, he has been a chief expert at Hebei Allgrand Battery Co, dedicating himself to collaborative research and technical exchange in developing new batteries for Sino-German markets."I met Merz when I studied in Germany in 2000. Back then, we often engaged in academic exchanges," said Meng Xianghui, 45, chairman of the Gucheng-based company.Meng recalled that after he completed his studies and returned to China, he took over his family's enterprise and maintained regular contact with Merz, hoping for an opportunity to work together.After learning about the Chinese company's experience in technical research and development, hardware conditions, and environmental protection concepts, Merz readily accepted Meng's invitation.According to Meng, Merz has more than 30 years of experience in battery technology and is a globally renowned electrochemistry expert whose research areas include electrochemistry, battery manufacturing and energy engineering.In 2012, Merz was appointed as chief expert at Meng's company. Over the next 12 years, he made multiple annual trips between Germany and China."It should be said that it was Meng who chose me first, and then the strength of his company deeply attracted me," said Merz.Filling a gapHe recalled that a decade ago, there was a gap between China and the West in terms of enterprise production, technological level and societal conditions."But what I saw was the unlimited development potential of this country," Merz said.He then led a team of experts at the company. He developed a new generation of large cylindrical high-performance lithium batteries with high energy density, long cycle life and a wide operating temperature range, filling the gap in this field in China, according to Meng.Now, Merz is collaborating with the company to research and develop sodium-ion and solid-state batteries.Two products have already been finalized."We expect to start producing them in August. They will mainly be used in energy storage markets such as photovoltaic and wind power," Meng said.The company's sales network covers places across China and more than 60 countries and regions in North America, Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia and other parts of the world.Merz is optimistic about the future of the new energy project with his Chinese partner."In this era when green and clean new energy is increasingly valued worldwide, sodium-ion batteries, compared to widely used lithium batteries, have a higher safety factor," Merz said, adding that the primary raw material, sodium, is widely available and can be extracted from salt."This will significantly reduce costs and is conducive to widespread production," Merz said.Thanks to the decade of friendly cooperation, Merz has gained many insights."In China, there are highly skilled technical personnel and high-quality production line workers, and China's level of electronic and technological development has become more advanced and sophisticated," Merz said."We have had a very pleasant cooperation. Merz has provided us with guidance and assistance, and we have learned the professional rigor and innovative spirit of German experts, continuously propelling the progress of our company," said Sun Hao, deputy general manager of the battery producer Allgrand Battery Co.Rongchang xiabu craftsmanship — a Chinese traditional intangible cultural heritage — is getting more attention and market opportunities worldwide owing to the inheritance and innovation by Ivan Andrew Chen, a young man from India, and his Chinese wife, Tang Yi.Rongchang xiabu, a type of xiabu (literally "cloth for summer"), or Chinese linen, is an ancient handmade textile that originated in the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) in Rongchang district, Chongqing.Rongchang, Tang's hometown, is a historical city that claims three national cultural intangible heritages — Rongchang xiabu, Rongchang pottery and Rongchang paper fan-making techniques. It is also an ideal cultivation base for high-quality ramie, or China grass, from which the renowned xiabu cloth comes.Hailed as the "king of natural fibers", the textile is comfortable, easy to wash, durable, and gives off a silky luster, making it ideal summerwear.Xiabu from Rongchang was once immensely popular. It became a favorite fashion choice for royals and nobles during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and was one of the earliest exported products from the area in the 20th century, with an annual output of around 700,000 bolts.Born in Mumbai, India, in 1989, Chen has deep roots in China — his grandfather is a Chinese Indian from Guangdong province, and he has a quarter Chinese heritage. He worked as a service coach with an international airline in Qatar for six years.Chen reconnected with China in 2015 when he met Tang at a friend's party.Tang, 32, was born into a family that has concentrated in the xiabu industry in Rongchang for three generations. In 2022, her cousin Ma Linqin was honored as a municipal-level inheritor of Rongchang xiabu craftsmanship in Chongqing.Shortly after completing a college business degree in the United Kingdom, Tang returned home with a vision to help her family's businesses at Chongqing Rongchang Denan Linen Textile Co, one of the local pillar xiabu companies.In recent years, the cousins have incorporated elements appealing to younger tastes into the ancient art and have promoted hundreds of creative items made from their xiabu fabric, such as screens, decorative paintings, embroideries, folding fans, notebooks, bedding and towels. SHENZHEN  -- With lunges and squats and open arms, US teenager Makenna Kelpman was ready to "take off" in Beijing. When members of the martial arts team of Capital University of Physical Education and Sports (CUPES) pulled quickly on wires, Kelpman rose into the air and experienced the feeling of being a "chivalrous woman" in a kung fu movie."It feels great, but handling the wires is not as easy as it looks. Compared with the martial arts team, my posture in the air is not ideal. I need to practice more," said Kelpman.Kelpman is a high school student from Steilacoom High School in Washington State in the United States. Along with more than 20 other students from Lincoln High School and Steilacoom High School in Washington State, she embarked on an 11-day trip to China in mid-March as one of a new batch of "friendship envoys" who are part of China's five-year program to invite 50,000 American youths to China for exchanges and study.The movie "Kung Fu Panda" is one of Kelpman's favorites. Ranging from Chinese martial arts to giant pandas and Chinese food, she is very interested in the Chinese elements in the movie. At the CUPES, 15-year-old Kelpman was eager to have a try after first seeing the wonderful martial arts performances presented by the Chinese students."I love sports. I play football, I do wrestling, and I won a state golf championship, but I never learned Chinese martial arts. I can't wait," said Kelpman. Learning martial arts in China is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated and unforgettable experiences for Kelpman and her companions.From cities to mountains and rivers, over the course of a few days, the delegation visited many locations in China, experienced the colorful Chinese culture, and felt the enthusiasm and friendship of Chinese people.After a ride on winding mountain roads and a walk along rough trails, Lincoln High School student Jake Junior Tei and his twin brother Lucky Joe Tei finally reached the scene they had seen in "The Karate Kid," a film released in 2010, when they arrived at Wudang Mountain in central China's Hubei Province."I love kung fu movies and have watched Yip Man many times. Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Donnie Yen are my top three favorite kung fu stars," Jake Junior said.The brothers felt deep and keen desire for this trip, which was aimed at seeing and attempting real Chinese martial arts. In a green valley with luxuriant vegetation, they finally met their master, who was waiting to teach them the art of tai chi."This is so amazing! We had to endure a long slog to be here for tai chi, and now it turns out that all this was worth it!" Jake Junior exclaimed.What the Tei brothers did not know then was that a big surprise was still ahead of them -- they would later end up having closer contact with Bruce Lee in the city of Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong province.Retaining its exterior and furniture, the former residence of Bruce Lee's family on the old street of Yongqing Square in Guangzhou has been turned into a museum to commemorate the legendary martial artist."Seeing all these old photos and stuff is like walking into a movie. It's interesting to learn more about Bruce Lee and his family, and I also found Yip Man in photos," Jake Junior said as he showed his friends pictures he took inside the museum.As their stay in Guangzhou drew to a close, the US teenagers felt reluctant to depart. During their visit to Shenzhen, another city in Guangdong province, the US students met and sang songs together with Chinese students at the High School of Shenzhen Nanshan Foreign Language School (Group) -- turning the venue into an ocean of friendship."Friendship! The biggest gain in China is definitely friendship. I have met many Chinese friends and I think we will definitely keep in touch," Jake Junior said excitedly. "It's wonderful to gather around and sing together. I realized at that moment that we had so much in common," he added.After studying martial arts in China and making friends with Chinese students the same age as him, Jake Junior came to understand how to cultivate virtue and make friends with martial arts, as he was taught at CUPES.Through such shared experiences, the Chinese and US high school students got to join hands and plant a friendship forest in Qianhai Bay in Shenzhen."Maybe I'll come back in future and I hope the friendship thrives," said Kelpman after planting the seeds and watering the saplings of friendship.Embroidery specialist combines passion and skill to stitch together a prosperous future, Wang Ru and Li Yingqing report.For Jin Ruirui, a craftswoman engaged with making Yi embroidery, a traditional craft of the Yi ethnic group, this old handicraft still has a big role to play in modern times. She was also a deputy to the second session of the 14th National People's Congress held in Beijing earlier this month.Jin was one of the first university students from her hometown in A'nali village, Chuxiong Yi autonomous prefecture, Yunnan province. After working in Qujing in Yunnan for several years, she returned to Mouding county in 2014 and established a Yi embroidery company.Over the years, her company has developed rapidly, reaching an output value of 32 million yuan ($4.43 million) last year and contributes to rural vitalization as it provides income for more than 1,000 people, each earning 20,000 to 40,000 yuan a year.She has also promoted the craft abroad, attending Milan Fashion Week last year to show costumes with Yi embroidery elements."For me, Yi embroidery was the beautiful flowers my mother stitched on our clothes in childhood, and when I grew up, it became the craft that my family lives on," says Jin.Jin was born in the mountainous A'nali village in 1989, and Yi embroidery has been part of her life since childhood. "I grew up in an environment full of Yi embroidery. Every item of clothing we wore used it, and you can show anything you want on clothes through the stitches," says Jin.It was past 4 pm when I reached the Beijing Library. I quickly realized that this was no ordinary storehouse of knowledge, but a delightfully imposing, gargantuan building barely an hour's drive from Chaoyang district, where I live.It probably rivals any great library in the world, and holds a sizable number of books, mostly Chinese, in its cavernous interior, an architectural feat in itself. Much had been written about its grand opening late last year, but I had paid scant attention, assuming somehow that it would be just another of those institutions open to the public where rows and rows of books are kept neatly stacked but lie unread for decades for lack of a committed readership.But I was in for a surprise. The library, located on the city's outskirts in Tongzhou district, is a must-visit for any serious bibliophile, and was teeming with readers when I visited over the weekend.Its amazing layout, the ease and convenience of its display and its stupendous collection — albeit with literary works still being added each day — and the technical finesse that makes the borrowing and returning of books seamless, left me spellbound.I was soon mentally thanking a dear friend for suggesting that I pay a visit to this steel leaf-and-canopy marvel.The library has a fairly substantial collection of books in foreign languages, chiefly English, and I was delighted to see books by both contemporary and classical writers, with some of my favorites thrown in for good measure.I think a visit to this modern-day masterpiece is one of the best ways to spend a lazy Sunday. There is nothing better to do than being curled up with a book in a tiny corner of the humongous library from 10 am to 8 pm, I decided.Though it is a good hour away by subway with at least one transit stop en route, the library is only a 5-minute ride by taxi from the drop-off station, Beiyunhe West.While there, I almost missed the absolutely fantastic children's section, and was astounded to see kids of practically all age groups poring over comics and other tiny-tot literature.There is also a magazine section kept in drawers that open out for you to pick and choose; and one area is devoted to LPs (long-play, or full-length vinyl records) of classical and modern Western music, as well as other well-known composers and albums. I am not sure if these are available to borrow, though.And, if you are in the mood for coffee while reading, the cafeteria also comes equipped with two robotic contraptions that serve you at least five varieties of caffeine from a vending machine.For the tech-oriented, there is also a separate metaverse experience hall that is dazzling and quite futuristic. I even managed to speak into a microphone to ask the Mandarin-speaking virtual assistant's name.Membership of the library is open to foreigners, though you need to show your passport before they process the request.I've been skateboarding since I was a child, and for me, it's much more than just a hobby — it's an integral part of who I am, connecting me with a vibrant community of like-minded individuals. Skateboarding isn't confined to skate parks for me, either — it's my way of exploring a city and forming a unique connection wherever I go.Arriving in Beijing as a 20-year-old from Germany, I found skateboarding to be my compass in navigating this vast and unfamiliar city.My first impression of Beijing was its blend of ancient buildings and modern, futuristic architecture, which provided an eclectic mix of skate spots. From the smooth marble grounds of historic landmarks to the sleek urban plazas in commercial districts, each location offered its own set of challenges and opportunities for creative expression.This contrasted with the skate parks back home in Europe, which, while well-designed and functional, lacked the historical depth and aesthetic diversity found in Beijing.The city's infrastructure, with its neatly built streets and smooth surfaces, is also more "skate-able" than the rough asphalt roads and old cobblestone streets of Europe.The skateboarding community in Beijing has also taken me by surprise. I remember the first time going out on a street skating session with my Canadian friend, who introduced me to the local scene. I had some concerns initially, fearing that people might be a bit reserved around me — a foreigner.Yet, my worries turned out to be unnecessary. The first thing that caught my eye was a beautiful backside flip done by Seven, a Beijing skater and bass player who had started his own skating brand, "Interesting".He and his crew were just as welcoming and free-spirited as any skaters I'd met in Europe. It's this shared passion for skateboarding that binds this community together tightly across the globe.Even those outside the skateboarding community show curiosity and enthusiasm for the sport, which fascinated me. Passersby, especially elders and young children, often stop to watch us skate, with some even daring to try it out for themselves. This openness and eagerness for exploration were refreshing for me, and it provided a wonderful opportunity for cultural exchanges and mutual learning.While China's skateboarding scene is still developing, it's expanding rapidly. Local skaters, many of whom have drawn inspiration from Western skate culture, are eager to carve out their own identities and make meaningful contributions to the global skateboarding scene.Social media and the internet have played a pivotal role, enabling Chinese skaters to connect with their international counterparts, share experiences, and learn valuable insights from one another.Reflecting on the history of skateboarding in China, it's evident that the sport has come a long way since its introduction in the late 20th century. Initially viewed as an obscure and somewhat rebellious activity, skateboarding has gradually gained acceptance and popularity, mirroring global trends and the shifting cultural landscape of China.Now, with its inclusion in the Olympics, there is a growing recognition of skateboarding as a legitimate sport and a vibrant part of youth culture. I was both astonished and impressed to see toddlers effortlessly dropping into 3-meter-tall bowls in various skate clubs across Beijing and Chengdu, the capital of Southwest China's Sichuan province.My skateboarding journey in China has truly been enlightening, one that bridges the gap between Eastern and Western cultures.As I continue to navigate the streets and skate parks of Beijing, I do so with a deeper appreciation for the unique fusion of cultures here and the unifying power of skateboarding, which transcends borders and brings people together in the spirit of joy, freedom, and mutual respect.Written by Stefanie Perner, a 20-year-old German girl who completed her elementary school education in China. Having grown up with a diverse cultural background, she is passionate and open-minded about all cultures. Now back in China, she is pursuing her bachelor's degree at Tsinghua University in Beijing.Cheng Yuyan never expected that the interest group "We Love Strolling in the Park", which she casually created on Douban, a Chinese social media platform, four years ago, would now approach 100,000 members.According to the 25-year-old from Shanghai, establishing this group was just a spur-of-the-moment decision, and she didn't invest much time in managing it afterward. However, park enthusiasts from all over China and even overseas have spontaneously made it their gathering community. From Fuzhou in southern China to Harbin in the northeast, from Tokyo in Japan to London in the UK, people share park experiences, post photos taken in parks, and offer recommendations and reviews about parks."The growth of this group is the result of organic development, just like a park, where people naturally come together. The surge in member numbers also indicates the increasingly important role that parks are playing in people's lives," Cheng said.Within this group, there is a tag called "20 minutes for parks", which comes from a theory originating from the International Journal of Environmental Health Research. According to the theory, spending 20 minutes in a park daily helps to reduce stress, regardless of whether people exercise in it or simply take a walk.With the help of social media, the theory has been gaining popularity among a great number of young people in China. Huang Bingbing, hailing from Hunan and now living in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, is a practitioner of this idea.She said that Shenzhen boasts numerous community parks that are scattered in neighborhoods and between office buildings. Over three years ago, when she was still working at an advertising company, she used to frequently visit the small park downstairs during her weekday lunch breaks. "On that patch of grass, I could connect with living plants and animals, allowing me to refresh my mind and heal from the stresses of the workplace," Huang said.In the modern era, China often tops the gold medal table during the Summer Olympics by the time the closing ceremony has tooted its last toot and lowered the curtain on the quadrennial sporting spectacle. Whether one measures success by the number of yellow metal medals earned, or overall medals, the world's second-most populous country certainly holds its own in Olympic contests, particularly the Summer Games.The Olympics began in ancient Greece as a way for various city states to show their stuff and compete in hard-fought games that didn't involve actual warfare. But the Summer Olympics as we know them today officially kicked off in 1896, in, where else, their ancestral home of Athens. The Winter Games took another 28 years to get going, back in 1924 in France.The People's Republic of China, founded in 1949, was a relative latecomer to the athletic extravaganza, not having competed at the Olympics until 1952, at the Summer Games in Finland. Therefore, it's understandable that the country has had some catching up to do. Combined medals by country — gold, silver and bronze — for both hot and cold-weather versions of the contests are, for the top five: the US (2,959), Russia, including USSR (2,012), Germany, including East and West (1,821), Great Britain (950) and China (713).But despite being No 5 on the all-time list, over the past couple decades, China has been on a tear, a veritable gold-buying frenzy, with its yellow metal takeaways often topping the charts. If things continue apace, China will soon be barreling its way up the all-time rankings and knocking at the Olympic superpowers' doors.I lack public funding or research grants to conduct a scientific survey into what would be the greatest national honor for modern Chinese sports fans — topping the overall medals charts at either the Summer or Winter Games, seeing a few more Yao Mings dominate the NBA (or the CBA), or, seemingly the Holy Grail for most of the younger locals I asked in Beijing, taking home the solid gold FIFA World Cup trophy?The responses I received on which would represent the greatest glory for the country varied greatly, with older folks often being content to lead the medals table, whereas younger sports fans often said a soccer World Cup championship would best float their boat.Also, responses were highly subjective, with one particular trend worthy of note: diving and table tennis championships are still coveted, but running the table on a sport traditionally not dominated by China is considered by many to be even more valuable. FIBA basketball honors, FIVB volleyball glory, tennis grand slams and even golf major wins were all touted about. Naturally, responses were heavily affected by the favorite spectator, or participatory sport, of those being queried.There was generally a bit more excitement about another NBA star like Yao Ming emerging out of China than another female tennis star and two-time Grand Slam winner Li Na making her mark on the global stage. However, both names are household across China and have brought great glory to the country's athletic bragging rights.In short, those saying a soccer World Cup championship elicited the biggest flickers in respondents' eyes, but if you would indulge me in a bit of self-surveying — and in-your-face subjectivity — if I were a local, I would currently be most excited about the lengthy list of up-and-coming Chinese female tennis players. Because my love for the game is never out of bounds, even though "love" means "nada" in tennis.On the yoga mat, in the soothing waters of a spa pool, sipping on a warm drink from a thermos filled with red dates and wolfberries, or enjoying the comforting warmth of an electric foot bath — these are just some of the unique ways the new generation of young people are embracing the pursuit of wellness.As the pursuit of wellness becomes an essential pastime for many young people, a trend known as "New Chinese-style Wellness" has taken over social media platforms. Wellness, or yangsheng in Mandarin, is no longer a term exclusive to the middle-aged and elderly. Faced with intense competition in education and their careers, those born in the 1990s and 2000s have already embarked on a journey to safeguard their health.The concept of "New Chinese-style Wellness "emphasizes the idea of dietary therapy, advocating for the consumption of fresh, natural ingredients, balanced meals and exercising moderation in the consumption of oily and spicy foods, essentially maintaining a light and nutritious diet. Additionally, it promotes mental well-being by incorporating traditional Chinese medicine theories to regulate emotions and achieve a balanced development of physical and mental health.Furthermore, it advocates for light exercise, such as tai chi, to strengthen the body and achieve the goal of wellness and fitness.Many young people are riding a trend. During a busy work day, they enjoy sipping herbal teas brewed in wellness pots, enhancing their well-being while tapping away at their keyboards.Twenty-nine-year-old Tang Siyu, employed at an insurance company, is among those who have adopted a routine of carrying a large thermos flask into the office daily.With a regular bedtime of around 11 pm and an early wake-up time of 6:20 am to walk her dog, Tang ensures she engages in physical exercise four to five times per week."Having a balanced and healthy diet has always been important to me. I grew up drinking health tonics following my mother's advice, and now I continue to prioritize my health based on my own preferences," says Tang, who traces her habits back to her college days, when she was greatly influenced by her mother, a nutritionist.Reflecting on her health-conscious behavior, since the age of 17, Tang has prioritized early sleep, physical activity, and dietary control, avoiding fried foods, high-sodium products, and emphasizing a reduced sugar intake.Different from her mother's approach to health, which involves seasonal herbal remedies for tonifying the liver in spring and treating winter ailments in summer, like many other young people, Tang enjoys drinking milk tea and indulging in meals with friends. However, she opts for sugar-free milk tea and avoids excessive food intake."I'm quite conscious about my diet, considering factors like calorie intake per meal. For instance, if I have a high-calorie lunch, I adjust my dinner accordingly," Tang elaborates.The data from the Z Generation Nutrition Consumption Trend Report, published in 2022, also shows that young people are becoming the main drivers of health-related consumption. On average, each urban resident spends over 1,000 yuan ($138) annually on health and wellness products. Among them, the 18 to 35 age group accounts for 83.7 percent."My daily health regimen mainly consists of taking vitamin supplements, protein powder and Ganoderma spore powder to boost immunity. I regularly consult with a TCM practitioner and undergo related treatments like massage therapy," says Tang, who spends approximately 1,000 to 2,000 yuan on healthcare and wellness every month.In recent years, a new term has quietly emerged among young people — "punk wellness". Staying up late, applying the most expensive face masks, and using the most expensive eye creams; putting wolfberries in beer, or pairing ice cream with blood sugar-lowering pills. Overall, its subtle popularity reflects the attention and concerns that young people have about their own health conditions, albeit with a somewhat exaggerated sense of rectification.However, there is no denying that the trend of "punk wellness" has swept in like a cool fashion label, igniting a wave of unique wellness habits among young people. For example, buying large quantities of health products to blend in with the crowd, sharing knowledge and experience with peers, and strengthening a sense of belonging and identity.According to data from Meituan Waimai, a major Chinese food delivery platform, since September 2022, the weekly search volume for "healthy milk tea" nationwide has doubled. Consumers aged between 20 and 30 account for over half of the searches, with young people in Shanghai leading the trend, ranking first in the country for using the search term.Scripted murder games, known as jubensha in Chinese, have been steadily gaining popularity while continuously evolving into immersive experiences, with one of the most popular genres being those that evoke intense emotions.According to the scripted murder trading and information platform HEYTIME, games released last year raked in a staggering box office revenue of 3.3 billion yuan, with Love Actually I topping the list at 31.23 million yuan.Li Yihan, 27, also known by her pen name Tang Yuan, co-authored both Love Actually I and Love Actually II.She attributes part of the series' success to the blend of quality content and perfect timing. "In the past couple of years, the duration of scripted murder games has significantly increased, from 4-6 hours to possibly over 10 hours. I believe many people are weary of lengthy quests and dramatic emotional swings," she explained. "That's why we created Love Actually I, a 4-5-hour 'dessert' or 'low-alcohol cocktail', so that players can enjoy this lighthearted story even on a weekday evening after work."Another allure of the Love Actually series lies in the distinctive identities of its characters and their romantic storylines. "My partner and I refuse to accept that the world is dull and serious. I still hold onto the hope of receiving my Hogwarts admission letter someday. We aimed to infuse these sentiments into our works," Li said.In Love Actually II, the authors incorporated a space for intellectual discussion, a feature that resonated deeply with Shen Hang, a passionate enthusiast of scripted murder. Shen, 27, expressed her love for scripted murder, emphasizing the chance it provides to inhabit various lives, from people of diverse backgrounds in the past to futuristic personas."In Love Actually II, I portrayed a very distinctive character with a captivating love story. Throughout the 7-hour gameplay, I underwent a journey of questioning my existence and the world around me, ultimately leading to self-acceptance. It was a meaningful and touching experience," Shen said.Another notable author, Wu You, 26, known by her pen name Younan, wrote The Unfading Hawthorne Forest and its sequel, Hong Mei Hua Xia (Under the Blossom). A unique feature of her works is the flexibility of the Dungeon Master's gender. In most games, the DM is typically constrained to being either male or female, but Wu has crafted her stories in a way that breaks this convention, allowing the DM's gender to remain unfixed, with the aim of dismantling gender stereotypes."Certain sentiments or personalities are often perceived as either masculine or feminine by the general public. By introducing flexibility in the DM's gender, I hope players can focus on the characters and the storyline," Wu explained. "In my next production, all characters will be gender-neutral, encouraging players to explore love and dynamics freely."As authors craft the scripts, the DM guides players, turning the scripts into immersive gaming experiences.Xu Yao, 24, a full-time DM who entered the industry after graduating from college, believes that regardless of the game genre, the DM serves as the bridge between the author's vision and the players.Before presenting a new script to customers, Xu's team usually conducts at least one test run among staff members to ensure its quality and smooth operation.One of their most popular scripts, About Me Being a Killer, underwent several adjustments to enhance the cinematic experience, including lighting, choreography, and accents for non-player characters.Yu Tao, 37, views each scripted murder game as a stage for performance. "Like actors, an exceptional DM must possess a distinctive style or skill set," he said.Yu achieves this by reimagining lesser-known scripts, crafting them into his unique versions. "Instead of starting from scratch, I prefer to see my role as refining a promising script into an enjoyable gaming experience."In the script Qian Fo Meng (Dream of a Thousand Buddhas), which revolves around historical and cultural relic protection, Yu integrated silhouette acting behind a screen, evoking a dynamic experience akin to moving Dunhuang murals."I also introduce questions that reference previous plots or details, aiming to evoke guilt or other emotions. It's all about stirring emotions, whether positive or negative," Yu explained.Xu noted that script modifications may also cater to regional preferences, acknowledging the diverse tastes found across different regions. From an author's perspective, Wu welcomes and supports reasonable modifications. "I understand that player preferences may vary by region or even by store, and DMs need to adapt their characters accordingly," Wu acknowledged.However, when it comes to delivering a spectacular scripted murder experience, Yu believes it primarily depends on the quality of the script, followed by the players, and finally, the DM.Li echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of surprising twists and a cohesive, emotionally resonant narrative. "As a player myself, what draws me to scripted murder scenarios isn't the abundance of non-player characters or the refreshments provided during the game, but rather the stories themselves," Li said. "In our next production, we aim to continue providing unexpected yet logical twists while delivering a story that resonates emotionally with our audience.""For me, participating in a scripted murder experience is like unwrapping a gift," Shen said. "The elaborate outfits, gourmet food, and DIY crafts are merely fancy wrapping paper. The heart of the experience lies within the script itself. I sincerely hope that in the future, more authors realize this and write stories that are both surprising and logical."Whenever I think of my arrival in Beijing in 2019, I think of three almost funny things. One took place on the flight from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.The in-flight entertainment provided music from around the world. So I plugged in and tried out Classical, Cantopop, Western pop, Western rock, whatever was there on offer. But no matter how many different options I selected, I could hear the same song playing. And it wasn't even anything I had selected. Frustrated, I gave up. My co-passenger sitting beside me saw me struggling with the buttons and looked at me. But she said nothing. Neither did I. Just when we were about to land in Beijing, I noticed a set of buttons on my right armrest. Those worked. So all this while I had been fiddling with buttons for my co-passenger's system on the left armrest. Thankfully she wasn't using her headphones.My first morning in Beijing, someone from HR took me to get a SIM card. At the China Unicom store, she asked for my phone to check the system. Sometime later I noticed my phone was still in her hands. I went nearer to check if she needed help. She seemed to be checking out some photographs in my phone's photo gallery. This is so unethical, I thought. Why should she do that? I tried to check which photograph had caught her fancy. When I tried to get closer to take a look, she tried to hide the phone from me. The more I tried to look, the more she moved the phone further away. This was getting a bit too much now, I thought. Shouldn't I protest? When I saw her making no effort to return my phone I raised my hand to catch her attention. She was unmoved. Exasperated, I gave up. But just then I noticed another phone lying on a table where we were standing. It was unmistakably mine. The one in her hand was her own phone, the same model as mine, also Made in China.I had found out that a classmate of mine from India was now my colleague and lived in the same building, albeit on another floor. I devised a plan to go to his place with another colleague and surprise him. The idea was to let my colleague introduce me as Anil — or Manoj, or any other Indian name but my own — from India and see how he reacted, assuming that my face would remind him of someone from two decades ago. Alas, that was not to be. He had gone to bed early as he had to report for work early the next day. So I took solace in making some new acquaintances at his home, thinking I had already had enough brushes with comedy in my first 24 hours in a new country.On Feb 14, Valentine's Day, which fell on the fifth day of the first lunar month as the Chinese were celebrating Spring Festival, Shanghai-based showroom interior designer Huang Weilai found himself unable to sleep after receiving a message from the Milan headquarters of women's fashion brand, Miu Miu.The Italian brand wanted to invite Huang's mother Qin Huilan, who turned 71 in December, to walk their runway show at the Paris Fashion Week for its Fall and Winter 2024 collection show."I was so excited and I couldn't believe it," says the 34-year-old. "I've been following fashion news for years and I know that selecting models for runway shows is very important. I am so proud that my mother, a woman in her 70s, was invited."Qin shared her son's excitement. Born and raised in Liuzhou in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, she is a retired physician. After accepting the invitation, she left for Paris on March 2."The 70-year-old wore a long gray coat with silver embellishments, a pair of oversized metallic gloves, a black scarf, a small brown leather bag and a pair of pointy-toe Mary Janes. … Huilan had plenty of eyes on her while she walked the runway, as the fashion house had a stacked front row. ... But she walked like a pro and brought her love of the house to the forefront," an article on the website of American magazine People said on March 5 after the show.Village doctor and NPC deputy devotes her life to helping improve the health of people in remote rural areas, Wang Ru in Beijing and Li Yingqing in Kunming report.Having worked as a village doctor for nearly two decades, Yang Lianying, a 44-year-old deputy to the 14th National People's Congress, stands out as a voice for her profession.As one of the doctors in Henan village in the Honghe Hani and Yi autonomous prefecture in Yunnan province, Yang is responsible for 1,950 permanent residents, and checks their health regularly, registers their conditions, and informs them of issues like preventive injections and pregnancy examinations."My biggest hope is that villagers are healthy," says Yang, who has been an NPC deputy since 2018 and who has won praise from her community for her hard work and perseverance.Born in Mengzi, Yunnan, in 1980, Yang was a farmer for many years before she began to receive medical training in 2005 in the hopes of making a better living.Yin Jiongjie, 24, shares his experience of competitions, older musicians and the art of leading an orchestra, Chen Nan reports.Like many young musicians, Yin Jiongjie has participated in competitions around the world, which he says is a great way of gaining experience by working with symphony orchestras, as well as an opportunity to raise your visibility.When it comes to dealing with unexpected situations right before or during a competition, the 24-year-old conductor also has answers.A day before he competed during the first round of the 57th Besancon International Competition for Young Conductors in France in 2021, for example, Yin fell ill. "Maybe it was because of spoiled food I had eaten the day before", he says. He only managed one piece of candy before going onstage and didn't think that he would make it to the final, although he did. The jury decided not to award a Grand Prix that year, as the high standards of the finalists made it impossible to decide between them. Yin and the two other finalists were given a Special Mention instead. "Jong-Jie Yin, the youngest of the finalists, had a very good mastery of the music, considering his young age," says Paul Daniel, jury president.Entrepreneur helps alleviate the grief of lost love by disposing of sentimental mementos, Wang Qian reports.When love ends, what happens to the mementos? It's a question faced by most couples who part ways. Fortunately, a waste disposal center in North China's Hebei province seems to provide a solution. The facility in Langfang shreds hundreds of wedding photos and sends them to a power plant incinerator, where they are turned to dust, much like those once happy marriages.The business has proved a hit with more than 200 clients, who have sent various keepsakes, mainly wedding photos, from across the country. Liu Wei, a 41-year-old resident of Beijing, launched the service early last year, which has helped people destroy their unwanted personal items, such as smartphones, laptops and documents."As a marketing gimmick, wedding photos are just part of our business. It was beyond my expectations how much it caught the public and media's attention. Maybe it is the emotions and stories behind the need for the service that resonates with shifting attitudes toward marriage," Liu says.These changes in attitude are reflected in the latest data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, which shows that in the first three quarters of last year, more than 1.97 million couples registered for divorce, up 1.4 percent year-on-year."Divorce, which used to be a social taboo, is no longer a topic that people feel cannot be discussed publicly. It is a common phenomenon, which can be seen among those born in the late 1970s and early '80s. I have seen so many people divorce, and some, although still married, go on dates with other people," Liu says.Talking about why the memento disposal service became such a hit, he says that maybe it provides a discussion platform for different opinions to be heard.Under his posts on short video platform Douyin, a comment from one user with the handle "Caicai "says: "It is a surprise to find that the strongest part of a marriage is the wedding photos." Although that sounds ironic, for many couples in China, tearing up wedding photos after a failed marriage is — quite literally — not an easy task.Seasoned practitioner and NPC deputy seeks innovation in promoting and inheriting traditional medicine, Li Yingxue and Yang Jun report.In treating temporary facial paralysis, Professor Yang Shuo emphasizes a holistic approach. "Beyond addressing the condition itself, we must also consider treating the individual," he instructs interns at Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. "That entails focusing on their meridians and acupuncture points."While juggling his teaching responsibilities, Yang attends to over 60 patients a day at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Additionally, he dedicates time to caring for hospitalized individuals.Adding to his impressive workload, last year, Yang assumed the role of a National People's Congress deputy. Despite his busy schedule, he prioritizes grassroots engagement, conducting visits and research to amplify community voices at the national level.His mission: to bolster the advancement of traditional Chinese medicine and pass on its rich culture.The 49-year-old brings 25 years of expertise to his practice, and specializes in treating spinal conditions. Employing techniques like qi (energy flow) adjustment and modern structural acupuncture, he focuses on holistic healing."Using pulse diagnosis and a comprehensive approach," Yang explains, "I combine traditional methods, like the assessment of meridian, bloodletting, and zangfu tuina (visceral manipulation) to treat ailments like neck and back pain."His approach integrates ancient wisdom with modern techniques, offering hope to patients suffering from a variety of musculoskeletal issues.The key to effective acupuncture lies in balancing the body's qi, ensuring its smooth flow, he says."For instance," Yang says, "if someone's breathing is rapid and they're easily irritable or experiencing insomnia or headaches, it suggests hyperactivity of the qi that needs to be regulated. Acupuncture can help bring it back into balance."After two years of implementing a hybrid working model, major travel agency Trip.com Group reports it has helped its employees cut commute time by 700,000 hours altogether and raise work efficiency. The agency launched the initiative that allows its employees to choose two days to work at home, in February 2022, and more than 80 percent of those born after in the 21st century have applied. The company found that the work efficiency of these young people has not been significantly affected, while the focus and output of some individuals had even improved.Liang Jianzhang, chairman of the board at Trip.com Group, says: "Promoting hybrid work is a win-win situation for enterprises, employees, and society. Not only does it improve employee satisfaction without affecting efficiency, but it also helps reduce traffic congestion, alleviates high housing prices and regional disparities, promotes family harmony, increases fertility rates."Recent box-office hit YOLO fuels a national surge in popularity for the sport of boxing, He Qi reports in Shanghai.If Zou Shiming's winning of multiple world and Olympic boxing championships is seen as a milestone in Chinese boxing history, the recent film Re La Gun Tang — which also goes by the English title YOLO — about an overweight woman rebuilding her confidence through boxing, can be seen as another, and is set to boost the development of the sport in China, according to Wang Dexin, a boxing professor at the Shanghai University of Sport.A boxing instructor for over 30 years and Zou's former mentor, Wang served as the technical director of boxing for YOLO, an acronym for "you only live once", which dominated China's box office during the Spring Festival holiday, and which has so far grossed more than 3 billion yuan ($420 million).During filming, lead actress, Jia Ling, who also directed the movie, lost 50 kilograms playing the protagonist Du Leying.The film's popularity and Jia's success have ignited a fervor for the sport of boxing among moviegoers that has transcended theaters.Data from e-commerce platform Meituan shows that online searches related to "boxing" increased 388.4 percent year-on-year in the week following the movie's premiere on Feb 10, and the consumer review platform Dianping saw a 337.53 percent increase in related comments.Keyword searches, such as "adult boxing", "trial boxing class", and "female boxing" have seen a tenfold year-on-year increase. Shanghai ranks highest in search volume, the data shows.Wang is also an instructor for referees accredited by the International Boxing Federation and a member of the Asian Boxing Confederation's Referees and Judges Commission. Committed to promoting boxing throughout his career, he is gratified by the positive response to the film."The influence of YOLO has achieved levels of promotion and popularization of boxing rarely seen in the past few decades, and I think it will be difficult to surpass in the short term," says Wang.While boxing dates back to ancient times and is considered one of the oldest forms of martial arts in the world, China is a latecomer to the development of modern boxing, Wang says.A woman's experience of losing her mother and a cancer diagnosis launched a quest of understanding that ultimately inspired a journey to become a hospice volunteer and, consequently, an author, Yang Yang reports.On July 6, 2019, 62-year-old Xu Shu came to the palliative care unit at Beijing Haidian Hospital, the Haidian Section of Peking University Third Hospital, as a volunteer photographer. She hesitated. She knew that on the hospice beds lay cancer patients who, with life expectancies of no more than six months, usually suffered from severe pain.She knew how miserable they may look and sound.Three years before, when her mother received chemotherapy, Xu heard the wailing of a terminal cancer patient at the same ward."It's so appalling. All the other patients became nervous when they heard the howling because that might also be their future," she recalls.Her mom told her she'd rather die in a coma.Xu's mother had lived with cancer for three years. But it was still hard for Xu to prepare for her unexpected death.In her final days, her health deteriorated quickly. Xu didn't know what could be done at home. So, she sent her mom to the hospital.It was a Sunday in mid-July. The ward's air conditioner was blowing cold blasts onto the bed to prevent cross infection. The nurse said nothing could be done about it.The pharmacy didn't have opioids because it was the weekend. But Xu was still able to obtain transdermal patches that she thought could help her mother get through the night.Before she drove her exhausted father home, she helped her mother lie down, covered her with a blanket and applied pain-relieving medicinal liquor on her dying purple toes. Her mom asked her to take good care of her father and said, "See you tomorrow".Those were her last words.Xu wanted to return to the hospital but was too tired. Thinking the nurses would attend to her mother, she fell asleep.She returned early the next morning and was surprised to receive an official notice that her mother was in critical condition.Xu rushed to her bedside. She found her mother couldn't move her facial muscles — and her hands were tied to the bed.She asked her mom what had happened, but she could only move her head. A nurse explained "the patient" had been writhing in pain, so they'd secured her arms so she wouldn't disconnect the infusion tube. A night nurse had mistakenly peeled off the two transdermal patches, which no longer worked after they were reapplied."The pain was so intense that she had a stroke," she says.Xu was devastated, thinking about how lonely, desperate and pain-stricken her mother was in that cold ward while she slept at home.The hospital only allowed half-hour visits each day.After the stroke, her mother was not able to say a word. And before Xu was ready, her mother died alone in the ICU.When she rushed to the hospital, she found fluid was oozing from a hole in her mother's chest. But she recalled she'd told the doctor to not do any invasive procedures.Xu was overcome with sorrow, regret, self-blame and despair. Half a year later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer.She sent her father to an elder care center while she received treatment. And she and her husband spent the following year and a half traveling the world.In Britain, she lay on a lawn outside a beautiful graveyard, where she found people appeared more relaxed when confronted with death. In Kenya, she saw beautiful wild animals and shot great memories with her camera.But travel didn't allow her to entirely escape her sadness. She had to stop and contemplate her own death, "which is inevitable"."If I wanted to continue traveling blithely, first, I needed to answer the question that kept coming to me: If my cancer progressed, where and how am I going to die? I don't want to undergo my mother's pain. I don't want to die at the hospital in lonely despair. I was wondering if there is any better way to die," she says."If, in the end, I get symptoms that can't be dealt with at home, where can I go to relieve the symptoms and die not so alone and helpless?""Visually impaired children have to be really cautious when touching the dots of a traditional Braille book," says Song Yanlin, a professor at the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.While Braille can only be imprinted on specially imported paper, which costs 15 to 20 times more than regular paper, the raised dots within Braille books can easily become flattened with repeated reading. The high expense and scarcity of Braille books can hinder educational opportunities for visually impaired children.Recognizing the urgent need for innovation in Braille printing technology, Song and his team embarked on a mission to enhance the quality and efficiency of Braille printing. Their research subsequently helped revolutionize Braille printing and improved printing accuracy at multiple levels.The new Braille printing technology has been promoted in China to the forefront in the field of global green Braille printing.Investing in the futureA traditional Braille printer embosses dots onto a special kraft paper using metal plates, but books printed using this method may not be durable. Song suggested transforming the conventional Braille printing process to make it more accessible."By precisely controlling the formation of ink droplets and manipulating each droplet to create a slightly raised structure, a basic Braille character can be represented," Song says.The primary hurdle for Song and his team was in tackling the "coffeering effect", a persistent issue in the field of printing in which a liquid, like a drop of coffee, evaporates on a surface, resulting in a ring-like pattern.Since 2006, Song and his team have concentrated on studying the coffee-ring effect in inkjet printing. They effectively managed nanoscale interface properties between the ink and substrate, averting any unexpected spreading of ink droplets.Based on this breakthrough, they printed the smallest ink dots recorded, with each containing just a few nanoparticles. These dots were interconnected to produce the finest lines, then the sleekest surfaces.The achievement marks a leap beyond traditional six-dot printing in Braille. With this new printing technology, Braille is not confined to text alone. It can also generate intricate graphics, aiding visually impaired students in comprehending complex mathematical concepts."By achieving this, blind children can also experience the beautiful curves of mathematical functions, appreciate three-dimensional topographical maps, and enjoy the pleasure brought by graphics and patterns through the touch of their fingertips," he says.Researchers also used environmentally friendly nano-antibacterial ink on 3D materials."This material permeates the surface of the paper, deeply integrating with the paper fibers through capillary force. It can firmly bond with the paper surface, so Braille dots will be highly resistant to friction, ensuring the durability of Braille books," Song says.In addition to printing on paper, the new technology facilitates printing on a variety of other materials. Song crafted a specialized Rubik's Cube for the visually impaired, featuring distinct patterns on each face. The technology has the potential to be incorporated into the daily life and needs of the visually impaired, such as in the design of packaging and bags, Song says.During a visit to the Beijing School for the Blind, Song found that a number of visually impaired children exhibited exceptional proficiency in solving Rubik's Cube puzzles, often surpassing other children in both speed and skill."Blind children are born without intellectual difference compared with sighted children. However, the disparity widens due to limitations in their educational opportunities," Song says."Our goal is to bridge this gap. We aim to enrich the cultural experiences of those unable to perceive the world through their eyes."The Braille printing technology was adopted during the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics. The team printed bilingual books to include visually impaired audiences. It covered athlete guides, venue descriptions, real-time event updates, and extensive tactile maps placed around event locations."It marked a historic moment in the Olympics as it represents the first widespread use of inclusive materials catering to both sighted and visually impaired audiences," Song says.Dedicated to othersThe innovative technology has been adopted in various settings across China, with the first few batches of tactile postcards and maps specifically designed for the visually impaired having been introduced in museums and libraries in Nanjing and Fuzhou of Jiangsu and Fujian provinces.At the Beijing Daxing International Airport, Song and his team's research was represented through tactile signage that helped visually impaired travelers get around and significantly enhanced the airport's accessibility services.To further improve the reading experiences of the visually impaired, Song developed multisensory printing products."Relying solely on touch significantly limits the information available to people with visual impairments. By integrating auditory and olfactory elements into the ink, our aim is to provide them with a comprehensive sensory experience," he says.Utilizing the new technology, people can print a Braille book where, upon a visually impaired person touching objects like an apple or a pear in the picture book, they can also experience the genuine scents of the corresponding fruits. The innovation is set to significantly compensate for the lack of visual input."We aspire to extend these benefits to blind individuals worldwide," Song says.He is actively exploring potential collaborations with international disability support organizations and Braille printing houses to share the technology and enhance the lives of visually impaired people globally.About a decade ago, Song had an encounter with a young visually impaired girl who was singing You Are My Bright Eyes, originally performed by a visually impaired singer named Xiao Huangqi."I was deeply touched by the lyrics and the girl's performance," Song says.From that moment on, a seed was planted in his heart."I started to think how we could help improve the lives of the blind by scientific research, and I found a field that requires more attention, that is, Braille printing," he says.Song says what he does is "a journey of mutual enlightenment".He once visited a school for the visually impaired and, enjoying a children's choir, felt his soul purified. "Their faces were pure and innocent, which was testament to their incredibly resilient and strong spirit despite disabilities," he says. "If we can embrace such positive attitudes toward life, we can find joy too."Song says he believes that scientific research should be motivated by the needs of society.Song and his team have begun experiments to develop and print high-performance, resilient cochlear implants for those with hearing disabilities, as well as innovative facial expression recognition systems for individuals unable to speak. The research is still in the experimental stage."It's vital to concentrate on the less noticeable areas, to attend to what others might overlook," he says.   Blind people in China have been struggling in guessing the meaning of Braille due to its lack of tones. For instance, Mandarin Braille does not have the ability to differentiate between the Chinese words "time" (shijian with jian in the first tone) and "practice" (shijian with jian in the fourth tone) due to identical pronunciations despite the differing tones.Things have changed as China introduced the Chinese Common Braille Scheme in 2018.After seven years of research, Zhong Jinghua, a professor at the Special Education College of Beijing Union University, devised a Chinese Braille system capable of representing the tonal aspects inherent in Mandarin.Zhong's groundbreaking work put an end to the 70-year history of non-tonal Braille in which visually impaired individuals had to guess word meanings.Now, tonal Braille has been integrated into primary education and Braille publishing, encompassing textbooks used in schools for the visually impaired across China.Inclusive sign language poetry workshop broadens horizons of expression and explores beauty of the medium, Cheng Yuezhu reports."In the flowing sands, I seek my own voice. Calling out to life: I love you, myself." This poem was by Wang Yiming, a performer and blogger with hearing loss.She wrote the poem at an inclusive poetry workshop, in which most participants had hearing loss, that was hosted by the Beijing Body On&On Cultural Exchange Center and Sign Alley.Wang says that the inspiration for the poem came from the interactive icebreaker exercises at the start of the workshop, where the participants and the instructor gathered in a circle, moved their fingers in the air, and then massaged the people next to them."I felt I could see sands shifting to vibrating sounds in a deserted area, forests, mountains, rivers, the sun, clouds, blue sky … Endless beautiful images of nature unfolded in my mind. I've never felt so carefree, comfortable or relaxed," Wang says."In that wondrous space, I truly felt that life comes from the Earth or nature. Although our lives may not be perfect, they deserve to be valued and cherished."After the interactive exercises, the participants sat around a table and introduced themselves, describing the feeling of giving and receiving a massage, and then engaged in a series of poetry collage exercises, with each participant writing down a noun, verb or adjective and then passing it on to the next person, and the sixth person arranging the five words into a verse.The last and main part of the workshop was writing a tercet (three-line) poem. As most of the participants were deaf or hard of hearing, the poems were presented in sign language in front of a camera, and participants without hearing loss were taught how to sign their poems.Theater artist, writer and curator Ai Kuo was the workshop's instructor. He says that to provide the participants with an experience that would involve different senses, he condensed his previous workshops.While many awards recognize and support outstanding photographers in China, there are very few that celebrate curators, who are also instrumental in researching and bringing themed exhibitions of photography and moving images to the public, whether in physical or virtual spaces.So, aspiring young curators, especially those working with lens-based art, rejoiced when the prestigious Jimei x Arles International Photo Festival set up the Curatorial Award for Photography and Moving Image in 2021.Co-initiated in 2015 by the Three Shadows Photography Art Centre, one of the first contemporary art spaces dedicated exclusively to photography in China, and the Rencontres d'Arles, which is often called the "Cannes Film Festival of the photography world", the annual festival has grown into an essential fixture on China's photography scene. It has organized hundreds of exhibitions that showcase the latest work of local and international artists.The curatorial award claims to be the first of its kind in China. It's a collaboration between the art center, based in both Beijing, and Xiamen, Fujian province, and the French fashion house, Chanel."We set up the award in the hopes of encouraging more talented curators to pay attention to photography and moving-image art, to gradually improve the ecosystem of photography and moving-image art," says Rong Rong (the penname of Lu Zhirong), co-founder of Three Shadows and of Jimei x Arles.Rong Rong, who's also an established photographer, laments the lack of exceptional curators working in photography and moving-image art, and says this has led to a deficiency in academic research and criticism of these mediums. This means lens-based art, which is a relatively young art form, is relevantly less valued than other mediums, such as painting and sculpture, he says.Yan Yuzhi and his five colleagues celebrated this year's Spring Festival atop Pamir Plateau in the Tashikurgan Tajik autonomous county of Kashgar prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. Their job is to maintain and operate a photovoltaic power station that is fueling the local economy.With so few people around, the quiet surrounding the station around 3,300 meters above sea level is only interrupted by wind and the occasional barks from dogs running below the vast rows of photovoltaic panels."We need to maintain normal operation of all equipment and guarantee stable power supply for residents in the county during the holiday," said Yan, a safety supervisor engineer and deputy head of the station.The station offers more than electricity.In 2017, the Futian district of Shenzhen, Guangdong province, invested 90 million yuan ($12.5 million), and the Shenzhen Energy Group added 84 million yuan, into building the station as the first centralized power station for poverty-relief purposes in Xinjiang.Since being put into operation in May 2018, all of the station's distributive profit has been given to the county government to create jobs, establish educational funds and critical illness medical funds, and conduct other projects related to rural vitalization. The nonprofit mode will last 20 years through 2038 and is expected to benefit more than 16,000 people from about 4,000 families.So far, the station has produced over 250 million kilowatt-hours of power with an annual average of 40 million kWh. As of the end of 2022, it had paid 19.59 million yuan to the county government, according to Yan.The money is used as salary for about 900 residents working as forest rangers, border guards, childcare workers and other posts, and it is used to promote a collective economy for 47 villages and to finance nonprofit projects, he added.Thanks to the project, Jerap Bayrak, 27, became a security guard in his village in July 2023, earning an additional 1,900 yuan monthly."I used to grow wheat and barley at home, raise yaks, and sometimes do odd jobs. The income was not very stable. Now, with this fixed income, our whole family's life is improving," he said.Xarwana Marwanjan, 26, is one of the two employees hired from the county. After graduating from college, she once worked as a kindergarten teacher and at a tourist center. In 2020, she applied for a job at the station. Now, she is an operation and maintenance engineer.Joining the new energy industry has been very challenging for her, and she has learned a lot."The electricity generated here is all used for the development of our county. I feel that working here is very meaningful," she said. "The station often provides training to help us better master the skills required for the job."According to Yan, 12 employees maintain the station's operation. Each person works for 16 days and rests for 14 days per month.At an average altitude of 4,000 meters, Tashikurgan is known as the county closest to the sun. Because of the harsh environment with thin air, frigid temperatures and poor traffic, residents used to live impoverished lives. However, the county has rich solar resources, providing about 4,434 hours of sunshine annually."Tashikurgan is an ideal place for developing photovoltaic power. The annual average utilization hours of power generation equipment far exceed those of other areas in Xinjiang," said Yan.During the holiday, the workers have been making daily inspections and troubleshooting, according to Yan. The station has 77,760 photovoltaic modules in an area of 42.3 hectares."In the past, workers had to patrol a 42-kilometer distance each time. We also used telescopes to look for smoking or malfunctioning solar panels. Last year, we introduced drones, which help us inspect the entire area in just half a month," said Yan.Since 2010, Shenzhen has assisted in developing Kashgar city and the Tashikurgan Tajik autonomous county as part of a national program enlisting 19 provinces and cities to help Xinjiang.As of early November last year, Shenzhen has invested 12.665 billion yuan and participated in 894 aid projects in Xinjiang, leading to an investment of over 31 billion yuan from enterprises and 637 million yuan in social donations, data from the command headquarters of Shenzhen's paired assistance to Xinjiang showed.   When Chen Wenjun first came to Kashgar prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, in early 2015, he had no intention of staying and starting his own business.At that time, he and his colleagues were promoting the Guangzhou New City, a commercial complex in Kashgar's Shufu county. They traveled around southern Xinjiang and felt the warmth and kindness of locals.Every time they went to the countryside to distribute leaflets, the villagers welcomed them with watermelons and cantaloupes. During meal time, the farmers would insist on inviting them to eat. When they got lost and unable to communicate due to language barriers, people would ride electric bikes to take them to their destination, even a dozen kilometers away, according to Chen."What touched me the most was one midnight, our car broke down in the Gobi Desert, more than 100 kilometers from our destination Yarkant county. When we felt desperate in the darkness, a small car stopped, and two Uygur friends got out. They helped tow the car for more than six hours. By the time the car reached the repair shop, it was already getting light," Chen said."However, when we wanted to thank the two men, they firmly refused and said something that deeply shook my hearts: 'Friend, I believe that when we encounter difficulties, you will help us too.'"At that moment, they decided to stay and do something meaningful and helpful for the local people.After a six-month investigation, they found that the quality and taste of the fruits in southern Xinjiang were exquisite and available in every household year-round. Yet, there was no good market for them, which was one of the reasons for the local people's poverty at the time.In November 2015, they founded Kashgar Jiangguoguo Agricultural Technology Co in Shufu county to purchase fruit from farmers, teach them planting skills, upgrade their gardens, hire them and make them stakeholders.Now a leading agricultural company in Xinjiang, it has four branches and sells fresh fruit, nuts, dried fruit and fruit drinks across China. That includes jujubes, grapes, pears, Badam nuts, walnuts and pistachios."Thanks to long sunlight hours, the big temperature difference between day and night and good soil, annual fruit production in Xinjiang reached more than 16 million metric tons, which involves the interest of 10 million farmers," said Chen, chairman of the company."However, in the past, when I visited the farmers' homes, I saw their red dates and walnuts piled up in the corner because they couldn't be sold due to long distance from customers and poor cultivation methods affecting fruit quality. They could only be used as animal feed."Jiangguoguo signed an agreement with 76 local cooperatives, which will collect fruits the company wants and get paid. The money will then be given to farmers who provide the fruit."In this way, farmers will not worry about whether their products can be sold," Chen added.As of the end of last year, the company has purchased 105,000 tons of agricultural products from Xinjiang farmers, providing 3,500 jobs to locals in tandem with the cooperatives. They work in logistics, packaging, selection, marketing and other posts.Dilbar Hani, a sales manager of the company, earns about 350,000 yuan ($48,000) per year, with a maximum monthly salary of 47,000 yuan. She joined the company in August 2019 and became a team leader the following March.She said she is satisfied working there. "I sent my child to a good school. I took my parents to travel and bought them gold," she said.About 90 percent of the company's 405 employees are from Uygur, Tajik, Hui or Kazak ethnic groups.Abderiyim Kmil, from the storage and logistics department, used to do farm work at home after graduating from high school. His annual income was between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan.One year after he joined the company in 2019, he became a shareholder because of good performance. Now, he leads a team of 18 people and earns between 4,000 to 8,000 yuan per month. His family moved out of their village. "I bought a car and house in Kashgar. My daughter studies there. Our life is better now."On Nov 8, 53 families in Oksak, a town in Shufu county, split 60,000 yuan as dividends from Jiangguoguo. Ablat Oxur, who received 1,000 yuan that day, said he is grateful for the excellent policy, Shufu county media center reported.In 2019, China Telecom, one of the country's three major telecommunications operators, donated 2 million yuan to Ruinong Cooperative, which then bought agricultural product processing equipment for Jiangguoguo, making the cooperative a company shareholder, the center reported.Every year, the cooperative receives 200,000 yuan as a dividend and sends it to farmers, especially those with economic difficulty, according to the report.Additionally, the company has organized about 800 training sessions for roughly 50,000 farmers. It upgraded 300 hectares of fruit farms. The families of 146 farmers became shareholders, receiving a total dividend of 1.4 million yuan.The company's sales grew from 105 million yuan in 2020 to 350 million yuan last year through online and offline channels.After the China (Xinjiang) Pilot Free Trade Zone was established in November last year, Chen also saw more opportunities from overseas. "With the construction of the zone, export of products to Europe through Central Asia will become more convenient," Chen said, adding that he is confident about its future development.As part of the program for Guangdong province to aid the development of Xinjiang, the company also enjoys preferential policies for infrastructure construction, decoration and transport. About 50 percent of products are sold in Guangdong, according to the company.   Young travelers prioritize places that make a good impressionStamp collecting has recently emerged as a fresh and innovative approach for young people to document their travels, and many have been driven by the hobby, which offers a strong sense of interactivity and ceremony, to explore more attractions.Instead of merely capturing photos with famous landmarks, enthusiasts of this new trend eagerly explore every nook and cranny of various attractions, museums, and shops during their journeys in search of a diverse array of stamps.They imprint the stamps, usually with single or multicolored pictures of the scenic spots, names of the places, profiles of famous people or cultural relics, on postcards or in travel journals or commemorative albums, thereby creating a unique keepsake of their travels.Free or paid, each stamp serves as a tangible representation of the visitor's presence at that specific location, becoming a cherished part of their memories. Furthermore, it has facilitated the discovery of hidden gems and unique travel experiences at destinations.Kuang Zhaoxin, a 25-year-old designer, is an avid traveler and has been passionate about scrap-booking for over six years. She enjoys sketching and painting, using the book as a means to record memories from her travels.Early last year, during one of her trips, she encountered stamp collecting and decided to incorporate it into her travel journal. Before each trip, she researches stamp-collection strategies on social media. During a two-day trip to Beijing, she collected over 80 stamps.Kuang particularly admires the beautifully crafted replica artifact stamps found in museums. She said that impressing these into her journal and then recording memories from the museums creates a strong sense of connection."It actually leaves a trace, a sense of ceremony. It serves as a great way to record the trip. When you see a particular exhibit and then happen to collect a stamp of the exhibit, looking back, you'll marvel at how beautiful it was and recall how impressive the exhibit was," she said.Kuang also enjoys purchasing postcards, impressing them with distinctive local stamps, adding well-wishes, and then sending them to her friends."I never imagined that I would one day become a jewelry designer, as I never studied such majors as arts or design in universities, nor did I have any training in this regard. If not for the wonderful people I encountered in my life, my journey would have become quite different."After graduating as an English major at Renmin University of China in the 1990s, Qian Jing embarked on her professional journey by first stepping into the corporate world at a Fortune 500 American company operating in China.Qian made a bold career move at the age of 27 and joined a French company where she became the head of the company's PR and Government Affairs department in China.Qian, more commonly called Lucy, carries an entrepreneurial spirit in business and her personal life.Retired journalist Chen Yi, who has known Lucy since the beginning of her career in multinational companies, considered her "a woman of remarkable resilience akin to a sunflower, never withers regardless of where she is planted, but grows toward the sun in all seasons."In 2007, Qian made another significant career decision by establishing a consultancy firm, leveraging the years of experience and networking she had accumulated from working with multinational companies in China, providing consulting services to both foreign and domestic enterprises.Her life transformed in 2006 when she started volunteering. She met Sarah Randt, the wife of the former US ambassador to China, who co-founded the Dandelion School in Beijing's Daxing District, a charity school dedicated to providing quality education for children of migrant workers.As a volunteer, Qian assisted the school in organizing charitable fundraising events. She noticed how Sarah always exuded elegance and captivated everyone's attention during these events. Sarah adorned herself with exquisite traditional Chinese dresses for every occasion, complemented by dazzling jewelry pieces.More than a decade later, Sarah highlights her outfits with a jewelry brand created and designed by Qian. Knowing Sarah's fondness for large and uniquely shaped baroque pearls, Qian designed a gold-wrapped exotic pearl necklace and earrings set.From the bottom of her heart, Qian considered Sarah her mentor, even though Sarah never specifically taught her about jewelry fashion. Before meeting Sarah, Lucy had no understanding of pearls and was unaware that China is the world's largest producer of freshwater pearls."It is through knowing her that I gradually came to appreciate the various types of jewelry: necklaces, earrings, brooches, rings, and the magic they'll do to brighten up your outfit," she said.With an ever-turning mind, Qian continuously seeks new opportunities for herself in her pipeline. In 2016, she founded Lucy Q Jewelry.Upon seeing her wearing her brand's finery, her former neighbor exclaimed, "How did you become a jewelry designer?! You never used to wear anything like this before!"Shortly after its launch, Lucy Q Jewelry won the recognition of celebrity fashion publisher and writer Hung Huang, who began selling Lucy Q designs in her store Brand New China (BNC), a boutique that housed original designs by Chinese fashion & accessory creators."Even though BNC closed later on, I always feel the inspiration from Hung Huang that China should have its own fashion designers, and an ordinary white collar woman like myself could also become a jewelry designer."Qian believes that by understanding her clients, she can provide trendy accessories to women who love life."By saving their selection cost and offering the most efficient solutions, I provide them with high-quality products at a better value than brand boutiques and more time-saving compared to online shopping," she said. "Professionals often lack time, yet they frequently need to find gifts for their bosses and colleagues who are leaving or celebrating birthdays. Selecting gifts is not an easy task and requires effort."Seeing the demand, Qian selects gift choices based on clients' preferences."Typically, I recommend at least two solutions, allowing them to choose the one that resonates with them. As someone with a corporate background, I also ensure the solutions are within the budget limit and in line with the codes of conduct at multinational corporations. I provide a total service that includes classy wrapping and packaging of the products using deep blue velvet or other material that spares my clients time in this regard, in addition to the value-added services such as floral cards."Qian often encourages her friends, saying, "Never give up on yourself. Life is not only to please others but also to nurture your own spirit. Be elegant throughout your life: beautiful at 20, captivating at 40, and irresistible for the rest of your life!"As the number of murder mystery game players flocking to museums for fun rises, the role-playing sector may find itself at a turning point.Wu Yusheng remembers visiting the Nanjing Tangshan National Geological Park Museum in Jiangsu province in November 2021, not just to tour the museum, but also to participate in a special role-playing murder mystery game, or jubensha, called Missing Password.She was one of 40 players, mostly university students, who had been divided into groups of four and tasked with unmasking the perpetrator of a murder set in a fictional primitive society thousands of years ago. The first group to find the killer was the winner."What impressed me most while playing the game was the sense of immersion," Wu says. "The clues in other murder mystery games are usually presented in the form of text. This game was different. While I searched for clues on my own, the game was so immersive that I even forgot to take photos."When murder mystery games meet museums, the journey of knowledge can be full of fun.These jubensha (literally "script murders") are a form of role-playing game in which the players unmask criminals by collecting information and cracking the case, much like actual detectives. Museums are taking advantage of the trend by using their valuable collection of relics and the stories behind them to attract more visitors.Since 2019, dozens of cities, including Shanghai, Luoyang in Henan province, Changsha in Hunan province, Beijing and Chongqing, have launched their own museum murder mystery programs based on their collections.Apart from physically taking place inside a museum, the scripts of these role-playing murder mysteries are based on the museum's area of interest.Between 2016 and 2019, Swiss artist Catherine Gfeller embarked on a journey to a number of Chinese cities, weaving a narrative as she engaged with the stories of women from different backgrounds.Her vision of the women, the challenges they confront, and their distinctive spirit are the focal points of the artist's subsequent explorations.In the bustling streets of Guangzhou, Guangdong province, Hong Kong, Beijing and Kunming in Yunnan province, Gfeller found a means of exploring the essence of these urban landscapes by focusing her lens on women.On Saturday, the Swiss embassy in Beijing unveiled a solo exhibition of the work that resulted, which spotlights the perspectives and voices of women. Through her lens, Gfeller skillfully establishes a dialogue and builds a bridge between the narratives of the women and the vibrancy of the cities they inhabit. Passing the Cities through the Lens of Women displays some of the 30 results, including photographs, texts, and videos.For Gfeller, women's voices are very important in modern Chinese society. During shooting, she learned how the women perceive the new ways of life and how they find an anchor in their cities."The moment I pressed the shutter, I felt like I became part of the city," Gfeller says.Ambassador of Switzerland to China Jurg Burri said at the opening ceremony, "Ms Gfeller cares very much about people, especially women in cities. Women's issues are a global topic and I hope that more women's voices will be heard."The exhibition is open to the public until the end of March.The 58-year-old artist is known for her focus on landscape photography. Using techniques like montage, collage, and superimposition, she creates unique photographic artworks.The winter chill that grips Beijing in December doesn't slow things down at all for Cheng Yongmao. He reaches his office in Huairou district in the capital's northeastern suburbs at 6:30 am and gets right down to business. "It's a force of habit," says Cheng, who's in his 60s and has been repairing and maintaining the Great Wall's Jiankou section in Huairou for nearly two decades.Jiankou is widely considered one of the most dangerous parts of the Great Wall in Beijing and is known by hikers as the "wild Wall". The only way up to the bulwark is a rocky path along cliffs.The Great Wall has been subject to natural disasters and human impact after standing for more than 450 years, and now direly needs maintenance and reinforcement."Construction work is generally conducted from April to October, and now it's time to prepare documents for future work," Cheng says.Previous work has to be reviewed, and historical items unearthed during the cleaning and repairs need to be properly put in files, while construction charts for future endeavors have to be readied, he explains.Cheng's office is filled with traces of his dealings with the Great Wall. A dozen walking sticks he made out of branches stand in the corner behind the door, next to a pile of tools he uses for tiling.Africa is a continent that everyone knows about, but not many fully understand. "If you haven't been there yourself, you would never truly know what it's like," said 29-year-old Huang Siyuan.From 2019 to 2022, Huang worked as a security engineer at a sewage treatment plant in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. The project was contracted to and built by CGGC International.Huang grew up and spent his academic life in Beijing. "If it weren't for this program, I might never have gone to Africa," he said. "I'm thankful that my company provided this platform for me to participate in international projects. It's a great opportunity for both personal and professional growth."The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is in western Africa and has a population of a little over 1.6 million. The sewage treatment plant that Huang works for is in the capital, Malabo.Recalling his first impression of Malabo, he said, "The city has a lot of greenery, with tons of mango and banana trees lining the roads. The infrastructure was more complete than I expected, with tall buildings and a well-connected transport network."However, when Huang arrived as the new security engineer, the plant had already been in use for about four years. According to his colleagues, Malabo looked very different before the plant was built."I heard that locals used to dispose of their waste right in front of their doorsteps. Since mosquitoes breed in sewage water, the incidence of malaria in the local community was extremely high," Huang said.So, with the sewage treatment plant, not only had the city's appearance been enhanced, but the health condition of the local people also improved.According to Huang, the plant has a daily processing capacity of approximately 20,000 cubic meters of sewage water. They've also built a supporting pipeline network totaling over 240 kilometers, covering basically every household in Malabo."A survey done by the World Health Organization showed that after our plant was put into use, the city's incidence rate of malaria dropped from 45 percent to 11 percent," Huang explained.Even if someone contracts malaria, including Huang himself, it's not a significant issue because of the availability of artemisinin. "The hospitals there also use artemisinin, which was discovered by the Chinese scientist Tu Youyou. Local people seek treatment as well since it's affordable," he said.Huang and his colleagues conduct routine checkups and cleanups of sewage wells around the city. "You could say that our footsteps covered every inch of Malabo," he said.Sometimes when Huang and his colleagues were fixing the wells, they would run into local residents, who would thank them for improving the local living environment. Some would even offer food and fruits, but Huang and his colleagues couldn't accept them. "We regard their gratitude as the most precious reward," he said.Ollivier Jean-Baptiste, 25, a vlogger from France living in China, delivered a speech on the latest episode of the China Daily Youth Power series. The episode, named "Timeless Tales from China", was aired on Jan 30.In his speech, titled "Bridging Cultures: A Personal Journey from France to China", Jean-Baptiste spoke about his initial impressions of China. Just like his family and friends, he saw China as a distant and mysterious place with a culture entirely different from France and other Western countries.The idea of visiting China first came to him when his uncle, who worked in China, returned with endless praise for the Chinese lifestyle. "Everything, from the food to the scenery, was incredibly appealing to me," he recalled.Later, a Chinese woman introduced him personally to the everyday life of Chinese people. He learned to use WeChat, Alipay, and navigating Chinese social media, which exposed him to a different way of living. The woman later became his wife, and they moved to Beijing together in 2022, which Jean-Baptiste described as "eye-opening" for him."She took me to see the flag-raising ceremony. Witnessing countless young people rushing toward the flag, I was deeply moved. It's a country of strength, unity, and love," he said.When Jean-Baptiste visited his wife's hometown for the first time, he couldn't speak much Chinese. While he was riding a bike, a group of relatives of his wife started shouting "waiguoren", which means "foreigner", and ran after him. He understood that this was their way of showing interest and hospitality."I felt their friendliness toward the French. Many, even those who spoke little English, would say 'welcome to China'. I felt the warmth of home in a foreign country and was thrilled to live in China," he said.All of these experiences made Jean-Baptiste eager to explore different aspects of Chinese culture. He visited the Great Wall in Beijing and the Terracotta Army in Xi'an, Northwest China's Shaanxi province. When he returned to France for vacation and shared photos of his travels and life in China with his family, they were also excited.Apart from his personal experiences in China, Jean-Baptiste noticed that friendly interactions between the two countries are also increasing. After learning about the 15-day visa-free travel from France to China, his family and friends couldn't wait to book their trip to China."I'm overjoyed to host them during the 60th anniversary of China-France diplomatic relations, showcasing China's modern development and rich history," he said. "I may be just an ordinary person with limited influence, but everyone can be a cultural ambassador."  On Jan 26, a day before the 60th anniversary of China-France diplomatic ties, young people from both countries gathered in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, to discuss their similarities and differences.This meeting was featured in the episode of China Daily's Youth Power, titled "A Journey Together: China-France Relations at 60", in which four young guests from France and three Chinese Gen Zers shared their experiences, highlighting the vibrant connections between the youth of both countries.These young guests, who had been exposed to both French and Chinese cultures in various ways, discussed the culture shocks they experienced when first encountering each other's people and lifestyles.Ni Xiajun, for example, is a 22-year-old Chinese student majoring in French at Fudan University in Shanghai. He found it surprising to observe the differences between the etiquette of greeting in China and France. He recalled his time in France, where people warmly greeted each other, even with bus drivers and shop assistants."I had a hard time getting accustomed to this at first, because in Shanghai, we just skip these formalities of greeting and go directly to the thing we want to have and get to the point," he said.Guery Alexandre, a French vlogger living in China, offered a different observation. According to him, people in French villages still warmly welcome and talk to strangers sometimes, but in Paris, people have lost that habit due to the high population density and stress of the city.The young guests also pointed out that as exchanges between China and France deepen, Chinese modern culture is gaining popularity in France.Lefevre Michele, an 18-year-old pre-college student at Fudan University, found that Chinese TV dramas, like Meteor Garden, have been well-received in France, particularly among many female French viewers. It was her love for these dramas that sparked her initial interest in Chinese culture, leading her to further her studies in China.Peng Shuyu, a student majoring in French at Peking University, also shared her observations and insights about French culture. She believed that the French language is precise and has a complex grammar system. "There are so many tenses — more than 20, and there are so many verb conjugations."Alexandre admitted that French people take pride in their language. He recalled how his mother emphasized the proper use of French — if he ever used incorrect grammar in an email, his mom would call him and guide him to correct his mistakes. He also mentioned that nowadays, more and more high schools in France are starting to introduce Chinese language courses.Oceane Rivoire, for instance, is deeply drawn by the charm of the Chinese language, which led her to come to China. Rivoire, now a student majoring in Chinese language and literature at Tongji University in Shanghai, found the homonyms in Chinese extremely interesting, such as the word "bat", which has the same pronunciation as the word "fortune", and "red dates and peanuts" are usually used to extend good wishes for the newlyweds to have a baby soon. It is some of these attached meanings that have deepened her understanding of the Chinese language.Looking ahead to the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, the young participants engaged in lively discussions about their expectations.Pierre Jouglet, a 29-year-old software engineer in China, expressed eager anticipation for the handball and soccer events — especially soccer, which is a source of national pride for France. He also highlighted badminton and table tennis as China's strengths.Peng expressed young people's desire to participate in the Paris Olympics in their own way. In fact, she and her classmates have already signed up as volunteers for the Olympics, hoping to contribute to the event with other youngsters from around the world.Guests from both countries agreed that the generous and selfless spirit of volunteerism in France, and the tradition of benevolent thoughts in Chinese culture are both splendid treasures that can serve as powerful catalysts for the development of the two countries' relationship.As the conversation shifted to technological innovation, Rivoire pointed out that French people tend to be relatively conservative toward new technologies, likening it to French people's cooking habits. "While making food, French people wouldn't have a lot of tastes. They just have a little bit of pepper and salt. We like to keep things simple," she said. "Maybe we are not as accustomed to new things as easily as in China, where everything develops very, very quickly technologically."Alexandre, however, believed that it's mainly the older generation in France that tends to be traditional, while the young people are used to embracing new technology. He also praised China's mobile payment system, saying that he hoped France could also popularize mobile payment since it's much more convenient compared to using cash.When it comes to the possible future cooperation between China and France, Ni suggested that the rail transit and aviation industry should be a focal point. He specifically mentioned the technological exchange between China's C919 and France's Airbus, believing that such joint ventures could further enhance product quality.Peng, on the other hand, expressed a strong interest in sustainability, particularly the ecological development of the energy industry in both countries. She once wrote an essay on France's nuclear power and found that over 70 percent of the electricity is generated by nuclear power in France. Feeling astonished, she pondered whether China could learn something from it and if the collaboration between the two countries could be broadened.The Gen Z participants unanimously agreed that seeking common ground, deepening communication, and fostering cooperation are essential for the stronger growth of the relationship between the two countries.      Zhou Wei, born in 1991 in Wuhan, the capital of Central China's Hubei province, developed a strong interest in ancient Chinese weapons and armor culture in 2015 while studying archery. This interest sparked a deep passion for traditional Chinese armor, leading him to explore and revive this rich cultural heritage.When he started crafting a set of ancient armor, Zhou faced a significant challenge due to the lack of historical references. "Because ancient armor was tightly controlled as a valuable military asset, very few surviving pieces exist today," Zhou explained.As a result, he has had to draw on what knowledge he could gather from military classics, ancient artworks, and statues to recreate these historical artifacts.Zhou's extensive research revealed that, unlike the diverse forms of hanfu (traditional Chinese clothing), armor from different dynasties shared many structural and stylistic similarities."Given its vital role in military operations, practicality and functionality were crucial in armor design. Therefore, many dynasties preserved practical design elements," Zhou said.He cited the example of the breastplate, a small iron vest that protects the heart. In ancient times, when the cost of iron was high, the relatively small breastplate required less material while providing protection for the most vital part of the body. "This design was prevalent in almost every dynasty's armor," Zhou said.While armor structures and styles did not change much across dynasties, significant transitions occurred due to technological advances, the integration of different ethnic cultures, and the emergence of new weapons.According to Zhou, the first significant turning point was during the Warring States Period (475-221 BC) and the Qin (221-206 BC) and Han dynasties (206 BC-AD 220), when advancements in iron smelting technology led to a shift from leather to iron armor. Cultural exchanges during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) also influenced changes in armor design."It wasn't until the end of 2019 that the first piece of Tang Dynasty iron armor was unearthed in China, and it hasn't been completely restored to this day," Zhou said.However, through related studies on the unearthed fragments of this Tang armor and some murals and other materials from the time, Zhou found that the shape of iron pieces and the weaving style of Tang armor were highly similar to those existing in the Xizang autonomous region. "So when I recreated Tang iron armor, I used ancient Tibetan armor as a reference," he said.Zhou also highlighted the influence of muskets in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), which led to another modification in protective gear, with armor being wrapped with thick cotton cloth to enhance its protective effect. This method originated from the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) and continued into the Ming Dynasty as a result of cultural integration with northern ethnic groups.Equipped with a deep understanding of armor history and craftsmanship, Zhou made his first set of armor in 2017.At the time, specialized iron pieces for crafting armor were not readily available, so he had to purchase industrial angle bars and hand-sewed them, laboring for weeks to complete it.Zhou quickly found a buyer for his first set of armor — a historical fencing enthusiast.Historical fencing, more commonly known as Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA), involves one-on-one or group combat using simulated weapons from the cold weapon era while wearing protective gear covering the entire body. "It was then that I realized the practical significance of ancient armor in contemporary society," Zhou said.Based on his observations, Zhou noted that traditional armor culture, as a niche branch of hanfu, faces particular difficulties these days. Armor is heavy, and in ancient times a set of armor could weigh approximately 20 to 30 kilograms, comprising thousands of iron pieces. Even though people nowadays try to take the wearer's strength into account by adjusting the thickness of the iron pieces or using lighter aluminum alloy, the lightest armor still ends up being about 10 kilograms. Furthermore, the production process remains time-intensive, typically demanding one week to a month for completion.Zhou's discovery of HEMA excited him and his further research revealed that another similar martial sport — Historical Medieval Battle — also incorporates the use of armor as protective gear. "Participants from various countries wear traditional armor representative of their own nation's medieval period and engage in combat using weapons," he explained.Zhou expressed his desire to advocate for the practical functions of armor as protective gear in sports and also to promote the sports themselves."These sports can not only foster physical fitness but also embody the martial spirit that has prevailed in China for thousands of years," he said.Another reason that Zhou is passionate about promoting traditional Chinese armor culture is that the majority of Chinese films and dramas inaccurately depict ancient Chinese armor, often basing their designs on Japanese armor styles.Zhou currently is the president of a hanfu cultural association in Wuhan, with members primarily aged between 18 and 25, all sharing a deep passion for traditional Chinese culture.The association, a nonprofit organization, has participated in many large hanfu events, such as the first Wuhan Garden Expo Flower Festival and the 1800th-anniversary activities of the Yellow Crane Tower in 2023."We took charge of organizing traditional Chinese armor parades and presented various cultural performances and displays," he said.Zhou has also established a lecture group named "Queyuewei", which translates to "Queyue guardians". The name is derived from Queyue town, an ancient town in the Wuhan area. Comprising enthusiasts of armor, the group, led by Zhou, collectively explores the realm of martial arts knowledge. Recently, the group has been focusing on the Miaodao sword, a type of Chinese sword."Our goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of ancient armor and martial arts culture and present it to a wider audience," he said.Beijing City International School launched The APEX on Friday, which functions as both a tech-driven space and an intelligent robotics learning hub.The aim of this newly established space is to lead innovation, adopt cutting-edge technology, and ensure the school remains at the forefront of tech education.The school has invited robotics education project developers to share their insights with the students on their journeys from makers to entrepreneurs. Students are encouraged to participate in real project development and apply their knowledge to practical scenarios.During the launching ceremony, the entire school community had hands-on experiences with the latest generation VEX Workcell CTE simulated industrial robot arm and the world's first desktop-level Raspberry Pi robot dog with a mechanical arm. They explored the interactive features and future potential of intelligent robots.Xiao Jun, an award-winning innovator in warehousing robotics and the founder of Tiangong Robotics, along with BCIS' teacher representative Mariann Beagrie, and student representatives Hu Jiarong and Cynthia, shared unique insights on future trends in education, AI application in teaching, and topics like autonomous driving.Additionally, the event featured a showcase of intelligent robot learning scenarios, demonstrating how robots integrate into the learning process."I have a strong passion for designing and building robots. As a high school sophomore with aspirations to enter the field of engineering in the future, I have often immersed myself in the school's design technology lab, exploring combat robotics as a hobby," said Hu."With the establishment of The APEX, we now have access to more systematic robot education and a dedicated space to integrate more programming elements into my projects."Tom Egerton, principal of BCIS, said: "The APEX fits with our strategic direction of a personalized approach to education, developing collaboration and leadership skills. It challenges, inspires and empowers our students to dream big, aim high and reach their pinnacle. We hope in time 'Meet you at the APEX' becomes a common phrase at BCIS for parents, students and teachers to gather to learn."The school places a strong emphasis on personalized learning as a fundamental strategy, seeking to spark students' distinctive strengths and exploratory enthusiasm through personalized education tailored to their strengths and passions. To realize this goal, the institution offers a diverse array of courses and resources, effectively harnessing students' innate strengths and enthusiasm for exploration.Bird-watching, a hobby gaining significant traction in China, draws a varied crowd of enthusiasts, from dedicated scientists to retirees looking for an engaging pastime. Its appeal lies in the fact that it offers an enriching experience that is mutually beneficial to both bird-watchers and to their avian friends.Liu Yang, a professor at the School of Ecology at Sun Yat-sen University and the deputy secretary-general of the China Ornithological Society, is one of the country's most accomplished bird-watchers, and has a sighting list of approximately 1,330 species.Since childhood, Liu has been fascinated with studying the nests of house swifts, an interest that sparked his love for nature and biodiversity. During high school in 1994, he embarked on his birdwatching journey. While others were captivated by collecting stamps or matchboxes, Liu's interest was piqued by the unique characteristics of each bird. Hence, observing and identifying all the birds he saw and keeping a record, which is also known as a "life list", became his "small goal".Mei Jian's daughter helped him design the logo for the Bird ID Master (dongniao in Chinese) WeChat mini program. However, the original logo has been lost, and he can only remember the silhouette in the icon. Regardless, his Bird ID Master mini program has helped birdwatchers identify countless birds.Born in Sichuan province, Mei now lives in Canada. He graduated from the Computer Science Department of Sun Yat-sen University in 1992 and worked as a programmer. Encouraged by friends, he began bird-watching in 2016 and developed a fondness for bird photography. However, he found that he was occasionally uncertain what species he had photographed."Given technological advancements, relying solely on bird field guides seemed outdated," he says.By then, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology had released the Merlin Bird ID app, which catered to users who know English. However, it lacked comprehensive support for Chinese, as well as accurate identification of bird species in China. After a two-hour ordeal spent leafing through books to verify one particular bird, he decided to design a program himself."Enthusiasm for this kind of venture is vital," Mei emphasizes.He had to acquire new skills and surmount a number of challenges while designing the program. In January 2017, he stumbled upon a bird-classification page online, but it proved to be full of errors. Consequently, he took the ornithology course offered by Cornell University, and grappled with unfamiliar terminology, learning step by step.The mini program follows the classification system used by the IOC World Bird List from the World Bird Names website. During the course of his journey, Mei realized that many bird species on the site were missing their Chinese names. He played an active role in adding them and thanks to his efforts, Chinese bird names now rank second in completeness after English on the site.In September 2017, the inaugural version of BirdID Master was launched on WeChat, and it has been continually upgraded and refined since.In a room bathed in soft music, Yuan Li took a deep breath to clear her mind and then started drawing interlocking circular patterns. She was practicing the spiritual and meditative activity known as mandala art.Every year, we expats need to head to the nearest visa office to renew our paperwork. It is an unenviable task that even the pandemic couldn't relegate to the back burner.Staring at us from our passports is that immutable date on that inner page that simply demands that we need be present at the facility prior to the designated day or things can go south in a hurry.Actually, south seemed like a tantalizing prospect that recent workday, as the capital was in the midst of a particularly frigid winter chill. Andy Dufresne said he had Mozart in his head to keep him sane during his month in solitary confinement. While my taxi ride to the visa office wasn't even close to being in "the hole", I did have Snow Miser's solo from the 1970s' holiday classic The Year Without a Santa Claus on my mind to keep me company on that subzero sojourn: "Whatever I touch, turns to snow in my clutch. I'm too much!"I think the Miser probably suffered from intimacy issues, much like Heat Miser and King Midas for that matter. It was a bit more uplifting than Sound of Silence, and it was a deep and dark January to boot.Well, the actual toughest part of the journey was standing streetside and trying to order a Didi taxi on my handset — while wearing gloves! It's impossible, so despite the — 10 C temps that morning, I had to push the tiny buttons with fat frozen fingers that resembled plump undercooked kielbasa.But my day was about to improve markedly the moment I hopped in the cab. To my chagrin, I had accidentally entered the wrong destination, to which the friendly cabbie said: "No problem, just reenter it." Which I did.Upon learning I was from North America, he asked if winters were colder than here in the capital, to which I replied, "Usually, but not this time around." This cheerful chauffeur was apparently just an appetizer for the fine service I was about to be treated to that day, it turns out.You see, a while back I had twisted my posterior cruciate ligament something fierce, and ambulate with a bit of a giddyap in my gait. Think an ambling Doc House but certainly no Ironside. So, that moment when an eminent member of the Thin Blue Line at the visa office saw me exit the cab with a cane, he immediately sprang to action and guided me up the broad staircase gracing the building's main entrance.After passing through a security check, I entered the complex thinking my law enforcement officer friend had returned to his post. But instead I was surprised to see he was not only an officer but a true gentleman, as he continued to accompany me to the front of the line, where my paperwork processing was prioritized and expedited. I mean, he didn't even swipe away my cane to see if I was a poseur looking for red-carpet treatment!Well, I tried to avert my gaze from the non-caners, who were dutifully waiting in line to renew their visas. I mean, what's a feller to do? My private LEO was treating me like a king (of the jungle) — a true LEO the Lion! It gave me a sense of pride, as he saw me as his "mane" man no doubt. Even the fable of the mouse removing the splinter from the lion's paw gave the little whiskered one a lifetime of bodyguard treatment.Anyway, I began the somewhat painstaking process of filling in the necessary documents when my cop friend asked, "what's in the envelope", at which point I realized he was pointing to all the paperwork faithfully filled out in advance by my intrepid HR office. In other words, my new best friend saved me a good 20 minutes and the horror of holding a poxy pathogen-ridden public pen for that interminable duration. I was liking my LEO more and more.Upon learning that I hadn't prepared passport-style photos in advance (actually, I think the only thing I did right that morning was remember to bring my passport), he escorted me to the photographer, rushed downstairs to pay for the service, then had me scan him back from the comfort of my chair. My, the perks of a walking stick!I will be forever in this kind police officer's debt, having bent over backward as he did to help out a fellow human. And on the way out, I was again immersed in the holiday spirit, as I watched two bespectacled intellectual types in the facility's lobby try and capture their opponent's Queen in a spirited and trash-talk fueled game of xiangqi (Chinese chess). Of course, this brought another holiday tune to my head: Chess Nuts Boasting in an Open Foyer.The word for sugar in Bengali, as in some other Indian languages, is chini. Ask anyone back in my hometown of Kolkata in India why that is so and chances are they will tell you it is because the Chinese introduced sugar to India. While history says otherwise, it is true that the story of India's first Chinatown does have a sugary connection to it.The story starts with the arrival of tea trader Tong Ah Chew from Guangdong province in the late 18th century. Atchew, as he is referred to in East India Company records, set up a sugar mill on the outskirts of Kolkata in Achipur, a village that is today named after him, with the help of 100-odd workers he brought from his homeland. When Atchew died in the 1780s and the sugar mill went bust, the Chinese mill workers moved to Kolkata proper in search of a living. What they left behind was a temple and Atchew's tomb, which members of the Chinese community visit by the hundreds during Spring Festival each year.The Chinese workers settled around central Kolkata's Tiretta Bazaar area, making a living running leather tanneries and carpentry shops. This was an area that was already inhabited by other non-Bengali trading communities, and the multicultural setup helped the new arrivals integrate easily. However, in the early 1900s, they were forced to shift the polluting tanneries to the marshy eastern fringes of the city and Tangra, the second Chinatown in Kolkata, took shape.Given their expertise in the leather trade, it is not surprising that before the mega brands made their appearance, Chinese shoe shops were the go-to places for footwear in Kolkata. The row of shops on Bentinck Street in the heart of town was where office workers picked up their formal shoes. My father and uncles all had their personal favorites among those shops and remained devoted customers all their lives. While the men found their custom-fitted shoes on Bentinck Street, for women, Henry and Kowloon in New Market were where the fancy pairs were.Not to be outdone, Chinese women ran hugely successful beauty salons. Even today, some of the biggest names in the beauty trade in Kolkata are Chinese. Dentistry was the other profession members of the community excelled in.But it was to the food that the Chinese community introduced to Kolkata that the city owes the biggest debt of gratitude. Nanking, Chung Wah, Eau Chew and Kim Wah, Pieping, Mandarin, Jimmy's Kitchen and the not-so-Chinese sounding Waldorf are among the scores of eateries that have been around for decades, serving Indianized versions of Chinese fare to a clientele that never seems to tire of the rarely changing menus.So popular is this "Chinese" food that fried rice and chilli chicken regularly make an appearance on Bengali dinner tables. Never mind that the only thing remotely Chinese about them is the liberal use of soy sauce. Humble roadside eateries make a killing every day, dishing up platefuls of Hakka chow mein and Veg Manchurian, which bear very little resemblance to anything available on the Chinese mainland. For the lovers of more authentic fare, the pork dumplings and noodles served early in the morning in Tiretta Bazaar is a breakfast pilgrimage made regularly.Kolkatans are proud of their Chinese food. Take them to any other city in India, and they will turn up their noses at what is on offer there. In Delhi, some of us would haunt this tiny place called China Fare, only because it served Kolkata-style Chinese food and that was the taste of home.After moving to China, I have discovered that what is known as the "chimney soup" back home, is just a modified version of the hotpot. The food in the office canteen seems strangely familiar but very different at the same time. Conversations nowadays with friends and family in Kolkata inevitably veer around how much of Chinese food I am getting to sample here — and the envy and wistfulness in their voices are real.Despite his young age, 27-year-old Sun Jianjun is a seasoned welder with nine years of experience.In April 2015, as a high school student, Sun moved from his hometown of North China's Hebei province to Wuhan, the capital city of Central China's Hubei province. At the age of 18, he decided to pursue further studies at a welding training institution linked to an iron smelting company.Starting as an apprentice, Sun faced challenges in mastering the fundamentals of welding. "With no prior experience, it took me almost a month to learn basic operating techniques," he recalled.Welding also comes with challenges, especially when certain methods require welders to assume uncomfortable positions, such as squatting or standing directly under the weld, risking burns from molten iron. During his early days of acquiring a proficiency with welding, injuries were almost inevitable due to the high temperatures and the arc light which caused burns on Sun's neck, legs, and eyes."But with proper handling, the risk can be mitigated," he said.Sun's hard work and intelligence led to rapid progress, and he soon mastered various welding techniques. From 2015 to 2017, he actively participated in competitions at municipal and provincial levels, honing his skills through rigorous training.In October 2018, he contributed to a construction project in Bangladesh under the Belt and Road Initiative where he met great challenges.The project had a substantial workload and significant technical demands. The relatively underdeveloped local infrastructure and frequent power interruptions during the local rainy season also slowed down the project's progress."It averaged over 10 power outages each day," Sun recalled.To meet the project's deadline, Sun and his colleagues frequently worked overtime into the evening."The arc light during welding attracts numerous mosquitoes and insects that can get through our clothing," Sun said. "We had to wear full protection and wrap ourselves tightly, even in the tropical heat."Over the course of this four-month project, Sun and his colleagues had little time for rest. Ultimately, they completed the work on schedule and ensured that all the products fulfilled the quality assurance and aesthetic criteria.Despite the challenging conditions, Sun gained substantial experience. "I've never worked on a major project like this before, so my welding skills have greatly improved," he said.After returning to China, Sun started engaging in nationwide welding competitions, including the first National Skills Competition.In the brief three-month training period before the competition, Sun had to spend over 12 hours every day in rigorous practice.In the competition, Sun demonstrated his expertise by finishing three different sections within nine hours while adhering to strict criteria. To assess the internal quality thoroughly, judges employed specialized non-destructive testing equipment that could uncover flaws not visible to the naked eye."These flaws in the weld are not apparent to the naked eye, but they can be detected using this specialized equipment, which evaluates a welder's proficiency in the welding process," explained Sun.Appearance was also an important factor. The height and width of the weld had to meet specific parameters.Even though welding might seem simple, Sun explained that it involves various fundamental theoretical knowledge, including electricity, mechanics, and materials science.He achieved an impressive fourth place in the competition's welding section, earning the title of "National Technical Expert".Sun's welding expertise was also acknowledged by his company. From 2019, he took on the role of mentoring and training apprentices. So far, Sun has had over 10 apprentices, most of whom were born after 1999.Under his guidance, these young craftsmen have all achieved honors at or above the municipal level."The demanding nature of welding work is often perceived as unattractive by many young people," Sun said, expressing his concern. But he remains hopeful about engaging more youngsters in the industry.He highlighted the importance of welding for the country's development, ranging from crafting everyday items to the construction of high-rise buildings, ships, automobiles, and airplanes."China is a manufacturing powerhouse, and welding is a significant part of the manufacturing industry. So, there is a substantial demand for young talent," he said, adding that the involvement of the younger generation is essential for driving progress in automation and digitization within the industry.He mentioned that government initiatives, like supporting the National Skills Competition, can effectively encourage young talents to enter the field."There are similar skill competitions at different levels in various provinces and cities across the country, making sure that truly skilled young people can be recognized and appreciated," he said, emphasizing that one's academic background does not restrict the potential of those committed to their craft.Through his educational cultural heritage centers dotted across the nation, longtime China hand Brian Linden is dedicating his life to sharing authentic China with visitors at home and abroad.During the past four decades, I've traveled to 100 countries. Wherever I went, I attempted to share stories of China with people from around the world. But too often, their excitement focused on my being from Chicago, and the typical reaction would be: "Chicago, wow! Michael Jordan! Chicago Bulls!"Then I would respond by asking them what they knew about China — had they heard of Mencius, Wang Yangming, Lu Xun, and Liang Sicheng? But they would ignore that and say: "Scottie Pippen! Dennis Rodman!"-both were players with the Chicago Bulls back then.I quickly learned that many of my international friends and colleagues knew more about the Bulls than about China, which, to me, is an incredible country.China has been my home off and on since 1984. I benefited from China's largesse when I received a scholarship to study in Beijing in the autumn of that year. I was one of the students with the most modest financial background and was given the scholarship because of this fact.When I first got here, Chinese people embraced me like family, showing me great patience while I, as a foreigner with no Chinese language background, struggled to express myself. No matter how basic and incorrect my language skills were, there was always encouragement.Chinese people always expressed curiosity about my international background, asking questions about cultural differences between China and the US and showing respect for traditions not their own. There was never a feeling of intolerance and chauvinism on their part while discussing the outside world.They were also proud to share with me their rich history. For example, every visit to places like the Forbidden City, Summer Palace, and the Great Wall would include numerous strangers approaching me to help me more deeply understand the historical importance of what I was observing. They seriously wanted me to appreciate China's history and traditions. Their passion encouraged me to learn more about this country. That journey has never stopped, even to this day.The world's lack of understanding of China is not anyone's fault. News about China is available in these places but only represents a small part of its real story. Stories about the West, too, are available in China, and they, too, represent a small part of the realities of those countries. This is why I think people-to-people diplomacy is important.While the concept of "diplomacy "is often viewed as the sole purview of governments-discreet interactions at official levels by which many people separate the world into friends and adversaries-I believe people-to-people diplomacy must complement official talks and build the foundation of trust between nations.This realization set my family and me off on a mission to create a platform for cultural exchange, an effort to add nuance and depth to the world's limited understanding of this country. In 2004, we sold our home in the US, gave up our jobs, and brought our two sons, ages 5 and 8 at the time, to China.After 20 months spent in over 15 provinces and homeschooling our two boys in rural guesthouses, we settled on an old courtyard in the small village of Xizhou, Dali Bai autonomous prefecture in Southwest China's Yunnan province.When we arrived in Xizhou in 2007, the village took us under its wing. Many locals invited us to their homes for dinner. After only a few months, we were gaining weight! Our boys also became friends with local children and we started an English corner held every weekend.We decided to repurpose our courtyard complex into the Linden Center, or Xilinyuan in Chinese-a name that combines the Xi of Xizhou and Lin of Linden-which is more than a hotel, but also a hospitality and education retreat, a base for storytelling with the outside world.Every day, we host an average of 100-200 visitors during the off-season and 500 during the summer and holidays, and 40 percent of our guests come from abroad. Our guests-both foreign and domestic — regularly participate in local weddings, housewarming parties, and, if appropriate, funerals. They also learn about China and Yunnan through our two free tours: a morning market tour of Xizhou, where guests are taken into our neighbors' homes, learning their crafts, such as rice noodle making, tie-dye, and woodblock printing, and an afternoon tour of the Yang Pinxiang complex, which focuses on the architectural traditions of the Bai ethnic group.We have also reserved nearly half of our buildings for public use. Local children and adults can use our libraries and fitness center, and 90 percent of staff are local hires. We have developed our own lecture series, artist-in-residence programs, and education courses, which are all open to the local residents.About 10 years ago, the Xizhou people started to call me "cunzhang", meaning the head of the village. This reflected their appreciation for our efforts to highlight their traditions. I am still called by this title every day in the village.Now Xilinyuan has branches in multiple locations in China, including Shaxi and Shangrila, both in Yunnan, and Suzhou in East China's Jiangsu province.My mission is to help the world better appreciate and respect the Chinese people and culture through rural development and heritage preservation projects, using these experiences to share the true stories of economic change and cultural continuity that make this country so dynamic and inclusive.About 2,500 years ago, Confucius expressed what is now the DNA of China's interaction with the world: "What a joy to have friends coming from afar!"Those wise words form the foundation of China's soft power and hold true for every visitor to this country. We, who experience this hospitality every day, must share these stories with everyone that we interact with, both within and outside of China.Written by Brian Linden, 61, born and raised in Chicago, US. He arrived in Beijing in 1984 and has spent over 25 of the last 40 years in China. In 2004, he and his wife, Jeanee, turned a historical site in Yunnan into a hotel and education center. The Lindens now have 10 bases around the country.Young students worldwide craft unique winter breaks, with each adventure shaping their perspectives and forging connections, Li Xinran reports.When it comes to winter breaks, young students around the world spend this recharging time in their own way. "Gen Zers tend to have a wide variety of hobbies, and there are more subcultures compared to other generations. We also tend to express ourselves more and explore the world on our own terms," said 23-year-old Zhang Yuze.Zhang is a graduate student at New York University, studying management and systems. He exemplifies this diversity with his unique winter break adventure-traveling to Europe during the monthlong break.Accompanied by his girlfriend, Zhang explored eight cities in Italy and Spain, including Rome, Venice, and Madrid, all within 18 days."Our goal was to recharge ourselves. So instead of following a tight schedule, we made a rough plan and did most of the detailed planning along the way and adjusted it based on our conditions," he said.Rome stood out as Zhang's favorite destination, captivating him with its living history and ancient architecture. "You're constantly surrounded by historical relics and ancient buildings. Even in front of our hotel, they're still doing archaeological excavation, adding a sense of living in history," he said.Their visit to the Colosseum, where they secured spots on an English guided tour, provided more insights into the historical context. "For instance, our guide told us that some people's minds would wander off during the fights and they would draw on bricks to kill time," Zhang said. "We were able to see some of the doodles preserved in the Colosseum Museum, which was quite intriguing."The couple celebrated New Year's Eve in Seville, Spain, witnessing a unique local tradition of grape-eating at midnight, which they learned from Xiaohongshu, a Chinese lifestyle-sharing platform, and also from their hotel's receptionist."Approaching midnight, local people would gather at the city square. Instead of doing countdowns, they would strike the clock 12 times. Legend says if you eat one grape per clock-strike, 12 grapes symbolize 12 months of good luck for the coming year," said Zhang. "It was a pity that local markets closed early that day and we couldn't buy grapes. Maybe next time."Zhang had memorable experiences interacting with locals during his visits to Italy and Spain. "Visiting these two countries, I found that Spanish are more extroverted, energetic, and hospitable," he said. "For example, when we had trouble understanding the menu at a restaurant, the staff kindly explained it to us in English."In contrast, he highlighted the romantic sentiment and fashionable taste of the Italians. "You can constantly spot flower shops on the streets. And whether it's a big city or a small town, almost every passerby's outfit is quite stylish. Even elder gentlemen would wear fashionable winter coats and leather shoes."Meowzart's innovative cat competition in China, led by Gen Z, fosters creativity and compassion, uniting communities to rescue and adopt feline friends, Gui Qian reports.A unique cat competition is happening right now, featuring stray cats from more than 280 universities across China. They're all competing for the title of "Best Meow Alumni" from Jan 21 to Feb 21.This event is in its third year and is organized by Meowzart, one of China's largest animal welfare platforms for college students. Using a mini-program on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, people can view profiles of the cat candidates from each university. The profiles include pictures and detailed information about the cats, such as their age, breed, personalities, and even "highlight moments on social media".On the Meowzart mini-program, there are profiles of over 18,312 cats from more than 340 university cat care communities.It is hoped that the increased attention on these newfound feline celebrities will boost their chances of adoption. The sales revenue generated from merchandise featuring their adorable images will also contribute to supporting the operations of university stray cat care associations.For example, Big Head, the "representative" of the Sea Cat TNR team at Shanghai Maritime University, was successfully adopted after participating in 2022's competition. Now, this year, Big Head's friend, Sea Cucumber, is a top contender, thanks to his undeniable cuteness.Across China, young people are actively involved in rescuing and adopting stray cats in their own unique ways. Almost every university has student-led associations dedicated to protecting stray cats on campus. These organizations not only provide food for the cats but also assist in their spaying or neutering and facilitate their adoption.Meng Yan, the founder of Meowzart, emphasizes that student communities play a significant role in the rescue of stray cats. However, these young people face numerous challenges.As students, they often struggle with financial problems and lack the means to sustain their organizations beyond fundraising efforts. Their limited experience and resources also put them at a disadvantage when dealing with schools and negotiating with those responsible for severe cases of cat abuse. Some students even face misunderstanding from others who perceive them as neglecting their studies.Meng hopes that her platform can unite young cat enthusiasts and amplify their voices.Since its establishment in 2021, Meowzart has been working to establish connections with university communities. By assisting them in raising cat food and encouraging the creation of cat-related works, the platform gradually build trust among its members.The platform now provides guidance for students and operates a mini-program that allows student communities to easily share adoption information.All of these initiatives encourage students to promote "star cats" on their campuses, create merchandise for charitable sales, and organize activities to fully unleash their potential for rescuing stray cats."I hope that young people, while focusing on animal welfare and their living environment, can also showcase the spirit of Generation Z and leverage their strengths and interests," Meng said.Every year on May 21, Campus Cat Day is celebrated. Devoted members of university stray cat communities express their creativity by crafting various artworks inspired by these charming felines, which they then share on Meowzart. The platform will select the most outstanding pieces for recognition.This year, students from over 200 universities across China and individuals from all walks of life created over 40,000 works in various artistic fields, including photography, video production, creative design, meme crafting, painting, writing, dance, and music. Nearly 4,000 works were chosen as finalists, resulting in 20 university societies being honored with the Best Society Award.The winning pieces have been curated into the Meowzart metaverse, boasting 521 museums that are accessible to everyone. This virtual world, centered around and inspired by stray cats, even features a post office and a police station, mirroring their realworld counterparts. For instance, the post office is situated at 197 Luban Road in Huangpu District, Shanghai.With the help of Meowzart, student communities collaborate with professional veterinarians to develop educational materials about rescuing and caring for cats. For example, the cat society at Xinyang Normal University in Henan province wrote about the basics of the Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) method. TNR is a globally recognized, humane, and effective approach for managing the population of stray cats.Volunteers capture stray cats without harming them, and they are then taken to veterinarians for health examinations and sterilization if suitable. Those cats that are friendly to humans may be kept until they are adopted, while those unsuitable for adoption will be returned to the wild."The TNR approach not only prevents the overpopulation of stray cats, but also reduces the risk of illness among them," wrote the students."One characteristic of Gen Zers is that they act out of genuine intention or love," said Meng. "In the compassionate endeavor of rescuing stray animals, love holds particular significance."Over the recent holidays, my home state of Nebraska in the United States was "blessed" with a blizzard that dumped around 25 centimeters of snow and caused a whiteout, a dangerous condition in which visibility is so hampered, motorists lose all sense of direction.Now that's heavy snow. And even more of it — from 9 to 30 centimeters — menaced the region in recent days as part of a huge storm system that hit huge sections of the US.So it's with amusement that I recall how Beijing's first snowfall of this winter, on Dec 11, was widely described as "heavy". Remnants lingered for a full month, but only because of the ensuing cold snap, not the paltry amount that accumulated.After all, while other parts of China have seen more than their share of snow, the roughly 4 centimeters that fell on the main parts of the capital amounted, where I come from, to a mere dusting.Yet classes were suspended, people stayed indoors, and a great hullabaloo was made about the hard work needed to clear the streets and sidewalks.When I was a boy growing up in the harsh winters (and summers, for that matter) in the Midwest, snowfall would lead to a "snow day" — the cancellation of classes — only if the white stuff on the sidewalks and roads reached knee-deep, or higher.Snow days would be spent outdoors, either sledding or making snow houses. These were built by shoveling snow into one big pile and, layer by layer, packing it down with the back of the shovel. Once this makeshift abode was about 2 meters high, it would be hollowed out via what eventually served as the door.I remember one snowy Christmas as a child when my siblings and I were playing with other neighborhood kids in our newly built snow house. Our mother called us in for dinner, but we were so cozy inside the wind-protected shelter, playing with our new Christmas toys, that we were reluctant to go back into the much warmer real house nearby.The heaviest snow I have ever witnessed firsthand was the 48 centimeters left by the Great Blizzard of 1975 in Omaha, Nebraska. Real effort was needed to clear the streets, with an army of snowplows working loudly into the night.Their enormous steel scoops piled the snow ever higher on the roadsides, until the streets were deep canyons winding through man-made drifts that generally stood at least 4 meters high. It was truly surreal, with almost nothing visible beyond the massive heaps of snow.Snowplow deposits can pose hazards beyond the obvious ones, too. Years after the great storm of 1975, the massive roadside drifts left by another Omaha blizzard provided concealment early one morning for John Joubert, the serial killer whose horrendous deeds terrorized my hometown for months.As Joubert scouted out the person who presumably was to be his next victim, he parked his car well out of sight behind an enormous drift at a church school, from where he could observe the children as they arrived without being detected.But an alert teacher — the only other person there at the time — spotted Joubert sitting in his car. The two, hidden from the outside world by walls of snow, suddenly came face to face. The ensuing flurry of activity — including what the teacher described as intervention by an angel — led to Joubert's eventual capture.That was the only time in my memory that a huge snowdrift seemed sinister.In general, however, snow — especially truly heavy snow — creates a wonderland of delight for adults and children alike, as an increasing number of Chinese are discovering. There is nothing like venturing outside before anyone else following a fresh snowfall, hearing the crunch underfoot as you make the first prints in the white blanket spread out before you.But for anyone whose exposure to winter is so limited that they actually thought Beijing's recent sprinkling was heavy, I'd recommend experiencing for yourself the pure joy of powdery flakes piled high.After his final exam on Jan 11, Wang Yatao immediately moved into the Xiyangfu Nursing Home in Jilin city, Jilin province, becoming a special lodger among the group of seniors.The 22-year-old sophomore at the Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University decided to spend two weeks at the nursing home before returning to his hometown in Yingtan city, Jiangxi province."I was attracted by a short video posted on (video-sharing platform) Douyin in early January," he says. "In the video, the owner of the nursing home was recruiting young people as lodgers."People who are younger than 35 and have a college education can get a single room, three meals a day and a monthly stipend of 300 yuan ($42) with a requirement to do 20 hours of volunteer service during that period.Applicants should have a fixed job or study in college, and should not drink or smoke."In fact, what attracted me was not the small stipend but rather, the volunteer service," says Wang. "I thought it would be a good opportunity to have a different kind of volunteer experience."Wang has participated in the volunteer team since he enrolled in the university."We initiated various volunteer activities across the city, such as visiting nursing homes, tutoring impoverished and 'left-behind' children of migrant workers, and teaching the public about environmental protection," he says."But I have never lived with so many seniors and delved so deeply into their lives."Zhou Weihong, owner of the nursing home, hopes to build a platform for both the elderly and youth."Lots of young people have to leave their hometowns and relatives for study or work, so they may miss the chance to live with their families, especially their grandparents," says the 60-year-old."Living in my nursing home will enable them to better understand and communicate with the elderly. And these younger people can bring new things and vitality to the elderly residents, who are … much happier when their grandchildren visit."Zhou's post recruiting lodgers has racked up over 1 million hits since he put it online in early January."I received hundreds of applications," he says. "After careful screening, I chose six, all of whom are college students from the cities of Jilin, Changchun and Baicheng."They will spend about two weeks of vacation before the Spring Festival in the nursing home," he says, adding that another 10 will come after the festival.Zhou's nursing home opened in 2004 and houses around 100 seniors, aged from 50 to 100."There are 30 workers taking care of their daily lives, so I don't worry about labor," he says. "I just hope the volunteers will provide quality companionship."Zhou says a growing proportion of the population is elderly, especially in the northeast."I hope young people will be able to alleviate their loneliness, understand their difficulties and deepen their awareness while respecting and loving the elderly," he says.Over 280 million Chinese, accounting for nearly 20 percent of the population, were above 60 years old by the end of 2022, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. A further 210 million people, or almost 15 percent, are 65 or older.Wang says he and the other volunteers have spent the last few days presenting performances, painting pictures and exercising with the seniors."I spent almost all of my time during the day with them. It was a really different vacation," he says."It gives me a warm feeling. They treat us like their grandchildren, and share their fruit and snacks with us. I'll continue to visit after I return to my university in the spring semester. And I'll spread the word about this among our volunteer team."Nearly 20 years ago, as a rookie copy editor working for a business daily in my hometown, Bangalore, I had occasion to go on an official trip to London, my first to a foreign land, courtesy of a British air carrier that had decided to take a few business journalists on a junket to mark its inaugural direct flight from the city.As I was running around frantically checking last-minute details, I vividly remember a senior colleague telling me how it was such a remarkable coincidence that I would be traveling to the very place and mingle with the very same people who had ruled us for around a century.Be that as it may, I was nevertheless impressed by London's impeccable architecture and, of course, its quaint double-decker buses and taxis.Four years after that eventful journey, I was to make a second intrepid one to Beijing — an experience that is closer to my heart for a number of reasons.China, I knew, could rival the UK any day with its unique tapestry of history and culture.However, it was not the pull of a mighty civilization, but four lines of dazzling beauty that had for long captivated me about all things Chinese."Flocks of birds have flown high and away,A solitary drift of cloud, too, has gone wandering on,And I sit alone with Ching Ting peak towering beyond,The mountain and I, we never grow tired of each other."It was in my fifth or sixth grade at school. I distinctly recall this intriguing verse snippet, attributed to the famed Tang Dynasty (618-907) poet Li Bai, tucked away in a chapter of my history textbook. To me, it didn't really matter why these sublime words happened to find place in a social sciences text, but suffice it to say, I was mesmerized by the poem, as well as the poet.The nostalgia these words have evoked since for an unknown place and culture thousands of miles away is hard to describe. It was only last year, having returned to Beijing to work, that I learned more about the poem and the man who — along with fellow Tang Dynasty poets such as Du Fu — will remain forever etched in the hearts of poetry aficionados here.Li manages to evocatively convey an emotion that vaults across centuries, time and language barriers.It is probably this verse that made me inexplicably fall in love with Chinese music, movies, poetry and, not to forget, acrobatics as well.While I have been a Chinese movie buff for years now, and was fortunate enough to witness a Chinese traditional music performance at the National Centre for the Performing Arts last year, its poetry is, of course, a different cup of tea, and I wouldn't dare approach it flippantly.The life of Li and his close friend Gao Shi, another renowned poet from the same period, and Du have been chronicled in the animated movie Chang'an, which I missed when it hit the theaters last year but hope to watch once it appears on a streaming platform.However, what I do not want to miss seeing live is a performance by the Chinese acrobatics team, which is showcasing its skills at an auditorium nearby.My interest in Chinese acrobatics was also piqued back in the 1980s after watching an hourlong videotape somewhat misleadingly titled Chinese Circus.So fascinated have I been with their performance that, I must confess, the tape has been reinserted countless number of times into the videocassette recorder and played over and over again at every available opportunity.Now, at last, here's my chance to watch them up close, and regale friends and family back home about their daring as well as dexterity.The five elements of the Chinese zodiac (wood, fire, earth, metal and water) combine with the 12 animals to create a 60-year cycle.

He has focused on plant taxonomy, which has widely been considered by the academic circle as the most challenging, fundamental and crucial studies in the field.The two recent overseas trips might seem like a breeze to Wang, considering how he has spent more than a decade trekking to the depths of the snow mountains on the treacherously rugged plateau, searching for rare plant species in harsh environments around the Himalayas.To date, he has collected over 100,000 valuable plant specimens and more than 200,000 related images."Being a leader does not give you the power to command your members. Rather, it empowers you to foster their growth and to grow with them," said Cai Weiyuan, a young but seasoned leader.At 23, Cai is a senior who is pursuing a double major in financial mathematics and economics at Ohio State University, the United States.He discovered his gift for organizing student groups during high school in Fuzhou, East China's Fujian province, where he started a chemical club. Upon his appointment as the president of the student organization association, he played a key role in establishing an additional 38 clubs.In an interview with Panopath, a social media account dedicated to creating an online community and information platform for Chinese students abroad, Cai said, "Compared with acquiring knowledge from textbooks, the planning and implementation of projects stimulate me better. It seems that discovering and motivating others are my innate skills."After completing three years of high school in the US, Cai continued his education at OSU, a university with a substantial Chinese student community.Reflecting on his journey, Cai said, "Inevitably, I have run into many bumps and taken detours in the past. I hope that I could point others in the right direction in the future."Leveraging his leadership experience from high school and co-founding a successful social media account, Booky Island, Cai received invitations from numerous student organizations at OSU. Eventually, he chose to lead Ingress Chinese Stock Investment (ICSI).ICSI, a financial club established in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, aims to provide comprehensive support for Chinese students aspiring to major in finance or economics and foster a strong sense of belonging in the US.Thanks to Cai's strategic planning, ICSI quickly became one of the largest student organizations on campus, with 200 out of 700 Chinese students annually applying at one point. Notably, Cai transformed ICSI from an online student organization into a thriving community."The sense of gaining and belonging is crucial to a member's adherence. They need to be willing to contribute to the club on their own will," Cai said, which was why he introduced the "Peer Mentor" program, guiding members through orientation, course selection, and career development.According to Cai, students hoping to work in the finance and business industry need to start early, and each step is interconnected."If you want to get a job right after graduation, freshman year requires you to equip yourself with at least basic knowledge and skills such as financial reporting and valuation. Then, in sophomore year, you would be able to get into programs for underclassmen," he said. "And in junior year, you need to apply for a summer internship. After all that, you may be able to secure a return offer in senior year."To aid members in their career paths, Cai designed extensive training courses and plans that would require the members years to complete."Many members have come back to me saying what I have taught came in handy during their interviews or internships. They have also become more and more active in the club and willing to help with club affairs," Cai said. "During their time as members, their contribution is somewhat like 'tuition'. It's a very healthy and benign cycle."Cai's commitment to the club is evident as he manages his dual majors, plans financial courses during weekdays, and teaches them to members on weekends. For him, 24 hours a day are not enough. And his biggest motivation is his sense of responsibility."I once read in a book that you should treat everything you do as your career," he said. "Running a student club has always been a huge part of my life, as important as academics. It's like I'm the boss of a startup company. If something goes wrong, I will be held accountable. I ought to put in more work because I have big shoes to fill."Personal gain is another motivator for Cai, who views his time at ICSI as an opportunity for personal experimentation and development. "With ICSI, I've been trying out theories and methods of my own, in terms of strategic planning and team management," he said. "The lessons and time spent at ICSI would benefit me for life."Having now "retired" from the leadership team of ICSI, Cai envisions a future where the club continues to be a helpful home for every Chinese student aspiring to a career in business and finance.In response to criticisms that Chinese student clubs are insular, Cai strongly disagrees and emphasizes their collaboration with US and international students. "There are cases where, for example, Chinese students tend to select the same courses, but it is only because we share a similar educational background," he said. "I embrace and endorse my own background."As an "expert" in extracurricular activities and clubs, Cai advises students to consider their ultimate goals when choosing a club."I would suggest that they evaluate the gain, value, and long-term effects a club can offer based on their individual needs and mindset."Traditional Chinese medicine gains global popularity, influencing health trends, and becoming a lifestyle choice for many.Phan Thi Kim Chi's connection with Traditional Chinese Medicine began at an early age. Growing up in a small village in Hanoi, Vietnam, it was inconvenient for Phan to travel to hospitals in neighboring cities. Whenever she caught a cold or experienced a headache as a child, her family would seek the help of a local TCM practitioner, whose prescriptions often included many herbs that could be found in the nearby woods of the village."For me and the villagers, TCM is a convenient and effective choice," said the 27-year-old. "I thought maybe one day I could use it to help people, too."This led her to major in TCM at a traditional medical school in Vietnam and later pursue further studies in acupuncture and tuina (Chinese therapeutic massage) at Changchun University of Chinese Medicine in Northeast China's Jilin province as a master's student.According to Phan, even though TCM has long been commonly practiced and accepted in Vietnam as it shares similarities with Vietnam's own traditional medicine, finding a good doctor or school to learn TCM in Vietnam is not easy. This is why she aims to bring the knowledge she has gained in China back to her own country. "I plan to become a TCM doctor and teacher after graduation," Phan said.Overseas students of TCM, like Phan, are not rare. According to a report co-published in April 2023 by Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine and Social Sciences Academic Press (China), the total number of international students studying TCM in China was 8,187 in 2020, with the largest population of 6,441 coming from Asian countries, followed by 832 from Africa and 432 from Europe.Bilibili's 2023 Power Up ceremony celebrated top content creators, recognizing diverse talents shaping China's digital landscape, Meng Wenjie reports.On Jan 6, Bilibili, a prominent Chinese video platform, hosted its annual Bilibili Power Up ceremony, celebrating the top 100 content creators, known as "uploaders", on the platform in 2023.Among the winners was Zhu Ruoxuan, a previous recipient of the award in 2021, following her two years as a vlogger.Born in 1998, Zhu began sharing her life through videos in 2019 under the moniker "Duoduo Hualin", initially focusing on makeup tutorials. It wasn't until 2021 that she gained widespread attention with a video depicting the evolution of ordinary Chinese women's appearance and mindset from the 1920s to the 2020s, which garnered over 10 million views on Bilibili."The year 2021 marked the centennial of the founding of the Communist Party of China," Zhu said. "So, I combined my passion for fashion and makeup to celebrate it."In the video, she also portrayed the facial expressions of women from different time periods, capturing their uncertainty in the 1920s, their helplessness during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45), and their confidence as female workers in the 1950s after the founding of the People's Republic of China.Despite a lack of formal acting training, Zhu studied women in old photos and movies instead to imitate their expressions, striving for accuracy.Over time, Zhu's videos shifted to an even greater focus on women, exploring other changes in women's images from the past to the present.Since last year, she's started paying more attention to current social phenomena and the issues women face. "I think it's a necessary growth both for myself and my creation," she said.One of Zhu's productions from last year highlights the transformation of Chinese women's hairstyles. At the end of the video, she depicted a character with pink hair, inspired by Zheng Linghua, a 23-year-old who faced cyberbullying due to her hairstyle and tragically ended her life while battling depression in January 2023."I want everyone to see that online violence can be fatal," Zhu said.Zhu's recent videos demonstrate a more compassionate approach toward women from historical periods. For instance, she released an anti-war video on Dec 13, the annual National Memorial Day for Victims of the Nanjing Massacre, portraying the transformation of an ordinary Chinese woman before and after the massacre. This video, which took two months to create, drew inspiration from Iris Chang's book The Rape of Nanking, in which women cut their hair short to disguise themselves as men during the war.As a native of Nanjing, Zhu felt a deep connection to the subject matter, and as a woman, she naturally focuses more on topics related to women. "I want to express my observations and thoughts through my videos," she said.Tibetan athlete Yudron Lhamo emerges as China's ski mountaineering sensation, claiming historic victories on international stages. Her journey, from remote peaks to triumph, reflects grit, skill, and an unyielding spirit.Tibetan athlete Yudron Lhamo, 20, has won multiple medals at ski mountaineering competitions, and she considers all these successes as the beginning process of building confidence in herself.Living in places surrounded by snowcapped mountains and glaciers, Tibetans seem to have a closer, more natural relationship with snow and ice, demonstrating their special talents in ice and snow-related sports.In recent years, the Chinese National Mountaineering and Skiing Team has selected an increasing number of young athletes from the Xizang autonomous region, training them to compete in various ski mountaineering games.An official ski team was established in the region in 2018 to support China's national strategy of encouraging 300 million people to participate in winter sports — a government commitment to the all-around development of ice and snow sports.Approximately 10 young athletes from the region serve as ski mountaineers for the Chinese National Mountaineering and Skiing Team, accounting for roughly half of the total athletes, according to Nyima Tsering, head of the regional sports bureau.Yudron Lhamo is one of the outstanding athletes from the region who has been gaining glory for China in international ski mountaineering games in recent years.Yudron Lhamo is from a remote township of the Konpo Gyada county in the region's Nyingchi city. She currently serves as an athlete of ski mountaineering for the national team.At the International Ski Mountaineering Federation (ISMF) World Championships in Spain on Feb 28 last year, Yudron Lhamo dominated the U20 women's sprint category with straight wins in the qualification, semifinal, and final rounds, becoming the first Chinese ski mountaineering world champion.During the 2023/24 ISMF Youth World Cup Ski Mountaineering season competitions held in Meribel, France, in early December, several athletes from Xizang won multiple medals, with Yudron Lhamo being one of the winners.During the two-day competition in Meribel, more than 100 athletes from 12 countries, including China, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and Spain attended the event, and three athletes from Xizang won three gold medals, one silver medal, and one bronze. Yudron Lhamo claimed gold in the U20 Women's Sprint and silver in the U20 Women's Individual competition."In the past, I often saw other athletes on television winning Olympic championships and raising the five-star red flag on foreign sports arenas," said Yudron Lhamo. She realized this dream herself when she stood on the award podium, and felt particularly excited and incredibly proud, she said.In 2019, Yudron Lhamo was selected from the medium and long-distance running team of the regional sports school to join the region's skiing team, officially becoming a skiing athlete.The transformation from zero experience to a skier was accompanied by unimaginable hardships. After years of training, the numerous bruises and scars on her body bear witness to her dedication."After winning this championship in December, I feel very happy, and I would like to express my gratitude to my family and coaches who have always supported and encouraged me all the way," she said."Everything went relatively smoothly during the competition, and I didn't encounter any major difficulties," she added, mentioning that her coaches and family members often describe her as overly competitive and ambitious."I personally believe that what I have gained so far cannot be described as success; it can only be described as a good result," she said. "If you ask me how much effort has been put into this achievement, my answer would be hard work day after day, year after year, to persist with determination."According to Yudron Lhamo, her regular training is divided into two types: summer training and winter training. During summer training, she usually does not have a fixed training location, and her training would be in places like Beijing, Nyingchi, Heilongjiang, and others.Winter training places usually include colder regions such as Jilin province, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, and Italy."During summer training, our main focus is on aerobic exercises like running, strength training, and roller skiing, which are aimed at improving our physical fitness," she said, adding that winter training primarily focuses on skiing techniques such as ascending, descending, and transitions, which is aimed to strengthen and enhance their skiing skills and aerobic and anaerobic abilities.She said the biggest challenges she currently faces during training are unpredictable injuries.One unforgettable experience, when representing the national team in a competition, was last year during the vertical sprint race at the Youth World Cup Ski Mountaineering season competitions in Italy."My body reached its limit, went into shock, and I had to be airlifted to the hospital for emergency treatment, and it was a painful experience," she recalled.In 2022, ski mountaineering was added as one of the events of the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, and Yudron Lhamo was selected as one of the national athletes to prepare for it."I believe that Tibetan athletes hold their greatest advantage in terms of willpower and endurance in this sport," she said.In a few weeks, she will be participating in the 14th National Winter Games scheduled to take place in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region from Feb 17 to 27."I do have confidence in this competition, but success is not guaranteed 100 percent as we can never prevent any risks at competitions."SUVA — China showed Fijian Katriena Wong that seeing is believing."The real China that I saw with my own eyes was so different from what the Western media had been portraying for years," says Wong, who'd previously studied in China.The Chinese government awarded her a scholarship in 2013. Wong studied the Chinese language at Central China Normal University in Wuhan, Hubei province, for a year, and then went to Shijiazhuang in Hebei province and completed her bachelor's in law at the Hebei University of Economics and Business in 2018."China was so vibrant and full of energy," Wong recalls. "What really struck me was the sheer scale of its infrastructure: glitzy skyscrapers, airports, malls, super-efficient transportation and convenient mobile payments."Most of what she'd heard about China beforehand came from mainstream English-language media, which portrayed China as "rural", she says.She visited several destinations, including Beijing and Shanghai and the Xinjiang Uygur and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions. She says she was impressed by the culture, people and landscapes."I really have wonderful memories of my visits. I always feel nostalgic about them," Wong says.She especially appreciated how safe China is, "even at 2 am", and its clean streets and urban parks."We (Fijians) can learn a lot more from China," she says."We also hope to bring the good things we have learned back to Fiji and implement them in our society to modernize our own country."Wong now works as a manager at Dingjin Real Estate Development Co and oversees Nausori Plaza, which is one of its largest investments in Fiji. It's the Nausori region's largest mall and will serve three bordering provinces.She believes the challenging but high-quality education she received in China prepared her for the job market.China's ambassador to Fiji, Zhou Jian, says around 300 Fijian students like Wong have studied in China through Chinese government scholarship programs since 1996.Zhou says Fijians are becoming more interested in learning about China. Recently, many of the archipelagic nation's cabinet ministers, members of the parliament, government officials, entrepreneurs, young people and students have traveled to China.Many of them told the ambassador these trips changed their perceptions."If you've never been to China, you should visit," Wong says. "It's the only way you will know what China truly is."When Li Yong took the train to the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, more than 1,500 kilometers away from his hometown — Liyang, Jiangsu province, he was just 2 years old.He was among about 3,000 children from the southern China, who were adopted by herdsmen in the late 1950s, when the country was hit by natural disasters and the government of Inner Mongolia took the initiative to take care of these children.Over the past six decades, these adoptees learned to integrate into their new environment and families, but they haven't stopped delving into their past and exploring their roots.This Is Life, a documentary film created by the Tsingying Film studio and distributed by film distribution platform Elemeet, is set to grace the nation's big screens on Jan 13.The film features more than 800 short videos captured by 509 ordinary people from all walks of life, especially manual laborers and farmers. The videos were selected by the production crew over the course of a year from a total of more than 50,000 video clips.By gathering the short video footage, the film engages ordinary people in its creation and presents their authentic life experience, allowing those who are often inadequately represented in mainstream cinemas to take center stage.According to the film's director Sun Hong, by gathering, selecting and compiling video clips from a vast database, the film presents how people record their own lives, which possesses a power of authenticity even greater than traditional documentaries.In the film, the audience members will see construction workers working out on the construction site during their spare time, fishermen talking to their cormorants and teasing their greediness for fish, or boatmen celebrating a rare day when they could use tap water."It is our creative endeavor, as documentary filmmakers, to present an authentic facet of China, highlighting how each individual establishes themselves in a rapidly developing society," says Sun.Since Jan 6, the film will embark on its roadshow theatrical release across multiple major cities in China. A series of special screenings are also being organized, including screenings inviting those whose footage are selected, screenings for children and parents, as well as ones for urban dwellers.A series of cultural merchandise are also due to be released, including lenticular tickets, woven bags, hoodies, as well as Chinese couplets and red envelopes to ring in the Chinese New Year."The first time I saw This Is Life, I was immediately drawn to its contemporaneity. This film carries significant experimental value in a contemporary context, representing new modes of expression and ways of life," says renowned film director Jia Zhangke.For Costa Ricans in Central America, UIBE scholar Felipe Mora's compatriots, China may not be the first-choice destination for higher education, given their motherland's proximity to the fabled United States, but Mora would not settle for anything else. He even disregarded his father's advice and decided he would pursue his master's as well in China.Mora believes it's always better to choose a path less trodden. He prefers to be off the beaten tracks.Since he grew up and received early education in both Costa Rica and the US, he is fluent in both Spanish and English. Now, he is determined to master Chinese as well, even as he pursues excellence in both academic areas and pastimes like travel and slacklining (more about that in a bit).Unlike most of his peers, Mora, now 25, gave up the opportunity to finish his higher education in the US in 2018. Instead, he decided to come to China for further studies."Going to the US for college is a good option, but learning a third language will give me more value as a person. And for me, China means more than the language itself, because when you study the language, you study the culture as well," he said.Mora further said he developed an interest in China through movies when he was a kid. Yet, he couldn't even say "Hello" in Chinese when he landed in China. He mispronounced "xiexie" ("thank you" in Mandarin) as "qieqie" at a restaurant."I remember how people were laughing at that time. Then I promised myself that no matter how long it will take to learn this language, I'm going to speak it as fluently as a native Chinese does. That has been my goal ever since."Soon, language was no longer an obstacle for Mora. A quick learner and hardworking student, he finished the precollege language courses in 2019. He is now in the fourth year of a bachelor's degree in international trade at the University of International Business and Economics or UIBE in Beijing.Mora said he has been particularly fascinated with the ancient Chinese architecture. Layers of bricks impeccably laid on top of each other always catch his attention.He holds places like the Temple of Heaven and the Summer Palace close to his heart. "They take me back in time and make me imagine how they used to be," he said.He recalled that China has not been a popular destination for education among his compatriots given the geographical distance. The Pacific Ocean separates the two land masses. Some of them, he said, think China is so far away they may never visit it even once in their lifetime."They envy me for having the courage to choose to study and live in a country that is so unfamiliar and they are very curious about China," he said."They ask me so many questions. How are the people? Are the girls beautiful? When I show them pictures, they think that's amazing and they get really interested in China."When Clifford Long Junior, 70, son of Clifford Long Senior, a member of the "Flying Tigers" — the US World War II air force veterans helped the Chinese people in their War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45) — visited the Liuzhou Military Museum in Liuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, in November, his eyes welled up on seeing the wartime archive of photographs, weapons, remnants and artifacts that were on display.Later, facing media cameras, he shared some rare pictures from his family album. The images featured wartime moments of his father. One image showed the senior Clifford sitting in a fighter plane alone. In other images, the dad could be seen with his air force crew members."My father was here (in China) in 1944. He was 19 years old, when he flew ground support very close to Chinese soldiers. The latter recognized him in the cockpit and nicknamed him 'Lieutenant Moonface' (as they thought his face was round)," he said, voice tinged with pride.The son shared another picture wherein his father is seen standing alongside a grounded fighter jet. "This is a picture of him after crash landing. He survived, else I'd not be here," he said with a laugh.Clifford Long Junior lives in the United States, and has been deeply involved for many years now with the Sino-American Aviation Heritage Foundation, a prominent NGO that promotes the legacy of Flying Tigers. The NGO is led by its chairman, Jeffrey Greene.From late October to early November, Long was in China as a member of a delegation of the foundation that was invited for a 10-day visit. The foundation is seeking to advance goodwill and friendship with the Chinese people.The delegation of more than 30 included two living legends — Flying Tiger veterans Harry Moyer and Mel McMullen — and first-, second-and even third-generation descendants of the Flying Tigers.The trip took them to historical sites and tourist attractions beyond Liuzhou — places like Beijing, Chongqing and Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province.Long said that before visiting China, he spoke with as many people as possible in the US about the Flying Tigers' relationship with the Chinese people. He wanted to gather as much information as possible so he could share it with others."In our country, although a lot of people are familiar with the term 'Flying Tigers', they only associate it with the P40 planes with tiger's teeth (patterns) on them, and they don't really understand or (are) not taught history," he said."I try to talk about that (part of) history with as many people as I can and shall continue to do so once I am back in our country, to promote the Chinese-American relations. That's what I do. I work with Jeff (Jeffrey Greene) and help him out with whatever I can, to promote our bilateral relations."Speaking on the core spirit of Flying Tigers, Long said love, life and circumstances characterized the young veterans back in World War II, which is now part of history.His parents, he recalled, fell in love while at school. His father later joined the US Army Air Corps and came to China. After a long and eventful life, his father passed on in 2019 aged 94. Three months later, his mother passed on.Long said when his dad was in China, his parents "wrote to each other every day, and he put his and her names on his plane"."In 1944, there was no international communication, there was no internet ... You couldn't even talk on telephone from continent to continent," he said.Back then, Long Senior was just a young man from a small town in the US and had never even been on a plane before he joined the air force."He was taught how to fly the plane, he came over to China to fly for General (Claire) Chennault, and during his time here, he fell in love with the Chinese people, and he was very proud that he was able to help them," Long said.Professor Jian Zhimin, who was elected academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences this year, is dean of the School of Ocean and Earth Science at Tongji University. He believed that oceans offer clues on global climate change patterns and the causes behind natural disasters."The ocean is the largest reservoir of heat in the Earth's climate system and one of the primary factors determining climate change," Jian said. "Since the Industrial Revolution, the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide emissions has led to global warming, with about 93 percent of the excess heat entering the ocean. This has affected ocean heat content and subsequently influenced the ocean-continent hydrological cycle."Using modern observations and proxy indicators from ancient environments, Jian's team has reconstructed the variations in upper ocean heat content in the warm pool over the past 360,000 years. They discovered that increased surface water evaporation in the warm pool region leads to an increase in monsoon rainfall in adjacent land areas. This is the first time that the driving role of lowlatitude ocean processes in climate change has been explained from an energy perspective. In October last year, the research study, titled "Warm pool ocean heat content regulates ocean-continent moisture transport", was published in the prestigious academic journal Nature.Jian said, "Only with firsthand materials, firsthand data, along with innovative and open-minded thinking, can we make significant scientific contributions." He believed that conducting marine operations and combining them with terrestrial investigations by geologists was necessary to obtain the samples required for research.Over the past 30 years, Jian has been part of numerous field investigations conducted in the South China Sea, Pacific and Indian Oceans, aboard international scientific research vessels. In 1994, he joined a Sino-German joint expedition aboard the research vessel Sonne-95 for a South China Sea survey. In 1997, he joined French research vessel Marie Tharp for the third expedition of the International Marine Global Change Study in the western Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. In 1999, he became the first Chinese scientist to board a scientific drilling vessel for the first Ocean Drilling Program Leg 184 in the South China Sea."I can do research in the deep seas for up to two months, and I really enjoy being on research vessels," Jian said. "It is the fascinating world of oceans that keeps me exploring, and the joy comes from the process of transitioning from the unknown to the known."Having received his "training" on research vessels, Jian said he always looks for occasions to send students on such research expeditions, letting them have close contact with other academicians and participate in cutting-edge scientific research.Jian believed that just like Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in the 19th century and the plate tectonics theory in the 20th century, Earth system science will lead the transformation of Earth science in the 21st century."To establish a Chinese school of Earth system science, innovation is crucial. It requires not only the integration of science and technology but also creating fertile ground for an innovative culture," he said. "Modern science originated from Europe's maritime civilization, while Chinese civilization has primarily been a continental one. So we need a more adventurous and exploratory spirit. Through efforts in recent years, Chinese scientists have made breakthroughs in various aspects of Earth system science." He said that China should not only absorb the innovative advantages of maritime civilizations but also promote the strengths of Chinese civilization, uphold cultural self-confidence, and implement an innovation-driven development strategy.In 2020, Jian was elected co-chair of the Scientific Steering Committee of the Past Global Change Programme, becoming the first non-Western scientist to hold this position in the 30-year history of PAGES. In November, when the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced the results of the 2023 election of academicians, Jian's name was on the list, giving him the highest academic title in the field of science and technology in China.He said that being elected an academician was like a new starting point for him. "As my mentor said, the work he is proud of internationally was accomplished after he was elected an academician. As a new-generation academician, I will take up the baton and contribute more to making China a power in the field of maritime science and technology. I feel that the responsibility on my shoulders is greater than before," he said."To build a maritime power and venture into the world's oceans, China needs a continuous stream of talented marine geologists. Fortunately, I have a large number of outstanding young talents behind me who have made a name for themselves internationally," Jian said. "For young students, the most important thing is perseverance. You need to keep in mind what you want to do and what kind of person you want to become," Jian said. He added that young people should be willing to endure hardship, work hard, never forget their original intentions, and stay true to their aspirations.Luo Jiayuan contributed to this story.French Sinologist stresses the importance of Chinese language education to ensure bilateral tiesInterest in learning the Chinese language has been growing around the globe, and this is evidenced by the rising popularity of Mandarin classes all over the world, says renowned French Sinologist Joel Bellassen.He made the comment during an education seminar in Fujian province on Dec 16. Two days later, the Frenchman conducted a class at Tongji University in Shanghai where he shared techniques for comprehending Chinese characters and other linguistic tips with more than 20 international students, before delivering a speech about his passion for the Chinese language to hundreds of young students from the university.When it comes to the Chinese language, few nonnative Chinese are as well-versed as the 73-year-old, who can speak standard Mandarin with decent Beijing accent and likes wearing a traditional Chinese-style jacket in dark blue. He spent more than half a century learning the language and has made hundreds of trips to China.Since his maiden trip in 1973, as an exchange student in Beijing, Bellassen has dedicated much of his life to not only mastering the Chinese language, but also building bridges that connect French and Chinese cultures.Between 1973 and 1975, the Frenchman studied Chinese at the Beijing Language Institute, which is now the Beijing Language and Culture University, and Peking University. So enamored by the language, he went on to create methods to teach Chinese language in primary schools in France.In 1984, he became a founding member of the Association Francaise des Professeurs de Chinois (Association of Chinese Language Teachers of France). In 1989, he coproduced A Key to Chinese Speech and Writing, a textbook that included a list of over 900 Chinese characters. They accounted for about 90 percent of frequently used characters in publications. Mastering these 900 Chinese characters means that foreign people can generally read newspapers or books.The two-volume A Key to Chinese Speech and Writing has been widely adopted in schools across France and is among the most popular text books in schools.Even former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing lavished praise on the usefulness of his pedagogy.According to Bellassen, Chinese was added to the French national baccalaureate in 1968. In 2013, Chinese language courses were made available in all school districts in mainland France, and this led to "a significant increase in the number of students studying Chinese".A skier was skimming across the slope before suddenly stopping with snowflakes stirred up. It happened within seconds, but the images had been recorded by a photographer not far away with a succession of shots.This photographer, Zhang Jian, is the chief of the photography team at Songhua Lake Resort in Jilin city, Northeast China's Jilin province. Since being introduced to the industry, this ski and photography enthusiast felt his job was perfect and tailor-made for him."The thrill of speed and the desire to push one's limits are the charms of skiing, of which photography is the best carrier," he said.An art major, Zhang, a native of Jinlin province, landed a job at a ski resort as a staff member in 2010. Seeing that more skiers wanted photos on the snow, he believed it was an opportunity. He worked hard to improve his skiing and photo skills.In 2015, Zhang became one of the first contracted photographers in China's "Hey Snow" application, providing skiers with photography services. In 2018, he took the lead in setting up a ski photography studio called Snow.Throughout the years, he witnessed the growing demand in ski photography and the popularization of winter sports in China, boosted by the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.During the snow season in 2021-2022, Zhang's team uploaded a total of 3.82 million photos, 23 times more than in 2018-2019, with sales exceeding 1 million yuan (about $140,845). He expects to see a new record this season.According to its provincial tourism industry development program, Jilin has 75 ski resorts and 319 snow trails. The province plans to raise snow and ice tourism revenue to 500 billion yuan within five years.According to Zhang, ski enthusiasts are becoming younger. "In the past, the skiers were mostly youngsters," he said. "Now, many young couples who love skiing themselves bring their children here to cultivate their interest in the sport."Since the beginning of this snow season, his photography team's schedule has been almost fully occupied. Apart from local skiers, he saw more enthusiasts from other parts of China, for whom the experience is valuable to be recorded in photos.Ski enthusiast Cheng Yang, from Nanjing in East China's Jiangsu province, told Xinhua she and her friends go skiing yearly. In the past, they used to go to Japan or Europe. But now, with the rapid development of the winter sports industry and infrastructure in domestic ski resorts, they have changed their destination to Jilin or Xinjiang.This year, she has just ordered a few photos. "In the past, skiers used to take photos for each other, and the quality was not ensured," she said. "Now that we have professional photographers here, taking photos has become a necessary part of my skiing experience, and I am glad to share them on social media."Satisfaction of the skiers is what Zhang and his colleagues want to see."The photographer might have to stand on the slope for hours to capture a perfect moment of a skier," he said. "It is the biggest achievement for photographers to record wonderful memories for skiers through photos."Award-winning Chinese shoe designer, Huang Qinqin, shares her transformative journey, blending cultural heritage and international design to shape the art of practical wear.In the 1988 novel The Alchemist by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, a shepherd boy yearns to travel in search of worldly treasure, only to discover his "personal legend" — his true calling in life, which brings him happiness and fulfillment. This story has inspired numerous readers worldwide to listen to their hearts and, most importantly, to pursue their dreams.Echoing the protagonist in the novel, Huang Qinqin, a 29-year-old Chinese shoe designer who recently won the Culture and Creativity Award of Study UK Alumni Awards 2023-24, has similarly found her "personal legend "along her academic journey in both China and the UK."The education I received in the two countries has shaped me into who I am today," Huang said.The Study UK Alumni Awards celebrate the achievements of international students who have studied in the UK, and have gone on to achieve remarkable feats. Now in its 10th year, the awards have attracted over 1,450 applications from international UK alumni across more than 90 countries. The British Council announced the recipients of the awards earlier this month, with Huang being recognized for her outstanding contributions to the field of arts and culture."The experience of studying overseas has allowed Huang to appreciate the charm of multicultural exchanges. She started to explore and reflect on the concepts of culture and aesthetics," said Josie Zhang, Senior Marketing Manager at the British Council.Since 2019, when she created her original footwear brand "ouvrir la boîte," Huang has left an indelible mark on the fashion industry. Her works have been featured in high-end boutiques, pop-up stores, and international fashion shows in New York, Milan, and Shanghai. Many of her shoe collections have adorned the feet of the new generation of Chinese stars, including Zhao Lusi and Yang Chaoyue.Believing that the value of her products lies not in business operations but in the unique design philosophy itself, Huang always focuses on how to convey the stories behind her shoes to customers. "Design is like storytelling, a natural ability I possess," she said with a smile.However, Huang's journey into design was unforeseen and it took her several years to discover her true passion.Back in high school, Huang excelled in physics. So, when choosing a major in college, engineering seemed the logical choice. However, during her freshman year at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China in Zhejiang province, Huang gradually realized that this was not what she wanted.The 2023 International Youth Sports and Health Series Activity, hosted by the China Soong Ching Ling Culture and Science Centre for Young People, commenced at the National Tennis Center in Beijing on Friday.About 600 students and teachers gathered at the cultural corridor of the National Tennis Center to gain insights into the development history of tennis in China and the progression of the China Open.Then they got into the Ice Cube where they experienced winter sports activities, delved into the realm of physical training knowledge and athletic skills in the professional athlete training room and attended educational experts' lectures.The series of events aim to enrich the sports knowledge of young individuals and broaden their perspectives.Su Hongtao, the deputy director of the center, expressed during the opening ceremony that participants will be offered the opportunity to interact with experts and sports champions while engaging in diverse sports activities."I hope that all the young participants can experience the joy of sports, and that their passion for sports and health will be ignited during our activities," he added.In recent years, China has undertaken a comprehensive initiative for rural vitalization, aiming to address challenges such as poverty, infrastructure development and economic inequality in its rural areas.In this video, five international friends, representing diverse perspectives on China's rural transformation, shared their admiration for the picturesque Chinese villages and commended the nation's achievements in poverty alleviation, noting cleaner environments and improved infrastructure.The interviewees also highlighted China's commitment to balancing economic development and ecological conservation, emphasizing the value placed on sustainable practices. Additionally, they shed light on the rising importance of ecotourism as a catalyst for rural development and emphasized the crucial role of intangible cultural heritage in preserving traditions for both local communities and international visitors.YINCHUAN — In the city of Yinchuan, Northwest China's Ningxia Hui autonomous region, 60-year-old calligrapher-turned-barber, Ren Zhanping, is making waves with his distinctive approach to grooming.Ren, who caters to a dozen clients daily, believes that grooming brings a radiant perspective to life.Ren had been a barber in his youth, and then parted ways with the trade, before picking up his old profession again three years ago as he entered his elder years."I once worked for an advertisement agency, writing shop brand names and painting pictures on the wall, but the trade has become too competitive with the advent of the digital age," he says.Ren's calligraphy skills, honed since childhood, have given him a unique edge in wielding the razor.At the Macao Grand Prix Museum, Patrick Koellmer, a German well-known on Chinese social media, immersed himself in the VR experience of road racing."It's so exciting!" he acclaims. "We Germans love motor racing. This museum reminds me of the BMW Museum in Munich."Koellmer and several other social media influencers are taking part in an event organized by media groups on the Chinese mainland to visit six major cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and experience the region's vitality and innovative charm. They recently spent a weekend in Macao.Having lived in China for over a decade, Koellmer graduated from Xiamen University in East China's Fujian province and now works in Zhuhai, a city in South China's Guangdong province that borders Macao. He loves sharing Chinese food, scenery and culture on social media."I've been to Macao before, but I didn't know the motor racing culture here is so rich," he says, promising to share his interesting experiences from the trip on the internet.Xiong Suwan, whose social media account focuses on food and culture in Hong Kong, says she was most impressed by the famous tourist sights of Macao such as the ruins of St. Paul's and local delicacies.Nicaraguan businessman in China taps improving international relationship to promote the Central American country's agricultural bounty.Two of the first few things about Nicaraguan Claudio Frixione that amaze his Chinese contacts are his birthplace and school."They're always very interested in the hospital where I was born, the school I attended, because those places are owned by the company I work for," Frixione, 26, says.Frixione, an employee of Flor de Cana, Nicaragua's award-winning rum, received free medical care and education from the parent company of the 133-year-old brand because his parents were also its employees."My father worked for the company for more than 40 years and my mother for 20-plus years before retiring, so I was 'raised' in the company, and I finished my high school at the school of the company; you can say our family is closely linked to it," he says.Frixione says that, as Asia-Pacific marketing manager for one of the biggest Nicaraguan brands, and the only Nicaraguan working in the field in China, he is also perfectly positioned to introduce his Central American country to Chinese friends and beyond."Nicaragua boasts quality agricultural products like its rum, cigars and coffee; its magnificent landscape includes volcanoes and lakes. They are all just waiting for more people to discover them," he says.Frixione, who obtained a scholarship for his tertiary studies in Taiwan majoring in business administration, including a year learning the Chinese language, moved to Shanghai half a year ago.He stands out among Nicaraguans not only for speaking fluent Mandarin, but also for having obtained a visa to work in the Chinese mainland."We see a lot of potential here for us …rum is something that you can enjoy with other Nicaraguan specialties, such as chocolate or even a good cigar," says Frixione, adding that increasingly affluent and savvy Chinese consumers who enjoy Scotch whisky and French cognac will also be able to experience premium rum through Nicaragua's offerings."The availability of all these products coming from Nicaragua to China can help people understand more about our culture," he says."For example, Nicaraguans, we have our unique drinking culture. At dining tables, it's our bottles of rum, it's not just for adding into cocktails at bars that many other people may be used to."Latest developments in China-Nicaragua ties are set to fuel Frixione's optimism for growth — in August, the two sides inked a free-trade agreement offering mutually beneficial trade and investment cooperation.Le Thi Khanh Linh, a Vietnamese legal scholar, overcame language barriers to translate China's Civil Code, facilitating legal and cultural exchanges between nations.When Le Thi Khanh Linh graduated from the College of Law at Hue University in Vietnam in 2016, she made a decision to start learning Chinese. Little did she know that this decision would eventually lead to her translating the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China into Vietnamese, which was published in 2021.As the main translator, currently pursuing a PhD in criminal law at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law (ZUEL) in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, Le, 29, was surprised to see the first 500 copies promptly sold out, indicating a high demand for the publication.This year coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative. In recognition of this milestone, Le chose to present the translated Civil Code of the People's Republic of China to ZUEL. Learning of her initiative, Hue University, Le's alma mater, generously donated 20 copies from its collection.Reflecting on her decision to learn Chinese in 2016, Le explained, "At the time of graduation, my English was decent, but so were many other Vietnamese students. To increase my competitiveness in the job market, I decided to learn Chinese. The more I learned, the more I became fond of the language. There are many similarities between Chinese and my mother tongue, which is very interesting."Over a two-year Chinese learning journey with a tutor, Le's passion for the language grew, leading to her bold decision in 2018 to pursue a master's degree in international law at ZUEL in China."Our program was taught in English, and my Chinese wasn't very fluent at that time. However, I always grabbed every opportunity to speak Chinese with my professors and Chinese friends. Also, I took Chinese classes at the International Education Department," Le said.After completing her master's degree, Le returned to Hue University to teach. It was then that she discovered the practical applications of her Chinese language ability.According to Le, in Vietnam, many legal terms are written in Chinese characters, creating a language barrier for students. While most professors can only explain these terms by abstractly describing the concept, Le's proficiency in Chinese gave her an advantage."Since I'm able to decode Chinese, I could explain the terms in a way that's easier for the students to understand," she said.But for Le, the application of Chinese in the field of law wasn't confined to the classroom setting. Tran Kien, PhD, a professor from Vietnam National University (VNU) in Hanoi, recognized Le's expertise and approached her for the monumental task of translating the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China."If in the 19th century the civil code of the century was that of France, and the civil code of the 20th century was that of Germany, then the 21st century is likely to be the century of the Chinese Civil Code," Tran said.Le did not work alone. Alongside Tran and two other PhDs from VNU, she also had a fellow scholar studying in France as a professional proofreader."My proofreader specializes in civil law, and he would give me suggestions for revision after reading my draft," Le said."When it comes to Chinese, I'm the expert, but in terms of civil law, he is."Le and her team had to overcome obstacles like the absence of direct translations for certain terms in Chinese. "For instance, we don't have a direct translation for the Chinese word peiou (spouse) in Vietnamese. We only have 'husband' and 'wife'," Le said. "Our solution was to write the pinyin in Vietnamese followed by an explanation."They also faced challenges such as differences in meaning. "In Vietnamese, the word 'government' refers to the highest administrative agency, equivalent to the State Council of China, but in China, there are governments at all levels," she said.Le stressed that they had to be very aware of these differences and nuances in order to explain them with clarity.After three months of strenuous work, Le completed the translation at the end of 2020.Comprising over 100,000 words and 1,260 ordinances, the Vietnamese version of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China was officially published by the Publishing House of VNU."Due to the language barrier, Vietnamese scholars could only access the English copy of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China in the past, and many things could be lost in translation. I don't think such learning method was ideal," Le said. "Now they can study and do research unhindered with the Vietnamese version."To meet the increasing demand, Le and her team are preparing to print 1,000 copies of a revised edition in the coming year."This revised version incorporates corrections, updates to terminology, and the addition of judicial interpretations from the Supreme People's Court on the Chinese Civil Code," Le said.Le noted that it will go into print as soon as Vietnamese legal experts finish reviewing the texts.Le's family has always been proud and supportive of her decisions."I'm from a family of doctors. Although they know little about my major, my parents would often showcase my translated book to others, and my brother would post screenshots of my interview on social media."Looking ahead, Le plans to translate the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China as her next ambitious project."Criminal law is my specialized area of focus. While others have translated specific ordinances, I aim to encompass a broader scope, incorporating fundamental principles of Chinese law and practical cases," Le said."I hope to make a contribution to fostering deeper legal and cultural exchanges between China and Vietnam."As the sun dipped below the skyline, the Auckland Art Gallery sparkled with the presence of celebrities and dignitaries, who came to celebrate the exquisite symphony of art, fashion and heritage, as the Chinese couturier Guo Pei unveiled her exhibition Fashion, Art, Fantasy.The six-month exhibition, from Dec 9, will showcase over 60 striking garments from Guo's two-decade-long career, inviting New Zealanders to immerse themselves in the grandeur of her art couture.The opening ceremony commenced with the soul-stirring resonance of a Maori Karanga, a ceremonial call of welcome to the artist and her family, followed by traditional blessings and songs.The exclusive exhibition not only displays Guo's representative masterpiece, the Yellow Queen gown and outfits never seen before in any other gallery or museum, but also features a series of unique public events, including an interview with the artist, the Chinese New Year Festival and a fashion fantasy ball."It is a privilege to present the magnificent work of Guo Pei to New Zealand, for the very first time," says Kirsten Lacy, director of the Auckland Art Gallery.Describing Guo's creations as more than fashion, she coined the term "art couture" to capture the essence of the exhibition.Guo said in her speech that she wishes to share her love and inspiration in her work with the New Zealand audience."Art transcends all the boundaries we impose. I aspire for my work to convey integrity, to transmit love, and to embody my civilization, along with the culture that flows in my veins," the artist said."In reality, culture and art know no borders; they belong not only to a single nation or ethnicity but to all of humanity. A country's museum represents the culture and refinement of its people," she noted."Much of my learning has been derived from museums, (which) I am delighted to present, in the most beautiful manner, within this art gallery and share with everyone, inspiring and uplifting all."Guo herself also engaged in an exchange by introducing her work to the audience, offering insights into the inspiration behind each creation.A splendid array of straw-made miniatures of classic ancient buildings adorn Xu Jian's home. They range from the Yellow Crane Tower in Central China's Hubei province to Forbidden City's turrets in Beijing. They are all full of details and delicately crafted, tied and arranged by Xu's ingenious hands from countless sorghum straws."All the pillars, beams, eaves, brackets, doors and windows and everything else are crafted from sorghum stalks," Xu points to the Yellow Crane Tower that is 1 meter high at his base in Yongqing county, Langfang city, North China's Hebei province.This particular piece was made out of hundreds of thousands of sorghum stalks and took him two years to complete without the use of any nails or glue."It relies entirely on interlocking, tenon-and-mortise construction," the man in his 30s explains.The craft involves carving grooves into the sorghum stalks, before multiple stalks are then locked together through those identically sized grooves, a technique referred to as tying, Xu says, adding that the art form combines elements of geometry, physics, architecture and mechanics."The framework of all the carved and tied straw works is composed of six interlocked sorghum stalks. Starting from the bottom and working from the inside out, the interlocked stalks are layered, much like building a house," Xu explains.He emphasizes that the sorghum straw art requires a great deal of patience, especially for works depicting ancient architecture.On March 18, 2018, I was alone at home in San José, Costa Rica, drinking a cup of tea, unaware that my life was about to change. I received an e-mail notification with the subject "scholarship selection result".My heartbeat quickened as I read through it, and I felt a bit of heavenly bliss: I had been chosen to receive a full scholarship for a master's degree in conducting at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. Finally, I would be able to delve into the ancient tales of dragons and the old legends of China, which had always fascinated me.Five months later, I arrived in Shanghai, stepping into an entirely new world. At the airport, two of my Costa Rican friends were waiting for me and accompanied me to the dormitory at Lingling Road.I remember clearly when I approached dorm building No 3, being drawn by the sweet melody of a dizi (Chinese flute), which was totally different from all that I used to hear in my country.The next day I went to the campus at Fenyang Road, and those buildings blew my mind since the music school I came from is really small in comparison.In Costa Rica, I learned the conducting technique well. However, it was my professor, Cao Tongyi at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, who guided me in elevating my skills. His teachings emphasized not only meticulous attention to detail but also the art of letting the music flow as gracefully as tai chi.In my opinion, that's the essence of life in China. You can see it on every corner when you notice how the traffic flows or on the way people walk to the subway, and even on how the delivery system works throughout China. Similarly, music can transcend the confines of notation and paper, flowing from the musician to the audience, enriching the world one note at a time.During the COVID-19 pandemic, I had to go back to Costa Rica, but I already held a piece of China in my heart.There, I taught music lessons in a school. One day, I introduced the Chinese folk song Molihua, meaning jasmine, to my 3rd- and 4th-grade students. Their first reactions were very interesting: some of them liked the melody while others were confused about the pronunciation, particularly the sound "zh", which we don't have in Spanish.The next week, some of my students were asking more about China and its people, so I dedicated my music classes to talk about it and to listen to more Chinese music. Weeks later, the entire school questioned why only certain grades had been selected to sing this beautiful song — a response that pleasantly surprised me. Then I knew that music is one of the best ways to show people about the culture of another country.Months later, my students and I crafted a video performance of Molihua to commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese Embassy in Costa Rica shared it across its social media platforms.This year, on March 8, I was finally able to return to Shanghai to finish my master's degree, to meet again with my friends and colleagues, prepare a concert with The Voice of the World Choir (from the International Education Division of Shanghai Conservatory of Music), and continue my exploration of China through its music. Words fall short in expressing the sheer delight and gratitude I experience, and every single day I feel blessed to be here.In my opinion, Shanghai is becoming the global center of classical music. Here, you can attend concerts of great artists such as Chinese pianists Lang Lang and Wang Yujia as well as American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, German soprano Diana Damrau, alongside orchestras including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, and the China National Opera House Choir.In addition, the ingenuity of Chinese composers such as Tan Dun is truly impressive. He uses water as a musical instrument and integrates paper sheets to evoke unique sensations in contemporary Chinese opera — an opportunity unavailable elsewhere.It's also a delightful experience to enjoy a mixture of Western and Chinese music when you attend concerts with different styles or even adaptations of renowned compositions such as The Phantom of the Opera: which debuted its Chinese rendition at the Shanghai Grand Theatre in May.Studying in China and immersing myself in its music has been a wonderful journey of discovering new harmonies rooted in the pentatonic scale, introducing me to diverse sounds produced by Chinese musical instruments like the erhu — a two-stringed bowed musical instrument — and the suona — a woodwind instrument.From now on, my mission is to share this amazing musical experience worldwide, which is the reason I'm currently working on to bring a new music proposal with a choir and orchestra to the stage in the upcoming months. I hope to spread the joy of music far and wide and I believe my aspirations will flourish here in China.Written by Edwin Montealegre, a 37-year-old Costa Rican citizen and music conductor with a Master of Arts degree from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. Currently, he is in the process of establishing a music company for performances in Shanghai.At first glance, the tasks may seem mundane. They include hanging laundry and hammering a nail. But if completed successfully they will give the person who carries them out a greater sense of achievement.These are the tasks that have been chosen to test if artificial hands are up to doing the mundane, and if their recipients can use them efficiently. They will also bring cheer to a number of scientists.At the Rehabilitation Engineering Technology Department at the Suzhou Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, engineers and researchers are busy adjusting a myoelectric prosthetic hand. This is an externally powered artificial limb that the recipient controls with the electrical signals generated naturally by their own muscles.The Suzhou scientists hope to make it more compatible for Xu Min, who lost her right forearm in an accident in 1992. The 48-year-old woman from Suzhou, Jiangsu province, will wear the hand to compete in the arm prosthesis race tasks in the Cybathlon Challenges in February. The four tasks include hanging laundry, serving food, stacking, hammering and removing a nail."These tasks are routine and delicate, by which, I think, the organizers intend to test if the artificial hand can replicate the dexterity and functionality of a human hand," Xu says. She won a top spot at the Cybathlon Challenges in March and if she wins the contest in February, she will be more confident about entering the October global finals — Cybathlon 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. This is considered the pinnacle event in the sector.In the previous challenges, Xu was equipped with a robotic forearm prosthesis and completed the tasks — carrying bottles and sweeping up — in the shortest time with no mistakes.Started by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and held since 2016, the quadrennial event is also known as the "Olympics of assistive technologies"."Beyond the competition, it is also a technology platform for researchers to exchange ideas, a community of people committed to an inclusive and barrier-free society, a technology transferring opportunity and a public campaign. It aims to create a world without barriers for people with disabilities," Jurg Burri, ambassador of Switzerland to China, said at a promotional event for the competition in Beijing in October, which will attract 160 teams from across the world. Each team is made up of a pilot (with physical challenges) and a technology developer from a university or tech company.Xu and her team attended the event to demonstrate their latest product and how humans and machines can collaborate."The event marks the countdown to the competition, which for me, means pressure to compete with researchers and companies from home and abroad," Xu says, adding that she cannot wait to get the hand ready to start the training.Walking along the Great Wall is a once-in-a-lifetime dream for many, but Jim Spear has taken it one step further, spending the last 18 years living in a village beneath the ancient wonder."As a boy, I didn't know much about China, but I did know there was a Great Wall," says the 68-year-old, a self-taught architect from the United States. "Never did I dream back then that I would have the chance to visit it, let alone live under it."One of the symbols of China, the Great Wall is actually a series of interconnected walls that extend for a total of 21,000 kilometers, some of which are 2,000 years old.It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, a year after Spear made the most important decision of his life and moved to China.Today, along with his wife, Tang Liang, Spear calls Mutianyu village home.In this quiet place, located at the foot of the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall about 80 km from Beijing, they live with their dog in a home with a courtyard garden they renovated themselves, which includes a design studio.Spear's interest in China began during college when he took a class taught by a Chinese specialist. His fascination deepened when he met his wife-to-be, Tang, in 1980, and married her two years later.In 1986, he decided to drop out of his doctoral studies in Chinese politics at the University of California, Berkeley, and move to China to get to the heart of things."I realized that if I became a scholar of China based overseas, I wouldn't be able to experience what was happening in China," he says.He still vividly remembers the moment he stepped off the airplane, and felt an instant connection to the place he had longed to visit. "The country was wild, full of all different kinds of people," he says. "It was very vibrant."He says that it was fate that led him to settle beneath the Great Wall. In the 1990s, he and his wife discovered their future home in Mutianyu after a chance encounter with Li Fengquan, who tried to sell him a T-shirt."I'm sorry. I'm not interested in buying a souvenir today, but I have to tell you I envy you living in such a beautiful place near the Great Wall," Spear recalls telling Li."I'll help you," replied the person who would later become a lifelong friend.Within a few days, Li had helped the couple secure a long-term lease for a traditional village farmhouse and a nearby piece of land in Mutianyu.For nearly 10 years, Spear and Tang spent their weekends at this idyllic location before deciding to make it their full-time home in 2005.As an architect, Spear used his expertise to renovate his dream house, which comes with multiple views of the Great Wall."In the mist, fog, or clouds, it is always beautiful," Spear says. "Seeing the Great Wall every day reminds me of how great people here can be; when they're organized and when they have a purpose together, great things can be accomplished."Spear is more commonly known locally by his Chinese name Sa Yang. He says that "Yang" means "ocean," and symbolizes his broad-minded character.Village life can be challenging and for the 500-plus Mutianyu residents, Spear was a double foreigner — both an American and an urbanite."My starting point is that I respect the people who live in the village around me," he says.Shortly after embracing full-time village life, Spear was approached by village head Li Lianting, who explained that Mutianyu was rapidly losing residents and badly in need of local businesses.This motivated the architect to explore ways of supporting rural residents.After looking into the matter, he leased an abandoned schoolhouse and turned it into a restaurant and glass art factory to make it sustainable. He also renovated an old tile factory in Beigou, the village next to Mutianyu, and turned it into the Brickyard hotel.In recognition of his contributions, Spear was given the Great Wall Friendship Award by the Beijing government in 2014.Incorporating exposed beams, locally sourced materials like glazed tiles, elegantly arranged antiques, modern bathrooms and kitchens, Spear's design reflects a talent for fusing traditional and modern elements.Li Lianting says that the architect has helped renovate around 20 households in Mutianyu, some of which now operate as hotels or restaurants, while doing his best to preserve the original structures as much as possible.Spear's approach to his work is far from straightforward, as he has devoted considerable time to studying traditional Chinese architecture. He has explored the work of well-known architects like Liang Sicheng and has even delved into feng shui, the Chinese study of geomantic omens used to determine the auspicious location and orientation of buildings and rooms."The Great Wall inspires me in many ways to this very day," he says when asked if his architectural work draws inspiration from the imposing structure.However, he emphasizes that adopting a Great Wall style doesn't mean building fortifications, but rather that his approach involves designs that echo the wall, but don't copy it.Spear sees plenty of possibilities in China, driven by significant domestic demand and a growing emphasis on preserving historical structures."Part of my heart is in the US and always will be. But I love living here. I like China," he says. Wuhan University graduate Yang Xiaohan embarks on a transformative journey, exploring the essence of excellence through scientific pursuits, voluntary service, and a deep commitment to patriotism.Yang Xiaohan, 24, made an unusual decision upon graduation from Wuhan University, in Central China's Hubei province, last year. Although he had just been admitted to the master's program at the university's School of Geodesy and Geomatics, he decided to take a year off and to embark on a journey to Southwest China's Xizang autonomous region.It all started in Yang's freshman year when he attended a lecture delivered by the university's president at the time, Dou Xiankang, who stated, "To become an excellent individual is the epochal responsibility of Wuhan University students."This resonated deeply with Yang, a boy from Tianshui, Northwest China's Gansu province. It guided him to grasp the essence of China's higher education spirit and prompted him to contemplate the definition of "excellence".In Yang's eyes, the excellence of Wuhan University is prominently manifested in the pursuit of an exceptional scientific spirit and a daring, innovative approach to practical endeavors."When I witnessed elderly academicians lecturing with sharp minds and agile thinking on the podium, and when I learned about surveyors fearlessly collecting geographic information in challenging natural environments, I truly understood what an excellent scientific attitude entails," Yang said.Throughout his four years as an undergraduate, Yang went beyond academic pursuits. He continuously engaged in various forms of community service and cultural events, using his eyes and footsteps to broaden the boundaries and perspectives of his life."I have seen the world beyond the ivory tower and heard the voices of numerous ordinary people," he said.At the 2022 graduation ceremony of Wuhan University, Yang, speaking as the representative of the graduating class, articulated another layer of his understanding of "excellence": "An outstanding individual should also possess a deep sense of patriotism and prioritize the wellbeing of the people."A series of questions stirred within Yang: What defines China's borders? What unfolds at the grassroots? How must Chinese youth embrace contemporary responsibilities? These questions led him to momentarily halt postgraduate studies and enroll in the China's Far West Program, a venture which was initiated in 2003 and has deployed over 410,000 graduates and postgraduates to the underdeveloped western region for one to three years of volunteer service.Yang's family, teachers, and friends were all very supportive of his decision. "My graduate adviser, considering the many responsibilities I would have during the volunteer mission in Xizang, tried to minimize the research workload for me as much as possible," he said. "My family also prepared warm clothing and medication for altitude sickness for me."Before officially embarking on his journey, Yang made thorough preparations to quickly adapt to work and life in Xizang. He extensively gathered information about Xizang from online sources to better understand the local social conditions.In order to acclimate to the high-altitude environment in advance, he chose Gannan Tibetan autonomous prefecture in Gansu province, located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, as his graduation travel destination.Yang was eventually assigned to Gyirong county, situated at an altitude of over 4,100 meters. Bordering Nepal, it is in the seismic zone of the Himalayas.Upon arriving in Gyirong, Yang was struck by severe altitude sickness. The oxygen deficiency caused his fingernails to turn purple, and he found it difficult to sleep at night. In response, Yang dedicated himself to a daily 10-minute jogging routine, aiming to boost his lung capacity."My initial impression of Gyirong was remote and desolate, but as I delved deeper, I discovered that it is much more modernized than I had imagined," Yang said.On the very next day after Yang's arrival, a local outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred. Having just learned how to wear and remove protective gear the evening before, he promptly received an urgent mission: a high-risk zone village required assistance in collecting nucleic acid information."In high-altitude areas, the body undergoes significant impacts once infected. Just as everyone remained silent, a Tibetan senior cadre stepped forward. I was deeply inspired and decided to join as well," Yang recalled.On the way to the village, Yang learned that the Tibetan cadre, named Basang Tsering, had served as the Party secretary and chief procurator of the People's Procuratorate of Xizang's Ngamring county. Despite retiring for medical reasons, when the pandemic broke out, Tsering rushed to the frontline without hesitation."During the battle of pandemic prevention, working overtime and staying up late at night became our routine," Yang said. "However, Tsering never retreated, putting in as much effort as us younger folks."Yang saw the tangible embodiment of patriotism from this respected elder, reinforcing his determination to face challenges head-on and serve the people.On July 1, 2022, coinciding with the 101st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Yang participated in the cleaning and marking of the boundary monument at the border between Gyirong and Nepal under the arrangement of the Gyirong Committee Organization Department.Along the way, Yang encountered multiple challenges — being bitten several times by leeches and navigating the slippery road, which almost caused him to fall into the torrential river."This experience has given me a deeper understanding of the indelible connection between myself and this homeland," Yang said.Throughout his year of volunteer work, Yang not only gained insights into the customs and culture of Xizang but also came to understand the significance of the Party's grassroots efforts for the Tibetan people and the profound sentiments that Tibetans hold for the Communist Party of China."This year's stay in Xizang has given me a renewed perspective on 'excellence'," Yang said."Excellence lies not only in the pursuit of perfection but also in accepting flaws and imperfections. As long as we do our best, regardless of the outcome, it is progress compared to before."For Yang, the once grand and abstract responsibility has now materialized through his volunteer service, becoming small acts of kindness and perseverance in daily life."I believe that young people in China, especially those with knowledge and abilities, should strive to integrate self-realization with social development," Yang said."By doing our own job well, approaching others with empathy and compassion, and communicating with others on an equal footing, we can contribute our goodwill to society." Diverse global voices in the Youth Power series explore Shenzhen's transformative journey in China's 45-year reform and opening-up, showcasing rapid growth, inclusive policies, and global impact, Meng Wenjie reports.In 2023, China celebrated the 45th anniversary of its reform and opening-up policy. Shenzhen, the city in South China's Guangdong province, is the policy's original incubator and the first Chinese special economic zone. Transforming from a small fishing village into a modern global metropolis, it has long stood as a microcosm of China's dynamic 45-year history of implementing this policy.The latest episode of China Daily's Youth Power, titled "Gen Z's Perspective — 45 Years of Reform and Opening-Up", aired on Nov 30. In the program, eight young people from different countries converged in this legendary city to discuss the events and changes over the past 45 years.Xiong Tian, a Chinese student at Tsinghua University, was raised and educated in Shenzhen. Among the city's many marvels, she believes that the Shenzhen International Trade Centre Building stands out as the best embodiment of "Shenzhen speed". It was completed in just 37 months, setting a record in China in the 1980s by constructing one floor, spanning 1,350 square meters, in only three days."I think this place best represents the phrase 'Time is money, and efficiency is life'," Xiong said, quoting the slogan that was commonly used in the 1980s, reflecting the era's determination for economic development.Reflecting on the history of how Shenzhen was once a small village and then became the factory of the world in the 21st century, Xiong said that daring to be the first in and for the world encapsulates one of Shenzhen's key spirits.As an epitome of China's reform and opening-up policy, Shenzhen has not only witnessed the rapid development of China's economy but also the evolution of different policy phases. Diego Rodriguez, a Spanish student studying energy and power engineering at Tsinghua University, pointed out that Shenzhen is the first city globally to alter the approach in measuring city growth: shifting from GDP (gross domestic product) to GEP (gross ecosystem product)."China is prioritizing the development of the country to make growth more sustainable," said Rodriguez. "And it's doing this in various ways."Jood Sharaf, a Bulgarian student at Tsinghua University, voiced concerns about the inequality in rapid economic growth. She noted that China's coastal cities expanded considerably faster and were more engaged in international trade. As a result, talented people from other developing areas frequently relocated to these cities in search of better prospects, with western parts of the country lagging behind."But there's starting to be a reversal of this tendency," Sharaf said, highlighting that the Chinese government is implementing measures to distribute economic benefits more equitably."For example, the Belt and Road Initiative passes through the heart of underdeveloped areas. Many projects have also promoted investment and attracted young people from these areas. These individuals, who may have studied in Beijing or Shanghai, are now returning to their hometowns to work on these projects."Ye Xueying, a Hong Kong student at Wuhan University's School of Chinese Classics, shared the story of Huang Wenxiu. Huang, a graduate of Beijing Normal University, exemplifies the group of young people who pursued education in major cities but made the deliberate choice to go back to their hometowns after graduation.According to Ye, Huang returned to her native Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region in Southwest China and worked as a village Party secretary in a severely underdeveloped community. She dedicated herself to efforts aimed at alleviating poverty."People like her are a crucial part of the reform and opening-up policy," Ye said.While sharing Huang's case, she also mentioned the same slogan "Time is money, and efficiency is life", which was one of the key principles during the initial stages in Shenzhen's development."It sounds very much like utilitarianism, but it didn't end up with utilitarianism; it ends up with eliminating poverty," she said.Rodriguez echoed this sentiment. "What the reform did was seek a way for the country to develop and ensure that the resulting wealth is distributed among all of the country's people," he said.Jane Amelia Ma, an Indonesian student studying at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, believed that China's reform and opening-up policy has not only improved the lives of Chinese people but has also benefited other countries."For example, in my country Indonesia, we didn't have an advanced metro system like Shenzhen. But now we have one under construction that will connect Bandung, a city near Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, with the help of China," she said.Dylan Austin Walker, an editor based in Beijing, hails from Longmeadow, Massachusetts in the United States. He pointed out that in Springfield, a neighboring city, a Chinese company manufactures subway cars that are distributed across the country, including Boston, the capital of Massachusetts. Notably, most workers at the factory are local residents, which, according to him, exemplifies how technological advancements and industrial development in China have a positive impact on other nations."As a lot of people say, if China develops well, it benefits the world," he said. "China is not interested in exporting its way of thinking or system to other countries. But if something were to be exported, it's just this thought of allowing other countries to understand that there are other ways you can try and just respect their choice."Reflecting Walker's viewpoint, Sharaf added that the policy of reform and opening-up has not only driven the development of China and the world but has also offered successful experiences for other countries."Some African countries have developed their economic zones," she said. "This means China's policy isn't just for its own domestic economy; it's a kind of model for others to follow and it's a way of interaction instead of imposition."But economic advantages are not the only outcome of China's reform and opening-up policy; it has also nurtured an open and inclusive mindset.For example, Sharaf, an international relations major who has studied in both Western countries and China, noticed a higher degree of openness in China toward scholars and academic perspectives from various countries."Here, I learn more about Western philosophy or policies in different countries, like Africa and Asia, compared to my studies in other countries," she said.Walker agreed, referring to his own academic experiences in China. "We had a more inclusive and open type of education in our major compared to what is taught in the West," he said. "We're not only learning from the Chinese perspective but also from diverse international viewpoints in an unbiased and objective way." Wu Muliang, a compassionate photographer from rural China, transforms funeral portraits into cherished memories, bridging generations and creating a visual legacy for forgotten lives.In China, having a portrait of the deceased at the funeral holds great significance. Wu Muliang, a 24-year-old from East China's Fujian province, took on the responsibility of capturing funeral portraits for his fellow villagers.Wu embarked on this task coincidentally. He had left the village at the age of 16 and only returned last year."I switched between lots of jobs and moved around frequently. There has always been a sense of belonging that's missing," he said.Taking funeral portraits for the elders was not part of Wu's plan when he first decided to return to the village.With a background in the new media industry, Wu was originally looking to make videos centered around agriculture and rural areas — topics that were trending both on social media and at the state level. This is why he was surprised to discover that his camera gravitated toward a task more significant than he had anticipated.Raised by his grandparents until the third grade of primary school, Wu saw them only once or twice a year thereafter. "When I first came back, I could truly see how time had changed Grandma. Her back used to be as straight as a pole, and she would do farm work every day by herself," Wu said."But now her back is bent to about 90 degrees, and she often needs my assistance with farming."Wu's grandfather passed away nine years ago. At that time, the family couldn't find a proper funeral portrait for him, and it has always been a regret for the whole family.Zhang Zening, a hanfu enthusiast in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu province, embarked on an extraordinary journey eight years ago to revive this traditional Chinese attire.Inspired by ancient murals, Zhang, 41, studied the artistry of hanfu in various museums, transforming two-dimensional paintings into tangible and wearable pieces.Her extraordinary craftsmanship has not only delighted hanfu enthusiasts but also captivated the curiosity of young minds, giving them the opportunity to wear historically significant attire during museum visits.Zhang said that she firmly believed hanfu serves as a gateway into the past, allowing people to truly connect with their cultural heritage.Upon graduating from college, Zhang first worked in material research, immersing herself in the laboratory, conducting chemical experiments for the analysis of cementing raw materials. At the time, she was one of the earliest enthusiasts of hanfu in China, frequently organizing various hanfu activities in her spare time."My husband saw how passionate I was and encouraged me to turn hanfu into a career," she said. "With his support, I opened a hanfu studio with some friends and later started my own career."Now the owner of Helu Hanfu Studio, Zhang has collaborated with women's re-employment organizations, seeking full-time stay-at-home women with sewing skills. This coincided with her need for the production of hanfu.Among them were many single mothers who could earn a partial income while taking care of their children, according to Zhang.Around 2015, Zhang began to focus independently on the process of hanfu restoration. In that year, she visited Dunhuang, Northwest China's Gansu province, and was fascinated by the exquisite murals there, wondering how she could possibly materialize them into beautiful costumes. Eight years later, she managed to restore more than 50 sets."How to turn flat paintings into wearable costumes has always been a challenge," she said. "I dedicated a significant amount of time to researching clothing patterns, sourcing fabrics, and personally handling the printing and embroidery."Zhang related that hanfu restoration is a relatively niche field within the culture circle. "Not too many people work on the restoration of hanfu," she said. "While some people may specialize in hanfu of different dynasties, such as the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), I'm not limited to specific time periods, and I try to focus on restoring whatever costumes are depicted in murals."In the past decade, she has traveled to more than 10 cities across China, constantly studying murals and conducting research to restore hanfu from different dynasties. She cross-referenced different materials including various murals, other cultural relics and literature to make sure that the restoration is as accurate as possible.Thanks to her work, many young people wear restored hanfu when they visit museums, and Zhang is thrilled to see more of them doing so."Hanfu is exquisite and complex, but it's only part of the outfit. Careful attention is also needed in other details such as makeup and accessories to create a holistic look," Zhang said, adding that wearing hanfu almost automatically gives someone a "dignified posture" because of its intricate nature.Reflecting on the evolving perception of hanfu, Zhang observed that in the past, wearing it would attract attention and curious stares, but now it can often be spotted in the streets and alleys."I believe there's no need to push too hard for the adoption of hanfu in the next generation. As our national costume and a reflection of our historical culture, hanfu, when appreciated by children for its beauty, is likely to be naturally embraced and loved."Guo Jun contributed to this story.cangwei@chinadaily.com.cnFive-year-old Zhang Yucheng, the youngest competitor in the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Fifth China Taxidermy Championships, loves insects and his entry won him an award."It is a mantis with a horsehair worm emerging from its body by a lakeside," Yucheng says, adding that the tableau took him a month to finish."One of the whiskers was broken, so I replaced it with one of my mother's hairs."Although he has hundreds of insect specimens at home, Yucheng was amazed by the 400-odd pieces submitted for consideration by taxidermists and enthusiasts from all over the country. The exhibition opened on Nov 14 at the National Zoological Museum of China and will run until Feb 25."Many of contest entries are lifelike representations. The subjects have been preserved and staged to look as though they are still alive, with alert facial expressions," Zhang Jinshuo, deputy director of the museum, says.The competition is organized by the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Zoological Society, the Chinese Association of Natural Science Museums and the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens, with support from the China Wildlife Conservation Association.Mammals, insects and birds like the kingfisher, fill the sprawling hall in a frozen stampede. In one corner, a zebra mother seems to be looking at a newborn foal, and elsewhere, a wolf standing over a dead roe deer bares its teeth as a giant bear prepares to fight for it.Qian Lihuai and Joint Lab twist tradition to craft concoctions that delight visitors and institutions alike, Li Yingxue reports.In the China Pavilion at the sixth China International Import Expo in Shanghai, a piece of bamboo art resembling a Taihu Lake Stone was the center of attention.It perfectly combined traditional craftwork with natural art, and demonstrated the beauty of the "thinness, perforations, convolutions and transparency" of the stone after which it was modeled.What impressed the visitors most was that the "stone" was actually made entirely from bamboo.It was the work of Qian Lihuai, an inheritor of traditional bamboo weaving techniques, a form of intangible cultural heritage from Zhejiang province.Qian spent two months on the Taihu Lake piece. With no preexisting example to model it on, he had to start from scratch.Following tradition while still innovating, and demonstrating the evolution of this traditional art, infusing it with fresh vitality, Qian has won a number of awards, and his works have been widely collected through exhibitions at home and abroad.Rarely has anyone elevated the weaving of bamboo to such an art form, but Qian sees in the material boundless possibilities for artistic expression."I've always thought of bamboo weaving as a kind of brush to illustrate the world," he explains, adding that he has studied calligraphy and painting from an early age.On the bustling streets of Shanghai, I stumbled upon a vibrant display of culture and camaraderie that would forever shape my dance journey.It was in 2019, when I first arrived at Donghua University in Shanghai, that I discovered a local park filled with elderly people dancing in the early morning. It quickly became my favorite spot. I'd bring my coffee, and unwind while watching them enjoy the rhythm of the music. Occasionally, I'd also join and dance with them.There, no one judges you for a misstep or for not keeping up with the rhythm. You simply dance and enjoy the moment. It's fascinating to see experienced dancers leading, while newcomers observe, learn, and eventually join in, just like me.However, I'm not exactly new when it comes to dancing. My love for dance began at a very young age in Uzbekistan, where I was born and raised. Unlike some, I had no familial ties to the world of dance as my mother was a teacher, and my father was an engineer. However, my mother would fondly recall how, as a child, I'd listen to music and effortlessly move to its rhythm.When I was around 3 or 4 years old, my mother took me to a dance studio. I vividly remember my first performance, just a week after joining the studio. The stage was colossal, the audience vast, and my nerves were undeniable. Despite a momentary lapse in memory regarding the dance moves, I instinctively knew my place and how to carry on. It was a defining moment that ignited my passion for dancing and helped me set a new goal to never falter again and always strive to improve.Throughout my school years and later in college, I actively participated in various performances, exploring a wide range of dances, including traditional Uzbek dances and various other cultural dances. The Uzbek dances, such as Gulim, Lazgi, Burdam, Doboz, and Mashal, each have their own unique story and style.Among these dances, one of my favorites is the Andijan Polka, a lively Uzbek folk dance that combines fundamental, energetic movements with entertaining components. It's a dance that both children and adults adore. When I first arrived in China, I had the privilege of showcasing this dance at a cultural event for international students, introducing my culture to others. It was a compelling experience to teach and share our unique dance form, and it left a lasting impression.Later, at Donghua University, we established a dance club where students from around the world taught various dance styles, such as hip-hop, freestyle, K-pop, and more. As a passionate dancer, I eagerly joined the club, learning new dance forms and participating in university events.However, outside of campus, I often found myself wandering into the park, where I would sit and watch people dancing on the square. This communal activity transcends age and background, offering an antidote to the loneliness and physical inactivity that often accompanies aging. It was a heartwarming testament to the inclusivity and vibrancy of modern Chinese society: older people and retired people gather, not just to exercise, but to socialize and form new connections.These two worlds — the vibrant public dancing in China and the rich Uzbek dance tradition — have profoundly shaped my life and brought me boundless joy.Dancing, whether in the modern city of China or the soul of Uzbekistan, continues to be the rhythm of my life. It serves as a bridge between cultures, an expression of the human spirit, and serves as a reminder that the joy of dance transcends borders, languages, and backgrounds. In every step and movement, I find a connection to the diverse world of dance and a celebration of the universal language of joy, movement, and connection.Written by Zakirova Rimma, a master's degree student at Donghua University in Shanghai majoring in business administration. Besides dancing, she enjoys sports, blogging, and taking videos and photos. She hopes that her photos can spark joy and inspire reflection.The enduring friendship between Wang Jie and Marco Antonio Del Prado Nuñez has transcended cultural differences and shaped a decade of successful Sino-Peruvian collaboration and mutual growth.Some say that friends are the family you choose for yourself. Wang Jie chose a family thousands of miles away.Wang, 37, is the deputy general manager of the Changjiang International Engineering Co., Ltd (a subsidiary of the CISPDR Corporation) and general manager of the CISPDR Corporation's Peru branch.His bond with Marco Antonio Del Prado Nuñez, a Peruvian government official blossomed when they met 10 years ago.In 2012, the two crossed paths at a training session hosted by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China. At that time, Nuñez was in charge of water resources. Wang could speak perfect Spanish, and his company is one of the best water conservancy consultancy companies in China."I introduced him to the middle route of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project and the Three Gorges Project. He was especially interested in the former, as 80 percent of Peru's population is located along the Pacific coast, but 80 percent of the country's water resources are in the western Amazon basin," Wang said.Book sheds intriguing light on polo and its fast-growing appeal in the modern era, Li Yingxue reports.Once hailed as "the sport of kings", polo, a niche sport with ancient roots, is played on horseback with a ball. Its exact origins remain uncertain, but one early version of the equestrian sport emerged in ancient Persia (modern Iran) around the 6th century BC.Different cultures developed similar games and, over time, polo evolved into the sport we know today. It also has a deep historical connection with ancient China, as evidenced by numerous artifacts, including murals, stone carvings, mirrors and paintings.During the 1930s, the modern version of the sport enjoyed a period of popularity, with polo grounds established in cities with foreign populations like Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Qingdao, Shandong province.Polo's noble and warrior-like characteristics have won it many passionate players, among them Jackie Wang. She and her family have spent the past three years researching and writing Polo in China, a book that chronicles the lengthy history of the sport in China.Published by the Cultural Relics Press this month, the book gives a detailed introduction to polo in China, with photos of artifacts and events, and an engaging narrative that brings the sport to life.As a combination of historical reference and artistic portrayal, it serves both as scholarly work and general interest publication, contributing to the academic study of polo in China, while capturing the sport's allure through its design and presentation.Wang says it contains nearly 500 images, many of which are presented to readers for the first time."As polo lovers, our purpose in compiling this book is to show the history of polo in China in both ancient and modern times, to reflect upon the cultural connotations of 'passion, glory, bravery, elegance and team spirit' of polo, so that China's contribution to the sport becomes known to more people around the world," she says.It is said that over 2,000 years ago, a king in ancient Greece was suspicious about the purity of his gold crown. In order to learn the truth, he entrusted the crown to Archimedes, the renowned mathematician and inventor who lived between 287 and 212 BC. For a while, Archimedes was baffled by the puzzle. One day, while bathing, Archimedes was inspired by the water's overflow. He rushed out of the bath in excitement, shouting, "Eureka (I found it)! Eureka!"This marked a historic moment in the birth of the law of buoyancy, and the term "eureka moment" has come to refer to a significant discovery made in a flash of insight.Fast forward to last month's 18th "Challenge Cup" National College Student Extracurricular Academic and Technological Works Competition. Xie Haoqiang, a 22-year-old student from the School of Biomedical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, experienced his own "eureka moment".When Xie was tasked with algorithm development in a cutting-edge science project centered on noninvasive localization using surface-enhanced transmission Raman spectroscopy (SETRS), he encountered a bottleneck. After prolonged contemplation, a sudden realization dawned upon him, akin to Archimedes' moment of revelation."A solution suddenly occurred to me at that very time. I turned on the computer right away, and while I typed the code, my hands shook. At last, it demonstrated success!" Recalling that critical moment, Xie's excitement is palpable. "It was at that time that I thought of the tale of Archimedes discovering the law of buoyancy, and I believe this was my eureka moment."The 18th "Challenge Cup" took place at Guizhou University in Guiyang, Southwest China's Guizhou province, from Oct 27 to Oct 31. Ultimately, Shanghai Jiao Tong University secured the competition's highest honor, the coveted "Challenge Cup".Me, myself, marriedRecently, a captivating trend has emerged among young people in South Korea, one that transcends conventional matrimonial norms — the phenomenon of "sologamy" or "autogamy".A sologamy wedding, similar to a traditional one, involves activities such as inviting guests, donning a wedding gown and ring, and even taking a honeymoon. The sole distinction is that all of these are done by oneself.In South Korea, the deeply ingrained tradition of gift money has contributed to the rise of sologamy. It is customary to give monetary blessings to newlyweds, with amounts ranging from 50,000 won ($38) to millions of won.While the cash gift is intended as a blessing, guests are often reciprocated with a similar amount when they get married themselves.However, as the country's marriage rate hits a new low and inflation intensifies, sologamy weddings are typically seen as a way for single people to recoup the money they previously spent at the weddings of acquaintances, South Korean TV personality, and YouTuber Lee Eun-jae told The Korea Herald.Nevertheless, at the heart of the sologamy movement lies the fundamental notion of self-love.Kim Seul-ki, aged 39, organized a wedding for herself last year and declared sologamy. "Now, that questions about my marital status just naturally disappeared," she told The Korea Herald.Although some people disagree with her choice, Kim is satisfied with her life right now. "It's all about finding happiness as an individual."The 1st Student (Youth) Games of the People's Republic of China, held from Nov 5 to Nov 15 in Nanning, South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, is concluding today.The event features 39 major events, 51 sub-events, and 805 small events, showcasing popular sports on Chinese campuses such as swimming, soccer, aerobics, and unique activities like shuttlecock ball. Notably, the Games also introduce new Olympic additions such as climbing and break dancing.Scaling heightsClimbing, which entered the Olympics two years ago in Tokyo, will also be featured in the 2024 Paris Olympics.It is a relatively "young" sport in China, and climbing centers across the country have been actively recruiting and training future athletes in recent years.Li Yantan, 15, was scouted in the fourth grade of primary school. "I've never heard of climbing where I grew up. I was curious."Unlike many first-time climbers, Li wasn't afraid of heights during her tryout. "I guess I was meant to become a climber."She participated in both speed climbing and boulder & lead during the Student Games.Boulder & lead combines bouldering and lead climbing while speed climbing involves a straight and fast ascent along a standard route to the 15-meter top. However, the Student Games introduced an additional challenge with a "random course" speed contest, featuring routes that the athletes had never seen before. This added an extra layer of difficulty to the competition."It really tests our abilities to plan and move quickly," Li said. "Also, I've only recently started training in speed climbing. I used to focus only on boulder & lead."Despite her worries, Li secured first place in girls' speed climbing.Ma Xueying, 15, won a silver medal for girls' speed climbing."My parents have always been supportive, but some of my friends were a little upset because they felt that they lost a friend since I started spending more time training," she said. "However, I never regret my decision of choosing this path, and it has already become a part of my life."For the boys' speed climbing champion, He Xin, the situation was the other way around."I was scouted at school back in 2018. But my parents weren't very supportive at first. They were worried that climbing would affect my grades. But my classmates all thought it was pretty cool as most of them didn't even know about the sport," he explained.His original motivation was to prove himself to his parents, a goal he achieved through the numerous medals and trophies he has won. Now, he is motivated by his passion for this sport.Huang Junning, 13, won second place for boys' speed climbing, and similar to Ma, Huang's parents encouraged him, but some relatives doubted the viability of a career in climbing. "I've never been swayed by others' thoughts," he said. "I have a genuine passion for climbing and thrive on challenging myself."Huang and He train on the same team and share a close friendship in life. "During training and contests, we compete against each other. But when we're not competing, we are best friends and often play pool together," He said.Huang's goal for the next contest is to secure first place. "It's not about beating He, even though he won the gold medal this time — it's about challenging myself and improving."Similar to Huang's relatives, Li has also observed that many people unfamiliar with climbing perceive it as a dangerous sport. "The truth is, as long as you go to a proper place that follows safety protocols, it's definitely a rewarding sport."Breaking groundIn December 2020, the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee declared break dancing, or breaking, as an official event of the 2024 Paris Olympics. This once-niche street dance has now come into the public spotlight.Break dancing consists of moves comprising footwork, freeze, and power move, including rapid foot movements, handstands, and astounding head spins, contributing to the sport's strong visual impact."I began learning break dance when I was 8. Many kids start at the age of 3 or 4 these days," said Qi Xiangyu, 18, the break dancing champion of this year's boys' competition.Although breaking originated in the 1970s, it only recently became an Olympic event and is now considered a sport by the public."People see us not just as dancers but as athletes now," Qi said. "Our contests follow the standards of the Olympics, and there are higher requirements in terms of our physical strength and the number of moves."Guo Pu, the champion in the girls' breaking competition, also started at a young age. "I began when I was 7. At first, my grandmother thought break dancing was indecent for a girl and it would affect my grades," Guo said.However, a turning point occurred when Guo achieved 6th place in the National Games of the People's Republic of China in 2021.This accomplishment successfully changed her grandmother's perspective.Breaking contests follow a three-round format, consisting of one-on-one "battles" set to music randomly played by the DJ. Each participant is granted a 60-second window to showcase their freestyle prowess, and the computer determines their order, initiating with the red side, succeeded by the blue side."For the red side, the music has just started, leaving them with scant knowledge of the beat. The blue side enjoys an advantage, with additional time for analysis and warm-up," Qi explained.In fact, during Guo's pursuit of the top spot, she found herself on the red side. "Going first might be a disadvantage for most people, but I wasn't too stressed about it because I'm adept at arranging moves."Both champions mentioned their strength in interpreting and decoding the music, an element hard to cultivate in a short period.Qi shared a personal tip that was effective in helping him achieve success: "I would always study the past performances of my adversaries. You could quickly pick up their strong suits and perhaps discover their disadvantages. If you have an idea of their capabilities, you'll know when to use your 'killer moves'. Save them for your strongest competition."In break dancing contests, whether underground or official, many dancers wear hats. Qi explained that, most of the time, it's simply because they are used to it."During contests, we always dress the same as during practices," Guo said. "I'm used to wearing hats for both the looks and practical usage. Sometimes, when the floor is coarse, I wear hats made from smooth material to reduce friction."Qi, a seasoned competitor in numerous contests, finds that the more he competes, the less nervous he becomes. "Winning the bronze medal at this year's Asian Games is probably the reason why many people recognized me and cheered for me. Competing at the Student Games was truly enjoyable," he said, adding that his current goal is to compete in the Olympics.Guo, sharing a similar sentiment, believes that with accumulating experience, she can enjoy the games even more. "The grand stage at the Student Games was a delight," Guo said. "I always remind myself to stay calm and dance on. This is a message I want to share with fellow B-boys and B-girls.""There's never a limit to break dancing. You're always exploring and innovating," Qi said. "My parents have instilled in me that persistence is everything. Achieving excellence in one thing through continuous effort is truly amazing."Skating to victoryAlthough freestyle roller skating hasn't become an Olympic event, its popularity has been growing in recent years. It consists of two subevents: speed slalom and freestyle slalom.In speed slalom, athletes must navigate through a row of fixed number of standard pylons at their fastest speed on a single foot. Each pair of pylons is 80 centimeters apart, covering a total distance of 28 meters with a 12-meter run-up and 18 meters of pylons. In freestyle slalom, athletes combine dancing and navigating pylons, typically performing a two-minute piece with music and costumes.Li Jiarui, 18, won the gold medal for boys' speed slalom. Having roller-skated for about 10 years, he began with simple downhill skating. "I used to train for freestyle slalom. I switched to speed slalom in 2019 when I discovered that it's a better fit for me."According to Li, freestyle slalom demands stronger endurance and more years of training, while speed slalom requires more bursts of power but less preparation time for competition.At the age of 13, Zhao Ziyu secured fourth place in girls' speed slalom. Inspired by her younger sister's training in freestyle slalom, she developed an interest in roller skating in 2020."I enjoy challenging and overcoming myself, and the sense of accomplishment motivates me."Despite the growing popularity of roller skating, misconceptions still persist. "It's not as dangerous as many may think. With a little practice, you could even wear roller skates while climbing stairs," Zhao said.Li also noted that there are still some stereotypes to overcome, emphasizing that it's not just a neighborhood pastime but a highly competitive sport.For Li, his short-term goal is to win a medal at next year's World Championship, with a long-term aspiration to become a certified coach and referee."The human limit for speed slalom has not been reached. There's still a lot of room for me to grow and break through." I did not come from a wealthy background. My mother (a single mother who raised 6 children with love and courage) wanted me to have a secure future, so she spent a lot of money to send me to the UK, where I learned to be a professional secretary.Then, I backed to Hong Kong and worked as a secretary.But I had a problem: I could not concentrate on paperwork.It was a serious issue and I sought medical help. The doctor diagnosed me with ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and these problems are not due to defiance or lack of comprehension).I felt like my world was falling apart. How could I make a living with this condition? How could I meet my family's expectations？When I was fired from three different offices, I lost all my self-respect.With nothing left to lose, I decided to use my savings and open a small restaurant.As kitchen is the only place to gain back my self-esteem.I love cooking, however, I was not trained as a chef.But I was very lucky. Many famous chefs were kind enough to share their cooking secrets with me wholeheartedly.They saw something in me: a fearless middle-aged woman.My cooking skills improved a lot with their help and the my business started to pick up.I became kind of famous as CNN named ChoyChoy Kitchen as one of the Best Private Kitchen in Hong KongBusiness was good and I gained back my focus and self-respect in my kitchen in Hong Kong.I tried to find a professional partner who could fully utilize my brand and my creativity.I moved to Tokyo and opened a restaurant with my partner.However, the covid pandemic hit, restaurant business suffered. And we ended the partnership.I bought a small house in Aobadai, Meguro and began to run my own restaurant.The restaurant was really small and could serve only 4 guests. I served only authentic Chinese Cuisine with high-end food ingredients.The price of my cuisine seems high. However, the cost of high-end ingredients in Japan was high too and the profit margin was unexpectedly low.Although the profit was not as expected, I feel a profound joy that fills my entire being whenever guests appreciate authentic Chinese Cuisine.Whenever I got a compliment about authentic Chinese cuisine, I feel like destiny chose me to spread the gospel of real Chinese Cuisine in Japan.Introducing the authentic Chinese Cuisine to Japanese is a challenging mission. As most of the Chinese Cuisine in Japan is adapted to the local preferences and tastes and therefore most Japanese have never experienced the true flavors of China's diverse regions and dishes.Although mission sounds difficult, I will try my best.Click here to enjoy Grace's recipes. On Monday, a Health Eaves Project salon on managing health issues of one's own family was held in Beijing, bringing together celebrities, experts, and opinion leaders from the fields of film, fashion, culture, design, health and medicine to be engaged with discussions on family health management from four dimensions: self-care, pet care, elderly care, and parenting.The Health Eaves Project encourages the public to "pursue health as they would pursue wealth", becoming the "chief health officers", or "eaves of health" for their households.The participants believe loving and taking good care of oneself is the prerequisite for managing family health. Moreover, when it comes to children, the elderly and pets, different management is needed based on their individual characteristics.Actress Li Fei'er says that the current young generation, which has become the backbone of the family structure, has taken on the responsibility of being the "chief health officers" of their families. And "being prepared" means that they need to actively manage family health in a long-term and comprehensive manner, shifting from passively treating illness to proactively taking preventive measures.Actress Tao Xinran adds that managing health within the family unit and promoting family health through good lifestyle is a lower-cost and more effective shortcut to good health.HANGZHOU — Sitting in her cozy apartment, 86-year-old Zhou Jihua gently touched the sleek black wristband on her arm. "This little device has helped me a lot," she says.When she fainted earlier this year, a simple press of the red SOS button on her wristband summoned help to her door within minutes.The smart wristband is part of a decadeslong journey at the Cuiyuan No 1 Community, a neighborhood in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, to improve the lives of elderly residents.In 2002, the community took the first steps toward supporting its senior residents with charmingly low-tech solutions. Volunteers partnered with elderly people living alone, and gave them yellow ribbons and small red lights.If they needed help, mostly simple things like changing light bulbs, the seniors could hang the yellow ribbon on the balcony during the day, or use the red light at night, Zhou says. She was a volunteer herself after retirement, routinely patrolling the neighborhood and knocking on doors to offer help.In 2016, a full-coverage surveillance camera system was introduced in the neighborhood, enabling staff to identify emergencies in public areas.Today, smart wristbands distributed to more than 2,200 seniors aged 60 and over represent the latest iteration of this care system. The devices, which have an SOS button and health monitoring capabilities, connect directly to a 24-hour community monitoring center and emergency contacts. They also track vital signs and alert medical personnel in case of anomalies."Our commitment to caring for the elderly has been consistent, but our methods have evolved with technology. From yellow ribbons to smart wristbands, we've come a long way," says Xiang Feifei, Party chief of the community.This dedication mirrors the country's efforts to improve elderly care services. With more than 290 million people aged 60 and over at the end of last year — over 21 percent of the population — China faces pressing challenges in meeting the needs of its seniors.A Ministry of Civil Affairs survey revealed that 22.1 percent of elderly individuals require meal assistance services, making it a critical aspect of home-based care. In response, the ministry, in tandem with other government bodies, released an action plan in October to significantly increase the coverage of meal assistance services across the country by the end of 2025.The Cuiyuan No 1 Community has been at the forefront of this initiative. In 2003, it set up Zhejiang's first senior canteen, which has undergone three major upgrades over the years. Today, it covers 220 square meters and accommodates around 50 diners, and offers a variety of affordable meal options. The canteen now has a smart digital system that provides personalized meal recommendations based on individual health needs."I've seen the community's dedication in the changes to the canteen," says Chen Quanfu, who has dined there every day for over 15 years.Earlier this month, some 300 measures were unveiled at a key Communist Party of China leadership plenum to push for deeper reform, pledging to develop community-based facilities to improve the supply of basic elderly care services."Our goal has always been to address the most immediate concerns of our senior residents," Xiang says. "We're constantly looking for ways to improve their quality of life."XinhuaFamily-based treatment is at the core of recovery from eating disorders, as parents of sufferers must learn how to teach their children to eat properly and doctors find that family plays a role in triggering the diseases.In some cases, adolescent sufferers have lived under the tight control of their parents for years and some were abused during childhood, experts say."For example, if children have long been living in families that leave little room for their own identity or autonomy, they may rebel when reaching puberty," says Chen Jue, director of the Eating Disorders Treatment Center of Shanghai Mental Health Center."Unable to rebel in other ways, they find they can control whether or not they eat. Eating becomes their biggest resistance and they turn the disease into a fight with their parents," she says.Exhibition puts spotlight on psychology, societal pressures, and pains of the relatives to raise public awareness, Zhou Wenting reports.For most people, food is a source of nourishment and pleasure, but for a certain group of individuals, it becomes at worst a matter of life or death. For these individuals, when asked to use clay to represent what food is in their minds, many of the pieces they make are messy and distorted in color and shape.The shapes mirror their mixed feelings toward food and are conflicted by strong dependence and resistance and boundless longing and fear.Putting a focus on eating disorders, an exhibition at the Shanghai Mental Health Center has been displaying the drawings and clay works of eating disorder sufferers they made as art therapy during hospitalization. The exhibit also includes works created by artists currently or previously afflicted by the diseases.Chen Jue, director of the Eating Disorders Treatment Center of SMHC, says that there is still much misunderstanding by the public toward eating disorders. "People may simply perceive such patients as those who don't eat well, make a fuss about diets, go to extremes in losing weight and have poor self-control."However, eating disorders are physiological disorders that are closely related to psychological factors. Although they manifest as eating-related behavioral problems, there are complex mental health problems behind them," says Chen from the center established in 2017, the first one specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders in China.The exhibition aims to help the public better understand the diseases and patients to show more tolerance and care, she says.More than a diet issueExperts explained that eating disorders are a group of psychiatric disorders characterized by abnormal eating behaviors and psychological disturbances accompanied by significant weight changes and challenges in physical and social functioning.Eating disorders mainly include anorexia, bulimia and binge eating. Eating disorders are more common in adolescents and young women, with anorexia having a mortality rate of 5 to 20 percent, making it one of the most life-threatening diseases in the psychiatric field.Anorexia usually includes a low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight and an unrealistic self-image. Anorexia often involves using extreme efforts to control weight and body shape, which may lead to systemic multiorgan complications caused by malnutrition that seriously affect normal life."Some patients even suffer from body dysmorphic disorder, characterized by inappropriate self-awareness of their body shape," she says. "A classical cartoon about the disorder depicts a slender person standing in front of a mirror who sees an obese body. So in their minds, they think that they're not slim and need to lose weight."Some anorexia may develop into bulimia — bingeing, or eating a large amount of food in a short time, then, due to guilt, purging to get rid of calories. Purging can include vomiting, excessive exercising, not eating for a period of time, or other methods, such as taking laxatives."Families of such patients are in pain. They either eat too much or nothing and are out of control. Eating topics can throw families into turmoil and every meal turns the home into a battlefield," says Chen.Women and young patientsThe number of female patients suffering from eating disorders is universally far higher than their male counterparts. Chen says the ratio of female to male sufferers is larger than 10 to 1 in China."I believe a main factor is that social culture puts more pressure on women in terms of anxiety about appearance. It seems that women with pretty faces and slim figures are more likely to succeed. Therefore, some college students start losing weight in preparation for job interviews," says Chen.A 19-year-old woman who finally ended her two-year fight with anorexia says that she believes the fact that female patients outnumber males is a result of societal expectations."One reason that I finally conquered the disease was that I became aware that the idea of thinness and weight instilled in women is detrimental to my health and how painful and difficult it would be to live with a body like that. But for many going through puberty, to conform to such standards of beauty becomes unshakable. I hope to help more women overcome these concepts," says the woman, using the alias Lam.TV screens convey the message that celebrities are slim without exception to the public and nowadays new media, including short videos, accelerates the spread of such social pressures.The international medical society acknowledges that people between 13 and 20 years old are the most affected by anorexia. But Chen says her youngest patient is only 7 and it is not rare to see patients as young as 11 or 12.Kids with self-esteemIn 2022, as high as 77 percent of anorexia patients hospitalized at the Eating Disorders Treatment Center of SMHC were younger than 18, according to the center's statistics."Children nowadays are exposed to the internet world at an early age. People tend to beautify their photos before sharing them online and part of the process makes their faces and bodies slimmer," says Chen."Also, they will hear adults talking about going on diets and losing weight quite often. Gradually, they'll form a concept that a slim body shape means beauty, attention and self-discipline," she says, adding that extreme cases include some who lived on water for a week and fainted due to low blood sugar at school.Doctors say that looking at personalities, anorexia and bulimia sufferers are usually demanding of themselves in many ways, which can lead to an extreme pursuit of a certain body shape, with a strong determination to achieve that goal."However, they also suffer from low self-esteem. The more inferior they feel about themselves, the more they will base their worth on things like body shape and weight because they think these can be controlled. When they lose a little weight, they may get the so-called praise of people, which helps them feel good," says Chen.If hospitalized, eating disorder patients typically need to stay in the hospital for four to six weeks. Doctors will inform them that the behaviors are very harmful to their health and will stimulate their motivation for cooperation. Some patients, especially bulimia sufferers, become cooperative as they feel tortured by such a way of life.Goodwill from strangersThe exhibition is beginning to harvest goodwill from the public. Some among the audience share their feelings in the message book at the center or online. Many people leave messages, hoping the sufferers can recover from the diseases soon and feel better. Some also encourage them to be healthy and never give up."The gallery allowed me to learn for the first time that patients with eating disorders are suppressing a lot of emotions and enduring hardships. I feel that they are very brave for fighting against the diseases," reads a message in the message book.Zhang Qinwen, who participated in designing the exhibition and was once a patient for years herself, hopes the public can understand the essence of eating disorders through the form of art, but not ignore the pain due to the artistic expressions."What I want to say the most is to tell sufferers of eating disorders that everybody deserves love. And I hope that every bite they eat, they can taste happiness," says Zhang, who shared her personal experience of conquering anorexia online in 2019, and encouraged many.Contact the writer at zhouwenting@chinadaily.com.cnOver 70 delegates from tourism associations and industry stakeholders convened at the China Mountain Sports Partners Meeting in Beijing on July 11. Among them were representatives from the Sichuan and Chengdu sports bureaus, the China Tourism Association, Trip.com Group, CYTS, and the China Adventure Association, engaging in discussions on advancing the mountain outdoor sports sector.The conference was presided over by the Pengzhou government.As the temperature rises, it is a good time to enjoy some green tea. Apart from well-known green teas, such as Longjing and Maofeng, a new bred green tea named Golden Shoot is worth a try.It is the only yellow variant tea in the Chinese tea family after decades of exploration and breeding since the 1990s.Due to its low yield, excellent quality, and high price akin to gold, it has earned the nickname "Golden Shoot". Furthermore, because of its rarity, cultivation challenges, and high maintenance costs, "Golden Shoot" is hailed as the "giant panda of tea"."Golden Shoot" stands out for its high content of tea amino acids, reportedly three to five times that of other tea varieties. With an impressive amino acid content of 9 percent, compared to the usual 3-4 percent in regular tea and 5-7 percent in white tea, Golden Shoot is a remarkable discovery.While parents and educators worry that children have been doing too little exercise, a sixth grade class from the Chaoyang School of the High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China in Beijing finished their 100th 5-kilometer morning jogging program on Saturday to celebrate their upcoming graduation.Starting in September 2021, under the organization of the class' parents association, the students embarked on their initial run in the Olympic Forest Park in northern Beijing.To enhance their physical fitness, perseverance and endurance, the program is organized every Saturday morning with the guidance of a parent who is selected to be the coach.Their first run proved that the beginning is always the hardest. After running for hundreds of meters, some students felt shortness of breath or nausea, while some couldn't continue at the midway stage and had to lean on each other for support to reach the finish line. Despite the challenges, their efforts have never ceased over the past three years.National surveys have shown a rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents across the country.According to data released at the 10th China Obesity Science Conference held in the capital last month, one in five people aged 6 to 17 is overweight or obese, up from one in 20 in 1995.The Asian Winter Games in Harbin, capital of Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, may seem a distant prospect as most parts of China are basking in sunshine and rising temperatures. A far cry from the chilly blasts of winter, however, even in this climate, an "alternative ice sports" from Europe is gaining popularity.The story has an unlikely beginning in 2002 when physical education teacher Chen Xin, then 27, stepped into a Swedish sports club in Shanghai.The Shanghai International Studies University teacher had felt there was a significant decline in students' enthusiasm for sports and wanted to find out about activities that might appeal to young people.At the club, Chen witnessed a spirited game — amid towering Swedish athletes, a petite girl held her own, moving about her competitors with fervor and determination and using her small stature swiftly and effectively in defense and offense.It was Chen's first encounter with floorball, and she found it exhilarating, engaging and, more importantly, safe and easy to grasp."That's the sport I'd been searching for," Chen recalls.Floorball, also known as indoor bandy, is a type of floor hockey with each team consisting of five players and a goalkeeper wielding sticks with plastic netting in place of blades. The ball is also plastic and has holes.A carnival, as part of the 6th Myasthenia Gravis Conference, took place in Beijing on Friday to share inspiring narratives of individuals living with myasthenia gravis, leading up to Myasthenia Gravis Care Day on Saturday.Organized by the Aili Myasthenia Gravis Care Center, the conference united nearly 200 patients and over 110 medical professionals in Beijing to raise awareness about the disease and its impact on individuals.Myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune condition affecting anyone, often hinders patients' ability to see clearly, make facial expressions, use their hands and feet, and perform various simple tasks.During the carnival, myasthenia gravis patients and volunteers staged a series of captivating performances.For instance, Li Caifang, a patient from Qitaihe, Heilongjiang province, and a community care worker, delivered a stand-up comedy act. Through humor, she shared her challenges and experiences with myasthenia gravis, showcasing the patients' optimism and resilience in a lighthearted and engaging setting.Actor Lin Jinglai led a group of patients in reciting the poem Be the Best of Yourself. This simple yet impactful performance conveyed the patients' pursuit of self-worth and self-affirmation to the audience."I never expected to not only have my eyes saved, but also continue to save lives in the operating room," said an anesthesiologist surnamed Cheng in Chongqing municipality. After being diagnosed with ocular melanoma, Cheng feared that he would lose his eyes.The removal of eyeballs is a common method for treating intraocular tumors. However, Wei Wenbin, from the Beijing Tongren Hospital, broke the tradition by pioneering the use of partial excision and radiotherapy in China.When Wei informed Cheng that both his life and eyes could be saved, he realized that his fate could be altered.As a leading unit of the national technical guidance group for blindness prevention and a World Health Organization collaboration center for the prevention of blindness, the Beijing Tongren Hospital has made a series of breakthroughs in recent years.These include offering an easier and more widely applicable treatment for ocular melanoma and advocating for the establishment of an infectious eye disease diagnosis and treatment center in Beijing to address eye diseases in patients with liver disease, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious diseases. It also pioneered the establishment of a diagnosis and treatment platform for intraocular tumors, and a screening center for pediatric eye tumors.These breakthroughs at the hospital represent China's efforts to prevent and treat blindness on a larger scale.Since the 1980s, the country has implemented plans for blindness prevention and treatment.In 2014, it successfully eliminated blinding trachoma, which used to be the leading cause of blindness in the country. After years of efforts, some medical institutions have reached the same level in vision restoration cataract surgery as developed countries.By the end of 2020, China had achieved a standardized age-specific prevalence of blindness lower than the global average and had made significant progress in eliminating avoidable blindness.However, it is still among the countries that face the highest number of blind and visually impaired patients. The issue of inadequate and uneven distribution of quality medical resources in ophthalmology persists.Xu Xun, director of the National Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, highlighted the changing spectrum of eye diseases in China.There is an increasing severity of eye problems caused by metabolic diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and hypertensive retinopathy, Xu said.In 2022, retinal fundus diseases were included as key focus diseases in the national eye health plan for the first time. Xu emphasized that a comprehensive and systematic focus on retinal fundus diseases plays a crucial role in raising public awareness and enhancing China's capacity to prevent and treat such diseases.At present, the number of retinal fundus disease patients in the country is estimated to exceed 40 million, and there are only around 5,000 specialized doctors to cater to their needs.While the absolute number of specialized doctors in retinal fundus diseases is not insignificant, it remains relatively small compared to the increasing demand from patients, Xu said.To address the problem, the National Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases and related associations have established standardized retinal fundus disease diagnosis and treatment processes and scientific management models for chronic retinal diseases in over 1,000 medical institutions nationwide."We need to further promote innovation in retinal fundus disease diagnosis and treatment management models, conduct precise early screening, and enhance comprehensive disease management," Xu said.In 2019, I attempted to close the Moments function on WeChat.Then one morning, just as I settled into my office routine, waiting for my computer to boot up, I absent-mindedly opened Moments. As usual, I scrolled through a barrage of advertisements for a few pages, finding it rather dull.So, I closed it.It wasn't just the ads. I felt there were too many people posting in Moments, many of whom I didn't really care about or want to keep up with.In the following days, my phone often found itself scanning, as the Scan function had replaced Moments at the app page. Unconsciously, my finger swiped the phone screen, opened WeChat, tapped on the place which used to be the Moments, relying solely on muscle memory. It took a few seconds for my brain to register what had just happened. By the fourth day, my finger had "forgotten" about Moments.Recently, I've been practicing with a friend to control our usage of Xiaohongshu, or Little Red Book (a social media platform). After being constantly bombarded with a kind of information flow, I realized I had been using it for quite a while, feeling physically uncomfortable and dizzy.Instead, I prefer to seek out content on the apps rather than what is pushed to me. I actively search for what I want to see. On Weibo (a micro blog), I only check updates from my friends and people I follow, and the news. I choose what I want to follow, rather than passively accepting information.After closing the Moments function, I hesitated for a moment, fearing I might miss out on information, which, in reality, did not happen. But there was an unexpected incident.On my parents' 30th wedding anniversary, my mother posted on Moments. It wasn't until I saw a screenshot in the family chat group that I remembered it.It's challenging to explain to my parents why I turned off Moments and why I missed that message. So, I clicked into my mom's Moments and gave her a like.Shao Wan spoke with Zhang Yi.Shao Wan, 33, hails from Hangzhou and works in the advertising industry.Every so often, 31-year-old Chen Jiawen, a product designer at a technology company in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, sets aside a day for herself called Unplug Day. On this day, she disconnects from the digital world and focuses on real-life experiences.In the morning, she prepares breakfast for herself while listening to music. In the afternoon, she strolls through the park with friends and in the evening, they enjoy a meal together without touching their phones, engaged in deep conversation. Upon returning home, she spends the evening reading. Throughout this day, she only connects to the internet twice: once for navigation and once to coordinate with friends."Occasionally disconnecting from the network is like feeding the brain a day of vegetarian food," Chen said.Unplug Day is part of her plan to combat information overload from excessive phone use and to rebuild her focus. In addition to this, she has started substituting short videos with longer ones and prioritizes reading in-depth news articles or books.Chen started the plan as she often felt "disrupted" by technology, citing moments of distraction like pop-up notifications, ring tones and persistent alerts leading her to check for new messages, and feelings of information overload."If my Apple Watch has the WeChat notification feature enabled, I feel like it's akin to electronic shackles because the moment I see someone's message, I feel compelled to reply immediately," she said."When friends gather and everyone is glued to their phones, it makes me uncomfortable," Chen said, adding that immersing herself in social media prevented her from completing planned tasks, leading to psychological burdens and a diminished focus.Nonsurgical cosmetic procedures will burgeon into a new growth opportunity for China's medical aesthetics industry, with noninvasive aesthetic techniques increasingly favored by beauty enthusiasts amid advanced regulations, said experts."Consumption of nonsurgical aesthetic treatments, which are characterized by high-level safety, short recovery time, low risk and affordable prices, has continued to rise despite lingering COVID-19 impact," said Jin Xing, chairman and CEO of SoYoung, an online cosmetic treatment platform.The sector, Jin said, will continue to dominate the medical aesthetics market this year, with skin management and anti-aging being the two largest segments in terms of demand.According to the latest SoYoung data, by 2030, the market size of China's nonsurgical medical aesthetics sector is expected to reach 415.7 billion yuan ($57.4 billion), nearly double the market size of surgical medical aesthetics.Specifically, injectable procedures such as botulinum toxin — sometimes referred to as Botox by patients — products, hyaluronic acid fillers, radio frequency and light therapy like Thermage and Ultherapy, and intense pulsed light (IPL) technologies are gaining traction in the field of nonsurgical treatment, said a report from SoYoung."For example, radio frequency and light therapy can penetrate deeper layers of skin tissue to help lift, smooth and rejuvenate the skin without surgery or extensive downtime, yielding significant aesthetic enhancements," said Wang Zhongjie, director of Beijing-based cosmetic surgery chain BeauCare Clinics and T.Mei BeauCare Clinic."Nonsurgical methods have offered me alternatives with greater flexibility, minimal trauma, shorter recovery time and lower risks compared to traditional surgical procedures," said a Beijing-based consumer surnamed Chen, who recently underwent IPL treatment."I've been a 'surgery-phobe' and I'd still definitely opt for noninvasive measures for cosmetic improvements in the future, if necessary, because I believe them to be much safer," Chen said.With the aforementioned advantages, the nonsurgical sector is gaining the upper hand in the overall medical aesthetics market.Globally, surgical procedures accounted for 44.3 percent of the total in 2022, while nonsurgical procedures accounted for 55.7 percent, according to a report from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery released in September last year.As the platform economy thrives in the Chinese market, online orders for cosmetic procedures also seem to be dominated by nonsurgical ones. According to a November 2023 report from the Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, nonsurgical orders accounted for 84 percent of the online total in 2022, rising from 62 percent in 2017.However, while emerging trends such as social media and livestreaming have broken down information barriers, forming a close connection between the platform economy and the growth of cosmetic treatment, there are also growing concerns about the industry's over-reliance on digital marketing for customer acquisition."Some medical aesthetics institutions are leveraging livestreaming to promote their services with attractive prices. This seems to be unreasonable to me because consumers, who lack necessary professional knowledge, may place orders before consulting a doctor, which could prove risky even if they do so for nonsurgical treatment," Chen, the cosmetic procedure consumer, said.In pursuit of growth, some market entities focus more on brand promotion and sales, with doctors "merely delivering hyaluronic acid products" and having lower participation in the entire diagnosis and treatment process, which is not conducive to the long-term healthy development of the nonsurgical cosmetic sector, said Li Bin, founder and chairman of BeauCare Clinics Medical Investment Group Co Ltd.Li said: "Especially in the cosmetic injection sector, with the increasing richness of upstream products, the emergence of new materials and technologies may slow down, leading to a greater emphasis on the comprehensive use of existing materials."This important market change will further test doctors' skills and expertise in delivering safe and effective treatments, and the importance of doctors in the entire industry chain will be further strengthened."With the medical aesthetics industry pursuing high-quality development, China is stepping up efforts to advance relevant supervision and regulations. In May 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation and 10 other departments jointly issued guidance on further strengthening the supervision of the medical aesthetics industry. The document clearly defined medical aesthetics services as a kind of medical activity, and stressed higher-level standards for the regulation of the industry."Moving forward, the industry is expected to see the rise of more standardized medical aesthetic institutions, with a focus on professional and advanced medical prowess to deliver high-quality services and drive sustainable growth," said Jing Xuan, vice-secretary-general of the Chinese Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.China's medical aesthetics industry is undergoing quality upgrades and embarking on the path of high-quality development, with consumers increasingly pursuing self-improvement amid intensified industry competition and heightened regulatory efforts, officials and industry experts said.When China rolled out its reform and opening-up policies in the late 1970s, the domestic medical aesthetics industry sprouted to ride the era of liberalization, gradually evolving into a dynamic landscape characterized by rapid growth and expansion. It is now on the threshold of another new stage — high-quality development driven by medical expertise and prowess, said Li Bin, founder and chairman of BeauCare Clinics Medical Investment Group Co Ltd.Sun Lijian, director of the Financial Research Center at Fudan University, said in an earlier interview that as the fundamentals of China's long-term sound growth remain unchanged, the current focus should be on boosting market confidence and exploring new growth drivers, where the medical aesthetics industry — a prime example of new consumption trends — has a role to play.Potential unleashed"Owing to improved life quality, development of the industry and rising awareness of consumer demand for beauty enhancement, consumption of services of the medical aesthetics industry has increased strongly, transforming what was once a niche sector for high-income groups into a mainstream business," Li said.With revenue reaching 200 billion yuan ($27.6 billion), China's medical aesthetics market expanded by 20 percent in 2023, with the compound annual growth rate expected to be 15 percent in the next four years, thanks to the resilience of the country's economy and growing demand for medical aesthetics, said a report from Deloitte last year.In addition, China's huge consumer base and relatively low penetration rate are expected to further unleash the potential of the industry. According to online cosmetic treatment platform SoYoung, the consumer base for medical aesthetics in China reached 23.54 million in 2023.Although the Chinese medical aesthetics market's penetration rate rose to 4.5 percent in 2022 from 3.6 percent in 2019, it still lags behind more developed markets such as Japan, the United States and South Korea, whose penetration rates were 2.5 times, 3.8 times and 4.9 times that of China, respectively, indicating significant room for further development in the future, said Dongguan Securities in a report.As the summer heat approaches, "losing weight" has become a top priority for many. But a new fad diet called the "life-sustaining meal" is sparking debate over its effectiveness and health risks.The diet, characterized by its focus on convenience, speed, and extreme simplicity, involves meals like apples with coffee, boiled corn with eggs, or a box of raw lettuce. While some, like office worker Liu Xiao, find it appealing for its time-saving and weight-loss potential, experts warn that it's not suitable as a long-term dietary approach, according to a report from Red Star News.Liu, a resident of Chengdu, Sichuan province, who had been following the diet for over a month, claimed to have lost 4 kilograms by eating bananas with soy milk for lunch and vegetables or shredded cabbage with sauce for dinner. She said it allowed her to maintain her body functions while saving time and effort.Others, like Dong Yi, who works in e-commerce, adapted the diet for fitness purposes, using meals of corn, tomatoes, cucumber, and boiled eggs to support muscle gain.The "life-sustaining meal" has gained traction on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu, where related posts reach 60,000, and Weibo, with related topics exceeding 100 million views.However, Liang Qingyue, a nutritionist at the Chengdu Seventh People's Hospital, expressed concerns about its long-term health risks.She pointed out that the low calories and limited nutritional elements in this diet can lead to various health problems like decreased metabolism, weakened immunity, increased susceptibility to colds, hair loss, and insomnia. The lack of carbohydrates can negatively affect brain function, leading to fatigue and reduced productivity.Furthermore, the diet's emphasis on raw and cold food may lead to vitamin deficiencies, as fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, and E are better absorbed after being processed.Liang recommended alternative approaches for weight loss, including incorporating whole grains like corn, potatoes, and purple sweet potatoes into the diet, opting for cooking methods like steaming or boiling, and adjusting the meal order by prioritizing vegetables over carbohydrates.While the "life-sustaining meal" may offer short-term benefits in terms of convenience and weight loss, its potential health drawbacks cannot be ignored. Individuals considering this approach should consult with healthcare professionals to ensure a safe and balanced dietary plan, she said.GUIYANG — Zhao Xinling likes to tell her son, whom she affectionately calls Hao Hao, one particular story. At bedtime, a little hare asks a big hare to guess how much he loves him, and the little hare says, "I love you all the way to the moon.""I tell my son, 'Mom loves you, from here to the stars'," says Zhao. "Although I have been teaching him how to say 'mom' every day, he is still unable to say the word. He is now 24 years old."Like many parents of children with autism, the 64-year-old has faced challenges and worked hard to help her son since he was diagnosed with severe autism at a very young age.She is the founder and principal of the Loving Home for Children Special Education and Rehabilitation Center in Guiyang, capital of Southwest China's Guizhou province. It is the first autism rehabilitation institution in the province, and Zhao is also a teacher there.Over the years, she has provided support to more than 7,000 children with autism. She has witnessed the autistic community flourish — from being under-recognized to being increasingly understood and accepted — and she has seen how the community is gaining more support from broader society.Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by varying degrees of impairment of communication skills and social interaction. Children with autism are sometimes called "children of the stars" in China, as society often perceives them as lonely, and they can exhibit unconventional emotional reactions, language abilities or social skills.This year's World Autism Awareness Day fell on April 2. A report on autism education showed that in 2019, there were more than 10 million people with an autism spectrum disorder in China, among whom about 2 million were children aged under 12.The maladies or symptoms strike without warning. Possibly, at first, the problem manifests itself in an inability to sleep well. Then the dietary problems start. Feelings of inadequacy are common. Nothing seems interesting. Life's supposed vibrancy — the laughter, the humor, the challenges — seems like a cruel joke. A sudden emotional breakdown strikes, and the person may wake up crying, or play endlessly with a smartphone.These are some of the symptoms of teenage depression, and most adolescents who have lived at Lyuting Home in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province, are familiar with these symptoms, which have caused many of them to drop out of school."Depression is a prevalent dilemma that students increasingly face across the country. We hope to turn Lyuting into a cozy, cave-like home, for those whose body and soul are in distress, to help them recover and return to normal life," Sheng Menglu, founder of the organization, says."Our basic rule is simple: No violence, no judgment, and respect for diversity," the 31-year-old woman says, adding that under the rules, everyone's feelings, behavior and ideas are welcomed, and there are no taboo subjects.A recent survey showed that more than 70 percent of the adolescents who lived in Lyuting for more than a month responded that their temporary residence had empowered them to feel connected to their community and provided a sense of security.Since its establishment in October 2021, the four-story home has served about 80 teenagers and their families through its companion program. Under the program, companion workers, usually in their 20s or 30s with a background in psychology, develop a healthy bond with the adolescents, providing care and love, dealing with their emotional dilemmas and helping them identify and express their feelings."Over the past two years, some organizations have consulted us about our service model and we hope it can be expanded, leveraging greater social forces to help more people in need," Sheng says.Depression and anxiety disorders trouble nearly 30 million adolescents across the country, according to the 2022 blue book on national depression released by People's Daily. Among them, 2 million are estimated to have dropped out of school due to psychological distress."After they receive therapy in a hospital or special school, most of these teenagers are trapped at home, which may not provide a good environment for recovery," she says.Pamela Reif, a workout vlogger with more than 9.83 million followers on YouTube and 11.96 million on Bilibili, came to China for a visit in March.During this trip, she experienced embroidery in East China's Suzhou city and tried some traditional Chinese food. Pamela said she always love coming to China. In her eyes, China is so beautiful because it has such a rich tradition and culture.In this exclusive interview with China Daily, Pamela defines beauty as a combination of outside look and inside knowledge. She shares her "secrets" on how to balance work and leisure activities.Crooked posture, vision problems, digestive issues, and even allergies — while these health woes may appear unconnected, one expert suggests they could share a common origin: spinal health issues.Li Yanhu, esteemed director of the sports health medical research center at the National Institute of Sports Medicine, which is under the General Administration of Sport of China, elucidates this critical link, highlighting the spine as the cornerstone of vitality."The spine serves as the body's fundamental support system, tasked with bearing weight, providing structural integrity, and facilitating essential functions such as movement and shock absorption," Li explains. "Yet, its significance is frequently underestimated, overshadowed by more apparent health concerns."Emphasizing the pivotal role of early intervention, Li advocates for a paradigm shift in healthcare practices, urging a holistic approach that, from infancy, prioritizes spinal health.As medical discourse increasingly turns its gaze toward preventive care, the spotlight now falls on the spine — a silent sentinel, the welfare of which profoundly influences overall well-being.For the past 15 years, 57-year-old Li has been passionately spreading awareness about spinal health, especially among teenagers. He travels nationwide, tirelessly promoting a "teen spine project".Through talks, research, and teaching exercises, like stretching and bedtime routines, he aims to help youngsters protect their spines from a young age. His mission? To ensure fewer kids suffer from back problems.Women can better fight disease if they know more about their bodies'Cure sometimes. Treat often. Comfort always." This renowned quote in the medical field has been embraced as a standard for practice by countless healthcare professionals worldwide for decades.However, Tan Xianjie, a Chinese doctor with more than 30 years of experience, has added a new phrase: "Educate forever".The gynecologist at the prestigious Peking Union Medical College Hospital usually sees patients and performs surgical procedures during the day. However, in his free time, he dedicates himself to sharing with the public scientific knowledge related to women's health conditions. He explains medical processes in books, offers advice on social media and tells doctor-patient stories on TV programs.Words related to women's health such as "menstruation", "uterus" and "vagina" are frequently spoken by him, which may occasionally cause slight embarrassment in public, but Tan remains unfazed. The gray-haired doctor says that he aspires to provide more women with knowledge about their health and assist them in disease prevention."A doctor, regardless of his or her level of expertise, can only attend to a limited number of patients and perform a limited number of operations. But a popular-science book, an engaging lecture or an informative video can spread health-related information to a much wider audience," Tan says.He first resolved to become a doctor because of his mother. Born into a big rural family in Southwest China's Chongqing municipality, he suffered the tragic loss of his mother when he was 12 years old. He was attending a county boarding school, and visits back home were infrequent.Seasoned practitioner and NPC deputy seeks innovation in promoting and inheriting traditional medicine, Li Yingxue and Yang Jun report.In treating temporary facial paralysis, Professor Yang Shuo emphasizes a holistic approach. "Beyond addressing the condition itself, we must also consider treating the individual," he instructs interns at Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. "That entails focusing on their meridians and acupuncture points."While juggling his teaching responsibilities, Yang attends to over 60 patients a day at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Additionally, he dedicates time to caring for hospitalized individuals.Adding to his impressive workload, last year, Yang assumed the role of a National People's Congress deputy. Despite his busy schedule, he prioritizes grassroots engagement, conducting visits and research to amplify community voices at the national level.His mission: to bolster the advancement of traditional Chinese medicine and pass on its rich culture.The 49-year-old brings 25 years of expertise to his practice, and specializes in treating spinal conditions. Employing techniques like qi (energy flow) adjustment and modern structural acupuncture, he focuses on holistic healing."Using pulse diagnosis and a comprehensive approach," Yang explains, "I combine traditional methods, like the assessment of meridian, bloodletting, and zangfu tuina (visceral manipulation) to treat ailments like neck and back pain."His approach integrates ancient wisdom with modern techniques, offering hope to patients suffering from a variety of musculoskeletal issues.The key to effective acupuncture lies in balancing the body's qi, ensuring its smooth flow, he says."For instance," Yang says, "if someone's breathing is rapid and they're easily irritable or experiencing insomnia or headaches, it suggests hyperactivity of the qi that needs to be regulated. Acupuncture can help bring it back into balance."Chung Hwa Medical Institution of Singapore signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Singapore Gaidon Group to jointly promote non-pharmacological traditional Chinese medicine treatments in Singapore on Feb 23, in an effort to assist the national health plan of Singapore and other countries through TCM treatments such as heat-sensitive moxibustion.Three institutions under the group are involved: TCM Inno-Tech & International Promotional Centre, Academy of TCM International Education and Gaidon Electronics Technology Pte Ltd.The two parties will mainly cooperate in training, application and promotion of heat-sensitive moxibustion technology, non-pharmacological TCM treatments and specialized TCM therapies and in promoting the "China-ASEAN Heat-Sensitive Moxibustion Technology Training and Promotion Program". Furthermore, the pair will work on clinical research in TCM, especially around heat-sensitive moxibustion technology in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases, health of the elderly, unhealthy conditions, and rehabilitation. The two parties will also conduct policy research, medical and health charity initiatives, high-tech product research and development, innovation in TCM service programs and service models, and popularization and cultural dissemination of TCM.Liu Shaofu, chairman of the Board of Directors of Chung Hwa Medical Institution, expressed his hope that the widespread use of heat-sensitive moxibustion will attract more aspiring individuals to build a growing team of  practitioners to provide safe and effective healthcare for the public, and offer new treatment options to deal with chronic illnesses and aging health problems in Singapore.Zhang Feng, chairman of Singapore Gaidon Group, said that as a multinational organization jointly established by high-quality resources from China and Singapore in the new era, the group is committed to the internationalization of TCM, including investment in and development of high-tech products in the field of TCM, promotion and application of appropriate technologies and specialized therapies, innovative practice of education and training as well as health service models.Singapore Gaidon Group is honored to join hands with Chung Hwa Medical Institution in empowering the national health plan of Singapore and possibly more countries. In the future, in addition to the three organizations participating in the signing of the agreement, the group will mobilize the strengths of all of its organizations to collaborate with Chung Hwa Medical Institution and more partners in exploring higher-quality and more efficient solutions to proactively address the challenges of global health, such as chronic diseases and geriatrics, Zhang Feng added.As a preliminary action to implement the agreement, the two sides launched the Chung Hwa Medical Institution Project under the "China-ASEAN Heat Sensitive Moxibustion Technology Training and Promotion Program" in September 2023; the technical training, clinical application and evidence-based research of heat-sensitive moxibustion technology and devices were launched simultaneously in the main hospital of Chung Hwa Medical Institution and all its branches.According to a leading doctor, more than 30,000 cases of metabolic and bariatric surgery, or MBS, which helps to reduce food consumption and aids weight loss by reducing stomach size and, in some cases, by rerouting part of the patient's digestive system, were performed in China last year.The rise in the number of patients resorting to surgery not only reflects a better understanding of these medical procedures among the public, but perhaps more importantly, highlights the country's increasing rate of obesity, says Wang Bing, a chief surgeon at Shanghai No 9 People's Hospital, which is affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.His team started performing weight-loss surgeries 15 years ago, and was among the first in the country to do so. The number performed by his team has leapt from a dozen a year initially, to around 300 currently."We find that a large proportion of patients coming to seek medical assistance at our department suffer from not only obesity but high blood pressure, diabetes and sleep apnea, a serious sleep disorder in which breathing stops and starts repeatedly. Obesity and its related metabolic diseases are usually cases of mutual cause and effect," says Wang."It's rather hard for these patients to lose weight through their own efforts by doing sports or dieting. They need to resort to external intervention to help break the body's unhealthy metabolic cycle and state of obesity," he says.So far, MBS has proved to be the most effective treatment to sustain weight loss and, in most cases, is not prone to relapse, according to the doctor. Implementation of the minimally invasive surgery has grown considerably since its introduction in the 1990s. Approximately 100,000 of them are performed in the United States per year.Wang says that most patients undergoing surgery will reach a healthy weight within three to six months after the operation. Their weight will keep dropping for around two years afterward.Obesity among Asians is generally different to Caucasians, according to experts. Asians tend to experience mainly abdominal obesity, meaning that individuals usually do not have excessively thick limbs, but have quite a lot of belly fat."Belly fat means excessive visceral fat, which is the root cause of a variety of metabolic disorders," says Wang. "Compared with neighboring countries, such as Japan and South Korea, China has a significantly higher obesity rate."Bariatric surgery usually triggers a series of chemical reactions in the patient's body, says Wang."After the surgery, we usually find changes to the secretion of gastrointestinal hormones in a patient's body, and the signals sent from the brain also change. All this helps solve metabolic problems dramatically," says Wang.According to treatment guidelines, MBS is recommended for individuals whose BMI is above 32.5, or above 27.5 if they suffer from two types of metabolic diseases.Still, the actual number of patients seeking help only accounts for a small proportion of those suffering from obesity, along with various other everyday physical issues, including pain in the back and knees, difficulty sleeping, and motion or mobility problems.Wang also says that while men account for 70 percent of obese individuals, women account for 70 percent of his patients, showing that women pay more attention to their appearance.Experts have reminded the public to pay more attention to obesity, which was listed as a disease by the World Health Organization in 1948.The latest official national statistics in 2020 showed that weight gain and obesity affected more than half of the Chinese population, almost double the rate in 2002.Also in 2020, the rate of overweight or obese minors aged between 6 and 17 years old, and below 6, stood at nearly 20 percent and 10 percent, respectively."The growth in the rate of overweight minors is a result of multiple factors, including a modern lifestyle and Westernized diets. People also traditionally believe that slimness is equivalent to unhealthiness to some extent,"Wang says.A 44-year-old father and his 21-year-old son, from Shanghai, underwent surgery a month ago. They have lost 20 kilograms and 15 kg respectively.The father, surnamed Pan, says that he tried various methods, including sports and taking slimming medication, to lose weight, all to no avail."I used to suffer from sleep apnea, which made me suffocate and wake up often. After the surgery, I'm sleeping much better. Also, my belly fat has decreased rapidly, which has made moving around easier," he says.As well as severe sleep apnea, he used to suffer from high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. The son used to suffer from high cholesterol, high uric acid levels and cardiac hypertrophy.The symptoms of many of their conditions have been alleviated, and doctors will continue to monitor indicators related to their metabolic disorders.zhouwenting@chinadaily.com.cnTraditional Chinese medicine gains global popularity, influencing health trends, and becoming a lifestyle choice for many.Phan Thi Kim Chi's connection with Traditional Chinese Medicine began at an early age. Growing up in a small village in Hanoi, Vietnam, it was inconvenient for Phan to travel to hospitals in neighboring cities. Whenever she caught a cold or experienced a headache as a child, her family would seek the help of a local TCM practitioner, whose prescriptions often included many herbs that could be found in the nearby woods of the village."For me and the villagers, TCM is a convenient and effective choice," said the 27-year-old. "I thought maybe one day I could use it to help people, too."This led her to major in TCM at a traditional medical school in Vietnam and later pursue further studies in acupuncture and tuina (Chinese therapeutic massage) at Changchun University of Chinese Medicine in Northeast China's Jilin province as a master's student.According to Phan, even though TCM has long been commonly practiced and accepted in Vietnam as it shares similarities with Vietnam's own traditional medicine, finding a good doctor or school to learn TCM in Vietnam is not easy. This is why she aims to bring the knowledge she has gained in China back to her own country. "I plan to become a TCM doctor and teacher after graduation," Phan said.Overseas students of TCM, like Phan, are not rare. According to a report co-published in April 2023 by Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine and Social Sciences Academic Press (China), the total number of international students studying TCM in China was 8,187 in 2020, with the largest population of 6,441 coming from Asian countries, followed by 832 from Africa and 432 from Europe."After taking acupuncture and massage therapies, I feel comfortable and relaxed," Mogel says, giving a thumbs-up after receiving treatment in traditional Chinese medicine at a clinic in Schaffhausen.TCM has become increasingly popular with people in Switzerland. In Schaffhausen, an old town in the country's northernmost canton with the same name, there are seven TCM clinics. Mogel got his treatment from one of them called "TCM-City".Mogel is a frequent visitor to the TCM-City clinic due to his sports injuries. "I believe in natural therapies," he says.According to TCM practitioner Jia Kejie who runs the clinic, most of her patients are from Schaffhausen and the neighboring cantons of Zurich and Thurgau.Over 20 years ago, TCM began being popularized in the Swiss health resorts of Bad Ragaz and Baden, and then gradually spread throughout Switzerland. Nowadays, many patients are referred by doctors in hospitals and other Western medicine clinics to TCM clinics for complementary treatments."While I was receiving acupuncture therapy, I fell asleep, even though I was nervous at the beginning," says Miroslava, who has been suffering from physical and mental disorders for a long time.Miroslava, who works in early childhood education, says that she had tried treatment elsewhere, but it did not work. "Finally, I accepted my friend's recommendation and decided to try this clinic."At the clinic, Jia and her colleague Zhang Zhitai communicate with patients in fluent German.At 10 am local time, the first patient finished his treatment, leaving the clinic. The next patient was on the way. In this cold and damp weather, many patients came here for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Jia was scheduled to treat 14 patients that day."TCM practitioners in Switzerland regularly conduct business online or offline," says Jia, who graduated from a traditional Chinese medicine university in China and has practiced TCM in Switzerland for more than 20 years.Jia, also vice-president of a local association involving TCM and Western medicine, estimates that her clinic in Schaffhausen has treated some 60,000 patients since its opening in 2002. About a total of 5,000 people came to the clinic and received TCM treatment."TCM is the natural medicine with a complete medical theoretical system," she says, adding that its unique properties are also the source of its vigorous development in Switzerland.Jia's clinic establishes a medical file for each patient and keeps detailed records of each treatment. "In accordance with Swiss law, we keep all patient cases for at least 10 years,” she says.At first glance, the tasks may seem mundane. They include hanging laundry and hammering a nail. But if completed successfully they will give the person who carries them out a greater sense of achievement.These are the tasks that have been chosen to test if artificial hands are up to doing the mundane, and if their recipients can use them efficiently. They will also bring cheer to a number of scientists.At the Rehabilitation Engineering Technology Department at the Suzhou Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, engineers and researchers are busy adjusting a myoelectric prosthetic hand. This is an externally powered artificial limb that the recipient controls with the electrical signals generated naturally by their own muscles.The Suzhou scientists hope to make it more compatible for Xu Min, who lost her right forearm in an accident in 1992. The 48-year-old woman from Suzhou, Jiangsu province, will wear the hand to compete in the arm prosthesis race tasks in the Cybathlon Challenges in February. The four tasks include hanging laundry, serving food, stacking, hammering and removing a nail."These tasks are routine and delicate, by which, I think, the organizers intend to test if the artificial hand can replicate the dexterity and functionality of a human hand," Xu says. She won a top spot at the Cybathlon Challenges in March and if she wins the contest in February, she will be more confident about entering the October global finals — Cybathlon 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. This is considered the pinnacle event in the sector.In the previous challenges, Xu was equipped with a robotic forearm prosthesis and completed the tasks — carrying bottles and sweeping up — in the shortest time with no mistakes.Started by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and held since 2016, the quadrennial event is also known as the "Olympics of assistive technologies"."Beyond the competition, it is also a technology platform for researchers to exchange ideas, a community of people committed to an inclusive and barrier-free society, a technology transferring opportunity and a public campaign. It aims to create a world without barriers for people with disabilities," Jurg Burri, ambassador of Switzerland to China, said at a promotional event for the competition in Beijing in October, which will attract 160 teams from across the world. Each team is made up of a pilot (with physical challenges) and a technology developer from a university or tech company.Xu and her team attended the event to demonstrate their latest product and how humans and machines can collaborate."The event marks the countdown to the competition, which for me, means pressure to compete with researchers and companies from home and abroad," Xu says, adding that she cannot wait to get the hand ready to start the training.BUDAPEST — In recent years, Hungary has witnessed a surge in interest in traditional Chinese medicine, as demonstrated by the success of the 2023 World Traditional Chinese Medicine Day free consultation.This event, which was held on Friday and Saturday at the BOK Hall in Budapest, drew a large number of Hungarians eager to experience the benefits of TCM."Three years ago, I came here, but it was too crowded, and I couldn't get in. So, I arrived early today to stand in line," says Marika Varga, a 65-year-old woman who traveled to the capital from Szekesfehervar in central Hungary to attend the event.The consultation was organized by the Central and Eastern European TCM Association and the Qihuang Traditional Chinese Medicine Center of Hungary as part of the 2023 Hungarian exposition for seniors, the Senior Plus Expo.Seven traditional Chinese medicine experts, along with interpreters, attended to over 500 visitors and patients during the two-day event, offering diagnoses, prevention, and treatment plans.More than 2,200 attendees also had the opportunity to try Chinese herbal tea, enhancing their TCM experience.Piroska Molnar, a 63-year-old from the northern Hungarian town of Matrafured, came to the consultation with her husband, who had seen Chen Zhen, president of the Central and Eastern European TCM Association and head of the Qihuang center, on television.Molnar and her husband were in good health, but they sought Chen's advice on disease prevention."Because this (TCM) is much more friendly, much more personal and holistic, it is much more favorable for us," Molnar said after the consultation.The growing interest in TCM is also evident among healthcare professionals and interpreters like Katalin Hornyak, who says that the TCM booth was the most popular at the expo because it offers a holistic approach to health, unlike Western medicine, which often treats only symptoms.Hornyak was particularly impressed by the thoroughness and compassion of Chinese doctors. "Chinese doctors are very caring and ask patients about their condition in detail. They work hard to help them solve their problems," she adds.Zhang Haifang, an expert from Gansu province who joined the Qihuang center in January, says she was surprised by the high turnout. "There's been a constant flow of people. I've given consultations to 30 or 40 patients today," she says."The wisdom and preventive philosophy of TCM have brought tangible health benefits to the local population and greatly promoted the friendship between the two countries," says Chen, who has organized free TCM consultations in Hungary for 18 years.A few years ago, as a teenager, I experienced daily migraines that made me want to bang my head against a brick wall. I was desperate to find a cure. For those of you who have experienced this pain, I can sense you silently nodding in agreement, while for those of you who have not endured this affliction, it is by no means an exaggeration to say that the experience is excruciating.I had tried everything. Ibuprofen only made the pain a bit more bearable; osteopathy as a holistic approach to medicine only stopped my migraines for a week; and homeopathic medicine, which to this day has been the only medicine I have found that can help avert a migraine once it has just started. Unfortunately, nothing worked as a continuous remedy for my unfortunate chronic condition.In my hopelessness, my father told me to try acupuncture, which he had undergone once in Hong Kong. It had helped heal his lower back when no other forms of therapy or medicine had worked. I had never experienced traditional Chinese medicine before, except Tiger Balm and the pectoral syrup called Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa, both of which I would frequently use.With no expectations due to my prior disappointments in my search for a remedy, I embarked on my journey of acupuncture, and I soon found myself in a middle-aged woman's office which was surrounded by Chinese herbal medicines.After I sat myself down on the patient chair, she asked me why I had come in. As a Francophone, I spoke, at best, shaky Chinese at the time, but perhaps because of this language challenge, I had a very authentic experience with her, a doctor who has practiced this form of medicine for over 40 years.A few moments later, she placed three fingers on my wrist and silently felt my pulse. I was then taken to a room and told to lie down. Soon, she took out the needles which made me quite apprehensive because such objects make me uneasy.The initial procedure of receiving acupuncture proved to be quite surprising. To address my migraines, acupuncture was first administered to the back of my hand, which is nowhere near my head. The sensation was quite unexpected too: as the doctor delicately tapped and twisted the needle in, I did not sense the needle itself, but rather an effect that rippled throughout my entire body.This highlighted the extensive historical body of research and practice which underpins acupuncture: the insertion of a single, slender needle can have such an integrated and holistic impact upon the body, making one feel relatively pain-free.The doctor then continued to tap and twist more needles throughout my entire body: head, face, stomach, legs, arms, and toes. To my surprise — since not all practices do this — alligator clips were attached to half of the needles inserted into me. The electricity was turned on, and the doctor left the room. While laying still during the treatment, I felt the electricity flow throughout my body.Around the five-minute mark, the doctor returned and increased the electricity dose. I lay there silently, thinking to myself, as a 15-year-old, what I had agreed to undertake.But before I knew it, the doctor came back in, turned off the electricity and took the needles out. The entire process was over in 20 minutes. She then prescribed some herbal medicine for me to drink every day for five days.That night, I recounted the entire experience to my mother. Being French, she was taken aback by the idea of electricity and needles, but I reassured her that while the prospect of needles and electricity was indeed unsettling, I was now without a migraine.I returned to the doctor for a total of 10 sessions, and each time the same routine was repeated and the same herbal medicine was given as a follow-up.The true benefits of the acupuncture treatment soon became evident: I was cured of my migraines, and for two years I had not experienced a single relapse.Acupuncture did change my life. I have found a healthy and natural solution to my migraines. As an added bonus, I've learned, through my treatments, of the many acupressure points on my body and I would massage certain circulation areas on my hand every day to prevent migraines and also sometimes to treat headaches, period cramps and water retention.This has also allowed me to massage acupressure points for my friends when they complain of a headache.I am now an advocate for acupuncture because of all the benefits it has brought me.If you have also been suffering from the conditions I endured, I would highly recommend delving into the world of acupuncture.Written by Victoria Lee-Baruffolo, 22, a French student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, completing a master's in political science. She is passionate about promoting cross-cultural understanding globally and bridging cultures in hope to foster international harmony. At 9:30 in the morning, Li Xueli, 25, hastily rode his motorcycle straight to the Dongzhimen Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. Having embarked on a career as a programmer at an internet company two years previously, he needed to get acupuncture treatment to his lumbar spine before his work started at 11 am.His job required him to sit for extended periods, often leaving him with stiff muscles in his lower back, neck and shoulders.Upon entering the acupuncture outpatient department of the hospital, he saw patients sitting or lying down in treatment rooms, undergoing a variety of treatments including moxibustion and electro-acupuncture, among them quite a few young faces.Symptoms, such as physical weakness, frequent colds, declining memory, lack of energy, disrupted sleep, severe hair loss, and pain in the neck and shoulders, are more common than in the past among young people.The demand for health and wellness has never been greater.On average, every urban resident spends more than 1,000 yuan ($137) per year on health and wellness, according to a report of 2017-2022 China's health and wellness industry market development status and investment.The report shows the current scale of the health and wellness market in the country exceeds 1 trillion yuan. Notably, people aged between 18 and 35 account for a staggering 83.7 percent of this consumer base.Three months ago, Li began receiving acupuncture treatment every two weeks to alleviate fatigue and pathological symptoms.It doesn't cost too much, he explains, as most of it is covered by health insurance."I was a bit resistant to acupuncture at first, afraid of the pain, but after the third treatment, I gradually got used to the slight, momentary pain of the silver needles sticking into my body, and I could even fall asleep on the therapy bed," he says.Wang Louda, 30, who works in the social media industry, has gained a newfound respect for TCM after suffering from cervical spondylosis.Six months ago, while driving home from work, Wang suddenly felt numbness and weakness in his left arm.He thought it was due to the excessive overtime he was doing and that resting over the weekend would relieve it.Unexpectedly, the situation worsened after a week. He had no choice but to go to the hospital for an MRI, which showed issues with his cervical spine.A colleague recommended that he try acupuncture. After over a month of treatment with TCM, his symptoms had significantly alleviated."TCM is relatively gentle and suitable for treating chronic diseases," Wang says.Editor's note: There are 43 items inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage lists that not only bear witness to the past glories of Chinese civilization, but also continue to shine today. China Daily looks at the protection and inheritance of some of these cultural legacies. In this installment, we find out how an ancient healing art has gained increasing popularity in modern times.For thousands of years, the Chinese have relieved pain and cured disease through acupuncture. Evolving from the discovery that using stone needles to prick specific points on the surface of the body could relieve pain and symptoms, acupuncture has become an integral part of traditional Chinese medicine, in line with the philosophy that promotes the harmonious coexistence of humans with nature.According to Records of the Grand Historian, written by Sima Qian about 2,100 years ago, Bian Que, a highly skilled physician during the Warring States Period (475-221 BC), was famous for having saved a prince from "death" by using needles to stimulate the Baihui acupoint on the head of the unconscious man.According to TCM, there are a dozen meridians in the human body, where the qi, or life energy, circulates to nourish the organs. Cold, infections or diseases can result in the blocking of the energy, and so stimulating the acupoints can unblock stagnant qi, restore normal circulation and improve health.Today, acupuncture is still widely used in China.Li Ming, a 41-year-old who works in media, says that acupuncture really helped treat the dry eyes she had been suffering from since 2009. After trying many other ways, a friend suggested she turn to a doctor at Beijing Tongren Hospital who excelled in treating the condition with acupuncture.Li's treatment lasted one and a half years, and after more than 130 visits, her symptoms significantly decreased, and her eyes became moist enough for her to resume work in 2013.Liu Cunzhi, head of the School of Acupuncture, Moxibustion and Tuina at the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, says that he has been using acupuncture to treat patients at the first stage of Alzheimer's disease. "Many of my patients come to me twice a week for seven or eight years to maintain their current condition," he says.In 2010, UNESCO inscribed acupuncture and moxibustion of TCM on the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Yet, the practice is not just cultural and historical, but also a medical technique widely used and researched today.Eight-minute short film provokes discussion and urges solidarity with victims of inappropriate sexual advances, Xu Fan reports.In Spring this year, producer Li Moxiao and director Han Xia engaged in a thought-provoking conversation at a cafe in Beijing. Savoring their cups of coffee, they brainstormed a question: How could a movie tackling the sensitive issue of sexual harassment become more relatable to its audience?The movie is part of a collaboration between cosmetic brand L'Oreal Paris and the One International Women's Film Festival, an annual event aimed at supporting women in cinema.After engaging in extensive discussions, the creative duo found themselves deeply inspired by actress Xin Zhilei's 120-minute stage play, Prima Facie. The play, originally written by Australian playwright Suzie Miller, revolves around a criminal defense barrister who experiences a shift in her perception of the legal system after becoming a victim of sexual assault.Managing to invite Xin to act as the lead, they ultimately shaped the plotline of the 8-minute-long short movie, By Your Side. It has recently been released on several streaming sites, such as Bilibili and Youku.Starting with a group of performers attending a rehearsal, the movie follows Xin's character, who portrays one of the performers, noticing that a fellow actress appears nervous and uncomfortable after the instructor, a middle-aged man, caresses and pats her shoulder.The actress is even more uncomfortable when, during the subsequent halftime break, she is chatting with a friend and sharing something interesting on her phone, when suddenly, a male actor approaches from behind, hugs her tightly, and jokingly asks, "What are you guys looking at?" This display of intimacy makes her feel even more uneasy.After rehearsing for the day, the actress walks home along a path by the river. Two men, who are chatting, notice her and ask in a flirtatious manner, "Hey, beautiful, where are you going?" This catches the attention of Xin's character, as she happens to be walking home on the same route. Bravely, she steps forward and demands an apology from the two men for their behavior.At that moment, the actress, who is initially scared and hurriedly running away, stops, with her eyes filled with gratitude. The two young women briskly walk away together in the dark."Xin's character, to some extent, represents the perspective of most of us — a witness of sexual harassment. We hope the short movie will raise public awareness and provoke them to think: 'What can I do if I witness such an incident?'" says Li, who is also the cofounder of the One International Women's Film Festival.A graduate of the Department of Directing at the Central Academy of Drama, Han says she was selected as one of the five winners of a project to support women directors by the festival in 2021 and that, since then, she has developed a friendship with Li.Hematologist develops innovative treatment to improve outcomes for leukemia patients, reports Zhou Wenting in Shanghai.At the beginning of his medical career three decades ago, Hu Jiong chose the roller coaster of bone marrow transplantation over the more routine merry-go-round disciplines of the medical profession.In the early 1990s, hematology was an emerging field where a lot of improvements were needed. However, Hu says he preferred the challenge of hematology to other medical disciplines that already had set treatment plans and predictable outcomes.Hu, 53, is now the director of the Bone Marrow Transplantation Center of the Hematology Department, Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, and his treatment innovations have improved the outcomes for many leukemia patients.Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation involves clearing away damaged or diseased bone marrow in a patient's body through chemotherapy and radiation therapy.This is followed by infusing normal donor hematopoietic stem cells, and rebuilding the hematopoietic and immune system in a patient's body.The procedure is recognized as one of the most challenging clinical treatment techniques, and requires highly skilled physicians, according to medical experts.Hu says a patient is usually hospitalized for five to six weeks during the transplantation procedure. Doctors have to ride a roller coaster with the patient as there are many obstacles to overcome, including complications and rejection of the donor material."We'll be haunted by fear all the time. But I enjoy such challenges from work," says Hu, whose hospital is affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University's School of Medicine.For his patients, Hu's aim is to lessen the impact of the roller-coaster ride of treatment, by improving their outcomes, achieving a full cure, and reducing donor material rejections and recurrence of the disease.Through constant innovations in his treatment method — intensive chemotherapy with sequential transplantation — Hu and his team have improved the long-term survival rate of patients suffering from refractory acute myeloid leukemia, or AML.Since the method was initiated in 2015, the long-term survival rate has increased from 20 percent of patients to between 50 and 60 percent.The recurrence rate of the disease among refractory AML patients — those who do not achieve full remission after treatment — has been lowered from around 60 percent to less than 20 percent."That gives hope to patients and their families who originally had already lost hope. As a doctor, saving lives is always my goal. Nothing else compares with this," says Hu.Refractory AML accounts for half of all AML cases. But these patients are often turned down by medical institutions due to the high relapse rate and risks of complications.The increased transplantation success rate was achieved by combining established international practices with innovations introduced by Hu's team. The lower recurrence rate was a result of using new targeted medicines, which proved to have good efficacy and fewer side effects, he says.Since the late 1990s, the international status of Hu's team has gone from follower to front-runner.Spreading benefitsMulticenter prospective clinical research to confirm the treatment used at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, is in the works.Two centers in France have already introduced the Ruijin treatment for refractory AML patients. The centers include the Institut Paoli-Calmettes in Marseille, which began using it in 2019.A published paper about the treatment method showed that 42 percent of patients could realize long-term survival, with the percentage expected to rise over the following years.The centers in Shanghai and in Marseille have regular exchanges, with the two teams often visiting each other. Hu got to know Didier Blaise, leader of the blood and marrow transplantation and immune cellular therapy program at Institut Paoli-Calmettes, at an international conference in 2004.During the COVID-19 pandemic, they held monthly online meetings to discuss difficult and complicated cases. Regular meetings have been maintained after that, with new ideas and research programs discussed.In June, Hu was invited by the center in Marseille to join a hematology experts conference to help the center review its clinical treatment plans. A month later, Blaise was invited to Shanghai by Hu to review the Ruijin team's methods.Sharing and reviewing knowledge and techniques helps research teams avoid getting stuck in a rut, Hu says. "Sometimes we need an onlooker from the outside to assess our programs from a different perspective, especially an international one, which may make our treatment approaches better recognized in international academic circles," he says.Counseling provides young players with outlet to relieve stresses of competing in high-pressure eventsLiu Tongyu's daily life is closely tied to esports players, but even as a non-player, she has become increasingly indispensable within the team.As one of the only full-time esports psychologists in the nation, the 27-year-old serves in the LGDGaming esports club. Conducting regular conversations and self-psychological assessments with teammates, providing psychological intervention, organizing workshops, and adjusting players' mental states are all part of her daily job.As a very niche profession, Liu believes that her career choice is a natural outcome.Born in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Liu studied Applied Psychology at Beijing Sport University and pursued a master's degree in Performance Psychology at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom."I have learned about the factors that affect high-level sports, targeted training and improvement methods, as well as courses on how to improve team performance, coaching skills, and cohesion," said Liu, adding that the matched major was one of the reasons she chose this job."I know the importance of psychology in competitive sports. While some people don't have any concepts about this profession, Pan Fei, the general manager of LGD, strongly agrees with psychological counseling. Therefore, I have become a full-time esports psychologist for this club, and I am currently the only one in the country," she added.Although she began to make progress, it was not a simple task.Being able to build trust with the team was her first obstacle."Psychological counseling can easily be misunderstood and lead to strong resistance when people have a lack of understanding of this profession," Liu said.Media workers experience the therapeutic benefits of traditional Chinese medicine, Xu Haoyu reports.At the Main Media Centre of the Asian Games, the Exhibition Hall of Traditional Chinese Medicine Culture has become the favorite place for people to visit in their spare time.Teachers, student volunteers and massage therapists from Zhejiang Chinese Medical University and its affiliated hospitals have contributed to the promotion of health concepts, and fostered cultural exchange by providing distinctive traditional Chinese medicine services to the media workers. Since its opening, the exhibition hall has received over 2,000 visitors. Every day, it receives approximately 200-300 visitors, and around 30 to 40 people come to experience tuina, a form of Chinese therapeutic massage.TCM encompasses thousands of years of experience and theoretical knowledge from ancient China in the battle against disease. Under the guidance of ancient materialism and the spontaneous dialectical thinking of the time, it was gradually formed and developed through long-term medical practice into a comprehensive theoretical system.It originated in primitive society, stemming from people's reverence of nature. By the time of the Spring and Autumn (770-476 BC) and Warring States (475-221 BC) periods, a basic medical theoretical system had already been established.Through continuous development and refinement over successive dynasties, TCM has matured and had a profound influence on the healthcare systems of countries and regions around the world.The exhibition hall displays classical Chinese medicine books and specimens, to introduce the concept of TCM to a broader audience."Through a combination of graphics, multimedia and physical objects, we hope to showcase the profound culture of TCM and explain the common health concepts shared by traditional medicine and modern sports," said Zhu Wenpei, a teacher at the university, who's also the general manager of the exhibition hall.I started practicing Korean martial arts when I was seven and then for my whole young life. In my early 20s, I felt a little bit disappointed with traditional martial arts and I wanted to do something not only physical but with meaningful movements.Then I traveled to the United States and found yoga.The core of martial arts and yoga is the same, that is focusing on the present moment, calming the mind and controlling the body. I found the only difference between them is the speed of movement. Yoga is slower, and it helped me calm down and control my movement and mind at a slower pace. I gained a love toward yoga.But then again, after a while of practicing I was a little bit disappointed with yoga too, as the teachers stress holding onto traditions just like martial arts masters do. I wanted to make some changes and push the evolution to the next step.In the 1990s, I kept looking for teachers who were doing something, for example, approaching yoga with music, that makes practicing more modern, but I couldn't find any. We didn't have the internet back then.Then I made the important decision — OK, nobody is doing this, then I'm doing this.From 2000 to 2008, I was experimenting and trying to achieve one thing, that is how to connect traditional yoga and its philosophical basis with modern society, providing practitioners health and happiness without getting religious.Then I came up with Inside Flow. In the first five years, we got much rejection and pushback from the yoga world. They say this is not yoga, it's more like dancing and it's too modern.It sounds weird but I was quite satisfied with this reaction, because I knew every time when a revolution starts, people reject it at first. The stronger the rejection, the more likely it's going to be a revolution. I knew for sure that it was going to change the yoga world.The essence of true yoga is that through physical movement, you connect with your heart and true self. That's why I still define Inside Flow as yoga, because the essence is the same.The moment I taught the first class was on May 25, 2008, in Austria. The students enjoyed it so much and gave me so much positive feedback that I contacted my lawyer to get it patented.In the past 15 years, I trained and certified nearly 20,000 Inside Flow teachers around the world directly.Until today, when I hear the music and see the whole crowd moving at the same time and one unity to the beat, and it doesn't matter if you are Chinese or Korean or Japanese or German or American, I still get goose bumps all the time. The practitioners too, I think, and obviously they also get a lot of sweat and tears.It's the power of music. The recipe of Inside Flow is quite unique. It's yoga movement, deep breaths, the music beat and the emotions that people feel during the practice. It's physical and emotional, and it involves body and mind. So that's why it's addictive.The aim of traditional yoga is enlightenment — the opening of all the energy centers and then people get enlightenment and become wiser.We don't look for this. Inside Flow just wants to make people happier. We achieve this very down-to-earth goal in every single class.I'm traveling more than 200 days a year to teach teachers. But when you ask my son, who's eight years old, why is your father hardly home, he says that my dad has a dream, and he's working really hard for his vision.In 2016 I was teaching Inside Flow in Bali during Spring Festival, and there were so many Chinese people. In 2017, I was invited to China for the first time.As long as you like to move to music, you're very welcome in Inside Flow.It doesn't matter how old you are or who you are. Your movement doesn't have to be perfect, because it's not a performance and it's not for showing others. It's for yourself.Related:Popularity of modern yoga stretches across nation More people turn to ancient pastime to improve health, mindfulnessOver the summer, a number of mass public yoga events were held across the country where people from all walks of life could be seen exercising not just their bodies but their minds too.The scenes were an indication of China's growing number of yoga practitioners drawn to the ancient physical, mental and spiritual practice whose roots stem back to some 5,000 years ago.According to a report on the yoga industry in China, from 2017 to 2021 the number of yoga studios in the country tripled to 42,000, and it's estimated that at least several million people in the country practice yoga regularly, while more people occasionally do so, with the most prominent segment being women.China's yoga-wear market, dominated by upscale brands such as Lululemon, increased in scale from 2.6 billion yuan ($355.8 million) in 2013 to 14.1 billion in 2021, according to a consumption report by Chinese e-commerce retailer JD.The increase in the number of people who've started practicing yoga, in its many forms, over the past few years is closely related to the nation's Healthy China 2030 initiative first put forward in 2016.A central mission of the Healthy China 2030 vision is promoting healthy lifestyles and providing better access to healthcare for all.From 2012 to 2019, the health literacy level among Chinese people increased from 8.8 percent to 19 percent, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the percentage continues to climb.For yoga, its ability to be easily practiced in the home has also worked in its favor over the past three years during the pandemic, when people were required to remain at home for extended periods to halt the spread of the virus.Countless videos and digital classes were available online and provided and ideal healthy activity for the temporarily housebound.For many who live in big cities and who have busy work schedules, yoga is also an ideal activity as it not only provides physical exercise but also has a focus on mindfulness, something that stressed city workers are drawn to.In addition to the traditional styles such as Hatha Yoga, Iyengar Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga, modern yoga systems like Rocket Yoga, Yin Yoga and Universal Yoga have emerged and become popular in recent years.YINCHUAN — Lying on the bench, Ma Zhifu took a deep breath, lowered the weighted barbell to the chest, held it motionless, and then pressed it upward with a low grunt.After three referees raised their white flags to indicate a successful lift, Ma screamed with excitement, "Finally, I made it!"In the recent Paralympic Games in Northwest China's Ningxia Hui autonomous region, Ma, a 54-year-old para-powerlifter, pocketed his first gold medal in the men's 49kg category on his competitive debut.Ma is a farmer from southern Ningxia's Guyuan city, located in Xihaigu, a region once deemed "uninhabitable". His life was irrevocably changed 20 years ago, when he fell while working at a construction site.The accident left him paralyzed from the waist down. After two decades in a wheelchair, Ma suffered from muscle atrophy in his lower limbs. In contrast to his skinny legs, however, he has strong and muscular arms.Before the camera, Ma proudly flexed his muscles, showing bulging biceps and triceps. "This is the result of my training," he says.Before becoming a powerlifting athlete, Ma lived a reclusive life. The accident stripped him of his dignity, leaving him incontinent and unable to take care of himself. Devastated, he shut himself away for years.In 2021, Ma joined a rehabilitation program, which is a tailormade training camp for those suffering from spinal cord injuries, hosted by the local Disabled Persons' Federation.Designed to rebuild shattered lives, the program taught people like Ma basic living skills, such as how to maintain basic hygiene and move themselves from the wheelchair to bed.During the training camp, Ma discovered that his instructors, some with injuries even more severe than his, are national champions in wheelchair racing. Taking them as role models opened up a new world for Ma.When he heard that Ningxia was about to hold the region's first Paralympic Games, Ma immediately signed up for powerlifting and started practicing at a local training base in the city.Without enough strength, his arm trembled, even when lifting just the bar. After a month, Ma returned home and continued training with farm tools such as shovels and rakes to build up his strength.A gym owner heard Ma's story and offered him free use of all his equipment. Since the gym is over 10 kilometers from Ma's home, he installed a motor on his wheelchair in order to "drive" there, practicing on a daily basis to stay physically active.Each and every lift he makes is him pushing the boundaries of his physical strength. Seven months later, Ma made three attempts in the competition, lifting from 35kg. In his last attempt, he hoisted 42kg, almost equivalent to his own weight.The competition is of great significance, says Guo Qinghong, chief referee of the powerlifting competition. "As the first Paralympic Games in Ningxia, it has set records for future para-athletes to break, goals to strive for and examples to follow," he adds.Ma says: "As long as I still have the strength, I will continue training and keep on challenging myself."Do you like cheeseburgers and french fries as much as I do? How about dumplings or tacos?Do you like any of them enough to reach into a shark's mouth to retrieve them, knowing full well that you might scrape razor-sharp teeth on the way in or out?That's pretty much what you have to do these days when takeout food is delivered, since so many restaurants now seal their bags with staples.The intention is good, because securely closing the bag helps ensure food safety. We can rest assured that no one has tampered with our meal before it arrives.But surely the use of tape, which many eateries do choose instead, is safer by far than staples. The latter are pulled into bare-fang position when a bag is opened, exposing lots of little teeth that find and surprise your wrist, hand or fingers. Ouch!Not to mention that a puncture wound from a staple, especially on a finger, is not only painful, but prone to infection as well.Furthermore, staples, being made of steel, are hardly environmentally friendly.And they pose yet another danger. They can fall into food such as french fries and accidentally be consumed. Believe me, you don't want to ingest a staple, especially not an open one.I actually found a staple in a bag of french fries one night in Beijing. It reminded me of the time when, as a teenager, I was working at my favorite local burger joint the day we offered a free hamburger, fries and soda to anyone who walked through the door (which hundreds subsequently did).We prepared our fries daily from fresh potatoes, and on that particular day I was kept very busy, nonstop in fact, cutting potatoes using a hand-operated chopper. I used a long fork to pluck a submerged potato out of a huge post-peeling bin, quickly pushed it into the cutting box and then forcefully lowered the multibladed cutter, hundreds of times.The chopper eventually buckled under the strain, and a small piece of sharp metal blade, unbeknownst to us, broke off and found its way into a customer's bag of hot, crispy fries. Luckily for all involved, she found it and did not accidentally consume it, so no harm was done.But woe to anyone who is not so fortunate.What's more, the open staple that we're lucky enough to avoid when eagerly reaching into a bag of food poses a hazard to anyone who handles the bag after we discard it. So I make it a habit to remove the staples before recycling a bag, which can be time-consuming.How many millions of these tiny steel nuisances are introduced each day into the food chain? Indeed, some restaurants go all out and use eight staples when two would do, which increases the danger and the waste. It also requires more physical exertion to open the bag, thereby guaranteeing that every staple is opened and ready to pounce.Why don't we put an end to this practice and ensure that rice and bread remain our only "staple foods", and not french fries?Let's defang the fast-food monster and just use tape to seal the deal.Our hands, and the environment, will be glad we did.Contact the writer at jameshealy@chinadaily.com.cn   I've met some who say they simply don't dream.

I think that not to take advantage of Nature's no-fee nightly Technicolor motion picture show, sans popcorn — feature films in which the dreamer is often the STAR of the show — is to sacrifice a gift from the subconscious that keeps on giving.Freud would say it's an end-of-day survival mechanism by the mind to discard the day's dilemmas, and allow your head to sort out the three-ring circus which is the daily dialogue between one's id, ego and superego. The Bard also had a thing or 100 to say about nocturnal reveries. In A Midsummer Night's Dream, after Bottom and Titania's heads hit the pillow and they enter the land of Nod, all bets are definitely off on what might happen in the deep forest.And of course, a Danish noble contemplating ending it all, famously asks, if after the deed, one can expect: "To sleep, perchance to dream." Thus, Hamlet wisely opted to take Pascal's wager and live to dream another day.And what do the Chinese ancients have to say about dreams? (Not young waking boyhood dreams of hoping to be the next Yao Ming, of course.)Li Yu (937-978) was the third ruler of the Southern Tang state, and also happened to be quite the wordsmith. My Idle Dreams Roam Far is a wonderful look through poetry into the mind's eye when the eyes are closed.I love how this short piece manages to engage all the senses, save touch and taste. Eyes, ears and nose are busy behind the poet's fluttering lids.My idle dreams roam far, to the southern land where spring is fragrant.Wind and strings play on a boat on the river's clear surface, city full of catkins flying like light dust.People are occupied admiring the flowers.My idle dreams roam far, to the southern land where autumn is clear.For a thousand li over rivers and hills, cold colors stretch far, deep in flowering reeds, a solitary boat is moored.Beneath the bright moon, a flute plays in the tower.And of course, Li Bai (701-762) had a thing or two to say about the otherworldly world of dreams. His Traveling to Tianmu in a Dream is a classic exposition of the surreal nature of escapist reveries.The people of Yue speak of Tianmu; its red clouds in bright light or darkness might be seen.Tianmu pierces the sky and stretches to the horizon, its power surpasses the Five Peaks and eclipses Chicheng Mountain. (Giving the reader a sense of the famous Wordsworthian "mind's eye" wandering above a field of daffodils.)Because of this I wish to dream of Wu and Yue, and in one night fly over the moon in Mirror Lake. (Possibly referring to place names or desired individuals.)The immortals line up like hemp (I won't go there, as I know you're aware that he's a wine connoisseur).Suddenly one's spirit palpitates and one's soul shakes; startled one wakes and takes a deep breath.There is only the pillow and mat when I am awake; gone are the mist and red clouds from before.All earthly pleasures are like this; since ancient times, the myriad things all like water flowing east.Why should I lower my face and bow for the influential and the rich, and take away my joyous smile?Surely, this statesman-slash-poet understood the value of the escapist pleasures of dreams to make the earthly grind more tolerable.Contact the writer at andrew@chinadaily.com.cn   "I never thought that I would beat the tumor," says a cancer patient in Lanzhou in Northwest China's Gansu province.The man adds that he is particularly grateful for heavy ion therapy he received, at a follow-up visit following several rounds of treatment revealed that his cancer cells had disappeared.A research team from the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed the country's first medical heavy ion accelerator with independent intellectual property rights, and put it into clinical application.The successful operation of the medical equipment blazed a trail of independent innovation from the initial basic research to its final industrialization and promotion, according to the China Science Daily.In 1993, researchers proposed to carry out basic research on heavy ion cancer treatment during an academic conference held in Tianshui, Gansu.Cancer treatments employing heavy ion accelerators can bombard a target with high-energy electrons to kill cancer cells.Compared to traditional therapy such as radiation, heavy ion treatment is considered to be more balanced, exposing healthy cells to less radiation. The treatment period is shorter and the therapy can more effectively control cancer cells.In 2006, China followed the United States, Japan and Germany to become the fourth country to successfully carry out heavy ion clinical treatment, when four cancer patients participated in preliminary clinical trials for heavy ion therapy.Between 2006 and 2009, the research team cooperated with local hospitals to conduct preliminary clinical trial studies among 103 patients with superficial tumors and witnessed satisfactory curative effects.The ultimate goal of heavy ion cancer therapy is to inject heavy ions into the body to treat deep tumors. Thus, the researchers began the preliminary clinical trial study on deep tumors in 2009.From 2009 to 2013, there were 110 patients with deep tumors who took part in the preliminary clinical trial study, says Xiao Guoqing, former head of the IMP.Meanwhile, the researchers were planning to develop a real medical heavy ion accelerator.In 2015, China's first such accelerator, with independent intellectual property rights, rolled off the production line in Wuwei, in Gansu.The price of the device is about one-third of similar imported ones, without any high maintenance costs.On March 26, 2020, the accelerator was put into operation, and by the end of June this year, more than 750 patients completed their therapy at Wuwei's heavy ion treatment center, with remarkable curative effects.The follow-up statistics showed that the three-year local tumor control rate reached 84 percent among 46 clinical trial participants.Similar medical heavy ion accelerators are being developed in Fujian, Zhejiang, Hubei, Jiangsu and Jilin provinces.The researchers disclosed that they are currently working on the development of a second-generation accelerator with lower power consumption.Heavy ion therapy is highly effective in treating a wide range of solid tumors and can be used in cases where surgery is not possible or unsuitable, when a patient is sensitive to conventional radiation therapy, or prone to relapse following such therapy. This includes tumors located in the central nervous system, head, neck, skull base, chest and abdomen.The range of indications is expected to broaden through further research and the maturation of the technology.XinhuaMedical personnel were recently tasked with measuring blood pressure and blood sugar and offering medication guidance to the elderly in Zhili village, Shandong province. It was part of the efforts by the local authority to improve the health of elderly in rural areas. The medical staff also used a three-dimensional dynamic interference electrotherapy device to alleviate pain and improve blood circulation for the rural residents with spinal problems, neuralgia and sprains."The doctors were very patient, and my health issues have been alleviated," says Wang Qiang, a local villager."It's especially convenient to receive professional medical services near home," Wang adds.More free medical sessions will be offered to local villagers, says Zhao Yunlong, a community official.The goal is to promote public health awareness and enhance their physical fitness, Zhao says.Downtown Zogang, a county in the Tibet autonomous region's Chamdo, lies beside a river and against an expanse of mountains. A wooden plank path winds its way up the mountain, allowing visitors to go hiking and embrace the county's beauty.Every night, the county welcomes tourists with a bustling scene. At its central square, locals and visitors gather in circles and dance without inhibition, enacting the bonfire dance of the Tibetan ethnic group at festive occasions.Up until 2019, Zogang was listed as an impoverished county, and its transformation couldn't have been achieved without special teams from the coastal city Xiamen, Fujian province, which lies around 2,100 kilometers away.In 2016, Fujian province established a partnership with Chamdo to aid its development. Cities from Fujian began offering one-on-one assistance to counties in Chamdo, and among them, Xiamen paired with Zogang.Each year, experts from various fields take the journey and work in the county. So far, eight batches of specialists have made the trip.Baduanjin helps stretch the body, loosen the joints and tone the muscles, while promoting good circulation.Before starting, stand in meditation, breathing and relaxing.1. Raise Palms to the SkyBreathe in as the hands are raised, palms upward, and slowly exhale as the hands are lowered. The movement helps improve the posture by stretching and straightening the spine, and also improves the flexibility of the shoulder joints and arms.2. Drawing the BowStand as though straddling a horse, imagine drawing a bow and releasing an arrow. Relax the arms and lower them, then lift the hands and draw the bow to other side. This exercise helps improve general blood circulation and exercises the heart and lungs, as well as the muscles in the arms and chest.3. Push High and LowCoordinate breathing with the movements. Breathe out as you push your hands up, inhale and continue inhaling as you push your hands down. These movements help stretch the side of the body and relieve pressure on the stomach, liver and spleen.4. Turn and Look Over the ShoulderStand with a straight back and turn your head slowly to the side, allowing your waist and shoulders to turn, without twisting your knees. Breathe out gently while turning to look over the shoulder, and breathe in while returning to the central line. This movement helps relieve tension and fatigue in the neck and shoulders.5. Rotate the Body and SinkPlace hands at the top of the thighs, keep the shoulders back, bend the knees and circle from the hips as you bend forward and come up on one side, then pause and return the other way. Breathe in while the body is upright, and breathe out as you roll forward. This movement helps stretch the sides and back.6. Two Hands Hold the FeetKeep your knees unlocked and slightly bent as you bend forward, aiming your hands at the ground in front of your feet. As you come back up, straighten up carefully. Slowly, breath out as you descend and breath in as ascend. This movement can be challenging. Slowly increase your reach each time you bend forward. This movement helps improve flexibility and circulation.7. Punch with FistsTake a wide stance and keep your back upright. Squat with the knees gently bent as if riding a horse. Punch with your fists either tightly balled or loose. This movement improves the flexibility of the spine and circulation.8. Bouncing on the ToesKeep the knees soft and bent as the heels lift from the ground, and return. Repetition of this movement helps circulation and relaxes the whole body.Related:Traditional exercise finds fresh audienceOnce a sport for elderly, pandemic and government support give baduanjin younger profile, Chen Nan reports.For 28-year-old model Huang Qian, going to the gym and following a strict diet help her maintain a slim figure.About eight months ago, she decided to add a new form of exercise to her daily routine. Baduanjin — which translates as 'eight pieces of brocade — is a form of qigong, a set of traditional Chinese fitness exercises combining physical movement, with breathing and meditation."I knew nothing about baduanjin until I saw videos of people practicing on social media platforms. The movements are very slow, like tai chi, so I naturally associated it with the kind of exercise favored by the elderly," says Huang, who is from Hubei province.Nevertheless, she decided to give baduanjin a try because she has issues with her cervical vertebrae, spleen and stomach."I read reviews, saying that it can be helpful to these kinds of problems," she says.The practice doesn't require much space or time. Baduanjin uses breathing and concentration techniques to improve body and mind, through eight, well-designed sequences. Huang usually practices about half an hour after breakfast. She enjoys the exercise, which stretches and relaxes her whole body."I feel my body slowing down, as well as my mind. I concentrate on my movements while listening to beautiful, smoothing music. It only takes me 12 minus to finish the eight sequences. I feel refreshed and full of energy before starting my day," says Huang, who now practices baduanjin every day, in addition to going to the gym to do weight training and cardio.When she found out that one of her favorite fitness influencers, German Pamela Reif, had added baduanjin to her workout videos, Huang was surprised and excited.The video, which is 1 minute and 50 seconds long, has received more than 900,000 views, 49,000 likes and 24,000 reposts in the three weeks since it was posted on Bilibili, a popular video sharing platform, on Aug 8. It has helped introduce the ancient exercise to a wider audience, especially to young people like Huang. Film stars and fitness influencers who do baduanjin have also shared videos online, which has attracted many new practitioners."The popularity of baduanjin among young people is increasing, especially since people spent so much time at home during COVID-19," says 28-year-old Li Jianlin, who works as a fitness content creator for Keep, one of the most popular apps for sports lovers in China, and which offers online fitness programs."Many young people go to the gym, and workout regularly. However, a phased and slow approach to resuming exercise after COVID-19 is the best way to regain pre-COVID-19 fitness levels. So baduanjin, which is slow and smooth, has won the hearts of the young during recovery," says Li.Li, who graduated from the Capital University of Physical Education And Sports with a major in aerobics in 2018, has created baduanjin exercise programs for the platform's users, which were launched earlier this year. Available in three different levels, the programs have received warm feedback from users."Seventy percent are young people, under the age of 30. The programs give detailed instructions and demonstrate the movements from different angles," says Li.Keep's baduanjin programs have been watched more than 5.41 million times, and about 36,000 users have added them to their favorites."Since it also involves meditation and breathing exercises, it's also regarded as a way for young people to relax and cope with stress," he adds.According to Wang Zhen, a professor at the Shanghai University of Sport, who teaches in its traditional Chinese sports program, baduanjin dates back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279).Compared with other types of qigong exercise, such as tai chi and wuqinxi (in which practitioners imitate the movements of a bear, a tiger, a monkey, a deer and birds), baduanjin is more suited to beginners thanks to its simple, gentle movements."Each movement has its own set of rhyming instructions, which allows practitioners to easily memorize them, and move in time," says Wang."You can practice at almost any time and anywhere. For example, you can practice a standing posture by the table after sitting in front of the computer for a long time," Wang adds.He started learning qigong when he was 12, introduced to the practice by his mother, who had high blood pressure, high cholesterol and hyperglycemia."She exercised at home so I followed her, just for fun," says Wang, who graduated from the Shanghai University of Sport in 1999 with a master's degree in traditional Chinese sports. He started to teach at the university later that year.On June 5, 2001, the General Administration of Sport set up the Health Qigong Administrative Center, which provides scientific and professional guidance on qigong. In 2004, the Center published four books about four types of qigong, including baduanjin."Government support helped promote qigong exercises and baduanjin has developed a large fan base, not only among the elderly, but also among the young," says Wang.In 2009, the university launched the Shanghai University of Sport National Science & Technology Park, which serves as an incubation center for sports enterprises, including traditional Chinese sports.One of Wang's students is 23-year-old Liu Xueqing, who has been practicing baduanjin since 2019. Now pursuing her master's degree in traditional Chinese sports science at the Shanghai University of Sport, the 23-year-old also teaches seniors, young people and children in communities around Shanghai."I first learned baduanjin with my PE teacher when I was a freshman majoring in sports rehabilitation. At the beginning, it was boring because the movements are slow," says Liu. "But later, I found that it's very helpful for relaxing my muscles, especially after sitting for hours reading or writing.""Now, baduanjin is a new fashion among the young," says Liu Xiaolei, associate professor of the martial arts school at the Beijing Sport University, who has posted baduanjin videos on social media platforms. One of them has been viewed over 200,000 times on Bilibili."In the past, only the elderly practiced baduanjin in parks or at home because it is not difficult. Now, I see many young people, either students or white-collar workers, practicing baduanjin," says Liu.Liu served as president of the jury at the 11th Session of National Traditional Sports in Beijing, between Aug 21 and 25. Baduanjin was among the competitive games held at the event, which began in Beijing in 1985, and which includes a wide variety of traditional sports, such as martial arts, wresting and bahe (tug-of-war)."We have people of all ages practicing baduanjin and like many traditions, such as hanfu (historic Chinese attire) and music, traditional sports is making a return to daily life," she says.Related:'Baduanjin' by yourselfIn 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche stated that "god is dead". The era that followed could be described as a collective philosophical panic attack in the West. It led to attempts to understand and experience the self and find meaning through logic, reasoning and mathematics. These methods weren't exactly aberrations; Socrates and Plato made similar attempts millennia before. Modern philosophers were standing on tried and tested lines of thinking in order to address the largest philosophical questions. Still, theirs were not the only paths toward enlightenment. After all, the Beatles found Buddha.Eastern religions and philosophies have been tackling material existence for longer and, in this writer's humble opinion, more successfully. As a budding existentialist, I find many wonderful similarities between that broad field of philosophy and Buddhism. Both seem to emphasize that suffering is at the very essence of existence, and that the work of being involves striving to understand that suffering. Both seek to define the self and its relationship with the material world, though not all through the same lens. Making these sorts of connections reminds me that the experience of existence — if not, at least, the illusion of it — is shared.From a Buddhist perspective, the "individual self" and its surroundings are one and the same; any attempt to separate them would be an illusion. This reminds me of the British moral philosopher Derek Parfit, who argued that people don't exist apart from their components. In his view, the brain, the body and the identity are entirely inseparable. In fact, he also claimed that his views would align well with Buddhism. So I was delighted to learn that he was born in Chengdu, Sichuan province, in 1942, showing me once again that there is not so much distance between Western and Eastern cultures after all.My first awareness of this fact came when I was in my teens, upon discovering that my quaint hometown of Chino Valley in Arizona, with a humble population of around 10,000, had its very own Buddhist temple just a brief 30-minute drive away. Today, I would not be so surprised. There is a stickiness to Buddhist philosophy that attracts Western audiences, from its notable influence on The Beatles to its growing uses in psychotherapy. In his book, Why Buddhism Is True, Robert Wright details how modern secular philosophy, psychology and neuroscience are uncovering secrets about our identity that Buddha already uncovered long ago, albeit with different terminology. He argues that through meditation and mindfulness, Buddhist practitioners developed an awareness of the self, and the language to describe it. The book is a New York Times Bestseller.The roots of Buddhist philosophy exist in my life, and I expect that they will continue to deepen. I've only begun to explore my "self" and to attempt to develop meditation and mindfulness. They are, after all, lifelong journeys. I am reminded of an expression I came across when visiting the Big Buddha in Hong Kong: "The greatest journey is one in which you don't travel at all." Whether it be through Western or Eastern philosophy, let us seek inward for the greatest peace.Contact the writer at haydn@chinadaily.com.cnLANZHOU/BUDAPEST — Jozsef Frenyo, a senior Hungarian biology teacher, recovered from hearing loss after several visits to a traditional Chinese medicine center near Heroes' Square in the Hungarian capital of Budapest."Doctors here cured my old malady. And my hearing is now getting better," says 78-year-old Frenyo.Practitioners of TCM use various approaches, such as acupuncture, cupping and herbal medicine, to address health problems. These practices spread to the world via the ancient Silk Road more than 2,000 years ago.The center, named the Qihuang Traditional Chinese Medicine Center of Hungary, was set up by Northwest China's Gansu provincial health commission in 2016. It has been operating with the help of teams of Chinese doctors sent to Hungary to provide medical assistance.Gansu province is a major TCM hub in China and has a long history of growing TCM herbs. Since the Belt and Road Initiative was proposed in 2013, Gansu has signed cooperation contracts with 12 countries, including Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Hungary, and built 16 TCM education, research and treatment facilities overseas.Frenyo has long suffered from hearing impairment and has visited many hospitals in Hungary over the past few years, but with little success."I was told by physicians that my hearing problem couldn't be cured due to my old age," he recalls. Before seeking help from TCM, he had almost given up hope.However, after receiving several acupuncture treatments from TCM expert Zhang Haifang, Frenyo is now able to communicate with others without the help of external hearing aids."The center is popular in Hungary," says Zhang, who has treated several hundred Hungarian patients since she came to the center in January.Chen Zhen, president of the center, says that TCM gained increasing acceptance among Hungarians after it played an important role in alleviating the symptoms of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and abroad.As more Chinese TCM doctors like Zhang go abroad to practice, they help bring the benefits of the ancient Chinese medical system to more people around the world.During the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25), China aims to jointly establish 30 high-quality TCM centers with countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, according to a plan issued by central government agencies in 2022.At the Qihuang Traditional Chinese Medicine Center of Thailand, about 90 percent of the patients are Thais.Rungrawan Wiwatpiyawong, president of the center, emphasizes that many Chinese Thais view TCM treatments as their first choice for maintaining good health."TCM did not take root in Thailand in a day," says Rungrawan, herself a Chinese Thai. "It spread with the footprints of Chinese immigrants over the past few centuries and has proved its value."To further promote TCM in Thailand, Rungrawan established a company called Tang Ming Green Health Co, which facilitated the approval of 90 kinds of proprietary Chinese medicines and 350 kinds of TCM granules by the Thai government."With official permission, I believe that the TCM industry and health products will have greater potential in the future," she says.Wang Xuejun, a professor at the Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, highlights the unique perspective of TCM on life and fitness, as well as the prevention and treatment of diseases, during its long history of development and innovation."It represents the spiritual core of fine traditional Chinese culture, and has generated a broad and strong international resonance," he says.Convinced of TCM's benefits, a growing number of overseas students and practitioners, especially those of the younger generation, have come to China to experience and learn TCM therapies.Bakhtiyor from Tajikistan is currently a junior student at the Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, which has so far trained students from 11 countries, including the Republic of Korea, Kazakhstan and Laos.During the past semester, Bakhtiyor devoted most of his spare time to practicing acupuncture techniques."It was hard," he says. "There are so many acupuncture points in the human body, and different points require different kinds of needles."Taking pride in his growing proficiency in acupuncture, Bakhtiyor hopes to pursue a postgraduate degree and work in a TCM clinic in China after graduation.According to statistics from the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCM has spread to 196 countries and regions, gaining worldwide recognition.China is continuing its efforts to introduce TCM more fully to the world, especially in countries and regions participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.As cooperation and exchanges have intensified, TCM has contributed to improving the well-being of people around the world, while promoting culture, medicine and friendship worldwide, Chen adds.The sixth edition of the Active Schools Innovation Award concluded on Aug 9 at the Shanghai International Convention Center, bringing together some 300 physical education teachers and researchers from across China.The award is a part of a charitable initiative that seeks to motivate primary schools and educators to creatively engage in physical education classes.Its primary objective is to cultivate interest in physical activities and each year, innovative PE practices at primary schools are honored.This year, the event, which is co-organized by the China Education Development Foundation and global sportswear giant Nike, attracted around 2,900 submissions nationwide.Following multiple rounds of expert evaluation, 100 outstanding examples of innovation were selected.Xu Lin, head of social and community impact at Nike Greater China, believes that the event could help motivate a larger number of frontline physical education practitioners to actively innovate and also enhance professional pride."We aspire to encourage them to explore diverse approaches that authentically cultivate children's fondness for PE lessons and enthusiastic engagement in sporting activities. Ultimately, this effort propels the evolution of PE instruction at educational institutions," she said.Public welfare program sees volunteer doctors visit medically ill-equipped rural areas to not only offer people free consultation and treatment, but also provide training and knowledge, Cheng Yuezhu reports.This might have been one of the more bustling days for Chagyoi town, deep in the mountains of Zogang county, Chamdo, Tibet autonomous region.At 9 o'clock in the morning, when medical experts from Beijing arrive at the town's health center, its front yard is already packed with villagers, who line up in front of the tables waiting for their turn to see the doctors.One of them, Yeshe Nyima, lives in a village more than 30 kilometers away from the town. He got up at 6 am to bring his 59-year-old mother to see the doctors for a checkup for her chronic leg pain."I saw on the news that doctors from Beijing are coming to treat patients, and our village committee also informed us. I've never heard of such an event before, let alone attended one," he says.Company device allows those who lost a limb to retake control of their lives, reports He Qi in Shanghai.After losing his left forearm during a workplace accident a few years ago, Wu Zheng'an fell into a depression and was constantly worried that he would never be able to work again."I couldn't accept the new reality," recalls the 37-year-old, who was operating a crusher at a construction site in Guangdong province when the accident occurred. "I even advised my wife to divorce me because I didn't want to be a burden to her." For a long while, Wu had to survive on the support provided by his family as he couldn't find a proper job.But he finally caught a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel in March 2020 when he chanced upon a video clip of a smart bionic hand called OHand on social media platform Douyin.Wu did not hesitate to give the product a go, and he now describes that decision as life-changing.Unlike traditional artificial limbs, OHand has signal sensors that track changes in skin morphology and intention signals related to finger movements transmitted through muscles. The signals are then sent through the skin to the bionic fingers.Created by Shanghai-based OYMotion Technologies, OHand weighs just 495 grams and allows users to perform dozens of tasks like pinching and holding chopsticks.Although the bionic hand is priced at 118,000 yuan ($16,414), the company offered the device for a bargain price of 38,000 yuan to the Shanghai Disabled Persons' Federation, and local residents pay just 3,800 yuan, with the rest covered by the federation. The device was listed in the subsidy catalog for conventional aids for the disabled last year.Authorities in Hunan province and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region are developing a policy, under which users pay 10 percent of the cost, with local government subsidizing the balance.Though Wu is a Guangxi native, he was given a 30,000 yuan discount by OYMotion Technologies so that he could cover the rest of the cost using the insurance payout for the accident.TIANJIN — Wei Ruihong's struggles began a mere 28 days after her birth when she suffered her first fracture, and by the time she was 43, she had endured a staggering total of 31 fractures. With a rare genetic disease known as osteogenesis imperfecta, which renders her bones as fragile as glass, Wei, standing just 1.2 meters tall, has forged a resilient life that radiates with a brilliance akin to diamonds.Surmounting numerous challenges, she completed the self-taught higher education examinations within a year and a half. Not stopping there, Wei authored two books, extended her support to thousands of families affected by rare diseases, and shared her optimistic and positive outlook on life with tens of thousands of individuals through psychological counseling."Just 28 days after my birth, I fractured my left arm, and soon I was diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta, often referred to as a'porcelain doll' condition," says Wei, from Guangping county, Hebei province.Doctors initially predicted that Wei's life expectancy would be a mere 11 or 12 years. They went so far as to suggest that her family should consider giving up."My grandfather was filled with fury upon hearing that. He said that his beloved granddaughter deserved to receive proper care and attention," she recalls.Reflecting on her struggles, Wei described how pain permeated her childhood. She remembers a particular incident when she was just 5 years old. "I tried to break a baked wheat cake, but to my dismay, my thumb ended up breaking along with it," she recalls.The pain that sounds tormenting is actually the easiest kind of difficulty faced by people with such conditions. Because of limited mobility, physical fragility and stigma, many patients can only stay at home."My family has always made me believe that I am not defined by my illness. They have treated me like any other child except that I was short and unable to walk," Wei says. "My mother sent me to school and told me to listen to the teachers attentively, while my grandfather always took me to the theater and greeted everyone he met with enthusiasm."Wei says that during her time as a student, she was fortunate to have encountered no discrimination from her classmates. She ranked top in the senior middle school entrance exam. "But I had to drop out of school due to physical limitations, which came as a significant blow," Wei says, adding that she found herself crying every day.One transformative moment came when Wei's schoolteacher paid her a visit. She brought a basin of water and imparted a profound piece of advice. "'Shed all your tears today, then wash your face and reflect on how to navigate your future.' My teacher told me tears would only cloud my vision and prevent me from seeing the path ahead," Wei says.Wei completed all 16 courses and earned a college diploma in psychology, and acquired qualification certificates, as a national psychological counselor."Once, I forgot to notify the exam authorities in advance, and no tables and chairs tailored to my height were arranged. I improvised by placing my bag filled with books and sat on it, which allowed me to write comfortably," she says."This incident struck a chord with me and I felt it mirrors my life. Being ill and physically challenged does not mean I am incapable. I must rise on my tiptoes to achieve my goals."Wei then moved to Beijing to offer counseling services to patients at the China-Dolls Center for Rare Disorders. "My own experience with illness made me more empathetic, and my phone has become a psychological hotline. Even normal people reach out to me to seek guidance," Wei says.In 2012, Wei completed a 150,000-word autobiography. The following year she joined the department of osteogenesis imperfecta at a hospital in Tianjin, and established the Sunshine Counseling Center for Rare Disorders to help more people. To promote employment opportunities for this special group, the center has introduced various courses, specializing in areas such as social work and psychology. It also regularly organizes handicraft classes and charity sales."Those with disabilities ... possess the potential to be a source of inspiration for others," she says.XinhuaA total of 453 medical experts and more than 100 volunteers gathered in Chamdo, Tibet autonomous region, on Saturday, kicking off the 2023 edition of the China Hearts program.The program, first launched in 2008, is a public welfare service that brings doctors from hospitals in major cities and also donates medical supplies to remote regions of China.This year, the program will last a week, during which time the doctors and volunteers are going to 11 districts or counties in Chamdo, offering free medical support including diagnosis, treatment and health checkup.The medical experts are also providing training sessions for local doctors and health lectures targeted at local residents.According to the China Hearts foundation, over the past 15 years, more than 32,000 medical experts from over 3,000 hospitals around China have been organized on these trips, offering medical support to over 2 million people.In a small fitness studio nestled in Harbin, capital city of Heilongjiang province in northeastern China, barbells take precedence over other pieces of equipment."Dead lift, squat, and bench press form our core training program," says Zhao Wei, the studio manager and a strength coach."Unlike bodybuilders who chase exquisite muscle lines, our emphasis is more on strength enhancement," Zhao explains. "Powerlifting doesn't demand an array of equipment; barbells are adequate."Born in 1975, Zhao discovered his affinity for fitness in his adolescence. "Growing up on a farm, I engaged in physical labor quite often, which made me feel more energetic than my peers," Zhao recalls, adding that he began simple exercises like pushups during this time."I relocated to Harbin in 1989 and started working out in a gym. That was my first encounter with barbells, but no one guided me in its proper use," Zhao says, noting that this lack of instruction led to injuries due to unscientific training.After 2000, Zhao became one of China's earliest powerlifting enthusiasts. "I started competing in several contests and managed to bag a few awards," Zhao recalls.During these competitions, Zhao sensed the disparity in powerlifting between China and other countries. Following his retirement in 2013, he pivoted to coaching.On Tuesday morning, two of Zhao's trainees arrived at the studio for their session. Donning knee pads, applying magnesium powder, and strapping on a belt, they loaded hundreds of pounds onto the barbell. With a mighty shout, they hoisted the barbell onto their shoulders and bent over.Although they lack the distinct muscular lines of bodybuilders, their robust physiques empower them to lift hundreds of pounds.Presently, Zhao oversees more than 1,000 trainees, many of whom opt for online training due to geographical distances from Harbin."Mr Zhao is revered for his meticulous techniques and a well-established training system, so numerous people aspire to learn from him," trainee Zheng Jiashen says.In recent years, Zhao has observed a surge in powerlifting's popularity among China's youth, including many women. Short video platforms have seen a growing number of clips sharing powerlifting techniques and experiences."This sport is relatively easy to start, and the required equipment isn't hard to procure. Moreover, it doesn't demand stringent dietary control like bodybuilding," Zhao comments."I have been practicing powerlifting for nearly a decade. It has significantly benefited my life and work, making me feel more energetic and confident," says another trainee, Zhang Nan.Now, some foreigners are also learning from Zhao, and many of his Chinese trainees have secured prizes in international competitions."The gap in powerlifting between China and foreign countries is narrowing, and performance improvement is not just about innate talent, but also about scientific training," Zhao says."I am condensing decades of experience into a book that will soon be published," Zhao adds.XinhuaFree medical checkups, hairdressing and other public welfare activities have been held in communities in Guanxian, Shandong province this year.More than 2,000 local residents have benefited from the services, according to local authorities. "Those events have been fantastic for us, especially for those who have trouble moving around," says Wang Dongliang, a senior from the Jingxiu Jiangnan community on Chongwen street."A barber has been arranged to give us free haircuts at home, and it is really convenient," Wang says.The move is part of local efforts to build a happy and harmonious community. Local authorities say they will continue to explore effective ways to realize a public life of virtue and health, combining various civilized practices, volunteer services and themed lectures to benefit local households in the future.This is an extract of the Survey Report on the Social Mentality of Young Chinese Netizens (2022) conducted by Fudan Development Institute's Center for Communication and State Governance Research, the Global Communication All Media Research Institute of Fudan University, Bilibili Public Policy Research Institute and the Shanghai Information Security and Social Management Innovation Laboratory. The report surveyed a total of 5,492 young netizens across China in 2021 and 2022.New ways to copeData from Sina Weibo shows that study and work are the biggest triggers of anxiety for young netizens today, followed by health and appearance. Among those surveyed, 77 percent of them clearly stated that they felt anxious about study or work, significantly higher than those reporting suffering from anxiety related to health and appearance, 30 percent and 18 percent, respectively.When it comes to gender differences, young women expressed more anxiety than their male counterparts.In terms of education level, young netizens with a master's degree or above were more anxious than those with a bachelor, junior college, high school or middle school degree, indicating that "the more academically successful someone is, the more anxiety he or she suffers".Some young netizens have developed a unique way to cope with anxiety — online "praying", which is part of a popular phenomenon known as the new metaphysics. For example, they would repost auspicious images and emojis online while writing down their wishes about wealth, education, relationships and health, among others. They believe in personality theories and matchmaking tests. They would look to horoscopes to find out their career prospects or overall fortune. They pay attention to when Mercury is in retrograde — a time they believe brings back luck. They also follow bloggers who share tips and "prophecies" and make divination rituals such as drawing and reading Tarot cards to feel that they have more control over the things they're anxious about.According to Sina Weibo, young netizens' favorable attitudes toward this new metaphysics grew slightly between 2021 and 2022.Among the 5,492 young people surveyed, 749 showed a positive attitude toward it in 2022, accounting for 13 percent, 1 percentage point higher than 2021's 12 percent. A logistic regression analysis of dichotomous variables of young netizens' attitudes toward new metaphysics revealed that youth in China's eastern areas are the least likely to rely on new metaphysics while those in central provinces are the most likely to do so. It also found that women were more likely to believe in new metaphysics, and that people born after 2000 are more likely to rely on new metaphysics to help relieve anxiety compared to those born in the 1990s.A network analysis of millions of related video comments on Bilibili showed that online comment sections have become an important outlet for today's youth to relieve anxiety. On anonymous social platforms, young internet users can seek empathy and reassurance through communication. Some also share their experiences or offer support and comfort to anxious strangers.Working on itIn 2022, young netizens generally held a positive attitude toward working hard. The number of people who supported "lying flat" — a state where people just settle for what they have now and don't wish to work harder for more — was lower than that of those who didn't. Sina Weibo data showed that, among the survey respondents who clearly stated their attitudes, 56 percent of them explicitly opposed the life choice of lying flat, indicating that lying flat advocates are still a minority.The network analysis of millions of related video comments on Bilibili shows that young netizens are reflecting on education and that they have a social mentality of "working hard while being anxious". The motto of "education can change one's fate" remains popular in secondary education, but some students may experience a sense of loss and disorientation after finally making it through the gruelling college entrance examination, or gaokao, to enter university. However, many young netizens still believe in hard work and are willing to work hard so that they can hold their future in their own hands. They oppose the misuse of the term "rat race" and encourage each other by writing positive comments online.One NGO is involving people of all ages to help bust myths and share the real lives of autistic people and their families, Chen Xue reports.The first modern Olympic Games was held in Athens, Greece, in 1896.The first Paralympic Games took place in Rome, Italy, in 1960.What about the first Special Olympics?"When our volunteers took to the streets to ask people about the Special Olympics, hardly anyone had heard of it," said Zheng Xingkui, 43, founder of Green House, an NGO based in Shanghai. "And among the few who did know about it, they couldn't really say the difference between the Special Olympics and Paralympics. That was frustrating."As an organization dedicated to providing support to autistic people and their families, Green House is one of the East Asia partners of the 2023 Special Olympics World Summer Games, which is currently taking place in Berlin, Germany, from June 17 to 25.A group of 89 Chinese athletes with an average age of 21 — the youngest being 14 — are now in Berlin, competing in 11 disciplines, including badminton, basketball, gymnastics and swimming. This is the 10th time that China has taken part in the Special Olympics — an international sporting event for athletes with intellectual disabilities that was first held in Chicago, US, in 1968.In 2007, Shanghai hosted the Special Olympics, making China the first Asian country to host the event. And yet still, few people in China even know about its existence.This is why, ever since Green House became a partner organization of this year's Special Olympics, its volunteers started working hard to help promote the event, with the aforementioned street interview just one component of their campaign. Other activities also include a virtual torch-lighting relay, and training sessions with previous Chinese Special Olympics medalists.In fact, Green House's volunteers have long been organizing different activities on a daily basis to raise public awareness of the lives of autistic people and their families.Ni Aishan, 19, a student at Shanghai International Studies University and Green House volunteer, once supervised the production of a graduation song project in her high school and proposed to create a song for autistic children and post it online so that more people could learn about the children's stories and the challenges they face."We're a social-media-savvy generation. We're sensitive to what's trending and familiar with how the internet works, which means we are best at spreading information online and helping public welfare projects reach more people," said Ni.Lu Yajie, 22, an industrial design major at Tongji University in Shanghai, is working on a class project to design a futuristic device that helps shield autistic children from excessive stimuli from the outside world. After she joined Green House earlier this year, she proposed the idea of organizing a jogging event for autistic kids and their parents so that they could get out of the house and get closer to nature and society."Doing my class project, I realized how little people know about autism. Many of my peers and even my professors believe that autism is a mental illness, but in fact, it's a developmental disability," said Lu. "When it comes to raising people's awareness, no efforts are too small."Xia Xiuyuan is about to start college this fall. Last month, the 18-year-old was part of the volunteer group doing the street interview for the Special Olympics. Instead of being discouraged by the fact that most of the passersby didn't know about it, Xia would actively introduce the event to them and share general knowledge about autism."The media tends to portray autistic people as a group of geniuses, which is one-sided and misleading," said Xia, making her determined to share with people the other side of the story.Zhang Bopei, 13, a student at Shanghai Xiangming Junior High School, took part in a volunteer activity with Green House playing flag football with autistic kids. His job was to explain the rules and help the children play the game. And although he was roughly the same age as most of the autistic kids taking part, it wasn't an issue for Zhang."I don't think only grown-ups can participate in public welfare projects. Students of all ages — from college right down to primary school — should all get involved," he said. "Only this way can we include and influence more people."We keep saying that people should have more understanding and tolerance of autistic people, said Green House's founder Zheng, "but that's probably too far a goal for now. People need to see them first."Contact the writer at chenxue@i21st.cn A seminar on medical volunteering, bringing together more than 150 representatives from organizations, healthcare institutions and universities, concluded on Saturday.The seminar, held by China Volunteer Service Federation, aims to explore the path toward the sustainable development of medical volunteer services in China.Guo Shubin, vice-president of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, noticed that enhancing the public's abilities in first aid, self-help and mutual assistance is an urgent requirement for improving public health awareness."By harnessing the resources of internet big data, there is an opportunity to advance the establishment of a robust network for pre-hospital emergency aid, promote widespread training for medical emergency volunteers and comprehensively elevate emergency medical capabilities and rescue proficiency," said Guo.Tian Feng, deputy secretary-general of the China Volunteer Service Research Center, said that engaging in medical volunteer service plays a vital role in facilitating the effective distribution of healthcare resources, addressing the specialized and continuous needs of the community, fostering interaction between healthcare institutions and society and empowering the healthcare industry to lead the promotion of volunteer-service culture.At the seminar, a promotional event was organized to highlight a healthcare volunteer service project launched by CVSF.The project aims to carry out 100 activities this year, reaching government bodies, rural areas, communities, schools, enterprises and military camps.By providing attentive and high-quality services, the project seeks to promote knowledge on health management and empower individuals to effectively prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. It encourages participants to take on the role of primary caretakers of their own health.Beijinger Guan Jing was taken aback when she took her 14-year-old son to have his eyes examined and was told that he had developed myopia.The condition is often called nearsightedness or shortsightedness because it can make distant objects appear blurry.She said she couldn't help but feel regret, realizing that she could have taken measures earlier to lower the risk and slow the condition's development. She quickly urged her son to form good vision habits such as periodically resting his eyes and increasing his daily outdoor activities.Her case is reflective of the widespread issue of myopia among students in China. According to the National Health Commission, the prevalence of myopia among Chinese children and teenagers in 2020 was 52.7 percent. That marked an increase of 2.5 percentage points from 2019 but remained 0.9 percentage points lower than 2018.The Shanghai Association for Science and Technology, the Eye and ENT (ear, nose and throat) Hospital of Fudan University and German optics and optoelectronics company Zeiss recently joined together to launch the 2023 Chinese Children and Adolescents Myopia Prevention and Management Trend Report. It is the third yearly report since 2021.This year's report involved over 1,500 subjects who had taken their children, aged between 3 and 16, to medical establishments for myopia. The study encompassed 15 establishments in Shanghai and Shenzhen, Guangdong province, as well as non-first-tier cities.The report, which took about six months to complete, featured a survey of parents and interviews with 28 eye specialists.It aims to provide new insights into the reduction and management of myopia, and offer the public guidance that is scientific, authoritative and practical.In recent years, China has been striving to promote risk reduction and control of myopia as part of its national health policy. In March, the Ministry of Education issued a plan for ways to reduce and control myopia among children and teenagers this year."In China, there is a growing trend of myopia developing at an increasingly young age, accompanied by a rising prevalence of high myopia," says the report's lead reviewer, Zhou Xingtao, dean of the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University.While most eye specialists emphasize that parents should pay attention to their children's axial length, 62.2 percent of the surveyed parents considered simple eyesight as their primary concern. Axial length is a combination of eye measurements that can help gauge and predict the presence of myopia."It's true that eyesight is important. However, for precise control of myopia, the assessment of axial length is essential, as it's an objective and measurable factor that helps judge the progression of myopia," Zhou says.He urges parents to prioritize their children's visual health from an early age. For children aged less than 3, it is crucial to determine their diopter and examine them for congenital eye disease. The diopter is a measure of optical power that can be used for a prescription of glasses or contacts.Additionally, with children between the ages of 3 and 6, it is important to establish their refractive development profile. The eye's cornea and lens bend, or refract, light to focus on the retina. When the eye grows, it can change that bending, producing blurry vision."We should prevent high myopia and the complications it causes. Having standard and digital refractive development profiles means that an individual's eye health can be tracked continuously, and it's good for myopia management," he says.According to Zhou, the spread of accurate and understandable scientific information about myopia is good for communication between doctors and patients and can improve myopia management."There are still challenges about myopia prevention in China at the grassroots level and in remote areas. A possible solution comes from digitalization and intelligent devices," says Maximilian Foerst, president and CEO of Zeiss Greater China.In 2020, the company established the myopia management project team in China, dedicating a WeChat-based mini-program to share scientific information and accessible tools about myopia for parents.It will soon release a digital product for practitioners, allowing them to gather data from equipment and measuring tools. Therefore, they can track if and how myopia is developing and give the best possible information to patients."A crucial part of the development of myopia is the behavior of children. Therefore, we need to look at it holistically, starting with education, then working together with the community and authorities to see how we can standardize management," Foerst says.Am I prouder of the 41st or the first? Hard to say. We'll get to that in a bit.Of one thing I am sure — I was definitely out of my comfort zone at that moment. There I was squinting against the intense camera flash, a giant needle sticking out of my vein, sucking blood into the centrifuge, and trying to answer interview questions in my third language — Mandarin Chinese. As a teacher, how often have I not parroted the phrase "You need to step out of your comfort zone"? I hope some of my students will see that, at least occasionally, I do walk the talk.In reality, it was a tremendous honor to be in that situation. Being interviewed by the Red Cross on June 3 for earning a gold medal for donating blood platelets 41 times in Beijing has given me a great sense of pride. Hopefully, my story can help inspire others to find their local blood bank and contribute to a stable public blood supply. With me that day, I had one of my students Han Xufeng, an English major at Beijing Union University. He completed his first donation right beside me. Honestly, I can't say if I was prouder of my 41st donation or being a part of his first foray into this world.One blood donation could save three lives, and in China, a donor can donate every six months. Later on, I learned that you can also opt to only donate blood platelets. These are needed by many cancer patients; one unit gives the recipient at least another 24 hours to live, while doctors find ways to treat their diseases. Unfortunately, blood cannot be made artificially and is very perishable, so there is always more need than supply. In other words, when we need it, we have to rely on strangers to volunteer their blood. Meanwhile, securing an adequate blood supply requires tremendous social coordination.Unfortunately, we seldom appreciate enough how difficult it is to achieve this coordinated social action. The difficulty often lies in the fact that it can be so tempting for individuals to act in their narrow self-interest instead of doing what is best for society. This was one of many valuable lessons that my professors at the University of International Business and Economics imparted to me. In Game Theory, this is known as the "free rider "problem. In the case of blood donations, many people don't realize that choosing not to donate means you are free-riding the system. We all expect blood to be available when we need it. However, an adequate blood supply can only be guaranteed if enough healthy people take the time out of their busy lives to visit the local blood bank and bear the slight pain of a needle puncturing the skin.The Chinese government has created an ingenious incentive system to promote the socially responsible act of donating blood. Donors benefit from free access to blood if they need it in the future. This coverage also covers next of kin, so every donation is, in effect, an investment in your whole family's future health. It is often forgotten that every donor is screened for blood-related infectious diseases, which means a successful donation is also a badge of health. In addition, donors also get a travel reimbursement, a nice lunch, a redeemable gift voucher, and a chance to earn bronze, silver, or gold medals of recognition from the Beijing municipal government.At the outset of the pandemic, I was lucky enough to get to know a group of dedicated donors. These people refuse to be free riders and go above and beyond the call of duty. Take Mr Jin Yongli as an example. He apologizes for being too busy these days, so he hasn't been able to add to his list of over 70 successful donations. Compared to him, my tally of 41 seems rather insignificant. But still, I feel an undeniable sense of achievement for meeting the blood donor gold medal criteria.Dedicated long-term donors like Mr Jin ensure a reliable blood supply for you and me if needed. The government has done its part to ensure a safe and rewarding donation system that benefits your family. Now it is up to us to educate ourselves, draw inspiration from the spirit of dedicated donors, and take positive action instead of taking the free ride.Thomas Karlsson, PhD, is a 45-year-old Swedish citizen and Chinese green card holder.

He is a teacher at Beijing Union University, which he sees as his second home.HANGZHOU — In the presence of a warm aromatherapy lamp and soothing music, Hong Dandan sat beside the bed and slowly massaged a patient's hands to relieve his pain. As a hospice nurse, Hong, 28, has provided end-of-life care for dozens of people, accompanying patients on their last journey.In China, the development of hospice care has been on the upswing. In 2017, the former National Health and Family Planning Commission issued a trial guideline for hospice practices, defining hospice care as efforts including pain and other symptom relief, comforting and psychological, spiritual and social support.Nurses are indispensable in hospice care. "Patients at the end of life often have many symptoms, including pain, vomiting, aphasia and mobility difficulties," says 44-year-old Xiang Qiaozhen, head nurse of the hospice ward at Zhejiang Hospital. Aphasia is difficulty talking, understanding speech, reading or writing."The significance of our work lies in minimizing their discomfort and addressing their needs and feelings," Xiang adds. The hospital has 26 hospice nurses after six years of development.In one ward in early May, the faint sound of opera singing broke the quiet. "He loved singing but had not been able to sing for a long time after getting sick," says Li Lizhen, 76, as she watched her husband humming his favorite opera in the hospital bed. Tears flowed at this remarkable development.The days of Hu Rongxiu, Li's longtime partner, are numbered due to the spread of stomach cancer. When Xiang and other nurses came to talk with Hu at his bedside, he took the initiative to mention, "I used to sing very well. Let me sing for you.""The nurses treat us like family, and I could see the light in his eyes again when he offered to sing," Li says.In March, an 87-year-old retired professor named Liang, who has since died, was admitted to the hospice ward where Xiang works. He had been grappling with malignant tumors for months, and at that point, his expected survival period was assessed at less than three weeks.Liang was a calligraphy lover who was quite fond of a portion of verse in calligraphy that was presented to him by an old friend. After finding out about the gift, Xiang went looking for the calligraphy and hung it on the wall in front of Liang's bed so that he could see it. "When you feel better, we can take a photo of you with the calligraphy and send it to your friend," Xiang suggested.Liang was too weak to answer, but a glimmer of hope flashed in his eyes. On the morning of the third day of his stay, Liang, whose pain was under control, suddenly said to his caregiver, "I want to sit up," and pointed his finger toward the calligraphy.Hearing the news, Xiang understood his thoughts immediately. With Xiang's help, Liang put on his clothes and managed to leave the bed. "Bring me a comb and the scarf," Liang whispered as he tried to open his eyes and smiled. "Being happy to live and leaving no regrets to die," Liang read the verse aloud and gave a thumbs-up.There is a special room in the hospice ward — the farewell room. "After the patient passes away, we hold a small farewell ceremony here following the family's wishes to work through their grief," Hong says, adding that she once applied makeup to an elderly woman before a farewell ceremony."These tasks are not supposed to be part of the nurses' job, but all that they did made me feel that my mother was respected, and her life cherished," says the woman's son, who visited the hospital afterward to express his gratitude to the nurses.Taking care of these end-of-life patients is not as depressing as many people might think, nurses say. Hospice nurse Li Yanfang, 40, says her work is interesting and vibrant. Hong described her work as similar to witnessing the beauty of golden ginkgo leaves before they fall to the ground."The elderly are like a book. In the process of taking care of them, we look back together at the highlights of their lives and share their happiness and sadness. It makes the nurse-patient relationship here much more harmonious," Hong says, attributing this warmth and recognition to the pride she derives from her career.In addition to the strength transmitted by patients and their families, the nurses are always supporting each other. "Sometimes when we are tired of work or in a bad mood, we will encourage and comfort each other," Li Yanfang says.Medical treatment may have boundaries and limits, but comfort is where hospice nurses often excel. Li says these "angels" do their best to see that pain and suffering are relieved to the extent humanly possible.With summer around the corner and the mercury slowly rising, it's always good to have a solid strategy of how best to avoid being caught in the oven. That is, stuck outside in the blazing heat in the middle of a scorcher of a day. While remaining indoors, blasting yourself full-bore with the air conditioning is one option, a slightly more traditional technique of regulating body temperature is my cup of tea. No, literally, it's my cup of tea.I was particularly excited recently about a trip to southern China. Not just because of the opportunity it represented in terms of a much-needed break or the vast opportunities to gorge myself on the lovely cuisine found down yonder, but because of liangcha, or leungcha in Cantonese, or cooling tea in English. It's also known as Chinese herbal tea, though actual tea is rarely used in its preparation. What is used instead are ingredients such as chrysanthemum, honeysuckle, dried longan and lilyturf root — such ingredients that, when brewed together, often for hours, are believed to have medicinal qualities.I always get excited about liangcha when heading to southern China, or Singapore, or Malaysia, because of its amazing capacity to remedy one of the most pressing issues for me in these places — the unremitting heat. Liangcha, well known by many in China because of popular brands such as Wanglaoji and Jiaduobao (don't get me started on the sordid history between these two), has been used for hundreds of years as a medicinal preparation that can regulate the body's temperature, as well as treat a range of other corporeal maladies.As with many tenets of Chinese culture, liangcha is about promoting harmony and balance within the body and, in particular, ridding it of too much heat. And it's not just all about the weather. It is believed that different foods carry a different amount of heat or coolness with them, such as nuts, chocolate, cherries and chili all being considered "hot", and beans, bananas, watermelon and tea all being considered "cool". Liangcha can act like coolant for your radiator when it gets too hot, whether from the sun at midday, a particularly fiery curry or if a pesky illness is lurking around the corner.My first experience with liangcha was many years ago in Hong Kong. I thought little of its tradition or medicinal qualities at the time and was, instead, lured by the giant golden gourds used to house the beverages. Now, Chinese herbal tea comes in many varieties and so it has many different tastes along with many different healing properties. My choice on that day was quite bitter and barky in taste, but nonetheless, being quite a bitter chap myself, I liked it.It wasn't until the following year, while meeting up with my brother in Malaysia, did I discover the truly magical, medicinal side of liangcha. My family is a fairly disparate group, living in all manner of places around the world, and so, on the rare occasions that we are able to meet up, we tend to make the most of it. One morning, after a particularly convivial night before, I felt rather unwell. My head hurt and my innards ached. I headed out of the hotel to meet up with my brother only to have the oppressive Malaysian heat rub itself against me like an obese man in a sauna. The sweat poured and I feared I wouldn't be able to fulfill my brother's agenda for the day of haggling for watches at the outdoor market.With vision blurred, I stumbled toward what I had assumed was a 7-11 in search of a bottle of water, when there it was in front of me — a shining golden gourd. I selected my herbal tea of choice — liver cleanser — and sure enough, my recovery was swift and the day passed without incident. And I have the restorative effects of liangcha to thank for it.In June, when the Children's Hospital of Diamniadio in Dakar, Senegal, received a 4-year-old who had swallowed a whistle by accident about 20 days earlier, Cai Zhiliang, a doctor, knew urgent surgery was needed.The child was coughing while wheezing, and the oxygen-saturation level had dropped to 70 percent.It was a common surgery, but the lack of proper medical equipment made the situation a little difficult. Cooperating with anesthesiologist Huang Jianbin and physician Guo Lianghua, Cai removed the whistle from the child's windpipe in about 20 minutes.The doctors are members of the 19th medical team dispatched from China to Senegal since November 2021.As of March 31, the 14-member medical team had provided 7,058 outpatient services, completed 3,150 surgeries and 1,039 cases of giving anesthesia.Liu Chenli, the vice-president of the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, was honored with the Agilent Thought Leader Award on Monday for his groundbreaking work in synthetic biology.Liu is the founder and director of the Institute of Synthetic Biology at SIAT, which is the world's largest research institute dedicated to synthetic biology.He is also the founder and chief scientist of the Shenzhen Synthetic Biology Core Facility."I feel privileged to receive this Agilent Thought Leader Award," said Liu in his acceptance speech."I am confident that with Agilent's support and its world-leading testing and analysis technologies and solutions, our studies in synthetic biology, one of the most cutting-edge fields in life science, will soon yield great benefits."Agilent, a multinational corporation that focuses on life sciences, diagnostics, and applied chemical markets, delivering insights and innovations that help customers bring great science to life, is the initiator of the award.Yang Ting, vice-president of Agilent, said the company is proud to support Liu with a comprehensive solution that includes Agilent's full range of products, from genetic research solutions to cell analysis solutions, chromatography, mass spectrometry solutions, and more. This support will help Liu achieve his research goal of shaping an innovative ecosystem for the study of synthetic biology in China.Darlene Solomon, the senior vice-president and chief technology officer of Agilent, highlighted the significance of synthetic biology as a field that is poised to revolutionize how products are sustainably manufactured."Agilent has focused on the field of synthetic biology for many years, and supporting leading researchers like Liu underscores our commitment to accelerating the development of this important field," he said.Established in 2013, the Agilent Thought Leader Award program aims to promote fundamental scientific advances by providing financial support, products, and expertise to influential thought leaders in the life sciences, diagnostics, and chemical analysis space.To date, 56 scientists from around the world have received this award, including six from China, one of whom is Jiang Hualiang, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Pharmacist Li Xiaoyan is busy receiving an elderly couple who came specially to dispose of their expired medicines. She carefully registers the information of the drugs and gives the couple a small pack of common household medicines in return.It's the sixth year since the pharmacy participated in the recycling of expired household medicines, a national public welfare activity started by Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Holdings Ltd in 2004.From March to April, over 6,000 brick-and-mortar pharmacies in 200 cities across China embark on the annual campaign, recycling expired medicines. Customers can receive common household medicines or daily use items provided by the pharmaceutical company as a reward.They can also deliver their expired drugs to the company's pharmacy on Alibaba's e-commerce platform Tmall, in exchange for online shopping coupons that can be used in the pharmacy.For the past 20 years, the corporation has collected more than 1,600 metric tons of expired medicines, which have been properly disposed of. It has expanded to accept expired drugs produced by other pharmaceutical companies and calls on its counterparts to participate.Through the activity, many customers have gradually realized that throwing expired drugs in the trash bin can not only pose a safety hazard, but also cause environmental pollution."Citizens in the neighborhood have raised their awareness. When their household pharmaceuticals are about to expire, they come and inquire as to when the next recycle activity will start," says Li, who's in charge of the pharmacy in Guangzhou, Guangdong province.She says, often, the expired drugs that their customers deposit are those for treating chronic conditions and medication for common illnesses, such as colds, headaches and fever. When some patients with chronic illnesses change their prescriptions, they have to dispose of the old medicines.This month, she says, between 50 and 70 people have visited the pharmacy every day, and sometimes had to stand in a line. Many are elderly people, and some are young people who purchase medicine for their parents.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, people in general have increased their household medicine reserves, as the demand for medication surged, making the recycling of expired medicines more essential.The corporation's chairman Li Chuyuan, a deputy to the National People's Congress, wrote in his proposal submitted to this year's two sessions — China's annual top legislative and political advisory meetings — that the recycling of expired household medicines should be legislated and management of such medicines should be strengthened."It's important to reduce the amount of expired household medicines from the source and establish a scientific concept for purchasing and using medicines," Li Chuyuan says. He calls on consumers to reasonably prepare medicines, regularly check them, and properly dispose of them.Huang Haiwen, deputy general manager of a pharmaceutical factory of the corporation, recalls that they initiated the program because many customers built up their medicine reserves during the SARS outbreak in 2003.At that time, he and his colleagues had to persuade the elderly to believe that the medicine would be disposed of."It was part of our corporate social responsibility, and it was also good for our sales of medicines still within their validity period," he says.According to Jiang Bin, deputy head of the Research Center of Public Policy, Peking University, in a survey done by her research group, 84 percent of the 6,278 subjects said they had a medicine reserve for their family. As for the disposal of expired medicine, only 17.6 percent chose to recycle them.She suggests it's important to adopt a classification management approach to recycling pharmaceuticals, based on the varying environmental risks posed by different types of medicines.Three years ago, oculist Tao Yong, director of the ophthalmology department at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, became a household name in China in an unexpected way. He was badly injured by a former patient, despite having tried his best to save the vision of the man, who had previously undergone multiple surgeries by other doctors.The attack triggered a wave of reaction on China's social media, not only because it was a repeat of similarly alarming attacks on doctors that had shocked the public, but because Tao, now 43, is a highly acclaimed specialist in his area, who was just caring for his patients, and seemed to have done nothing to warrant such severe injury.Numerous people expressed anger toward the brutal behavior, care for Tao, and pity for his injuries, which have made it difficult for him to perform complicated eye operations.Facing the praise, flowers and pain head on, Tao has accepted his reality, shifted his direction, and is still striving to realize his original aspiration of ensuring nobody has to suffer from blindness in the future.To promote Shingles Awareness Week, which ran from Feb 27 to March 5, a forum was held by Health News in Beijing. Doctors and experts shared how to prevent the infectious disease frequently occurring in people above 50.As the immune system function decreases with one's increase of age, the incidence rate of shingles shows a rising trend. Data shows that there are about 1.56 million new shingles patients who are aged above 50 years old in China every year."People of any age may be infected with shingles. The vulnerable group is those who are above 50, especially those who have basic chronic diseases. People with low immune systems should also pay attention for shingles," said professor Du Xueping from Yuetan Community Health Service Center in Beijing.She suggested that those who have chronic diseases should consult their family doctor about their risk of being infected with shingles. They should have a healthy lifestyle focusing on diet, exercise, adequate sleep and also make sure they get vaccinated in advance. If they have shingles, they should consult their family doctor as soon as possible to get treatment.Cui Yong, deputy director of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, said that shingles is one of the most painful skin diseases. He noticed that after the recent Spring Festival, there was an increase of shingles patients going to the dermatological department. It's probably related to factors such as fast-paced work and low immune systems related to travel.Wu Hao, a member of the CPPCC National Committee, said that it's important to strengthen the construction of the general practice medical team and the management of chronic diseases in community health hospitals, to better manage the health of the middle-aged and elderly.PHNOM PENH — Hem Sreynet, a 21-year-old nurse at the Cambodia-China Friendship Preah Kossamak Hospital, was all ears as she listened to traditional Chinese medicine experts deliver a presentation on acupuncture and Tuina remedial massage.Sreynet is one of 20 medical personnel at the hospital taking part in a three-week seminar about acupuncture and Tuina remedial massage, held at the hospital's Chinese Medicine Clinic in Phnom Penh."I have wanted to learn about traditional Chinese medicine for a long time and, now, I have a chance to study it," she said while attending the first day of the seminar. "I hope to gain a better insight into acupuncture and Tuina remedial massage after this seminar."She says that TCM has been used to diagnose, cure and prevent illness, and it also reduces the use of modern medicine."There has been a remarkable increase in the number of patients coming for TCM treatment, and many of them have recovered," Sreynet says.Held in a hybrid format, the seminar is part of a project carried out by the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine to train people in acupuncture and Tuina remedial massage in developing countries.Koeurng Raksmiy, a Cambodian doctor at the friendship hospital's Chinese Medicine Clinic, says that TCM can help treat a number of diseases such as osteoporosis, insomnia, infertility, pain, chronic cough, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease."TCM, which includes therapies such as gua sha massage treatment, acupuncture and cupping, is very useful in treating illnesses," he says. "Through the seminar, we gain an insight into TCM treatment methods, particularly acupuncture techniques."Raksmiy says that, since it was launched in March 2022, the friendship hospital's Chinese Medicine Clinic has received more than 6,000 patients."In general, they have recovered, and some patients said that the TCM treatment has helped them reduce the use of modern medicine," he says.Wu Zhaomei, a member of the TCM anti-COVID-19 pandemic team in Cambodia, says the seminar focused on basic theories and operational methods of acupuncture, moxibustion and Tuina, as well as TCM nursing techniques."We are happy to find that doctors and nurses in this hospital are interested in TCM. That's why we want to improve their knowledge and ability to practice it," she says.Wu says more than a dozen TCM experts, who are experienced in both the clinic and at teaching the subject, gave lectures during the three-week seminar."TCM treats many common illnesses effectively, and we want to share this with them," she says. "We expect that doctors and nurses at the friendship hospital can learn more about the practices of acupuncture and Tuina, as well as nursing techniques."Xinhua  Tang Dafeng began livestreaming on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, at 10 pm, saying hello to the audience and introducing the story of her 3-year-old daughter, who two years ago was diagnosed with Rett syndrome, a rare disease that many people have never heard of.On Douyin, many mothers of daughters with Rett syndrome like Tang are sharing stories of their kids fighting the disease, and, as a result, more helping hands are being extended to families in need.Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological and developmental disorder that affects the way the brain develops. It particularly affects speech, purposeful hand use, and coordination, leaving individuals understanding more than they can communicate.Caused by a gene mutation, this disorder is first recognized in infancy and occurs primarily in girls. According to statistics, one in every 10,000 to 15,000 girls is born with this syndrome.Austrian medic Andreas Rett originally described the syndrome in 1966. The first case in China was reported by Peking University First Hospital in 1988."My doctoral supervisor Wu Xiru was the first to diagnose this disease in China. In 1991, I became a clinical doctoral student under the guidance of Professor Wu and began to do research on Rett syndrome," says Bao Xinhua, an expert in pediatric neurology at Peking University First Hospital.Bao says that, on average, she diagnoses about five Rett syndrome cases monthly. "These children had usually been diagnosed with brain dysplasia and autism before," says Bao.Tang's daughter Zhizhi is one of Bao's patients.At the beginning of 2021, after discovering that her daughter showed signs of autism, as well as degradation in hand function and language, Tang arranged all kinds of examinations at a hospital in Beijing, but the results showed that everything was fine with her daughter."In a WeChat group for parents of autistic children, a father suggested that Zhizhi might be a 'Rett child', and added that this meant she wouldn't live long. I was left trembling," Tang recalls.On March 9, 2021, Tang came to Bao's clinic with 18-month-old Zhizhi, and reserved a genetic test for her. About a month later, Tang received the result of the report, which finally confirmed that Zhizhi had Rett syndrome.After Zhizhi initially showed symptoms of Rett syndrome, Tang quit her job in Beijing and the whole family moved to Cangzhou, a city in North China's Hebei province, also the hometown of Tang's husband.Tang says it was hard for her to make the transition from office worker to a stay-at-home mother, let alone the mother of a child with special needs.In May 2021, Tang established an account on Xiaohongshu, China's lifestyle-focused social media platform, to share her knowledge about Rett syndrome and details of her daughter's daily rehabilitation training. She has also been constantly answering questions for those parents who suspect their kids might have such a syndrome, and she readily accepts interview requests either from media organizations or college researchers.Wang Nan is mother to 4-year-old twins, both of whom were diagnosed with Rett syndrome when they were 15 months old. Like Zhizhi, they are also receiving rehabilitation training."Now, the rehabilitation cost of two children is 80,000 to 100,000 yuan ($11,500-14,400) a year," says Wang, adding that, in China, there is no rehabilitation institution that is exclusively set up for children with Rett syndrome yet, and this means her twins are receiving treatment together with people diagnosed with autism.Currently, there are no drugs on the market globally to treat Rett syndrome. However, families like the Tangs and the Wangs are not simply waiting. Instead, they persist in communicating on social media, sharing information about this rare syndrome with the public."I used to worry that people would discriminate against my children, but now I don't. I truly feel the value of my daughter as a child with a rare disease and our value as parents of a child like Zhizhi," says Tang. In her view, "it is most urgent for patients with Rett syndrome to be noticed and understood by the public."Rare diseases can be hard to diagnose and treatment can be difficult, and this is a major public health problem commonly faced by people around the world. In recent years, China has increased investment in medicine and health.There are now more than 4,800 prenatal screening institutions and some 500 prenatal diagnostic institutions nationwide. Authorities are also making efforts by cutting value-added tax on imports and domestic production of drugs to treat rare diseases and illnesses, and increasing the number of such treatments included in China's medical insurance catalog.Thanks to a State bulk-procurement program, which started on Jan 1, 2022, the price of a single jab of Nusinersen, a medicine used to treat spinal muscular atrophy, a rare neuromuscular disorder, fell from 700,000 yuan to 33,000 yuan in China, while the national health insurance will cover many such expenses."This news has given us great confidence. Now, Zhizhi can also receive living and rehabilitation subsidies from the government. I have faith that we will overcome all the obstacles we face," Tang says. On Sunday, the 2023 Myasthenia Gravis Public Welfare Forum was held online, attracting about 840,000 viewers.Organized by the Beijing Aili Myasthenia Gravis Care Center, the forum brought together experts and scholars from China and abroad to discuss the diagnosis, treatment and management of myasthenia gravis (MG); and issued a health report of Chinese myasthenia gravis patients in 2022.Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that anyone can be affected by. The patients often find it difficult to see things clearly, make expressions, move their hands and feet, and execute many other simple tasks.According to the forum participants, with the increasing improvements of medical systems in China, more and more medicine is being used in the treatment of MG and as a result have been included in the medical insurance catalog, enabling more patients to gain hope for their disease to be cured.Since 2014, the center has issued reports on the situations of MG patients in China six times, showing their experiences, medical burdens and the social support they received, with the aim of promoting an understanding of the illness among the general public and helping improve the quality of patients' lives.The latest report was made after surveying 1020 people, and supplemented by in-depth interviews with patients, their family members and doctors.It shows young people are more prone to this disease, with an average onset-age of 29.4. Most of the patients have varying degrees of anxiety or depression.MUKONO, Uganda — Dozens of people at the Katosi landing site in the Central Region district of Mukono lined up to get free medical care provided by a visiting Chinese medical team from the Ugandan capital of Kampala.The medical camp, which ended on Feb 17, pulled crowds from its landing site on the shores of Lake Victoria and surrounding areas.Muhammed Musisi, a patient, says that the free medical camp was a rare occurrence and that it would save on meager resources that did not have to be spent at private clinics.Patients with ailments visited the tent where Chinese doctors of different specialties were stationed. Mangeri Akirapa lined up with his 11-year-old son, who had an ear infection for three years. A Chinese ear, nose and throat specialist cleaned the boy's ears with medical instruments."I took my son to different hospitals, but there was no success. Here, they just cleaned the ears, and my son said he was feeling much better," Akirapa says.Several patients were given health counseling, while others were asked to visit hospitals for further examination.The medical camp aimed at boosting healthcare in remote areas. The medical team, in their white gowns, left their workstation, the China-Uganda Friendship Hospital in Kampala, to camp out at Katosi.The team consists of seven physicians and surgeons, specializing in gastroenterology, urology, infectious diseases, otolaryngology, anesthesiology, and traditional Chinese medicine, among other fields.The camp was held in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the deployment of the first Chinese medical team to Uganda, which arrived in 1983. Since then, a total of 229 doctors and experts from China have provided medical services to local communities in Uganda, according to Chinese embassy figures.Guo Zhiping, head of the 22nd Chinese medical team to Uganda, says at the camp that they are introducing a Chinese practice where medical experts from developed urban areas go to remote villages to extend health services."Since we are doctors from China, we want to bring this tradition to the Ugandan people. We will give them physical examinations and health advice," Guo says shortly before the medical camp began."This way, we can improve the health awareness of local people," she adds.Guo says working with Ugandan counterparts has been mutually beneficial, involving knowledge and skills transfer."We both benefit a lot from this process, and it is good cooperation between us," she adds.Local officials around Katosi praised the Chinese medical team for holding the camp in their area, noting that access to free health care is important, especially for low-income earners.The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Uganda also donated mosquito nets for the officials to distribute.Jiang Jiqing, economic and commercial counselor to the Chinese embassy in Uganda, shed further light on China's efforts to send medical teams to boost healthcare provision over the last four decades.She noted that in 2012, China provided a grant to set up a China-Uganda Friendship Hospital with 100 sickbeds.There, the Chinese team works with its Ugandan counterparts to perform surgeries and deliver other medical services."We are also doing joint research and delivering training programs from time to time," Jiang adds.Xinhua  Following a successful six-month probationary period, a mental health center in Chengdu, the capital of Southwest China's Sichuan province, has officially welcomed two dogs to carry out psychological assistance therapy.The dogs are part of the animal-assisted therapy, or AAT, in the treatment process of emotionally disturbed patients carried out by the Fourth People's Hospital of Chengdu. This marks the first time that AAT has been implemented in Southwest China, and highlights the hospital's innovative approach to mental health treatment.According to Chen Jiajia, who works with the hospital, the two dogs, named Lidabao and Xuegao, were previously deployed at nursing homes for seniors and orphanages before joining the hospital.The dogs used in the treatment have been carefully selected from many family pets that have undergone specialized training to develop strong bonds with humans.Given that they reside with their owners, the therapy dogs are expected to exert a welcoming and serene influence over the treatment process, and the dog's owners are also allowed on the site.Having passed rigorous evaluations, both dogs were granted official working certificates and currently provide treatment twice a week."AAT has proved to be a successful method for treating depression and social anxiety, and has been extensively employed in treatment programs overseas, aiding in the recovery of patients," Chen says.Chen adds that earlier in January, a severely depressed boy, who didn't talk to anyone and even wrote a suicide note at one point, took part in the trial. During their initial encounter, the dog seemed to sense his depression and instinctively nestled into his arms.The boy, who never usually showed his emotions, couldn't hide his surprise, and later shared a story about himself and his pet, Chen explains.The profound experience with the dog had a transformative effect on the boy's emotional state, leading him to open up to the psychologists and engage wholeheartedly in his treatment. As a result, he made remarkable progress and was eventually discharged from the hospital with a newfound sense of hope and optimism.According to Chen, the interaction between patients and dogs can be instrumental in helping patients open up emotionally. The process is further facilitated by the participation of psychologists who provide timely counseling and treatment.During treatment, psychologists will give careful consideration to what the patient is saying in order to identify any topics of interest. By establishing a genuine and trusting relationship with each patient, the psychologists can eventually create a supportive environment that is conducive to follow-up psychotherapy.Treatment frequency will be adjusted according to each patient's needs and response to therapy, with the goal of providing more effective care for a greater number of patients, according to the hospital authorities.Chinese researchers have recently put forward evidence for improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease with selenium-enriched foods and ingredients, according to the Institute of Microbiology under Guangdong Academy of Sciences.The new study indicates that selenium-enriched ingredients can inhibit inflammation and oxidative stress, showing the potential of a new dietary strategy for AD patients.AD is a neurological disease characterized by memory loss and declining learning capacity, which can impair an individual's ability to perform daily activities and worsen their quality of life. There is a growing interest in selenium-enriched ingredients in the study of AD.A joint study team with researchers from the Institute of Microbiology under Guangdong Academy of Sciences and other institutions proposed the potential interventional mechanism of selenium-enriched ingredients for improving the condition of those suffering with AD.The ingredients are ubiquitous in many plants and microorganisms, such as yeast and mushrooms.The study also shows that enzymatic hydrolysis and physical processing, such as thermal, high pressure and microwave treatment, are the main techniques to modify the properties of dietary selenium.The study results have been published in the journal Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition.Not even slightly alarmed by the thin acupuncture needles penetrating her body, the patient remained calm as she received treatment from the age-old healing practice.Tatenda Chimbunde, the acupuncturist who was under the watchful eye of a senior physician all the time, recently graduated from a traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture personnel training course at the Zimbabwe-China TCM and Acupuncture Center at Parirenyatwa Hospital in the capital Harare.On a typical day, Chimbunde can barely catch a breath as she attends to patients who flock to the center to receive treatment free of charge."I graduated from the China Pharmaceutical University last year as a pharmacist. During my time in China, I also learned the identification of traditional Chinese plants which are used as herbal medicine," Chimbunde says.Chimbunde has mastered the art of multitasking. She not only excels in acupuncture, but also speaks fluent Chinese and provides translation services between locals and Chinese visitors at the center."Most of my time, I practice as a pharmacist. As I have a certificate, I also practice acupuncture alongside the Chinese doctors," says Chimbunde.She is one of 10 healthcare workers who successfully graduated from an acupuncture training course in December."During the first days (of the training), we were just overwhelmed seeing how the doctors did everything, and we were wondering if we would also be able to do that. Then, we did the theory part, where we learned the in-depth knowledge about acupuncture, its origins, and how it is used in therapeutics," she says.Besides acupuncture, Chimbunde learned about cupping, a deep tissue massage and detoxification technique, which is another component of TCM. "I also learned what we call moxibustion. Moxibustion is mostly used to expel cold from our bodies," she says.The Zimbabwe-China TCM and Acupuncture Center was established in 2020 as part of efforts to offer Zimbabweans affordable medical alternatives.The introduction of the acupuncture training course was meant to make the service more accessible to Zimbabweans as more people seek TCM treatment.Chimbunde's mentor is Zhu Wei, a TCM doctor and the head of the Chinese medical team in Zimbabwe."I taught Tatenda acupuncture, moxibustion, scrapping, cupping, massage, etc. She has learned a lot. At present, she can do acupuncture for the patients," says Zhu.Chimbunde says, in her experience with acupuncture, she has seen patients recover from migraine headaches, lower back pain, joint pains and other ailments.Besides her qualifications as a pharmacist and acupuncturist, Chimbunde has immersed herself in Chinese culture, learning the language and martial arts."I am glad to say that I managed to learn the Chinese language when I studied in China. Apart from being a pharmacist and acquiring acupuncture skills, learning the Chinese language has widened my horizon," she says.Zimbabwe and China share a long history of cooperation in the health sector. Since 1985, China has dispatched 19 medical teams to the southern African country.In Zimbabwe, traditional knowledge systems and medicines play an important role as an affordable source of treatment.The site of the ancient Luoyang capital in today's Henan province has recently seen the discovery of over 80 meters of water channels dating back to the Wei (220-265) and Jin (265-420) dynasties. It indicates the maturity of techniques used to build water conservancy facilities and the capability of water resource utilization and environmental management of the time.The excavation on the Qianqiu Gate site of the ancient palace started in 2021, and the researchers later found the large-scale underground water channels beneath the gate site's square.So far, four water channels have been discovered, all stone culverts running side by side from southwest to northeast. The channels were confirmed to have been built together and follow a unified construction plan, says Guo Xiaotao with the Institute of Archaeology from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Such water conservancy facilities, with large-scale layouts and delicate designs, are the first to be spotted during the excavation work on the Luoyang ancient city.The manhole covers above the channels also have square holes to facilitate rainwater collection. The ruins of the water channels are believed to have introduced water from outside sources into the palace city, before funneling the water into the lakes of the Xiyou Garden at the north of the imperial palace complex.The facilities were likely part of a water diversion project to the gardens inside the ancient capital's palace that were later reused by Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534), says Liu Tao with the institute.The discovery further explores the royal garden layout of Luoyang at that time and serves as a historical reference for modern urban water resource utilization, Liu adds.Luoyang city site has a history of over 1,500 years, and for about 600 years, it served as the capital city for many dynasties in ancient China.University researcher writes about his China experience and benefits of ancient treatmentIn 2009, I came to Shanghai from Iran. At that time, I was just 23. My fate in China began with a car accident in which my friend injured his hand, suffering from lasting numbness after surgeries. He tried many treatments to regain sensation, but none were effective. One day, when he was passing by an acupuncture clinic, he decided on a whim to try it, though he was skeptical. After a month, he was cured.Such effectiveness led me to develop a strong interest in Chinese medicine, and I was determined to study it in China. In 2011, I transferred to the Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and began my studies. While living and studying in Shandong, I learned that the province — home to the famous philosophers Confucius and Mencius — has a profound cultural heritage. The hospitable, honest, and humanistic qualities of the Shandong people are encoded in the local culture, often referred to as Qilu culture, harkening back to the Warring States Period (475-221 BC) kingdoms of Qi and Lu. These unique and long-lasting cultural traditions inspired me to read the Confucian classics, and I gained a deeper understanding of Chinese culture.Since I came to the beautiful mountain city of Chongqing in 2018 to work in the Center for Iranian Studies of the School of History and Culture at Southwest University, I have had more opportunities to research and promote traditional Chinese culture.Amid Covid-19 and self-isolation, people look within to lower anxiety, ease depression.On a recent Sunday afternoon, 15 young people laid cozily on colorful rugs and throw pillows arranged in a circle. Their eyes were closed, some with their legs stretched forward and others curled up, looking as if they were asleep.Kong Yi sat cross-legged before them, using a special mallet to gently hit metal bowls in front of her, arousing a sound that reverberated long inside the quiet room in downtown Shenzhen, a fast-paced southern city in Guangdong province.Following Kong's instructions, they participated in a two-hour sound healing and meditation session. Listening to the slowly fading sounds of ancient musical instruments such as singing bowls and gongs, participants reached a deeper center and a semi-conscious state.After, they were guided into imagining that they were talking to a wise man dressed in white, during which they could ask questions and get answers from the wise man in half an hour. In the final section, they were encouraged to share their inner conversations with other participants."In that session, many people asked the meaning of life at the end but everyone gave different answers from the wise man — actually themselves," said Kong, who runs a studio offering healing courses incorporated with art forms like painting, music and dance.Such spiritual, meditative experiences that can lower stress and anxiety and ease depression have become the latest option for the country's stressed-out younger generation seeking relaxation and inward exploration.Among Kong's client groups are those who are interested in art and psychological healing — educated young white-collar workers who need to relax and full-time mothers who are eager to learn and talk.Kong said: "The sleep-like phase, though only lasting half an hour, is very decompressing and relaxing, and many people wake up feeling like they've slept for a long time."Through meditation and expression, the potential for self-healing in each individual has been brought out, which is a powerful process, she said. "They get rid of some thoughts that are not beneficial to life and feel relaxed at the end," she said.The 37-year-old former university staff turned to studying art healing in recent years after being inspired on her first try in 2016. She observed that young Chinese who are open-minded are now willing to try art healing, which had little market a few years ago.Kong attributed part of the reason to the frequent quarantine and social distancing practiced in the past three years for COVID-19 epidemic prevention which has changed people's way of dealing with stress."People used to go to the cinema, KTV, shop, eat and drink but now they tend to spend more time with themselves, which is a kind of ability that needs training, so sound healing and meditation that offer inner exploration is now welcomed by the public," she said.Art therapy remains a niche in China, but Kong believes the market is expanding. In the post-pandemic era, people have growing stress relief and spiritual life needs.URUMQI — As this year's ski season got underway, Liu Zhihua joined the crowd at a ski resort and glided fluently down the piste. With only a brief break, she took a brisk turn, got onto a chairlift and was ready for another round.Liu has become a star at the resort in Urumqi, the capital of Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. Dressed in her baby blue suit and white helmet, she blends in with the other ski enthusiasts. But in fact, she is the resort's oldest skier, at age 87.Though a fluent skier now, Liu only took up the sport when she was 72. Up until then, like many old people, she would spend her days taking care of her grandchildren, watching TV or playing mahjong.Encouraged by her children, Liu got on the piste for the very first time in 2007."The first day was not easy. My waist and legs ached. But in the following days, I was able to walk on the skis," Liu recalls. "After conquering the fear of falling, I became increasingly interested in it and got addicted as time passed."Starting on the beginner slopes, Liu gradually advanced to intermediate runs, and has even got onto the advanced ones."I've taken part in a competition twice. I didn't do it for a medal. Finishing the competition without falling is enough for me," she says.When asked about the setbacks she had encountered during her years of skiing, Liu recalls that she fell over while going down a slope due to a lack of experience."But skill comes from practice. Just get used to it," she says.For Liu, skiing is also a way to keep herself young and lively. Despite being the oldest ski enthusiast at the resort, she thinks she is just as vigorous as younger skiers."No one can tell your age when everyone's in a ski suit and with snow caps and goggles on," says Liu with a smile.As her passion for the alpine sport unfolds, the industry is also gaining momentum in Xinjiang. Home to ice-and-snow tourism destinations such as Urumqi, Altay and Ili, the region has now become a paradise for winter sports lovers.Ranking first in China in terms of the latitude, temperature and elevation difference of its pistes, Urumqi has been listed among China's top 10 ice-and-snow tourism cities for six years in a row.These days, Liu skis for about two hours at a time under the protection of her instructors. Although she skis less often than in previous years, Liu is determined to continue as long as possible."I'd rather fall on a piste than lie on a sickbed," says Liu."Health and happiness are the two things that doing sports has brought to me," she says. "I don't think age has much to do with my mindset. Old or young, I have been brave and optimistic."In its fight against COVID-19, China has put the people and their health above all else. When it comes to severe cases, the elderly are considered a high-risk group. However, nationwide, a number of centenarians have been discharged from hospital after recovering from the virus, thanks to the all-out efforts of medical workers.As the country optimizes and adjusts its epidemic prevention and control measures, China is striving to achieve the goal of "protecting health and preventing severe cases" by strengthening vaccination for the elderly and improving the ability to treat acute and critical cases, among other moves. The following stories of some Chinese centenarians that have been cured exemplify the efforts in this regard.Narrow escapeA 100-year-old woman surnamed Liu recovered from COVID-19 recently and was discharged from hospital after 11 days of medical treatment at the Chongqing Public Health Medical Center in Southwest China.Liu is the eldest COVID-19 patient so far to have received treatment and recovered at the hospital in Chongqing.She had been bedridden for a long time and could not take care of herself due to various underlying illnesses. On Nov 19, Liu was in a critical condition when she was transferred to the Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, according to Li Peibo, head of the center's medical affairs department.During her hospitalization, Liu suffered two cardiac arrests due to chronic malignant arrhythmia and heart failure, but the hospital managed to bring her back. Liu recovered gradually thanks to precise medical treatment, careful nursing and tailored food preparations at the center, says Li.It was also arranged for Liu to stay in the same inpatient ward with her daughter and nanny. The three were all discharged from the hospital on the same day."It is like a medical miracle to successfully rescue and cure my mother, who is a centenarian with a severe case of COVID-19. We feel so grateful to all the medical workers and our government," says Liu's daughter.Good appetiteIt has been more than three months since 108-year-old Huang Yafen, the eldest COVID-19 patient in South China's Hainan province, was cured of her COVID-19 infection and left the hospital.On Aug 14, Huang, a member of the Li ethnic group who lives in the coastal city of Sanya, developed a cough, fever and muscle soreness, and she returned a positive result for a COVID-19 nucleic acid test. Confirmed as a mild case, she was transferred to the Haikou People's Hospital."We didn't expect that the elderly would be infected with COVID-19, and we were very worried," says Chen Guiying, Huang's granddaughter-in-law, adding that after Huang became infected, her family did not tell her the situation, fearing that she would be afraid.The hospital's expert team carefully worked out the diagnosis and treatment plan for Huang. Chen stayed with her to help her communicate with the medical staff, and the centenarian actively cooperated with the treatment.Ten days later, Huang recovered. When she was discharged from hospital, Huang gave a thumbs-up to the medical staff to show her gratitude.Chen says that Huang's health and life have not been affected, and she still has a good appetite like before. In September, her family celebrated her 108th birthday with her.Getting over the humpThe other day, Li Ti's 101-year-old mother told her that she was totally back on her feet. Li Ti felt so glad. About one month ago, however, she worried whether or not her mother who was infected with COVID-19 would recover."My mother was in a bad mental state and had a poor appetite. Nurses could only feed her some milk, apple and banana puree. However, her mind was clear, knowing that she had got COVID-19, and she felt that there would not be much hope of cure," recalls the daughter.On Nov 9, the mother, surnamed He, was admitted to the Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.Considering the high risks involved in treating elderly COVID-19 patients, Lu Chen, head of Xinjiang's COVID-19 treatment expert team, assembled medical experts from two hospitals to customize a treatment plan for He.Ten days later, when doctors informed Li Ti that the elderly patient was cured, she felt incredible. "I didn't expect my mother to really get over the hump." He was discharged from the designated COVID-19 hospital and spent several days under medical observation in another hospital before returning home.HomecomingEvery morning, a 100-year-old woman surnamed Wang does breathing exercises that she was taught by a nurse when she received COVID-19 treatment in the hospital. Wang, a resident of the city of Jilin, Northeast China's Jilin province, was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the city's epidemic resurgence in the spring. With the help of the medical team, she overcame the disease in 10 days and is now recovering well.Wang suffers from underlying conditions, including coronary heart disease, and was diagnosed as a severe case by the national medical experts' team sent to Jilin.Wang Yuhong, director of the respiratory department at Jilin Municipal Central Hospital, says that the medical team adopted tailored measures to treat the elderly patient. Initially, she was depressed and didn't like to eat and talk. It was the medics who cheered her up and helped her mental and physical condition to gradually improve."I remember the names you wrote on the medical protection suits, so please come to my home for a good meal someday," the 100-year-old told the medical staff when she was discharged from the hospital.RecoveryReceiving a call from Central China's Hunan province, the son of another centenarian COVID-19 patient in Shanghai answered it at once and expressed thanks to the medics from Hunan.The call was dialed from Changsha, capital of Hunan, from where a team of medical workers came all the way to support Shanghai and help treat local severe cases amid the city's virus resurgence earlier this year.His mother, surnamed Chen and aged 101, recovered pretty well after being discharged from hospital in May. She is the second centenarian COVID-19 patient cured by the Hunan medical team sent to Shanghai.With high blood pressure, diabetes and other underlying illnesses, the elderly patient was in critical condition. But a week's hospitalization and careful medical treatment helped her back to sound health."My mother now can watch television shows and has a good appetite," the son says.We shall winPuencog Zhoema, a 100-year-old resident in Southwest China's Tibet autonomous region, recovered from COVID-19 and was discharged from hospital earlier this month, after 25 days of medical treatment.The centenarian tested positive for the virus on Nov 6 after being infected with COVID-19 by her grandchildren.Puencog Zhoema, accompanied by her son-in-law, was admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Tibet later.Sonam Qoezhoen, Puencog Zhoema's doctor, says that the senior was diagnosed as a moderate case and showed symptoms of coughing with phlegm and shortness of breath. Meanwhile, the patient also suffers from several underlying conditions.Doctors then optimized the treatment plans for Puencog Zhoema and provided her with nursing services around the clock."The recovery of the elderly truly encouraged us. We believe that we can cure more patients through our joint efforts. We shall win," Sonam Qoezhoen says.A total of 113 COVID-19 patients in Tibet over the age of 80 have been treated and discharged from the hospital since August.Xinhua    GUANGZHOU — Sitting in her wheelchair, a 101-year-old COVID-19 patient surnamed Li expressed her thanks to the medical staff who had cared for her during the previous five days."Thank you so much. I didn't expect to be discharged so soon," says Li, a resident in Haizhu district in Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong province, which has seen a resurgence of COVID-19 infections in the past few weeks.On Nov 21, the centenarian developed a high fever, cough, shortness of breath and other symptoms, and had a positive nucleic acid test result. Due to her advanced age and underlying conditions, she was rushed to the intensive care unit at the Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital.With careful treatment, Li recovered gradually and left the ward after only five days in hospital, making her the oldest person to be discharged from the hospital's isolation ward during the latest virus resurgence.Xing Rui, director of the hospital's critical care medicine department, recalls that Li was in a critical condition when she arrived at the hospital, with complications such as unconsciousness, dehydration and cardiac insufficiency. In view of the patient's malnutrition and dehydration following the high fever, physician Wei Yi immediately arranged for rehydration to relieve her dehydration and electrolyte disturbance conditions."At that time, the elderly person had no energy and didn't respond much when spoken to," Xing says. "But the doctors and nurses cheered her up by chatting with her in Cantonese, which relaxed her."As Li also had a weak cough and poor sputum discharge, the nurses turned her over and patted her back every one to two hours, so that the sputum could be discharged smoothly. Meanwhile, the ICU nutrition team worked out a special nutrition program to meet the patient's particular situation.Two days later, Li's body temperature began to drop, her inflammatory indicators returned to normal, her physical and mental condition improved significantly, and her lung capacity improved. After expert evaluation, she was transferred from the ICU to the cardiovascular rehabilitation ward for further treatment, where she felt better and received a negative nucleic acid test result.On Nov 26, Li's condition had improved so much that she was discharged from the hospital."Because most of the elderly COVID-19 patients suffer from underlying conditions, it is relatively difficult to treat them," says Lao Yu, deputy chief physician of the hospital's cardiovascular medicine department. "It is remarkable that Li was able to prevail over the virus and recover. We sincerely wish her good health."From Nov 14 to Dec 7, the hospital received 2,016 COVID-19 patients and discharged 1,048."If you put your heart into it, you will be able to cure more patients. For aged patients with underlying conditions, ICU intervention means a better chance of survival," says Xing, adding that the hospital has reserved about 200 ICU beds for treating critically ill patients. Like a lot of other people, I sometimes have trouble going to sleep.On the 10th floor, in a spacious apartment in Beijing, there are nights when getting to sleep feels a lot like Sisyphus of Greek mythology, a man cursed by the gods to push a boulder up a hill, only to find it at the bottom again the next day.Only for me the boulder is sleep, and I regularly watch it roll right back down thinking "nope, you're not getting any shut-eye tonight."This has happened to me more times than I care to count.It happens a lot more when Christmas rolls around. Maybe it is the season. Being away from family does not help. I miss all my assorted relatives.Coming from a culture where Christmas songs begin playing on the radio in September, spending the time in another country clearly does not help in eliminating the loneliness.In my room, I toss and I turn. And toss and turn again. The eyelids refuse to fall despite being dead tired. I go to one side of the bed and then the other.One wit compared it to punching a pillow. You throw a left and then a right. You keep punching and then you end up exhausted, with the pillow staying in the same shape, seemingly laughing in your face.The appropriately named Sleep Foundation estimates a third of people globally experience unsatisfying sleep.According to the foundation, "Chronic insomnia is when a person experiences sleeping difficulties and related daytime symptoms, like fatigue and attention issues, at least three days per week for more than three months or repeatedly over years. It is estimated that about 10 percent of people have chronic insomnia disorder."See, they even have a name for it.There is a hotline for the problem in another country. It is called the Help Me Sleep Hotline at 1-833-I-Can't-Sleep for a set of tips, meditations and bedtime stories to help you get a good night's rest.I have not called them, but one day I might.The Sleep Foundation has listed a set of tips to get some sleep."One, maintain the same bedtime and wake time every day, even on weekends. Get out of bed if falling asleep is taking too long or causing anxiety."Do not consume caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine, especially near bedtime. Keep the bedroom both dark and quiet. Refrain from watching television before bed. Do not check the clock to see how long it is taking to fall asleep. Avoid eating large meals too close to bedtime."I've been known to drink coffee at night, paradoxically to relax. I need to watch TV and late in the week, I would go for a big meal to reward myself.Useful tips, but they're not for everyone.I still get to sleep, especially when I am totally fried. It's probably the cost of a modern professional life. I know I need my sleep. And I use the weekends to get it.There is also retirement, when you can opt to sleep at any time of the day if you can afford it. There goes a sleeping pattern.Thing is, I enjoy binge-watching TV too much to give it up, although that means waiting for several more months before Season 2 of House of the Dragon pops up on the television.Insomnia. You gotta love it.The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and the Shanghai Mental Health Center, also known as the Mental Health Center affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, recently released a series of products that include 10 packs of blended coffee, with each claiming to be able to address a mental status or problem such as anxiety, depression and insomnia.Each pack also comes paired with a short piece of symphonic music and a three-minute audio clip of a mental health professional's interpretation of symptoms.For example, those who scan the QR code on the pack of coffee marked "anxiety" will hear Bach's Sheep May Safely Graze, while scanning the pack titled "inferiority complex" will produce sounds of Ravel's Morning Song of the Jester.Developed by the two organizations, the products are aimed at addressing common mental health issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic."We believe music has healing power and can provide emotional support for those in need," explains Qiao Ying, a doctor at the mental health center.The new products have been an instant hit — the first 5,000 sets of coffee was sold out so quickly that even Xie Bin, the Party secretary of the mental health center, has to wait until mid-December before he can sip the coffee, which he ordered on the WeChat platform of the orchestra.This is not the first time the mental health center has sold merchandise. The institution previously sold face masks together with Shanghai Museum that were just as popular.According to Xie, the decision to sell official merchandise came about when the mental health center realized that many online vendors were selling goods that bore the institution's name and address as a joke.This joke, however, has inadvertently played a role in raising awareness about mental health and eliminating the stigma associated with mental illness, he adds."People in China used to be evasive about their mental issues, and they would be afraid to let others know about their visits to mental health specialists," Qiao says. "Today, I have seen children who proudly share their experiences of receiving counseling at our clinics, and other children have responded with feelings of envy and admiration."Regarding the decision to collaborate with the center, Zhou Ping, director of the orchestra, says that music and other art forms play positive roles in helping people through difficult times."We have quite a number of avid symphony lovers who have claimed that a particular piece of music has helped them through their difficulties. This particular piece of music would eventually lead them to other music and composers, until music becomes an indispensable part of their daily life," says Zhou."With the introduction of this coffee series we would love to see increased awareness of mental health issues. We would also consider presenting concerts aimed at helping people heal mentally in the future."WUHAN — Hu Qun, a 27-year-old case manager for AIDS patients in Central China, was lost in thought when reading the words on a silk banner gifted to her: "Thank you for your companionship along my way from the dark abyss to brightness."Thursday marked this year's World AIDS Day, which aims to raise public awareness of the disease. The thank-you gift was sent by an AIDS patient in his 20s. "I wish him all the best," says Hu.She was once a nurse with little knowledge of AIDS at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, but about three years ago, Hu began to work as a case manager in the hospital's "caring clinic". Hu now provides individualized psychological counseling and medical treatment services for AIDS patients.Over the past three years, Hu has helped nearly 800 AIDS patients. She feels fulfilled whenever those who used to be resistant to medical treatment and gave up their hopes for life gradually face their reality and bravely return to their normal life.In 2015, several major cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan, began to recruit and train such case managers to support the antiviral treatments of the country's AIDS patients. The new program seeks to help AIDS patients lift themselves up and to assist them in getting medical treatment, thus curbing the further spread of the disease.The patients often easily shrink into themselves due to social discrimination and stigma over the disease, and delay treatment out of shame and fear. They even lose control of their emotions leading to behavioral issues because of a lack of confidence to fight the virus over the long haul.In 2019, Hu joined the cause of helping AIDS patients face the disease head-on. "It's hard for them to accept the fact when their infection is confirmed. They are often unavailable when local disease prevention and control authorities conduct follow-up visits," recalls Hu."Some get depressed, self-contained and unwilling to receive any medical treatment as their family may lack enough understanding of the situation," Hu adds."Only by becoming their most trusted person can you truly help them. An eligible AIDS case manager needs to know about the disease, its antiviral treatments and relevant policies. We also need to have good communication skills and provide love and care for the patients," Luo Yanhe, head nurse of the care clinic, explains.Hu still remembers an old woman she met at the clinic, who huddled with tears in her eyes while her family kept a distance from her.Hu didn't ask about her symptoms immediately, but chose to listen to her stories first. After the patient gradually calmed down, Hu then began to extract key information about her disease and reported back to the doctor to make a tailored therapy plan.Currently, the special clinic at Jinyintan Hospital has six AIDS case managers. The number of patients there has grown from over 400 to more than 4,000 since 2015."We have online chat groups with the patients, where we can remind them to take medicine in time and answer their questions instantly. We refer to the medicine as 'candy' and always ask if the patient is OK to pick up the phone before we make the call," says Hu, adding that it is all done to better protect their privacy.The managers also participate in training programs, collaborate with social organizations to carry out auxiliary treatment, discuss how to provide patients with guidance on health, medication compliance and other aspects, and offer necessary psychological counseling for both patients and their families."I'm looking forward to wider social participation in fighting the disease so that everyone can learn more about AIDS, treat the patients equally, and there will be no discrimination against the infected," says Hu, adding that she will continue to help the patients with love and care and make them feel accepted and understood.HARBIN－With her silver hair, 68-year-old Xu Lili stands out in a crowd of young people.Xu goes square dancing every night with her friends in the center of Harbin, Northeast China's Heilongjiang province. Their dancing has strong rhythm and a wide range of movements, making it more like disco than the slow traditional Chinese square dancing. Xu is the organizer and the only senior taking part.Apart from Xu, most dancers are in their 20s. "Grandma Xu may be old, but we all learn from her," says Zhang Dongkai, 23. "She is our leader.""Most of my friends are young people. I have danced with them for more than 10 years. I can't do that kind of slow dance," Xu says, adding that dancing is the happiest part of her day. It not only keeps her fit, but also makes her happy.The contrast between her age and her dancing has not only endeared her to those around her, but also made her famous online, with many netizens praising her dancing and optimistic attitude.Instead of just looking after grandchildren, increasing numbers of elderly Chinese are enjoying their own lives.Wang Yun, 72, goes to a dance class for seniors every week at Harbin University, which was founded in 1984 and is one of the earliest universities for the elderly in China. Hundreds of thousands have graduated from the institution over the past three decades.The average age of Wang's dance class is over 60. Teacher Li Yongxia says she has taught dance there for more than 10 years. Many students were not in good shape when they first came, but dancing changed their attitude toward life.Harbin University for the elderly is very popular. Though there are branch schools in every district of Harbin, many courses are full soon after the online registration channels are opened.Qu Wenyong, a sociology professor at Heilongjiang University who has been following the elderly care industry for many years, says the ages from 60 to 70 have become part of the "golden decade" for China's elderly as the country's average life expectancy increases. "They are healthy, they have time and they demand a higher quality of life," Qu says.Many elderly people in China also like to share their lives on the internet.Not long ago, a video of 66-year-old Deng Xiaohui walking a catwalk with her partner in Harbin's Central Street received more than 1 million likes on social media."I loved fashion shows when I was young, and I realized my dream after I retired." Deng has been studying the catwalk for five years at a modeling school in Harbin.Wang Deshun, 86, is known to many netizens in China. He started working out at 50, and walked the runways of China Fashion Week at 79.A famous health tip says you'd better drink eight glasses of water (about two liters) a day. However, the results of a new study suggest that fewer are needed.An international group led by scientists at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology in China found that the average daily water intake of a man in his 20s should be 1.5 to 1.8 liters, while it should be 1.3 to 1.4 liters for a female in the same age group.The study published recently in the journal Science described, for the first time, a set of equations to predict human water turnover, an indicator reflecting the amount of water used by the body each day.The researchers investigated 5,604 participants from the ages of 8 days to 96 years, and from more than 20 countries, using isotope-tracking methods.They have found that a man aged 20 to 35 consumes 4.2 liters of water each day, while a woman aged 30 to 60 consumes 3.3 liters, with the water requirements dropping as he or she ages.Since the metabolism and water exchange on skin can provide 15 percent, while food and drinking respectively contributing half of the remaining 85 percent, people are encouraged to drink less than 45 percent of the total daily turnover, according to the researchers."The majority of people perhaps don't have to drink eight glasses of water a day," says Zhang Xueying, co-first author of the paper and an assistant research fellow at the SIAT.The total water input and output vary according to multiple factors, including body size, physical activity, air temperature, humidity and altitude, according to the study."The equations can be applied to individuals around the world," says Zhang."Just input their basic physiological indicators and the temperature and humidity they live in."However, people living in countries with a low human development index have higher water turnover than people in high-HDI countries, she adds.The study marks the first step towards a personalized prediction of water requirements, says the paper's co-corresponding author John Speakman who also works at the SIAT.Traditional Chinese medicine is providing a viable medical alternative to Zimbabweans as more people turn to natural remedies.Since a TCM center was opened at Parirenyatwa Hospital in the capital, Harare, in 2020, thousands of locals with different ailments have thronged the center to receive treatment free of charge.Charity Nyakurimwa, one of the patients who have received treatment at the center, says she opted for acupuncture due to its noninvasive nature.Nyakurimwa had sciatic nerve pain on her right leg because of the nature of her job — she was standing most of the time, so the pain was now radiating to her back. Then she found the TCM center which gave acupuncture to patients."So I came in and had acupuncture done on my right gluteal muscle and my back. After that, the pain was greatly relieved," Nyakurimwa says.Another patient, Catherine Sadza, who has arthritis, says she has witnessed significant progress since she came for her first acupuncture session."I came here with a problem with my neck, my hand and my knees. Now I am feeling better than before," she says.TCM is a holistic ancient system of health and wellness that has been used in China for thousands of years. It encompasses several therapeutic methods that include acupuncture, cupping, Chinese herbs, and tai chi.Zhu Wei, a TCM practitioner at the center and captain of the 19th Chinese medical team in Zimbabwe, says the ancient knowledge system is proving to be a viable medical alternative for local patients."It can help to unblock meridians and bring back balance to the body. People get ill because of imbalance of the body, so acupuncture can bring back balance in the body, and people can be kept in health," Zhu says.The physician says TCM offers many tangible benefits."More than 5,000 people came and received acupuncture treatment. They have spread the information to their relatives, so at present more patients come to try acupuncture treatment," he says.To meet the growing demand for Chinese medicine in Zimbabwe, the TCM center started offering acupuncture training to local health personnel in July."We are planning to train more local doctors who can specialize in acupuncture, so they can help more people," Zhu says.Richard Mutingwende, a homeopathy specialist and a TCM trainee at the center, says Chinese medicine has many advantages."It can address so many health conditions, such as arthritis, spinal injuries, diabetes and high blood pressure," he says."I will be doing acupuncture, moxibustion and tai chi. Such types of treatment are very safe and noninvasive," he adds.Soo Bishop, a patient who sought medical treatment at the center after having muscle spasms in her shoulder, neck and head, says that as a form of natural intervention, traditional treatments are beneficial.Bishop says her condition improved a lot following her acupuncture sessions at the center.Tatenda Chimbunde, a pharmacist and a trainee at the center, says TCM is more beneficial since it addresses the cause of the problem rather than just treating the symptoms.After witnessing firsthand the benefits of traditional remedies, Chimbunde hopes to pursue a career in TCM."In the near future, I hope to be able to practice acupuncture on many people with different ailments, as well as working in the public sector or in the private sector," she adds.Zimbabwe and China share a long period of cooperation in the health sector. Since 1985, China has dispatched 19 medical teams to the southern African country.Lotte Lustig Marcus, a Jewish refugee in Shanghai in 1939, was a woman whose strength of character, intelligence, resourcefulness and courage will be remembered, Ho Manli reports.Lotte Lustig Marcus, one of the last of the "Shanghailanders" — the 18,000 European Jewish refugees who fled to Shanghai to escape Nazi persecution during World War II — died at her home in Carmel, California, on Nov 19 at age 95.A clinical psychologist well known for treating trauma sufferers, she was also active in humanitarian and educational work with migrant workers and multiple sclerosis patients.In March 1938, two months before her 11th birthday, Lotte Lustig saw Adolf Hitler march triumphantly into her native Vienna after the Anschluss, the union of Austria and Nazi Germany, which subsequently shattered the third-largest Jewish community in Europe and precipitated a refugee crisis.The lives of 185,000 Austrian Jews changed overnight under the ensuing Nazi reign of terror. Lotte's father Oskar was fired from his job at the Austrian State Bank. Because she was Jewish, Lotte could no longer attend school or participate in the ice-skating shows she loved."Lotuses moving gracefully in the wind" and "swallows returning to nest" are phrases that evoke images of nature at its best. But they serve another purpose. They are also the names of tricks in the ancient Chinese game cuju, a forerunner of modern soccer.Li Weipeng, the seventh-generation inheritor of cuju in China, demonstrated these tricks during the China-Qatar youth cuju exchange on Nov 21 in Doha, Qatar, where the World Cup is in full swing.Li also led Chinese and Qatari youth players, wearing traditional cuju costumes, to sample the ancient game and see for themselves the similarities and differences between cuju and soccer.A cuju photo exhibition was displayed at the event, which attracted the attention of the guests and youth players from both countries. The exhibition introduced the history of cuju and the background of the ancient Chinese game.Cuju, which has been traced back to the Linzi district of Zibo, Shandong province, was acknowledged by FIFA as the earliest form of soccer in 2004. The word cu means to kick, while ju refers to an ancient type of leather ball filled with feathers.The event is hosted by the Chinese and Foreign Cultural Exchange Center of China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism, and Zibo city's government.Chinese Ambassador to Qatar Zhou Jian said at the event that cuju is one of the spiritual symbols and part of the cultural essence of Chinese civilization."I hope that this event will be an opportunity to attract more Qatari people to understand and perceive Chinese culture, and promote the exchange and mutual appreciation of Chinese and Qatari cultures," Zhou says.China fully supports Qatar in hosting the World Cup, Zhou says, and the two countries have carried out fruitful cooperation in many fields, including the construction of the World Cup venues, public transportation and broadcasting.The popularity of cheerleading in Pu'er can be attributed to a young man's passion, Xing Wen reports.A scene of gorgeous women in tight-fitting clothes boisterously performing stunts, jumps and dance moves at sporting events would first come to mind when thinking of cheerleading.An all-male cheerleading squad from Pu'er University, Southwest China's Yunnan province, is set to change the stereotypical image of cheerleaders.The bouncy, suntanned young men wow the audience with their mechanically precise choreography, energetic tumbling and sophisticated routines. The competitive cheerleaders have their own platform as athletes rather than simply cheering for others in sports.Since its initiation in 2017, the squad has won a number of medals at competitions of varied scales, including the National Cheerleading Championships, Asia-Pacific Cup Cheerleading Open and the International Cheer Union World Cheerleading Championships.Such feats have sparked an explosion of interest in cheerleading among younger students across Pu'er city. It has become a common practice in primary and middle schools there as an important exercise for students during recess.The popularity of cheerleading in Pu'er can be attributed to a young man's passion in promoting it: Li Dong, 31, a teacher at Pu'er University, ran the squad from scratch and developed a reputation through organizing intensive trainings day after day. He used to learn gymnastics when he was young.After entering Yunnan Arts University, he got to know about competitive cheerleading and founded a club. He became obsessed with cheerleading — it has many forms and allows participants to be innovative in designing routines."I also like to collaborate with others," Li says.Over time, he wanted to become a teacher who could run a cheerleading squad at college level.After completing his postgraduate program from Yunnan Normal University, as he had wished, Li became a teacher at Pu'er University in his hometown. He began to select students from the university's school of physical education to be cheerleaders in 2017."Basically, our squad members don't have the athleticism as outstanding as those from the country's top sport universities, so we have to train harder," Li says.He also found that a squad should form its own unique style to catch the eyes of judges at different competitions. Then he decided to form an all-male squad that could show moves that required more physical strength and endurance. He also integrated kung fu and other elements of traditional Chinese culture into the squad's routines.The stories of such historical figures as the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) scholar and calligrapher Tang Bohu and the legendary martial artist Huang Feihong would also be told through their performances.Yunnan is inhabited by more than 20 ethnic groups. To enlarge the population that practices cheerleading in the province, Li has sought to design routines that involve cultural elements of different ethnic groups."For instance, when we planned to promote cheerleading in schools in Mojiang Hani autonomous county, Pu'er, we first worked out a routine based on the traditional style of singing and dancing of the Hani people. That would be better accepted by people there," he explains.What motivated Li to throw himself into cultivating talent for competitive cheerleading was mainly his eagerness to help more students open new vistas in life.Many students in the university are from remote mountainous areas in the province. They have to help with farm work at home during holidays and lack the chance to see the outside world, Li says."There was one time when I led the squad to compete in Shanghai. On arriving at the Pudong International Airport, a student turned to me and blurted a remark that made a strong impression on me," Li recalls."He said that if he weren't in Shanghai with me, the most possible reason for him to visit the metropolis would be as a migrant worker seeking work opportunities," Li adds."I hope their participation in the sport (cheerleading) brings them more opportunities to see with their own eyes different life possibilities in the outside world and empowers them to tap into their potential," Li says.The opportunity has inspired Zhang Haomeng, a 22-year-old member of the university's cheerleading squad, to pursue bigger goals. He used to be shy and didn't talk much.In 2019, as the squad got entry to the year's China (Nanjing) Cheerleading Open, for the first time Zhang traveled to Nanjing, Jiangsu province where he met more than 2,000 domestic and international cheerleaders and watched their performances in various styles. He felt an upsurge of emotions when the squad was announced winner in the event's Open Lg Team Cheer Pom.Confucian teachings that espouse vigilance help China chart a stable course, Xu Haoyu reports.China's ancient wisdom informs its contemporary leadership. In this series, China Daily explores how age-old principles and philosophies continue to steer the country's governance.In times of peace, one must be alert to danger, and in times of stability, one must be mindful of the potential for chaos — this Confucian wisdom, originating more than 2,000 years ago, is still a golden rule for many people in China.Such an idea forms an integral part of the spiritual consciousness of Chinese culture and is an important expression of the inner character of Chinese civilization, according to Wu Genyou, a professor at the School of Philosophy of Wuhan University in Hubei province."The awareness of unexpected developments not only requires individuals to consciously strengthen their moral cultivation, but also requires people to have a broader vision, to care not only for themselves, but also for others, society and humanity as a whole," says Wu.Wu writes in his book Zhi Buwang Luan, An Buwang Wei (do not forget chaos in times of good governance, do not forget danger during peacetime) about Confucianism: "From a dialectical perspective, ancient Chinese explained the universal truth: Complacency might lead to chaos; security and danger are close friends; and misfortune and blessings go together."He says it's reflected in history and the rise and fall of ancient Chinese dynasties, illustrating the need to "stay alert for potential distress even in times of peace, and stay alert for possible turmoil even in times of stability".This idea is so all-encompassing that it is not limited to the political sphere, but extends to the economic, military and diplomatic spheres as well, he says.Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said at a ceremony marking the centenary of the CPC on July 1, 2021: "On the journey ahead, we must demonstrate stronger vigilance and always be prepared for potential danger, even in times of calm. We must adopt a holistic approach to national security that balances development and security imperatives, and implement the national rejuvenation strategy within a wider context of the once-in-a-century changes taking place in the world. We need to acquire a full understanding of the new features and requirements arising from the change to the principal contradiction in Chinese society and the new issues and challenges stemming from a complicated international environment. We must be both brave and adept in carrying out our struggle, forging new paths and building new bridges wherever necessary to take us past all risks and challenges."Food securityToday, the world is in a period of great development, change and adjustment. As China grows into a global power, it's facing increasing risks and challenges, especially in the fields of finance, technology, network information, energy, ecology and food security.China's total grain production has remained stable for seven consecutive years at over 650 billion kilograms.Last year, grain production reached a record high of 682.85 billion kg, and per capita grain holdings reached 483 kg, higher than the internationally recognized grain safety line of 400 kg, achieving basic grain self-sufficiency and food security.According to the 2022 Global Report on Food Crises released by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 193 million people from 53 countries or regions suffered a food crisis or further food insecurity in 2021, an increase of nearly 40 million more people compared with 2020.The UN's World Food Programme has warned that people might be facing "the biggest food crisis since World War II", with up to 1.7 billion people exposed to the destruction of food, energy and financial systems.A popular saying among young internet users in China goes something like, "we are not living in an era without hunger but a country without it".As a major grain producer, China has also put great attention on curbing food waste in recent years."The issue of food waste is shocking and distressing. We need to maintain a sense of crisis regarding food security, especially amid the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the fact that China has scored consecutive bumper harvests," Xi said on Aug 11, 2020."It is necessary to further enhance public awareness of the issue, effectively cultivate thrifty habits and foster a social environment where waste is shameful and thriftiness is applaudable," he said.The National People's Congress, the country's top legislature, enacted an Anti-Food Waste Law in April last year, to offer legal backing to the country's efforts to safeguard food security and promote traditional virtue of thrift.Under this law, food service providers could face a fine of anywhere between 1,000 yuan ($140) and 10,000 yuan, if they induce or mislead consumers into ordering excessive quantities of food that causes waste and refuse to rectify the problem after being warned by market supervision departments.Catering service providers are allowed to reward customers who finish their food, and charge customers who leave an excessive amount of leftovers a disposal fee when the rates for the charge are clearly advertised.In 2021, about 4 million people online purchased food that was approaching its expiration date.According to the China Market Analysis and Consumer Research Report 2020 published by iiMedia Research, 47.8 percent of consumers of expiring food in China are aged between 26 and 35, with young people being the main buyers."These figures show Chinese people's concern and attitude," said Zhang Lijun, vice-president of the China Federation of Industry and Commerce, in a previous interview.Carbon neutralityThe ancient philosophy of ju'an siwei (staying alert for potential distress in times of peace) is also reflected in China's efforts to tackle climate change. It is no longer an academic topic, but has drawn the attention of policymakers and is gradually penetrating all levels of society.More than 100 countries around the world have proposed carbon neutrality goals, which are to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century, in order to effectively combat global warming caused by the combustion of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of industrial operations.This requires the vigorous improvement of energy efficiency and clean, low-carbon utilization of coal, as well as disruptive breakthroughs in renewable energy production, consumption, storage, transmission and distribution. The further promotion of industrial transformation and the development of green and low-carbon industries is also a must.Xi mentioned in his report to the 20th National Congress of the CPC on Oct 16, "Reaching peak carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality will mean a broad and profound systemic socioeconomic transformation."The country's continuous green efforts show the government's dedication and foresight in tackling the environmental crises of today and in the future, which is a fine example of following the ancient philosophy of ju'an siwei.On July 16 last year, the much-anticipated national carbon market officially went live for trading.Hubei's pilot carbon trading market has been running for nearly 10 years, incorporating 373 emission-controlled enterprises. It controls 275 million metric tons of carbon emissions, accounting for about 45 percent of the province's total, and 64 percent of the enterprises have achieved a reduction in total carbon emissions or their intensity.Qi Shaozhou, the current director of the Research Center for Climate Change and Energy Economy at Wuhan University, who is also the director of the Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Carbon Emission Trading, hopes that the market-based economic incentives and pressures provided by the carbon market will help China achieve carbon neutrality."The purpose of building China's carbon market is not only to restrain high-emission enterprises and force them to reduce emissions, but also to support the development of new energy enterprises and active emission reduction enterprises to achieve carbon neutrality," says Qi."The need for climate investment and financing is huge, and there is an urgent need for innovation in investment and financing tools, methods, valuation and institutional mechanisms of the national carbon market," he says.A Frenchman has realized his dream in China by becoming an inheritor of centuries-old traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Philippe Emmanuel Couste said it is his lifelong pursuit to promote TCM and help treat patients.TIANJIN — Traditional Chinese medicine physician Wang Wenhao has become a celebrity among patients at the Huayuanjie community's health service center in Tianjin.The warmhearted 34-year-old started his TCM practice at the center earlier this year, and now receives around 15 patients every day. He also provides daily physical therapy for a further 15 patients, sometimes making home visits to provide acupuncture treatment and prepare medicine for those with mobility issues."The community health service center is useful because it provides easier access for patients. By working at the grassroots level, I can learn more about different illnesses and continuously improve myself," Wang says.TCM physicians at the community level are a key part of "a 15-minute TCM health circle "created by the municipal health authorities to provide convenient and better medical services for residents."TCM services at the grassroots level are the foundation of the development of TCM, and Tianjin is striving to promote TCM to benefit more residents," says Yu Chunquan, head of the TCM bureau of the municipal health commission.China has launched a special three-year program to promote the role of TCM in enhancing public health. It will focus on eight aspects, including the application of TCM in maternal and pediatric healthcare, elderly care, preventive treatment for chronic diseases, adolescent myopia and obesity, and the popularization of TCM knowledge.Data shows that there are more than 260 community health service centers and township clinics in Tianjin, and all of them are able to provide such services."This means that people can reach the nearest health service center and receive TCM treatment in just 15 minutes," Yu explains.TCM services at Huayuanjie community have won recognition from the locals. "Some 40 percent of the 800 outpatients received by the center every day ask for TCM services," says Zhang Na, the center's director."We see more young patients today choosing TCM, and we will continue to provide better TCM services for different groups of people," Zhang adds.Mu Ruina, a resident living in Zhongshanmenjie community, Hedong district, says she is a beneficiary of the 15-minute TCM health circle."We signed with a family doctor who can offer TCM services. Since our children are not in Tianjin, the home-visit service can solve our problems," the 58-year-old says.Nearly 30 percent of people in the Zhongshanmenjie community are aged over 65. Taking into account the aging population, the community has opened seven health service centers and established 21 teams of family doctors to provide better services for locals.Meanwhile, over 80 percent of grassroots medical and health institutions in Tianjin are able to provide TCM rehabilitation services, according to Yu."The next step is to train 5,000 TCM practitioners for grassroots-level health institutions, providing better services for locals and meeting their healthcare needs," Yu says.Mining rare-earth elements has long been considered a dirty business, as it can lead to water and soil pollution, but a new technology developed by Chinese scientists may reverse the trend, offering a greener alternative for the industry.Rare-earth elements, especially heavy REEs, are an essential part of many high-tech devices, from the engines of electric cars and smartphones, to LED lights. More than 90 percent of the global heavy REE demand is sourced from ion-adsorption deposits, which form within weathering crusts. However, conventional mining applies excessive usage of chemical agents to recover REEs from these deposits, not only exhibiting low efficiency but also polluting the environment.Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry proposed a new approach in the journal Nature Sustainability earlier this month, showing that employing electrokinetic mining techniques to extract REEs from weathering crusts can be both clean and economical.Using this approach, researchers generated an electric field by putting electrodes on the top and bottom of a volume of soil. The electrokinetic effect can accelerate the migration of REEs, reducing the need for harmful chemical agents.To evaluate the feasibility of the new method, they carried out several experiments of different scales. Results suggested that the new method outperformed traditional mining techniques.For instance, the scaled-up experiments achieved a recovery efficiency of 96 percent within 67 hours by using electrokinetics. Using the conventional technique, it was only 62 percent at 130 hours.The difference between the impact of the old and the new approach was even more significant in an on-site field test: Using electrokinetics can achieve a recovery efficiency higher than 90 percent, an 80 percent decrease in polluting agent usage and a 70 percent reduction in metallic impurities.The study confirmed that this novel electrokinetic technology enabled green, efficient and selective recovery of REEs. Researchers also noted that the new method has great potential for use in the mining of other critical metals under conditions in which the metals exist in ionic states.YAOUNDE, Cameroon — Before 6 am, Berline Fangan had already taken her seat at a makeshift traditional Chinese medicine clinic just outside the Bangou sub-divisional hospital in the West Region of Cameroon.The mother of two was nervous and in pain as she explained that her untreated 10-year-old joint problem was wearing her down. She, like many of the other patients who visited the clinic, had been treated by conventional doctors over the years, but found the prescribed drugs ineffective." (The drugs) relieved me a bit …but five minutes later the pain came back," the 53-year-old woman says. She and hundreds of Cameroonian residents of Bangou and Bamendjou, Upper Plateau division, were waiting for a team of Chinese specialist medics who arrived in the region last week for a two-day free consultation and treatment campaign.Bangou and Bamendjou, with a population of more than 100,000, are surrounded by many rural communities widely dispersed through wild terrain, and have only two hospitals.Villagers are often troubled by health problems like gastritis, typhoid, malaria, cataracts and rheumatism. But most of them cannot afford medical services.People came from far and wide in the impoverished region to receive free medical treatment."My brother informed me of the health campaign. I left Douala (Cameroon's commercial hub, more than 200 kilometers away from Bangou) at midnight and arrived here at 6:30 in the morning," says a retired history teacher and father of five who says he has been suffering from cramps since 2016.Martine Kouamo stood looking dejected at her 10-year-old son Christian Djomo, who had been suffering from testicular pain. His twin sister had neck strain, and one part of her body was exhibiting weakness.The exact causes of the ailments were unknown."I tried to use conventional medicine (on Christian) for three years, but in vain. I think Chinese doctors will help because they work well," Kouamo says.As the sun rose over Bangou and Bamendjou, a good number of patients began taking turns to register, consult and then received treatment from doctors in various departments, who were here as members of the 22nd Chinese medical team to Cameroon.Fangan was among the first patients to be consulted.She was carefully administered an acupuncture therapy, an ancient Chinese method of treatment in which fine needles are inserted through the skin at specific points to treat various physical conditions."As I speak to you the pain is gone," Fangan says after the treatment. "I feel better. In the morning, I couldn't swing my neck like this …but now I can swing behind, left and right without problem."Her boy, Christian, was administered medicine, and hoped it would help him recover.For the first time since 2016, Justin Kouamou, 71, felt relieved. Before this, he had visited doctors several times for an unnamed sickness, but the results were not satisfactory."The Chinese doctors inserted needles in my skin and it magically alleviated my pain. I am still amazed by the wonders of that treatment," Kouamou says.More than 1,600 patients were consulted and treated during the campaign, which ran from Oct 29 to 30, says Paul Sikapin, mayor of Bangou."I asked firmly that such a campaign should be organized next year," Sikapin says.Fabrice Dubila, a medical doctor in Bangou sub-divisional hospital, says Cameroonian and Chinese doctors worked shoulder to shoulder in treating patients and offering much-needed medical services during the campaign."This is a great opportunity to learn from our colleagues overseas. So far we have collaborated on the diagnosis of some patients and I have also learned some other diagnostic techniques I can use to diagnose some particular diseases, notably lipoma and other pathologies. I think it is a very good opportunity to have witnessed acupuncture here in Bangou," Dubila says.Theodore Datouo, deputy speaker of Cameroon's National Assembly and also a member of parliament for the Upper Plateau constituency, says the campaign was a mark of friendly relations between Cameroon and China."China has always assisted Cameroon in the health sector and this time it is the turn of the West Region to benefit," says Datouo, the main organizer of the campaign."This campaign is for the health and well-being of the population, and when the population is healthy, economic development will follow. We thank China for this cooperation and the Chinese medical team in Cameroon," he adds.Guo Jun, head of the Chinese medical team in Cameroon says China has dispatched 22 medical teams and 736 medical professionals to Cameroon since 1975 to diagnose diseases, relieve patients' pains and improve local health conditions and medical expertise."Today's free clinic is just an example. In the future, we will further deepen cooperation and contribute to promoting medical assistance projects and improving China-Cameroon friendship," Guo says.Besides the free acupuncture clinic, the Chinese medical team, along with the Beijing Urban Construction Group, donated drugs and protective materials to local hospitals.Multinational pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is flexing its innovative muscle at the ongoing fifth China International Import Expo in Shanghai, showcasing its product portfolio of breakthrough innovations and medical solutions.At its 1,000-square-meter exhibition booth, a record size for the four-time CIIE participant, more than 20 innovative products and treatment plans for cancers, vaccines, anti-infection, inflammation and immunization, and rare diseases were on display. One of them is making its Asia debut and three have their China premieres, the company said.Innovation lies at the core of Pfizer's competitiveness, said Jean-Christophe Pointeau, president for Pfizer Global Biopharma Business in China.The company focuses on developing innovative products and high-quality treatment solutions in the Chinese market, leveraging its product lineup and digitalized market model to satisfy the health needs of patients, Pointeau said.Since its entry into the Chinese market in 1989, Pfizer has brought in more than 60 products, including original drugs and vaccines.The company plans to introduce 25 more new products, therapeutic applications and dosage forms to Chinese patients between 2021 and 2025.Since December 2021, Pfizer has got the green light for 11 of its new products and therapeutic applications in China, according to the company.As of July, the group has 104 research projects underway worldwide, including those on Phase One clinical trials or filed for registration and approval, Pointeau said.The fifth China International Import Expo, kicking off on Saturday, is offering great opportunities for internationally leading pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences to showcase its new discoveries in virology, oncology and mycology sciences, the company said.This year marks the 35th anniversary of Gilead Sciences' establishment. With the vision of "creating a healthier world", the company has been committed to promoting drug innovation in a bid to treat diseases such as HIV, viral hepatitis and cancer.At its booth during the fair, the company is exhibiting a group of new launches in China, looking forward to setting up more partnerships to improve new drug accessibility and eliminate barriers for the public to pursue their well-being and health, and promote the construction of the"Healthy China 2030" initiative with joint efforts.Gilead Sciences launched China operations in 2017 in Shanghai. In recent years, it has grown from zero to a large-scale company with more than 600 employees. Nine of its products have been launched in the Chinese market and seven of them have entered the national reimbursement drug list. It has launched businesses across more than 80 cities in China.The CIIE is an excellent platform for a company to expand the opening-up scale, set up cooperative partnerships and achieve win-win results, the company said.The company is tapping into the field of oncology and mycology in China. So this is a good time to show their past achievements and more importantly, their future development plans, the company said.Yang Xiuyun, 72, is enthusiastic about running. A 10-kilometer run in the morning is as important to her as the first meal of the day.Before her retirement, Yang was a breeder at Chaoyang Reclamation Farm in Nanchang, East China's Jiangxi province. At that time, she did not know what a marathon was, but now, she has run nearly 40 marathons, not only participating in China, but also in Helsinki."Life is like a marathon. I'm just racing against the clock," says Yang, who has been running consistently for 22 years. The elderly woman has short hair and speaks as fast as she runs.When she retired, Yang suffered from kidney stones. The doctor said that if she did not have surgery, she could only recover by taking medicine and exercising. At that time, Yang often saw people running along the Ganjiang River, even when it was windy or rainy.One morning, Yang went out for a walk and met this group of runners again, who ran together and cheered each other on. Seeing Yang's envious look, the runners warmly invited her to join."At first, I was afraid that I would become a drag on this group of young people, but they accepted me with great enthusiasm." From running 5 km, then 10 km to 20 km and, finally, a full marathon, the distance that Yang was able to cover became longer and longer. At the same time, her circle of running friends also grew."There are some older runners, but most of them are much younger than me. They call me 'Sister Yang', which is a young name," Yang says with a smile. Now she feels empty if a day passes without seeing her runner friends.Running every day has also brought changes to Yang's body and mind. To the doctor's surprise, her kidney stones, which were initially the size of broad beans, disappeared after several years of running.Yang used to spend long hours working in a noisy and messy environment, and she was always tired after work, but running changed her. In 2006, Yang joined the Nanchang Distance Running Association and became one of its first members.Teams of doctors from Shaanxi province are providing critical treatment to the people living in some of Tibet's most remote areas and elevating the quality of service available at 4,500 meters above sea level, Li Yingxue reports.On Nov 17, 2021, in the world's highest altitude catheterization lab in Ngari prefecture, Tibet autonomous region, Luo Yongbai, alongside his colleagues, successfully executed an interventional angiography for a patient with critical coronary heart disease.It was the 13th coronary angiography carried out since the chest-pain treatment center in Ngari Prefecture People's Hospital opened last September.Luo, 39, a doctor from the department of cardiology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University in Shaanxi province, is a member of the seventh batch of Shaanxi's medical aid team for Tibet.Last August, the team of 42 doctors, drawn from different hospitals in Shaanxi, arrived in Ngari prefecture, nicknamed "the roof on the roof of the world", and began their yearlong secondment working at local hospitals.As soon as Luo arrived, he started planning the establishment of the treatment center. Acute chest pain is a common symptom in emergency departments, and one which needs quick and accurate diagnosis, especially in the case of a heart attack, Luo says, and if the patient is not effectively treated inside the "golden hour", it will be life-threatening."It takes 20 hours by car to transfer a patient to the hospital in Lhasa; for some critically ill patients, there is simply not enough time," Luo adds.Because there used to be no cardiovascular specialists at the Ngari Prefecture People's Hospital, the treatment process for dealing with a heart attack was not standardized, which can affect the prognosis of patients, and sometimes can cost a patient's life, Luo says.Luo led a team to build the catheterization room and then taught the doctors the procedures for its operation.The situation has improved since the treatment center was established. Doctors have successfully treated over 30 high-risk chest pain patients over the past year.Luo remembers treating a heart attack patient in his 30s whose heartbeat was as low as 30 beats per minute upon arrival at the center. It took around three hours to restore the patient's heartbeat without the aid of advanced facilities."After staying in hospital for nearly two weeks, the patient was discharged and is able to live a normal life," Luo says.Chen Chen, vice-president of the Fourth People's Hospital of Shaanxi, is the leader of the team, which consists of doctors from multiple departments including cardiology, urology, neurosurgery, and gynecology, as well as care specialists from nursing and hospital infection management.Alongside Chen, 25 other doctors were assigned to Ngari Prefecture People's Hospital, and he assumed the role of the hospital's president. During the past year, for Chen, the most fulfilling part of his tenure was witnessing the establishment of the chest-pain treatment center and a neonatal intensive care center at the hospital.The latter was officially established in November. The Shaanxi medical aid team for Tibet and the Beijing United Charity Foundation integrated social resources and donated 4.37 million yuan ($613,617) worth of facilities and neonatal transfer and rescue equipment to the unit.Over half of that medical equipment has already been put into use.From above, the regional hospital for women and children in the Tibet autonomous region looks like the flowing hada, a white ethnic scarf that represents purity, honesty and good tidings. These are qualities this first-of-its-kind institution aims to achieve with active cooperation from experienced medical staff from outside.Wang Qiu has had many unforgettable moments since he left home and came to Lhasa to join the hospital about a year ago. The doctor in his early 40s was caught off guard by altitude sickness as soon as he landed in the regional capital with his co-workers in late October."Some of us could barely sleep for the first few days owing to breathing difficulties," recalls Wang, who has 17 years of experience in medicine for children and has worked as deputy director of the rehabilitation department of the West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, in Chengdu, the capital of Southwest China's Sichuan province.Many of them had to wear a nasal catheter in order to breathe without distress, but the tube came off every time they turned in their sleep. "So, lack of oxygen jolted you out of slumber. You had to fumble around in the dark for the catheter, find it somewhere under the sheet or on the floor, plug it back in and then try to sleep again," he says.In August last year, the Tibet autonomous region and the Chengdu hospital inked an agreement on establishing a state-of-the-art healthcare hub for women and children in Lhasa. Wang, who often treated Tibetan children in Chengdu, was made the director of the new hospital."I have always been keen on child rehabilitation and development in Tibet," the doctor says. "In most cases I encountered while at Chengdu, critically ill children from Tibet missed what we medically refer to as the 'best treatment period', when medicines are likely to be more effective, because they had to travel to nearby provinces for proper medical attention. The delay usually led to poor prognosis."Wang believes child medicine development in Tibet still has a long way to go in terms of disease screening, early diagnosis and medical services, but the regional hospital is definitely a step in the right direction. "Our first task, therefore, has been to promote pediatric specialties. We plan to gradually turn the hospital into an integrated healthcare hub for both women and children," he says.Farsighted grape farmer uses family skills and modern technology to draw tourists to a once-sleepy East China village, Yang Feiyue reports in Jiaxing, Zhejiang.Editor's note: China Daily profiles ordinary people doing incredible things in the cultural sphere as the country has advanced over the past decade.Life is "berry" cool for Tang Jianqin right now. The 58-year-old grape farmer from Majiadang village in Jiaxing, East China's Zhejiang province, has had juicy sales since the beginning of the harvest season in June, and orders have been placed through October for the final picking."I introduce at least one new grape variety every year to keep up with the dynamic fruit market and its changing demands," says Tang, who has developed considerable business acumen over the years."The wholesale fruit hub in Jiaxing is among the biggest of its kind in the country and offers timely information on market trends," he adds.Earlier this year, Tang introduced a new grape variety that is devoid of seeds and twice the size of its garden-variety counterparts. It also features a pleasant carmine luster, has firm flesh and is delightfully sweet.In late August, this awesome variety won the gold prize at a competition hosted by the Jiaxing grape association to encourage local farmers to raise the quality of their produce and create some buzz to promote sales.Tang's new grapes are already out of stock, sold at 60 yuan ($8.7) a kilogram, about six times that of ordinary varieties. He admits that he owes his incredible success to today's technologies. "WeChat groups have bridged the gap between planters and agricultural experts. One can share problems and find solutions in no time."Award-winning psychiatrist is spearheading efforts to develop the sector, Xu Xiaomin reports in Shanghai.To many people, obsessive-compulsive disorder might seem like a relatively harmless condition characterized by the unusual need for cleanliness and orderliness, but such misconceptions cannot be further from the truth.In fact, some people with OCD never display such inclinations. Rather, the disorder manifests itself in other ways, such as an irrational fear of contracting an illness or harming through violent means. Such obsessions and compulsions can become so time-consuming and distressing that they cause immense stress to an individual.In China, OCD affects around 1.5 percent of the population, but the impact of this condition has been profound-an investigation in 2019 revealed that OCD results in 33 billion yuan ($4.78 billion) in economic losses every year.Wang Zhen, the deputy director of the Shanghai Mental Health Center, knows this all too well. For the last 20 years, he has dedicated much of his time and effort toward a better understanding of this condition that has been labeled "the cancer of mental diseases" by the medical community concerning the long-term prognosis, low rate of full recovery and unknown definitive cause of this mental health condition.Over the past few years, Wang, who also specializes in research into anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder, has been focused on researching clinical studies of treatment technique instead of pathogeny theories.This shift in focus, he says, was partly due to one patient he saw in 2014.The patient, who was from the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, started a conversation by saying that Wang's clinic would be his last stop as he had experienced little to no improvement in his condition after visiting numerous medical establishments in the country."As a psychiatrist, I knew that when he mentioned the words 'last stop', it was likely he would never visit a doctor again and might even give up on life should things fail again," says Wang.His team's research on treatment techniques has also led to the development of a new solution-an enhanced form of deep brain stimulation surgery for treatment-refractory OCD patients.Unlike the conventional DBS procedure now practiced in other countries which involves using one electrode to stimulate one location in the brain to regulate abnormal impulses, Wang believes his clinical trial through simultaneously stimulating two locations with one electrode could be more effective."We are in the process of clinical trials at present. If we succeed, this will be an exciting step forward that could rewrite the guidelines for the treatment of OCD," he says."I derive much happiness from research not just because of the breakthroughs it may bring, but because important findings can bring less pain to people. This is the charm of scientific research."For his relentless efforts in this field, Wang has been awarded by the city government several times. He is also the recipient of a national award for his outstanding efforts during the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, Hubei province, in 2020.Wang Lihua, an oculist from Jinan, Shandong province, says there have been many intangible rewards from providing free eye care to people in the Tibet autonomous region.The 67-year-old eye expert now works as the dean of Jinan Huashi Eye Hospital, after retiring from Shandong Provincial Hospital. Since 2006, he has been to Shigatse six times to provide patients with free cataract surgery.Located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the "roof of the world", Tibet is home to many farmers and herdsmen suffering from a variety of eye-related afflictions, due to the high altitude, thin air and intense ultraviolet radiation, with cataracts being the most common.Dedicated doctor provides essential round-the-clock care for the aging residents of a small community living 40 kilometers off the coast of Shandong province, Cheng Yuezhu reports.Covering just 114 hectares, the isle of Xiaoqin lies in Yantai, East China's Shandong province. It takes a four-hour voyage by ferry to reach the island from the mainland.For the past 14 years, Wang Hui has been living and working at the Xiaoqin Island health center, most of the time being the only doctor available to serve the island's 400-strong population, which has an average age of over 60.Upon graduation from the Shandong College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 2008, she entered the national program that sets community-level posts in education, agriculture, healthcare and poverty relief.When she first arrived at the island, the inconvenient transportation and insufficient infrastructure posed immediate challenges for her. She recalls that, at the time, fresh water was supplied once a week and it was difficult to even wash her clothes.Se Sokna, a sixth grade student at the Angkomnob Primary School in Bati district, 40 kilometers south of Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh, was elated after receiving a Chinese-donated "kit of love" on Thursday, saying that the package was very useful."This kit is very valuable for us and I like it," she said after receiving the package, which included a school bag, stationery, a stainless-steel water bottle, and a stainless-steel lunch box, among other items.Another sixth grade student San Sokchen, 12, said he was very grateful to China for the donation, and the package had not only aided his study, but also helped improve his personal hygiene."I received a school bag, tinned fish, a bottle of Ovaltine, a water bottle and a lunch box," he said. "I'm very happy and excited."Jointly funded by Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund and China Foundation for Peace and Development via Cambodia's Civil Society Alliance Forum, the "kit of love" project was launched by Cambodia's Minister of Post and Telecommunications Chea Vandeth and Liu Jianchao, head of the International Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.Liu was visiting Cambodia as head of a CPC delegation from Aug 23-26, and met with ruling Cambodian People's Party's president and Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen, and other party leaders.CSAF's planning and project director Chea Munyrith says that the three-month initiative is aimed at meeting the needs for stationery among students, to encourage them to study hard, help improve hygiene, be environmentally conscious and connect the hearts of the people in the two countries."A total of 10,000 'kits of love' will be donated to students in three target areas, including the capital Phnom Penh, Preah Sihanouk province and Tboung Khmum province," he said.Munyrith said the "kit of love "project would not only contribute to reducing poverty, but also to improving the well-being of students in rural areas."We believe that this project will deepen the bonds of solidarity, friendship, and brotherhood between our two countries and peoples," he said.Nget Sam Oeun, principal of the Angkomnob Primary School, where the project was launched, said that a total of 257 students in the school had each received a "kit of love"."This is a good project because it has helped improve health and hygiene for rural students," he said. "The important project will contribute to improving health and hygiene for primary school students, particularly helping to protect them from the COVID-19 pandemic."The 'kit of love' truly reflects the kind hearts of the Chinese people toward their Cambodian counterparts, and it has also brought smiles and hope to rural children in Cambodia," he added.A group of volunteers from China is winning hearts in Pakistan through their continuous humanitarian assistance to the people in Pakistan in their hour of need.The volunteers are working under the name of the China-Pakistan Youth Exchange Community. They collect donations from overseas Chinese in Pakistan to provide necessary help to poor communities in the country.Ma Bin, the head of China-Pakistan Youth Exchange Community, says that they run several initiatives to donate to the locals, including those hit by floods and children living in orphanages, as well as providing food and other necessities to poor people living in underprivileged areas of the country."During Ramadan this year, our Chinese volunteers donated food relief packages to more than 6,000 local families, with each package containing food worth nearly 4,000 Pakistani rupees ($18). They delivered enough to meet the food needs of over 24,000 locals for a month," he says.This year so far, the volunteers have sent relief packages to more than 50 families, Ma says.To reach flood victims, the volunteers teamed up with an Islamabad-based NGO, Al-Khidmat Committee, to send humanitarian relief packages to flood-hit people.Muhammad Suleman Butt, the chairperson of the NGO, says that the Chinese volunteers have always been a great support to Pakistan in difficult times."They not only give donations for people whose lives are devastated by disasters, but also take a special interest in helping pack food or other items for them, as well as sometimes visiting locals themselves to deliver the packages prepared for them," Butt says.The Chinese volunteers also often visit local orphanages and Afghan refugee schools to donate stationery, cotton-padded clothes, shoes and food supplies. These are all humanitarian activities regularly organized since the CPYEC was founded in 2013."As well as donating supplies, we also encourage our volunteers to spend time with the orphans or refugee children and to hug them so they can feel our affection," Ma says.Sheikh Ahsan Farid, national manager of Aghosh Homes, where Ma Bin and his fellow volunteers donated goods, says that the children were very impressed by the gesture of the Chinese and cherished meeting and receiving gifts from them."The children told their teachers, after meeting the Chinese, that they were very happy and it made their day to receive good quality gifts," he adds. "They felt loved, and such attention boosts their self-esteem."Farid says that by meeting the Chinese, the children, who already knew about the China-Pakistan friendship, have witnessed and experienced it themselves."We at the orphanage always love such kind gestures. The initiative taken by the Chinese volunteers also encouraged local donors when we shared their stories, so we are highly thankful to them for helping out and giving the kids a reason to smile," he says.High school students find innovative and viable solutions to tackle power crisis and control the scourge of malaria in Africa, Xing Wen reports.Charity should begin at home, but should not stay there, says 17-year-old Li Yuqi, who's always on the qui vive for an opportunity to help the less privileged in strife-torn African nations.An 11th grader at the Affiliated High School of Shanxi University in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, Li often yearned for a chance to volunteer in programs meant to benefit refugees and impoverished communities in Ethiopia, ever since she heard heartrending stories about their loss and despair from the family of a childhood friend who moved there.Three years ago, she participated in an online research on empowerment of African women, which stiffened her resolve to help. The right opportunity came knocking this summer in the form of a competition that encourages high school students to propose and execute public welfare projects to improve medical, nutritional and educational conditions of vulnerable groups in Africa.Sorting out rubbish is not a waste of time, but it can be a responsibility that people may too often discard. Which is why improving household garbage treatment in urban areas and popularizing the knowledge of waste sorting and recycling among city dwellers is an idea that should not be binned.It's not an easy task for everyone to keep waste-sorting knowledge in mind and practice garbage classification on a daily basis. Some people might even get confused when deciding which category the rubbish they are going to throw away belongs to.But, what if we had a garbage container that could help us classify the trash? Based on that assumption, twins Chu Siyu and Chu Siqi, both fifth-grade students from Beijing Huiwen No 1 Primary School, have employed artificial intelligence, cloud storage and the internet of things to design a set of four garbage containers, which is able to help users to sort the trash.Users first open a designated app upon which the names of different kinds of rubbish are displayed. Once the user chooses an item of trash in the app, the corresponding Bluetooth-enabled trash bin will automatically open."That also allows people to throw away their waste without touching the trash bin, which is more sanitary," say the young inventors.Speech recognition technology is also applied in the invention, allowing users, the twins say, to open the corresponding trash receptacle by speaking out the name of the item of trash that they wish to discard.The creation of the prototype interactive trash bins propelled the duo to the top prize in this year's the Soong Ching Ling Award for Children's Invention.The event received around 20,000 entries from more than 30,000 domestic and foreign students from more than 3,800 primary schools and middle schools.The award ceremony was held in Beijing on Aug 21. Renowned academics with the Chinese Academy of Sciences or the Chinese Academy of Engineering were invited to present the trophies, enabling the young participants to meet accomplished scientists in person.Other award-winning entries included a badminton shuttlecock collecting robot and a smart elevator, which is designed to help curb the spread of COVID-19. To do this, it employs AI technology to monitor the social distance between passengers, as well as allowing them to select their floor remotely via their mobile phones, eliminating the need to push a button.The event also raised the curtain on a series of science promotional activities co-hosted by the China Soong Ching Ling Foundation and China Association for Science and Technology.Jing Dunquan, vice-president of the foundation, notes that both will carry out science-popularization work among youngsters to forge their scientific literacy and cultivate young people's desire to make a contribution to society.The two organizations announced a strategic partnership with each other in February to better carry out cooperation in science promotion, talent cultivation and international exchanges.Ancient Chinese insight that extols 'moving with the times' is prompting new state policies to protect businesses from economic slump, Wang Ru reports.China's ancient wisdom informs its contemporary leadership. In this series, China Daily explores how age-old principles and philosophies continue to steer the nation's governance.As the founder and CEO of Chongqing Zhubajie Network Technology, Zhu Mingyue has paid close attention to policies related to tax exemption and operational cost reduction for years, especially after COVID-19 struck in 2020."Hit hard by the pandemic, many micro, small and medium enterprises have struggled to survive. Slashing taxes and reducing fees have become major ways of helping them increase cash flow and, in turn, encouraging innovation. These moves ensure stability in employment and foreign trade, as well as guaranteeing security of the basic needs and operations of market entities," the 48-year-old says.In recent years, a series of policies have been drafted to offer declining businesses a fresh lease of life. In the Government Work Report, delivered at the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress in March, Premier Li Keqiang announced a new package of tax refunds and cuts of 2.5 trillion yuan ($365 billion) this year.Zhu, also a deputy to the 13th National People's Congress, has submitted motions related to the issue three times, primarily because "it can greatly benefit enterprises".His own company enjoyed a tax exemption of more than 29 million yuan from 2020 to the first half of this year.Since April, the newly implemented value-added tax credit refund policy has allowed Zhu's company to get a tax refund of 19.7 million yuan. "The monetary aid from the government has provided us timely support," he says.When President Xi Jinping chaired a symposium with entrepreneurs in Beijing in 2020, he pitched for more cuts to taxes and fees, as well as a reduction of rents and interest rates, to ensure that the relief policies reach the primary level and directly benefit market entities.Statistics released by the State Administration for Market Regulation show that there were 98 million market entities in China in 2018, and this year, the number has surpassed 150 million."Cutting taxes and fees is not just a policy adjustment, but an institutional reform. In other words, it is meant to be long-term and stable," Gao Peiyong, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said at the China Business Annual Meeting Week on Enterprise Competitiveness in 2020.Only change is constantBehind the reforms is the spirit of keeping pace with the times, which is deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture.In his keynote address to the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations in 2019, President Xi mentioned that changing with the times through reforms and innovation was an abiding commitment for the Chinese.In another speech in 2013, he stated: "Innovation is the soul of a nation's progress, the inexhaustible force enhancing a country's prosperity, and indeed the profound endowment of the Chinese nation."According to Li Zhong, a professor at the School of Marxism, Xi'an Jiaotong University in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, the spirit to move with the times is in the "cultural genes" of China."The ancient Chinese believed that the entire universe was prone to endless changes, and that people should be very sensitive to such things. As a result, they valued change and kept pace with the times and environment," says Li."It is very different from Western philosophy, which puts more emphasis on space-something still-and valuing the grasp of structures and rules," he adds.The adaptive Chinese spirit can be traced to I Ching (The Book of Changes), an ancient divination book that is among the oldest classics. "The name of the book, obviously, implies the idea of change. And, the last hexagram suggested in the book is called weiji (not yet completed), which means changes do not end," Li explains.The Great Learning, one of the Four Books of Confucianism that was believed to have been written during the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC), mentions that the platitude, "if you can improve yourself in a day, do so each day, forever building on improvement", was engraved on the bathing paraphernalia of Emperor Tang, the first monarch of the Shang Dynasty (c.16th century-11th century BC).Some experts say that the feudal dynasties in China had an incredibly stable structure. However, Li points out that, although the general structure remained stable, institutional reforms were constantly being made.The professor highlights the example of the ancient imperial examination system to choose civil servants, which is believed to have started during the Sui Dynasty (581-618). Before that, government officials were selected by recommendation from local governors."The innovation was advanced for that time, because it offered talented people, regardless of their family background, an opportunity to gain high social status. It broke the monopoly on political power and social resources by the aristocracy, thereby promoting social mobility," he says.In his speech at the conference marking the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up in 2018, President Xi, too, mentioned that, to keep up with the times, "our best resource is to comply with the trends of history, and to seek and proactively respond to change".Tradition delivers innovationLi believes this "adaptive spirit" is of vital importance in present-day China. "We are facing global, once-in-a-century changes. The complicated international situation and the COVID-19 pandemic jointly challenge us and require us to innovate," he says."On the other hand, the development path we are walking now has never been explored by any other nation. We need the courage to reform and to innovate in an effort to build a great modern socialist country, and realize the great rejuvenation of our country," he adds.At the fifth plenary session of the 18th Communist Party of China Central Committee in 2015, President Xi proposed a new growth philosophy. He also mooted the idea of "comprehensively deepening reforms "during the third plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee in 2013.According to Li, the guiding philosophy behind the proposals is the need to change with the times.He, however, insists that innovation should be based on tradition. "From a dialectical perspective, tradition and innovation are two sides of the same coin. Innovation doesn't happen in a vacuum; tradition provides a foundation. We need to remodel traditions to suit our modern needs."Bai Ming, a professor at the Academy of Arts and Design, Tsinghua University, sums it up best by saying: "In some way, the best traditions are innovations made in the past."Tan Yingzi in Chongqing and Shi Baoyin in Zhengzhou contributed to this story.Rural doctor overcomes incredible obstacles to care for those who need her, report Wang Qian in Beijing and Yang Jun in Guiyang.Finding a doctor for her mother, who had chronic pulmonary heart disease, was not easy for Pan Feng in the 1980s. It meant a walk of more than 10 kilometers from her home to the nearest health center in Getang, a mountain village in the Qianxinan Bouyei and Miao autonomous prefecture in Guizhou province."That was when I wanted to be a doctor to make medical care more accessible in the countryside," the 53-year-old Pan says. Since becoming a rural doctor in 1999, a profession with a shortage of practitioners, she has played an important role in keeping the community healthy and reducing the healthcare gap between the rural and urban populations.On Aug 17, Chinese Doctors' Day, Pan was awarded the Chinese Physician Prize, the highest honor the nation's medical workers can receive, for her dedication and long service to the village. Besides her, 78 recipients received the title this year."I consider myself very fortunate to get the honor, because there are many village doctors who have done a great job and I am just one of them," Pan says.The latest data from the National Health Commission shows there were about 1.15 million doctors providing care for rural residents as of last year, down by around 100,000 from 2012, despite all the efforts to get more doctors into rural practice by the authorities.Pan knows that meager salaries and bleak promotion prospects have led to fewer doctors willing to practice in the countryside, but she doesn't regret her choice.For six days, a group of 32 doctors from China Medical Volunteers provided nearly 3,000 patients with free medical consultations and conducted 26 surgeries on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.During this healthcare campaign, the doctors trekked more than 1,000 kilometers at an average altitude of over 4,000 meters."It is a totally different working environment, and adequate communication with the patients is of great importance, as every detail matters," says Ling Feng, head of the volunteer team, who is also the chief neurosurgeon at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, in Beijing.Ling's team began its medical care campaign in Yushu Tibetan autonomous prefecture, Northwest China's Qinghai province, on Aug 6, with the first stop being Yushu's Nangqian county.Nyzhong, 55, who is from Baizha village, underwent knee replacement surgery that day. For years, Nyzhong only relied on medicines and acupuncture, which didn't help much in alleviating her pain.After a thorough evaluation and preoperative preparation, the volunteer surgeons spent two hours performing the knee operation, bringing relief to Nyzhong from the pain that had plagued her for over two decades."Hip and knee joint problems are prevalent among the elderly in high altitude areas where local residents need to crouch or even kneel to milk cows," says Ma Liwu, a volunteer doctor, who is also the chief orthopedic physician at Xuzhou No 1 People's Hospital.The 6th Youth Innovation Competition on the Lancang-Mekong Region's Governance and Development came to a close at Fudan University on Thursday, with teams of students attending an online awards ceremony and sharing their insights.Themed on public health and medical care, the competition held by Fudan University and Shanghai Foreign Cultural Exchange Association saw 51 university teams from six countries in the region compete in the preliminary round in 2021.Eight teams from countries including China, Cambodia and Laos entered the final.Located in the Central South peninsula, with a basin area of about 795,000 square kilometers, the Mekong River, known as the Lancang River in China, originates from Qinghai province in China and flows through Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, before joining the South China Sea.The team, made up of three 19-year-olds from the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam, won one of the awards for best projects for incubation at the competition. The team had suggested the idea of producing environmentally friendly face masks using coconuts, a widely available natural resource in Vietnam."Medical masks are effective in preventing viruses and protecting human health, but the polymer fiber and woven fabric used in making masks take up to 10 years to decompose," explains team member Le Minh Khue, who majors in international economics."Some countries have even classified masks as hazardous medical waste as they pollute the air, land and water resources if they are discarded casually," she adds.Fu Qiaomei has been affectionately nicknamed by her colleagues and the moniker gives a clue to her line of work. Her nickname is "DNA detective".The 39-year-old's efforts and persistence have enabled extinct societies to tell their tales, even though their remains and clues to their identity have been compromised, almost beyond recognition, by the passage of time.Her evidence-backed discoveries of a modern human from Romania dating back 36,000 years with its recent Neanderthal ancestor, and a 14,000-year-old European featuring dark skin and light-colored eyes, who lived during the Ice Age, took academia by storm in 2015-16.Her decoding of the first and earliest modern human's genome from China opened up new prospects for the genetic study of past East Asians in 2017.Using cutting-edge paleogenetic (the study of genetic material to uncover the past) techniques, she retrieved the first Denisovan DNA in East Asia from soil in 2020. Denisovans and Neanderthals split into separate branches about 400,000 years ago.These are just some of the achievements from her exploration of the genetic roots of humankind.Fu's work in the field of paleontology has played a big part in untangling the early admixture history of modern humans and Neanderthals, and revealing how early agriculture affected European farmers."I'd like to be of some service in illuminating the human prehistory of Asia by investigating the ancient genomes of humans, animals and pathogens," Fu says.Sponge sticks, tin cans, plastic bottles and old tires are not objects that you would usually associate with the lively and boisterous activities of a primary school physical education class.However, one man's trash, as the saying goes, is another man's treasure. In some cases, that applies to teachers too, especially those named as winners in the Active Schools Innovation Awards. To them, such scrap objects can all be converted into practical teaching aids or sports equipment that engage students and facilitate a wide variety of games that both provide enjoyment and help to hone their bodies.The awards are part of a charity program that aims to inspire primary schools and teachers to actively deliver creative PE classes that can foster the interest of their students in physical activity. Every year, 100 prizes are awarded for outstanding examples of primary school PE practices and the program provides some of the award-winning teachers with the opportunity to tour other countries where they can conduct exchanges with their overseas counterparts.The Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Center at the Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, has started training its first batch of local health workers to meet the growing demand for TCM in the country.Zhu Wei, a TCM practitioner and chief of the center, says the three-month program aims to train a group of health professionals, who can provide an alternative medical option to Zimbabweans. "We hope to train personnel to specialize in TCM and acupuncture, and that, after the training, they will master the basic acupuncture techniques and the knowledge of TCM," he says.Zhu, who is also the head of the 18th Chinese medical team in Zimbabwe, says TCM offers substantial benefits to patients, hence the need to train local health workers."In TCM, we can diagnose disease by inspection, inquiry, palpation and auscultation. So for those people who cannot afford to get a scan, they can benefit from TCM and acupuncture. After we diagnose the patients, we can use acupuncture and Chinese cupping therapy to treat them," Zhu says. "TCM and acupuncture can be used in different fields and different specialties. We can treat different pains like neck pain, low back pain and arthritis, headache and so on. It can also be applied to the digestive system, neurological system and vascular system."The center, established in 2020 as part of efforts to offer Zimbabweans affordable medical treatment, has in recent months seen a multitude of patients seeking medical attention free of charge.Before the introduction of the program, Adam Muchenje, a nursing tutor, had attended training and workshops on TCM in China."The opening up of this clinic is a blessing to me and the patients because I am now going to have a chance of helping people," he says. "The knowledge that I attained in China and that I am getting now is going to help in treating patients, in educating people on how they can get treatment and how to combine it with Western medicine."Tatenda Chimbunde, a trainee at the center who is a recent graduate from the China Pharmaceutical University, says it is her duty to share what she learned in China for the benefit of locals.The rigor of championships, and the reputation of over 20 athletes in provincial and national teams, keep driving Sun Jiangang's dream to promote hockey among the youth.The 45-year-old coach has led the Sports School of Jingyuan County, in Northwest China's Gansu province, from nothing over a decade ago to national champions."In 2008, when I became the coach, the school lacked basic gear for the game, except for hockey balls and sticks," Sun says, adding that the campus team also had to practice on a basketball court.To make matters more difficult for Sun, parents wanted their children to focus on studies, which meant the selected players could only practice hockey after school hours and on weekends."I tried to ease the concerns the parents had and persuade them to encourage the kids to play," he says.The team of ragtag players that Sun cobbled together in 2008 went on to participate in national youth hockey championships for more than a decade and won three titles since 2009.The all-round development of the players has been inseparable from the improvement of local hockey facilities. Three 6-a-side hockey fields and one for an 11-a-side game have been built in Jingyuan county since 2008. The number of hockey coaches in the school has increased to four.When a young physician appeared in a village to set up practice, she ran into a wall of distrust. Fourteen years on, the locals treat her as one of their own, Yang Feiyue reports.Two pairs of old-fashioned black shoes with rugged cotton soles stand out among an array of items, including awards certificates that exemplify Zhong Jing's work in improving rural health over the past 14 years.The shoes are by no means finely finished and point to the arduous manual labor of a 90-year-old villager who touched Zhong's soul and made her decide to put down roots in Longhe village, Longchang town, Qianxinan Bouyei and Miao autonomous prefecture in Guizhou province."I've never been able to get over how she must have struggled across several kilometers of rough mountain roads just to send me these shoes,"Zhong says.The anecdote is one of many that tell of the bond between Zhong and the village's 3,000 or so residents.Rain or shine, Zhong opens the door of her clinic in the village no later than 7:30 am each day.The clinic is the only place where the villagers can see a doctor and have their ailments tended without trekking further afield.Zhong, 39, knows every one of her patients and their conditions, so her diagnoses are dispensed efficiently, with prescriptions that almost always seem to do the trick.When villagers are on their work breaks, Zhong makes calls to some who have chronic diseases, such as high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes."I need to remind them to come to have their blood pressure and blood sugar tested," she says.If they can't make it, Zhong visits them."Patient visits to the clinic have become less frequent in recent years, thanks to the increasingly better health awareness of local villagers."When Zhong settled down in Longhe in 2008, villagers' worries of having nowhere to turn to in a medical emergency evaporated."I live in the clinic, so they can see me at any time of the day, even in the middle of the night," Zhong says.For the past two years, Zhong has made a point of making more house calls to those with chronic health conditions."This way they don't have to move around during the special (COVID-19) times," she says.The smart technology of facial recognition has been met with much ado, but less attention has been given to whether it will enhance or hamper our own innate ability to discern fellow humans.During the drawn-out two years since COVID-19 walked abruptly onto the world stage, we have learned to accept, or at least tolerate, the wearing of masks that pretty much hide two-thirds of our face.From the beginning, I made a game of it, trying to recognize people based on two things in particular: an individual's eyes and unique body movement, particularly their manner of walking.Eyes, as they say, are windows to the soul, and I have always looked, in the "fairer sex", to distinctive eyes as the primary feature of attraction.I also consider myself among those who never forget a face, even if the passage of time can make this increasingly difficult. On the last visit to my hometown in the United States before COVID hit, I was enjoying tacos in a local Mexican restaurant when, glancing at the next table, I was sure that a woman seated there was a grade school classmate whom I had not seen for nearly five decades.Urban dwellers in China are taking up paddleboarding to beat the sweltering summer heat and get closer to nature as COVID-19 restrictions limit their chances to go on long-haul trips."If I can't go to Sanya, the moat will be my Garden of Eden," so goes a social media post, as cited by Chinese news portal Jiemian.The author was hoping to replace a trip to Sanya, a beach destination in South China's Hainan province, with a stand-up paddleboarding, or SUP, experience in their own city. The once-obscure water sport is making a splash this summer in the country's urban areas."SUP gets us closer to nature and enables us to investigate the city we live in from different angles," a Beijing-based member of an online group of more than 400 SUP enthusiasts was quoted as saying by People's Daily."Water sports are exceptionally hot this year," a staff member at Beijing's Chaoyang Park told Beijing Business Today."Water sports used to be a relatively niche area, with most of the participants being members of sports clubs. Lately, the number of nonmembers participating in water sports has been on the rise and some of them joined a club after just one water sports experience," said the worker.Photographer undertakes odyssey to record and preserve a world that's slowly disappearing, report Yang Feiyue in Beijing and Zhu Youfang in Changsha.Tan Jianhua has trekked to more than 800 ancient villages over the past 15 years, an odyssey made all the more difficult by his carrying a heavy bag every step of the way.The bag is the key to the endeavor. It contained kit that has enabled him to take 100,000 photographs on his journey that have captured the natural landscape, distinctive architecture, folk customs and historical landmarks of the hidden rural jewels that are scattered across Central China's Hunan province.Some of the scenery captured by Tan's lens has since vanished, giving his work an unexpected historical value, experts say.Tan, in his early 70s, was a professional photographer for the Chinese and Overseas Architecture journal based in the provincial capital Changsha.Despite being well-versed in the various styles, schools and theories of architectural design, it wasn't until Tan was in the home stretch of his career at the journal that he realized the most beautiful rural structures were those that had been around him throughout his early years.Growing up, "body shaming" wasn't a term often used. With the growth of online photo and video platforms, and the ability for everyone to comment on posts, it's now one of the most commonly used phrases in the current social media environment.Body shaming refers to anyone who makes humiliating remarks regarding someone's physical appearance. A clear example of this is when media posts performances by entertainer Lizzo, who is an example of a plus-size, strong-willed, self-loving Black woman who feels comfortable enough in her own skin to wear curve-hugging outfits.While some commenters understandably point out the risks of obesity, diabetes and heart disease, there are several more that say they "don't need to see a fat girl wearing that" and "she should cover up those rolls". These are unnecessary, damaging, rude and blatantly ignorant opinions. If you're a real Lizzo fan, you'd know that she also posts videos of herself doing high-intensity interval training, or HIIT workouts, and she could likely kick your butt. Genetics often plays a big part in someone's physical makeup, so, even though they may appear to be "unhealthy", they actually have healthy habits that their appearance doesn't reflect.Let's take a look at a recent story in China news. Chinese actress Zhang Tian'ai, who is 31 years old, recently appeared on a reality show called Sisters Who Make Waves. And make waves, she did. Some online were shocked by her extremely thin appearance. Now weighing 45 kilograms and 1.68 meters in height, one must question her health. When asked how she lost weight, she claimed that she only ate boiled eggs and cucumbers for two years. What is that doing for the mentality of women all over the nation?Several comments praised her, and some people even attempted to follow her diet. To me, this is a danger of celebrity. The people who criticized her appearance and restrictive eating habits have been accused of body shaming her by pointing out that she looks underweight and unhealthy. Those accusing people of body shaming Zhang make me cringe, because I read the comments as being from rightfully concerned fans who can see that she is putting herself in harm's way. Is it body shaming when fans are concerned about how dangerous her eating habits are?According to medical experts, a woman of 1.68 meters should weigh between 52.2 kg and 70.6 kg and consume roughly 1,800 to 2,200 calories per day. To lose weight, a diet of 1,500 calories per day is sufficient. Undereating and starving oneself can lead to menstrual cycle disruptions, heart disease, liver and kidney problems, muscle waste and a slew of other complications.Eating disorders are, and have always been, an issue in society, and they are becoming even more prevalent in today's world of fake online lives, where people can obsessively follow celebrities. A greater number of people are influenced by what famous people say and do. And that includes adopting unhealthy, even dangerous, habits.I'm not one who tends to follow celebrities or influencers, but I often struggle with compulsive actions. Four years ago, after noticing the results of natural aging, I started a Keto diet, intermittent fasting, and a grueling workout schedule that included CrossFit, Pilates and running every single day. I became obsessed. I had a relatively normal diet that consisted of around 1,600 calories per day, but I strictly limited my intake of carbohydrates. After almost two years of this routine, I started experiencing heart palpitations, tremors and instances of fainting.I've since backed down from this outrageous pace, but even six months ago, I was consumed with walking 19-24 kilometers per day. After going through foot surgery, I've had to stop, but I know as soon as I recover, I'll be right back on that treadmill.Although I've always been small in stature, my friends have voiced concern that I'm "overdoing it" or that I may have a compulsive disorder. These comments make me reconsider my ideas of what is healthy and I always accept them as constructive. However, I have also been criticized for being "too skinny", or conversely "getting flabby", even of being "too old to wear a bikini". That is body shaming, something which no one should give out or have to take.Enormous efforts invested in resurrecting Saihanba as one of the world's largest man-made forests are rooted in the ancient Chinese philosophy of peaceful coexistence, Cheng Yuezhu reports.Editor's note: China's ancient wisdom informs its contemporary leadership. In this series, China Daily explores how age-old principles and philosophies continue to steer the nation's governance.From a barren wilderness that encouraged severe sandstorms to a verdant forest that provides Beijing and its adjacent regions a bulwark against natural calamities, Saihanba in Weichang Manchu and Mongolian autonomous county, Hebei province, is nothing short of a green miracle.Epic endeavors of three generations of foresters have transformed hectares of arid land into an enviable man-made woodland, and Zhang Jianglai's family is proud to have contributed to the extraordinary project.Born and raised in the county, 29-year-old Zhang recalls how his truck driver father worked day and night to transport timber for the forest farm. "I vividly remember the day my dad first took me to Saihanba. It was like an ocean of green. The rows of trees stretched as far as the eyes could see," he says.The day left an indelible imprint on his mind, and after he graduated in seed production and management from Hebei North University in 2016, Zhang applied for job openings at the forest farm. He started working at the farm's Dahuanqi area as a technician and participated in an afforestation program in the spring of 2017.The same year, the Saihanba afforestation community took home the UN Champions of the Earth award for its outstanding contribution to the restoration of degraded landscape.However, the path to glory was no cakewalk. The temperature often plummeted beyond-20 C and the average frost-free season lasted for about two months, which meant planting trees and ensuring their survival was a Herculean task.The afforestation team usually arrived at the foot of the mountains by 4:30 am, and then climbed for an hour or so to the designated plantation spot. The unpredictable weather was the toughest challenge, recalls Zhang. It could be sunny in the morning and start snowing by lunchtime."My story is just a snippet of the lives of young people working at the forest farm. Our predecessors laid a solid foundation. We are standing on that foundation and pushing forward," says Zhang, now director of Dahuanqi's Xiahebian forest section.Historically speaking, Saihanba was once an abundant resource of flora and fauna, but deforestation began toward the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Wars and conflicts in the first half of the 20th century reduced it to a desert. The forest shield gone, sandstorms began striking neighboring areas, including Beijing, with alarming frequency.In 1962, the central government established the Saihanba Mechanical Forest Farm and engaged a dedicated team of 369 youths to revive the green lung. Today, the area's forest cover has increased from a measly 18 percent to a promising 82 percent.According to Zhang, the forest farm's focus has now shifted from planting trees to protecting the ecology by introducing more species and improving disease resistance. The economic angle has also moved from just selling timber to understory agricultural produce. The farm has also adopted advanced technologies, including video monitoring, drone surveillance and radar aid, to prevent fire hazards.During an inspection in August 2021, President Xi Jinping said generations of workers there have forged, through concrete action, the Saihanba Spirit-staying true to the original aspiration, being hardworking and enterprising, and pursuing green development.In a statement at the UN Summit on Biodiversity, via videoconference in 2020, Xi said that China always prioritized ecological progress, and embedded it in every dimension and phase of economic and social development. The goal is to seek a kind of modernization that promotes a harmonious coexistence between people and nature, he stressed.A natural bondThis concept of coexistence is derived from the term tianrenheyi in ancient Chinese philosophy. Here, tian literally means the sky or the heaven, but its definition extends to encompass nature and the order of things as determined by nature and followed by people.Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi made a representative statement when he said: "Heaven and earth were born at the same time I was, and the ten thousand things are one with me."The idea of harmony between people and nature is, however, not limited to Taoism. Confucian philosopher Mencius proposed "to have love for the people, and cherish all things" while Zhang Zai from the Song Dynasty (960-1279) put forward the notion that "all people are brothers and sisters, and all things are equal".An expert in traditional culture, Guo Wenbin says the main reason why varied schools of thought, including Confucianism and Taoism, have raised and emphasized the concept is that they share the same Chinese roots, which rely heavily on astronomical observations.An example of this is the Chinese lunisolar calendar that stresses the impact of the sun and the moon on people's daily lives. It played an important role in China for millennia, as it guided agricultural production."In ancient Chinese philosophy, nature and everything in it are equal. Together, we are one. This is why ancient philosophy requires us to treat nature with kindness and reverence," Guo says. "Ancient Chinese people even personified nature. They believed trees and grass have feelings, and that these must be respected."Guo says his hometown, Xihaigu in the Ningxia Hui autonomous region, faced a similar plight to that of Saihanba. After decades of controlling desertification and promoting afforestation, Xihaigu's destiny changed. The once barren acres are now a picturesque natural landscape."Under this philosophical frame, the relationship between nature and people is an interactive one. We should be grateful to nature. If we continue to be so, nature will repay us with more kindness," Guo adds.Success story in statisticsAccording to last year's figures, made available by the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, China's forest cover has improved from 8.6 percent over six decades ago to 23.04 percent by the end of 2020.The country has established 11,800 protected natural sites, offering protection to around 90 percent of terrestrial types of ecosystem, 85 percent of wildlife species and 65 percent of higher plant communities.During the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-20), desertification control was conducted on more than 10 million hectares, and approximately 4 million hectares of farmland was converted back to forests or grasslands.China's outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) states in its main objectives that new progress will be made in building an ecological civilization.Specific goals suggest that energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 13.5 percent and 18 percent, respectively; the total discharge of major pollutants will be consistently reduced; the forest cover will reach 24.1 percent; and the environment will be consistently improved for a stronger ecological defense.In September 2020, China also announced that it aimed to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060."The worldview of unity between nature and people clarifies the responsibilities and obligations of people toward all things. It draws a red line for human behavior, emphasizing that we should care for and respect nature, act in accordance with the laws of nature, and take natural resources in moderation," Guo Qiyong, a professor from Wuhan University, says in an article for People's Daily.The professor further writes: "It aims to maintain the balance and achieve the state of harmonious coexistence between people and nature, providing an important practical guideline for the construction of an ecological philosophy with Chinese characteristics and the pursuit of sustainable development."Zhang Yu contributed to this story.Disc-throwing sport is growing in popularity, not least because of its non-contact and social aspects, Yang Feiyue reports.When a group of Yale students inverted the pie tins that were used to cover the delivery of their bakery orders more than a century ago, they found an airfoil shape that could be thrown around for fun on campus.This prototype of the frisbee has evolved and since the beginning of the 20th century it has become a popular sport and pastime.Yet, the activity has been confined to a small number of players in China over the years. Recently, the game has made its presence felt and has become one of the most popular emerging sports in the country."I was under the impression that it was only a toy for children and pets," says Qu Xinchen who started playing frisbee in April."It never occurred to me that it was a competitive game with a social functions" he adds.The Beijing resident in his early 30s tried his hand, literally, at the game after being invited by one of his friends."The gyms were closed because of the COVID-19 resurgence then, and indoor activities were subjected to restrictive conditions," Qu recalls, adding that he's also seen many enthusiasts posting their frisbee experience on the social media platform Xiaohongshu.A veteran craftsman in Hunan seeks to keep the tradition of making bamboo products alive while helping locals earn more, Xing Wen reports.Some villagers sit at the entrance of a cave, from which cool air blows and brings them relief in the midsummer heat. They make small talk while their hands are occupied in splitting bamboo into thin strips and weaving them into various items, including tea mugs, baskets and sieves.Bamboo weaving is a time-honored handicraft that has been passed down for generations in Maoba township, Yongshun county, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture, Hunan province.Fu Yelin, a 58-year-old resident of Maoba, has been making bamboo products since he was 12."Back then, I used to get cut by the sharp bamboo strips. My father, from whom I learned the craft, encouraged me to be careful," he says.And it requires patience to complete the time-consuming process of turning a bamboo into items of different shapes and sizes. Craftspeople would first choose a proper bamboo species, use a knife to smooth out the raised joints and then, scrap off the outermost green layer of the bamboo. After that, the weaver has to split the bamboo into strips according to the width needed.After decades of practicing the craft, Fu has equipped himself with the skill to divide the bamboo into strips, sometimes as thin as needles, and his hands are calloused.In the past, bamboo baskets, bed mats and sieves were widely used by people in the country as everyday objects. Following his father, Fu used to travel across Hunan, providing a bamboo weaving service from door to door, village to village. He visited and wove bamboo products for more than 5,000 households.However, people's demand for bamboo items fell with the country's rapid industrialization. Handmade bamboo products have been replaced by manufactured products made with other materials, particularly plastics.Fu, a veteran craftsman, sensed the change.He opened a store in 2003 in Yongshun's Furong town, a place steeped in history and renowned for its ethnic styles and natural scenery, to observe the aesthetic trends in people's consumption of daily items.To better cater to the market, Fu then designed bamboo products of exquisite appearance and of diverse functions. He hired around 20 local bamboo weavers to make the products in accordance with his ideas. Gradually, his bamboo products became popular among both locals and tourists who bought them as souvenirs. The products have been sold in more than 30 cities and provinces across the country and even reached foreign consumers.As he receives larger orders, Fu encourages his fellow villagers to join him in making the bamboo products to also increase their income."Many villagers can't become migrant workers, as they have to take care of their children and old parents at home, so I hope to help them earn more," Fu says.Before the outbreak of COVID-19, Fu's bamboo-weaving business would bring an annual profit of more than 3.7 million yuan ($550,000) to locals, he adds.He has visited many villages across the country where the tradition of making bamboo items is alive.As costume drama A Dream of Splendor attracted many audiences this summer, the way the heroine Zhao Pan'er makes tea also garnered much attention. Heytea, a Chinese boutique teahouse chain, recently launched new flavored tea drinks based on the recipe from the TV show.China, home of most of the world's tea, also has a series of customs concerning tea making and tea choice according to the seasons.In the summer, the most recommended one is green tea, for its character is "cold" in traditional Chinese medical theories, suitable to soothe the restlessness caused by hot summer.Since the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279), loose leaf green tea has been popular in China. Emperor Qianlong from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) was a tea lover and often enjoyed Longjing, the most well-known Chinese green tea, in summer.Apart from Longjing, Chinese green tea has many family members with beautiful and poetic names, such as Yunwu (which literally means cloud and mist). Below are just some examples of these poetic teas:BiluochunProduced in Wu county in East China's Jiangsu province, the tea got its name for its curled leaves that look like snail shells.Average life expectancy, a key gauge of the health level of a country's residents, reached 78.2 years in China in 2021, statistics released by the National Health Commission (NHC) on Tuesday showed. The figure is up from 77.93 years in 2020.China saw its maternal mortality rate fall in 2021, dropping from 16.9 per 100,000 in 2020 to 16.1 per 100,000, the commission said in its annual report on the country's health development.China's infant mortality rate decreased from 5.4 per 1,000 in 2020 to 5 per 1,000 last year, the commission said.The mortality rates of pregnant women, infants and children under 5 years of age in China all dropped to their lowest levels in history in 2021, said Song Li, director of the maternal and child health department of the NHC.Wang Lin, 39, shows a very small bit of jelly to her students in the laboratory. The seemingly nondescript substance is sericin hydrogel, which plays a magical role in repairing damaged tissue.Over the past decade, she has led her team to work round the clock to extract such sericin from natural silk and do experiments to prove its function of tissue regeneration and repair.It's an unprecedented undertaking. Using natural silk, China's special biological material, makes her a pioneer in the country's regenerative medicine field.Last month, Wang was awarded the China Youth May Fourth Medal-the top honor for outstanding young Chinese people.Natural silk consists of silk fibroin and sericin. While silk fibroin is widely used in clinical practice, such as for surgical suture, sericin is often considered as a waste in the silk industry."We're the first in the biomedicine field to research sericin, opening up a new world. Our overseas counterparts have done much in-depth research about silk fibroin," Wang says.She's director of the Clinical Laboratory Department and Research Center for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.In 2005, she went to the United States to pursue a doctorate in biomedicine at Brown University.After that, she became a research fellow at Harvard University and visiting scholar at Michigan University, with great achievement in "regeneration and repair of skeletal muscle".In 2011, she returned to her hometown Wuhan, Hubei province, and established Central China's first regenerative medicine center.Health Care Science, a peer-reviewed academic journal written in English, was launched at Tsinghua University in Beijing on Saturday.With open access, it aims to provide a platform for researchers, policymakers and innovators to share knowledge in, mainly, seven academic sections, namely, health policy and medical ethics, healthcare evaluation and health economics, public health management, medical technologies and devices, medication use management, data science and health informatics as well as healthcare management in low- and middle-income countries.The journal especially welcomes articles based on quantitative methods with emphasis on specific healthcare settings which will have an impact on real-world operation and policymaking or about emerging hot topics in healthcare.According to Zhang Zongjiu, the editor-in-chief and executive deputy dean of the university's Institute for Hospital Management, the journal was founded in the context of the current global spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and a variety of chronic non-communicable diseases that continue to challenge global healthcare systems.By focusing on healthcare management driven by technological innovation and bringing together multidisciplinary professionals, it will further add to the improvement of healthcare service quality, the promotion of medical system reform and disease prevention strategies as well as the acceleration of scientific research and new technology applications.The journal will promote exchanges and cooperation in healthcare management and medical and health services. It will also expand the international influence of China's researches in this field, says Wang Xiqin, principal of the university.He adds that the launch of the journal is part of Tsinghua's effort to strengthen the construction of world-class sci-tech journals and its strive to become a world-class university.JINAN - Kim Hyung-ho arrived in China from the Republic of Korea on Aug 24,1992, which happened to be the same day that the two countries officially established diplomatic relations. Kim, just 19 at the time, came to China to study traditional Chinese medicine, a medical system with thousands of years of history and which enjoys popularity in many countries.Kim's passion for TCM took root in his teenage years after he had a twisted ankle treated with acupuncture. "It's incredible that a little needle can have such magical powers. That experience inspired me to learn authentic TCM in the place from which it originated," recalls Kim.During his 11 years of study in Harbin, Heilongjiang province, and Beijing, Kim learned from renowned experts in acupuncture and moxibustion to become proficient in both therapies.In 2013, he was hired as a TCM specialist by the international clinic of Qingdao Municipal Hospital (Group) in East China's Shandong province, becoming one of over 100,000 ROK nationals settling down in the coastal city."Doctor Kim is a professional, hardworking and nice," says Sun Jie, director of the clinic. "He also helps bridge the communication gap between our staff and Korean patients."With a specialty in acupuncture therapies for neurological diseases, Kim has treated numerous patients suffering from strokes or other neurological disorders. For those who have difficulty moving around, Kim will go to the patient's home to offer treatment.Apart from his daily work, Kim has also volunteered to provide free medical consultations in the countryside. Through regular consultations, he found that many rural people have been suffering from chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia, but are not aware of the severity of their conditions, let alone attend regular checkups.As a result, Kim led fellow volunteers to compile lists of people with chronic illnesses from different villages. The lists were handed to local authorities to keep track of the patients' treatment.While in the countryside, Kim also provided guidance and carried out tutorials for village doctors, which helped improve the standard of treatment in the area.Three decades have passed since Kim set foot in China, and he's very grateful for what he has gained in the country, especially after he started his own family in Qingdao. His daughter is 5 years old.As the two countries celebrate their 30 years of diplomatic ties this year, Kim feels even more obligated to better play a role in bilateral exchanges using his expertise."Medicine knows no boundaries. As a TCM practitioner, I will continue to communicate with my counterparts in the ROK and other countries to help it spread and flourish even further, so that more people can understand its excellence," says Kim.HAVANA - Cuba held a traditional Chinese medicine expo recently at the University of Havana. Organized by Havana's Confucius Institute, the outdoor event gathered university students, experts, doctors, and the general public.Yorbelis Rosell, director of the institute, says that the expo was aimed at expanding knowledge of TCM across the country and improving the work links between scientific institutions."The research on TCM is a paramount priority for our staff and students," she says. "We strongly believe that there are many topics we can still examine and many things we can learn from Chinese culture."The expo featured exhibitions, massage sessions and acupuncture workshops.Evelyn Gonzalez, president of the Cuban Society of Bioenergetic and Naturalist Medicine, says that TCM practices have been useful in the treatment of many ailments affecting the island's population."The efficacy of the TCM is undoubted," she says. "We are not only using herbal medicines to cure different illnesses, but also acupuncture, moxibustion and massage, among other techniques."At present, TCM is integrated into the public health system in the Caribbean nation from neighborhood doctor's offices to mainstream hospitals, according to Johann Perdomo, head of the Department of Natural and Traditional Medicine at the Cuban Ministry of Public Health."We are providing our experts with specialized training on TCM, so it can help promote healthy standards of living among people," he says. "The study of the traditional medicine is an integral part of our health approach."Cuba held a traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) expo during the Chinese Culture Week from Monday to Friday at the University of Havana.Organized by Havana's Confucius Institute, the outdoor event gathered university students, experts, doctors, and everyday Cubans.Yorbelis Rosell, director of the Confucius Institute, said that the expo was aimed at expanding knowledge about the TCM across the country and improving the work links between scientific institutions."The research on the TCM has a paramount priority for our staff and students," she said.

"The study of the traditional medicine is an integral part of our health approach."The 5th Myasthenia Gravis Conference was held online during the weekend, ahead of the 9th Myasthenia Gravis Care Day, which falls on Wednesday.Organized by Aili Myasthenia Gravis Care Center, the conference aimed to bring together patients, doctors, scholars, charitable organizations and others to attract more attention to myasthenia gravis and people who have it, as well as improve their situations.Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a long-term neuromuscular disease, which can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, trouble walking and even endanger one's life. However, patients can return to normal life after timely and sufficient treatment.The 2022 health report of Chinese MG patients was released during the conference. Statistics from the report show the quality of life for patients has improved when compared with 2018, but their situations are still far from being good.Dong Dong, an associate researcher at Shenzhen Research Institute of The Chinese University of Hong Kong analyzed the report. According to her, patients are still burdened by the medical expenses. Thirty percent of adult patients cannot get employed or shoulder family responsibilities. Seventy-six percent of them live in depression or anxiety.Neurologist Xu Xianhao gave a keynote speech during the conference, in which he introduced the research and development of medicines that has potential to be helpful for MG patients. He predicted there would be more medicine and better therapies for them in the future, and encouraged them to live with hope.Young woman dedicates her time to raising awareness about the need to protect Yangtze's 'smiling angels', Cheng Yuezhu reports.The waters of the Yangtze River are home to the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise, known locally as the "smiling angel" thanks to its upwardly extending mouth, which gives it a seemingly cheery expression.Currently, however, there is little for the creature to smile about. With only around 1,000 of the porpoises left, the government, researchers and volunteers are working hard to preserve the species. Tan Ge, secretary of Yueyang Porpoise Protection Association in Hunan province, is one of them.Born in 1991, Tan grew up in Hunan's Yueyang, a city beside Dongting Lake, which is linked to the Yangtze River. However, it wasn't until she started working that she learned about this precious aquatic animal, and that a group of volunteers was working to protect them."At first, I started donating food and protective gear like hats and gloves. I just wanted to do everything I could to relieve a little of their stress," Tan says.Hardworking counselors all over the country offer a lifeline to people in mental and emotional distress, Wang Qian reports.Mental health service hotline operator Su Wei will never forget a call he received from a woman in Wuhan, Hubei province, when the city was mired in the battle against the first COVID-19 outbreak.He was one of the nearly 100 counselors around the country working for the 12355 hotline specifically assigned to offer support and address the psychological needs of people in Wuhan during the peak of the outbreak in early 2020.Besides working as a counselor, he is also in charge of the operation of the 12355 Beijing service program.It was around midnight, and when he picked up the phone, he could hear the sound of wind."It was a woman in her late 20s. She said that she was on top of a makeshift hospital and she could not get hold of herself," Su recalls."She, her husband and their child had been separated and were in three different places. Although calling each other every day and knowing they were fine, she still worried about them. What's worse, she suffered from depression, but there was no medicine," the 47-year-old counselor says, adding that he could feel her desperation.Trying to keep his tone even, as if chatting with an old friend, Su began to ask her about her living environment and whether there were volunteers to help. The woman said that the environment was not good, but every volunteer had been kind and nice to her, even though they were overworked and exhausted, with the volume of patients far outweighing the staff capacity."Talking about the surrounding environment and the kindness given to her by the people around her was the turning point. Her focus was transformed from her own desperation to the present moment, which helped her find motivation and meaning in life," Su says, adding that all he wanted to do on the call was to keep her connected as long as possible, until someone found her."I told her that there were numerous people across the country like me who cared about people in Wuhan and she was not alone. I promised that, after the call, I would contact local authorities as soon as possible to get the medicine she needed," he says.Upon hearing other people's voices and a door opening over the phone, Su felt relieved, knowing that his strategy had worked. It was a volunteer coming to the roof to look for her, because she was not in bed."When she told me she was sorry and had to hang up, I was quite happy, not because of what I did, but because the call helped her realize there were many people ready to help and support her," Su says, smiling.The World Health Organization estimates that 54 million people in China suffer from depression, and about 41 million suffer from anxiety. The COVID-19 outbreak has exacerbated the situation.While a number of nationwide online mental health services have been established since the start of the pandemic, 12355 is a hotline that was set up by the Communist Youth League of China in the early 2000s. It has thousands of counselors, like Su, available to offer those in need timely mental health support.From Jan 13 to May 16, the Beijing hotline alone received more than 5,400 calls, with more than 100 calls a day at the peak, according to Su. The center has about 60 operators. It usually provides free hotline services from 9 am to 5 pm, seven days a week."As a hotline counselor, our work is to provide hope and encouragement to callers," Su says.Researcher Yuan Xin learned from a young age that to make a difference, he would need his brain to do the heavy lifting, Yang Feiyue reports.A childhood accident cost Yuan Xin his right arm.Yet, the 27-year-old from a small village in Xianning city, Central China's Hubei province, has taken it in his stride and never looked back."It was fate's joke on me," Yuan says.If anything, the loss was converted into an inexhaustible source of motivation, helping him roll with life's punches and shoot for the stars.With his remaining hand, Yuan has come up with ingenious designs and patents that have earned him more than 60 prizes and awards that are envy of his peers."One of the most unforgettable experiences is winning second prize at the Challenge Cup in 2019," says Yuan, who is now pursuing his doctoral degree in computer science at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology.The Challenge Cup contest was initiated in 1989 and is reputed among Chinese college students as being the Olympics of science and technology.Yuan's entry focused on the development of a shipborne water cannon that integrates computer-enhanced vision, artificial intelligence and object detection, all of which falls under his field of expertise."I settled on it as the project for the competition after I found existing water cannons at the time mostly relied on manual force," he says.Water cannons are mostly used for targeting and expelling illegitimate fishing boats."If we could deliver automatic monitoring and response, a great deal of labor would be saved," Yuan says, adding that it would also enable sharper observation and more efficient control of nautical crime, especially at night.His idea was adopted by his classmates, and they formed a team of eight for the competition. Yuan was elected the team leader.They got down to work on the programing and design and took it to a water cannon plant in Jiangsu province and a shipyard in Guangdong province to test and debug their automatic operating system."We had to make sure our auto system fit with a real-life cannon and ship, and took into account the wind fluctuation and other factors that would affect the operation of the water cannon," Yuan explains."So the field experiment was indispensable."The preparation lasted for more than a year, and, after much trial and error, Yuan's project eventually succeeded. It managed to offer real-time monitoring, as well as constant ship tracking, alarm and strike capabilities.The work by Yuan and his team won approval from the judges at the Challenge Cup for its viable operation and big future potential.The auto water cannon system has since been applied in some regions of the country."The whole process was challenging but fulfilling," Yuan says.It is one of the many similar experiences that have enriched Yuan's life and spurred him onward.Yuan doesn't remember exactly what happened to him at 3 years old.According to the accounts of Yuan's parents, he was walking behind his mother who was carrying a load of laundry to wash at a local river across a street, when a truck suddenly came around the corner and headed straight toward him.The China Soong Ching Ling Science and Culture Center for Young People began offering online physical training classes for students and their parents amid the new pandemic wave.Activities and games, designed by professionals for children and adults to engage in together, ensure adequate physical exercise for everyone even at home. Workouts that train different muscle groups are demonstrated by PE teachers to help students in middle schools build good postures.The center is also offering more than 700 online classes in subjects including arts, traditional Chinese culture and science, attracting over 10,000 views despite the difficulties and challenges caused by the resurge of COVID-19 cases in China.More Chinese are opting to work out at home via the internetLi Zhibin, 29, plays Ring Fit Adventure, an exercising action role-playing game with his Nintendo Switch console connected to the television, five times a week.He also plays Just Dance, a series of rhythm-related video games that allow him to dance to background music of popular songs, imitating movements of the on-screen dancers. He prefers to exercise at home rather than go to the gym because he feels more comfortable doing workouts in a familiar environment."Combining exercise with video games makes fitness less dull. I've learned many workouts for different functions as well," the office worker from Beijing said.Amid the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, more and more Chinese have realized the importance of health and have started exercising at home because of the control and prevention policy that hinders them from going out sometimes.In addition to such fitness games, they are also choosing to follow the guidance of online exercise short videos or livestreams. A few are seniors, inspired by their families.According to China Insights Consultancy, the number of people who exercised in China was about 300 million last year, and is expected to rise to 420 million by 2026. It's expected that the value of China's online fitness market will rise from 370.1 billion yuan ($56.44 billion) last year to 895.8 billion yuan in 2026.Since the COVID-19 epidemic started in 2020, Xu Chun has formed the habit of taking exercise at home every day via livestreamed fitness classes.Workouts at home are the best option for the 30-year-old because the commute from home to the gym is time-consuming, and she prefers to exercise in a more private place.In the first three months, she lost 12.5 kilograms due to regular exercise, lifestyle and a healthy diet. Since then, she has kept her weight at about 50 kilograms.She has made a 3-square-meter space at home into her private gym as she's purchased more exercise equipment, such as an indoor bike, barbells, kettlebells and resistance bands.South Africa Soong Ching Ling Foundation, a Chinese public welfare foundation's overseas branch, on Friday donated winter clothes, shoes, food and other stuff to South African children in Cape Town, to help them live better.The beneficiaries stay in the SOS Children's Village Cape Town, launched by former South African President Nelson Mandela in 1996. These children, aged between 2 and around 18, didn't have adequate parental care before they were brought to this home-like complex with social workers, who stay with children like their mothers. Some children living there are orphans, while others lived in vulnerable situations, whose parents could be drug users or drinkers.The donations, also including face masks and toys, are very useful to the children, as many of them even don't have a pair of proper shoes for the upcoming winter, the organization's corporate fundraiser Freroza Carlsen told Xinhua after receiving the donations.Although there have been donors, but the organization still needs more assistance in funding and materials to provide children with better care, she said.Carlsen said the organization receives a lot support from the Chinese community, adding that its workers go to Chinese shops to buy things like clothing as what they sell are more cost-effective and affordable.Chen Qing, head of South Africa Soong Ching Ling Foundation, told the children living in the SOS Children's Village that she hopes they can happily grow up and study well.The charity, which raises funds from the Chinese community, made its first donation to the organization in 2017. Last year, it donated funds to the organization when the country was in hard time due to COVID-19.South Africa Soong Ching Ling Foundation made around five donations towards vulnerable children and schools each year before the pandemic. In 2013, it funded a 1,000 square meter building of Baphumelele Orphanage in Cape Town's impoverished township Khayelitsha, which has dormitories and other functions."We hope to demonstrate, through charity acts, that the Chinese community in South Africa is willing to give to local societies," Chen told Xinhua.Some crooks are preying on people's goodwill to donate unwanted items, which are then sold for a profit, public warnedAs spring arrived, Xia Yiming rearranged her parents' closet and helped them dispose of clothes that no longer fitted or were out-of-style. She usually does this twice a year.The helpful daughter washed the clothes, sorted them into different bags, and placed them in the clothing donation bins in the community of her parents' home in Fuzhou, Fujian province."It is a good way to help the needy and also keeps my mom and dad's closet neat and tidy. The old generation like my parents have a habit of hoarding," she said."They always kept used clothes, waiting to give them to some poor relatives or cleaning ladies, but now, very few people wear used clothes, so I just help donating them."When there was a public emergency, such as flood or earthquake, Xia donated unwanted clothes to needed areas.However, she never thought the goodwill might go wrong or even help criminals get rich.'Golden business'In March, a report from a news outlet ThePaper.cn found that without providing any public fundraising credentials, buyers can order donation bins from China's popular e-commerce platform Taobao at a price of about 400 yuan ($63). Some sellers even suggest that buyers print "charity federation" on the bins to attract more donations.According to the report, a metric ton of used clothes can be sold for 2,000-2,200 yuan. The report also quoted an insider saying that it is "an easy and golden business", with an annual profit of 500,000-600,000 yuan.The Ministry of Civil Affairs issued a notice to ban such activities last month.Recently, some individuals, social organizations and enterprises without any public fundraising qualification collected used clothes in the name of "charity" and "public welfare". Some even sold them for profit, which violates the provision of the Charity Law, jeopardizes donors' legal rights, tarnishes the image of the charity sector and should be prohibited, the notice said.The ministry also reminded people to check an organization's credentials before handing over a clothes donation.It is a public fundraising activity to set up used clothes donation bins in public for charitable reasons, the ministry said.According to the Charity Law, only charitable organizations with public fundraising qualifications can carry out public fundraising activities. Meanwhile, the organizations with credentials should draw up detailed fundraising plans in accordance with charity law, related regulations and policies, and report to the local civil affairs administration.Information such as the organization's name, public fundraising credentials, contact information and donation tracing, should be printed in prominent places on donation carriers-in this case, the bins.Organizations are also required to publicize donation and tracing information in order to receive supervision from society.The ministry urged participants to check organizers' qualifications at cszg.mca.gov.cn, a platform used to disclose national charity information.If the organizers do not have public fundraising credentials but carry out used-clothes collection activities, residents can report them to local civil affairs administrations.If illegal activities are found in the name of charity or they are pretending to be operated by a charitable organization but taking property by collecting used clothes, residents can report them to local public security authorities.Old problemZhang Yixun, a charity business insider, told the Red Star News, a media outlet in Sichuan province, that fake charity activities involving used clothes recycling are a difficult problem that has harmed the reputation of China's charity business for years.In 2019, the ministry issued a reminder to tackle fake charity activities in the realm of recycling used clothes and other waste items. At the same year, the ministry set up the Department of Charity Promotion and Social Work to strengthen the management of charity-related activities.However, since most of the fake recycling bins are small-scale, the administration is mostly dependent on local governments issuing penalties or tip-offs from communities and residents. It has been difficult to tackle illegal clothes recycling bins, Zhang said. He also noted that the key to manage the misconduct relies on whether local civil affairs departments have managed it properly.In the illegal enterprise, some good-quality used clothes will be cleaned and sold. Poor-quality clothes will be sold to recycling companies.Zhang suggested that people exchange their unwanted clothes within their community or between relatives and friends. He also said some valuable used clothes can be sold on second-hand e-commerce platforms or to vintage shops.Some fast-moving consumer fashion brands recycle used or unwanted clothes. This ensures the donations go through procedures including decomposition and purification to regenerate waste clothing into new fabrics."Donation activities began in the 1990s on a regular basis. Back then, without private enterprise or social organization participation, donated used clothes were usually recycled by civil affairs departments that set up donation centers in a community," Wang Zhenyao, president of the China Philanthropy Research Institute, told Red Star News.China's regular social donation work-which mainly relies on the donation of used clothes-began in 1996. Promoted by the civil affairs system, a regular social donation network consisting of more than 30,000 social donation sites was established nationwide, he added."Nowadays, public need for used clothes is weakening, so new ways are needed to take care of secondhand clothes. People can return unwanted clothes to commercial markets with or without being paid," he said. He added that in some foreign countries, goodwill stores are registered as social organizations, where the government provides rooms to recycle the used items and then sorts them to be sold again.Fraudsters punishedThe ministry issued an alert in 2019 to warn of fake charity activities in the name of recycling used items, including clothes.Last year, the civil affairs administration of Jiangyou city, Sichuan province, punished four fake charitable organizations for setting up used clothes recycling bins. A fine of 20,000 yuan ($3,050) was levied, the bins were removed and the illegal income was confiscated.In 2020, the civil affairs bureau in Liunan district of Liuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, removed 172 illegally used clothes recycling bins that were without public fundraising qualification or whose owners had failed to report their activities to the bureau.In addition, involvement from neighborhood residents and property managers is important to regulate charity conduct.According to the civil affairs bureau in Luzhou, Sichuan province, authorization is required from the housing and rural-urban development department to set up charitable clothes recycling bins in a community, and they are managed by a residence's property management office.According to an opinion piece in Beijing Youth Daily, there are usually two ways to recycle used clothes in China. One is by public donation, often via bins with charity information placed in a community. The other is for individuals or companies to handle used clothes, who often sell it for a profit.However, good-quality clothes should not be placed in charitable bins. Some people will take advantage of people's goodwill to carry out illegal activities.According to the Charity Law, individuals, business owners or organizations will be investigated and punished by the public security authorities for fraudulently obtaining property under the name of charity or impersonating a charitable organization. Sadly, there is no detailed regulation about what punishment they face.Xia Yiming looked closely at the used clothes recycling bins in her parents' community and found the organizer's information. She also found a new way to handle her parents' used clothes-by leaving a bag at the doorway on the first floor of her parents' building. She sent a message to the neighbors' WeChat group: "Used clothes suitable for those in their 60s. Feel free to pick it up, your neighbor."Searching for the keyword "clothes" at the Charity China website, a platform to disclose national charity information, more than 240 clothes donation charitable activities were found to be running for the past five years.According to the website, many of them are used clothes donation events. Organizers vary from regional charity societies to all kinds of foundations. Some activities lasted for days and some for years.Donors can check the activity's legitimacy on the website, such as an organizer's qualification and activity plans. Contact information is also available.One project organized by the China Children and Teenager's Fund started in 2017 and plans to end in 2027. The project's proposal is publicized on the website.For example, the aim of the project is to practice green development, promote the traditional virtue of helping the poor and the needy, advocate the lifestyle of practicing public welfare and help children from poor families.It also publicizes the operations of the project. By setting up used clothes recycling bins at office buildings and communities, donors can place clothes in the bin and collectors will retrieve the donations on a regular basis.The recycled old clothes are sorted. Items of higher value will be cleaned, disinfected, sorted and then sent to children from poor families. Poor-quality ones that are unable to be worn will be decomposed and regenerated into fabric to be used in industrial production.The profits gained in the process will be used by the project to ensure its healthy development. Unlike projects practiced across the country, some target people in need in a certain neighborhood.A three-year project organized by a charitable society in Fuyang district of Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, collects used clothes to help deprived local people.Some projects even sent secondhand clothes overseas. A project initiated by a charitable society in Xiaoshan, Hangzhou, said about 35 percent of second-hand summer clothes will be sent to Africa.We all need it, but for many it's a nuisance that they feel deprives them of living, Zhang Lei reports.For night owls like Chen Danhong, 28, who works for a technology company in Beijing, the day really just begins after about 8 pm, a psychological hint that she can relax, she says."When I get home I'm feeling worn out and tired, but that suddenly turns to excitement and I go on the internet, read novels or watch movies. I'll be playing video games and continually saying to myself, "OK, this is the last one" before I eventually realize that it's 2 o'clock. It's the same with watching TV, bingeing on a whole series before I realize it's 4 o'clock."For Chen, breaking promises about getting enough sleep has become a way of life. "I know that if things go on like this it's going to take a toll on my health, but I just can't help myself."Chen is suffering from what is called unforced sleeplessness, a term borrowed from tennis, in which an unforced error refers to a mistake that occurs when there is no pressure.Common symptoms include falling asleep later than 2 am, with the average time taken to fall asleep being more than one hour. Young people in cities are most vulnerable to such symptoms, according to the 2020 Chinese National Healthy Sleep White Paper by the China Sleep Research Association. Common causes are loneliness, overtime sequelae, excessive stress and emotional disorders.Nearly 75 percent of respondents to a survey said they had sleep problems, the paper says. The incidence of insomnia among Chinese adults is as high as 38.2 percent, which means that more than 300 million Chinese have sleep disorders. The most common of these are insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.The Sleeping Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Group on the social media site Douban, founded in 2006, says it has more than 100,000 members. Words you will often hear members of the group using include procrastination, anxiety and escapism."I really can't do anything about going to bed early," one member said in a posting.On March 21, designated by the United Nations as World Sleep Day, Nanguo Morning News, a newspaper in Guangxi autonomous region, conducted a survey that attracted 2,000 respondents, Forty-three percent of them said they sleep late every day because they feel that the only time of the day that truly belongs to them is just before they go to bed, and they treasure that so much that they are reluctant to sleep.About 36 percent of respondents said they go to bed late at least three days a week, and only 2 percent said they never go to bed late. According to the survey, the reasons for going to bed late vary widely, with overtime work or taking care of a baby accounting for just 5 percent of the respondents' answers on this question. Sixty-four percent said they sleep late because they watch dramas, variety shows, read books or play with their mobile phones. Fourteen percent said they do not want to go to bed too early even if they have nothing to do.Twenty-six percent said their time during the day has been occupied by work and children, and they want to enjoy the time that truly belongs to them; 25 percent said they are very sleepy and tired in the middle of the night, but their minds are very active; 21 percent said a hindrance to sleep is their mobile phone, while at the same time doing things with them makes them happy as they retired for the night.Chen Xingrong's favorite activity is hopping onto the swing in the middle of the living room and dangling around.The swing was set up by his father to help him learn how to swim without water."When he is happy, he jumps on the swing and smiles from ear to ear. This is his way of saying 'I am happy'," says Chen's father Chen Xunhu. "But he is a big boy now and has grown as tall as 1.78 meters, and the swing has become a bit too small for him."Chen Xingrong, 16, was diagnosed with autism when he was a baby.Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills and social interactions, and by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior.There are at least 10 million cases of autism in China, with more than 2 million of which are children, according to an industry report released in 2015.In spite of all the hardships in life, Chen Xingrong managed to become an outstanding swimmer, thanks to relentless training and the love and support of his family and community members.Last year, he won five medals, including a gold, at the 11th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the eighth National Special Olympic Games.Born in Hainan province, Chen Xingrong could not utter a word until he was 2 years old. After being diagnosed with autism, his parents were worried."We did not understand why such a thing would happen to us," Chen Xunhu says, adding that he began traveling to big cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou, Guangdong province, to learn more about autism. During the process, he learned how to communicate properly with autistic people. He quit his job at a computer company and devoted his full attention to the topic of autism.In 2012, Chen Xunhu learned that swimming could help people with autism enhance their vital capacity and articulation, so he spent months learning how to swim by watching videos and reading books."I spent three months teaching my son, but the efforts were in vain," he recalls.To his surprise, after another three months, he discovered that his son had developed the ability to control his breath under water, which significantly boosted his confidence, and swimming soon became a key activity of the family.The father laid the groundwork for his son's swimming lessons. On one wall of their home hangs a table for Chen Xingrong's routine exercises."I used to plan all his exercises for him, but now it is all up to him," says the father. "He decides how many exercises he wants to do, and we respect his choices. It's a process of self-management."Two hand rings and a swing are suspended from the roof, all of which were installed by the father to help Chen Xingrong strengthen his muscles and learn swimming movements more precisely.In October, the father took his son, and several other disabled athletes, to participate in the 11th National Paralympic Games and the eighth Special Olympics in Xi'an, Shaanxi province.His son managed to claim five medals, including a gold."It was really exciting," says the father. "My son looked so happy on the podium!"As well as swimming, learning basic life skills is also an important part of life for a teenager with autism."I hope that my son can live well on his own when we grow old," says the father.Chen Xunhu has made great efforts to make people in their community understand autism better.In 2010, an autism-themed film, titled Ocean Heaven, hit the big screen in China. It depicts how a terminally ill father attempts to teach his son the necessary life skills to live without him."My wife and I watched the film in the theater," he says. "We sobbed uncontrollably because we could resonate with the film's characters. It took us some time to regain our composure before exiting the cinema."Thereafter, the father organized about 500 people to watch the film together in the cinema."I wanted the public to know more about autistic people so as to reduce misunderstanding," says the father.Thanks to his father's resolute perseverance, Chen Xingrong has learned to buy food in the market in their neighborhood. He also does voluntary jobs at supermarkets and fast-food restaurants, such as arranging shelves and cleaning dining tables."He is good at skillfully arranging cluttered goods. He also likes to attend patients in clinics by monitoring their infusion bottles and covering the patients with quilts," says Chen Xunhu."He is part of the community, and I hope he will live a wonderful life in the future."Half an hour before class, art teacher Dong Fangyi starts to prepare for the day, putting out brushes and canvas with the help of his 14-year-old student Dazhi (pseudonym).Later, the scene in the class is a little out of the ordinary, as some students are silent and concentrating while others are restless and excited, banging on their desks.All the children in the class have been diagnosed with autism. The painting studio was founded by a public welfare service center in Xi'an, the capital city of Northwest China's Shaanxi province, which mainly involves parents of neurodiverse children, or those with mental difficulties, from more than 600 households.With an operation model of mutual assistance, the parents are not attempting to rehabilitate their children, but are allowing them to develop their abilities through proper social interaction."Through painting, they can improve their artistic creativity and concentration while gaining some confidence," says Chen Ao, founder of the center, also the mother of a child with autism.Customers at Beijing FLTRP Bookstore get a free bookmark when they buy a coffee there, but few are aware of the challenges that the bookmark artist has overcome.The bookstore is named after the Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press.Kang Rui, 23, has worked at the bookstore since 2018, hand-painting posters, postcards and bookmarks.Kang is autistic and his unusual behavior and impaired conversational abilities can unsettle some people, but his art enchants them and it's a major attraction for the bookshop.Autism in China has an incidence of 0.7 percent, and more than 2 million children under the age of 12 are autistic. The figure is rising by about 200,000 each year.In the run-up to World Autism Awareness Day on April 2, Kang's story came under the spotlight as he is one of the lucky few to find a job they like and can support themselves.Kang can paint landscapes, still life, cartoon figures and self-portraits. His work is on display in neighboring schools as well as the bookstore. He created a set of winter sport-themed paintings for the Beijing Winter Olympics and they were on show in the organizing committee building.The bookstore job brings him joy and a sense of achievement. Many see him as a genius, but do not see the sacrifices behind the scenes.Like most Chinese parents, Kang's mom and dad were determined that their son would receive the best education.Seeds are the "chips" of agriculture. Academian Yuan Longping spent more than 50 years turning a wild rice seed into a "super rice" that benefits the world.Spring is the season for sowing. The Hunan Provincial Crop Germplasm Resource Bank, within the Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, preserves, inspects and breeds the little-known crop seeds every day. The resource bank is the first comprehensive public service platform for the conservation and utilization of crop germplasm resources in Hunan.Its total construction area is nearly 700 square meters, of which the low temperature control area covers an area of 350 sq m. There are five warehouses including long, medium and short-term, as well as parental and adjustable repositories. It also has six functional areas: strategic resource protection, basic resource preservation, resource display and exchange, resource information management and resource pre-processing.Jiang Huan didn't understand his father's decision to donate his organs until an organ donation coordinator told him that the transplant surgery was successful and had helped save a life.Families of organ donors, alongside the recipients and coordinators, gather at the Chongqing Organ Donation Memorial Park in Bishan district of Southwest China's Chongqing, every Tomb Sweeping Day, or the Qingming Festival in the Chinese lunar calendar, which fell on Tuesday this year. Holding commemorative ceremonies and laying wreaths in solemnity, they pay tribute to the departed for their generosity."Hearing that one life was saved due to my father's donation, I realized the greatness of his heart and the true meaning of life," Jiang says. "It feels like his life was extended, and he would continue to accompany me with no goodbye."In 2010, China officially launched a national pilot program for human organ donation, which gave rise to numerous donation coordinators like Zhou Lijuan. With her mobile phone available 24 hours day and night, Zhou gets used to rushing to hospitals whenever there are any potential organ donors."We are often misunderstood, rejected, and even cursed by the family members. But agonizing scenes of patients waiting for organ transplant opportunities always come to my mind first," says Zhou. She adds that the eagerness in the eyes of those patients has motivated her over the years to stand up for her duty."It's not how much time you have but how you use it that matters," says a card from a donor's family presented at the memorial park.A decade ago, Wan Ying, a patient with impaired vision due to marginal corneal degeneration, received a corneal transplant thanks to a deceased donor. "I was in urgent need of a suitable cornea, and my family was almost desperate at that time," Wan says. "I was lucky to be given the priority in receiving the transplant as one of my family members was a registered donor whose cornea was used in 2005."Now, Wan is thankful for every moment she gets to witness with her loved ones thanks to her improved vision. "The donor in my family is observing the world through the eyes of an organ recipient, as the donor of my new cornea," she says.Since Chongqing gave the green light to cornea donation in 1980 and started work on human organ donation in 2012, the city has registered donations of 4,929 bodies, 817 organs, and 2,896 corneas.Zhang Qi, an ophthalmologist at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, says that the Chongqing Eye Bank recorded more than 2,700 corneal donations, helping more than 3,300 patients recover their sight."Though the figure is still far from enough to meet the mounting need of patients, I believe that more will get involved in the benevolent undertaking and bring hope and light to those suffering from the darkness," Zhang notes.In recent years, organ donations and transplants in China have gained momentum, allowing those with organ failure to start anew. According to data released on the China Organ Donation Administrative Center website, as of Saturday, more than 4.62 million people had signed up as organ donors.When I was approached to cover the 2022 Beijing Winter Paralympic Games, I felt honored. Having a very close friend in the United States who lives with quadriplegia and witnessing firsthand the challenges he faces each day, I am inspired by his perseverance and independence. His spirit moves me. I knew attending the Paralympics would also move me. And it did, which I'll cover for a future column.A month prior to entering the closed loop for the Games, we were notified that we were required to complete hotel quarantine before returning to the general public. Why the need for quarantine after having been inside a strictly closed circuit during the events? With so many people traveling into Beijing from other countries, there had been positive COVID-19 cases. Three days after the Paralympics began, a positive case was found in my hotel. Quarantine was mandatory for seven days-or 14 days if a positive case appears in your hotel. So, 14 days it is.While I wasn't thrilled with the idea of having to quarantine, it didn't deter my enthusiasm to attend the Winter Paralympics. I thought, the best thing to do is to start preparing immediately. For anyone, being confined to a small space for any period of time can have negative effects on one's mental health. I began to analyze the items in my home that make me feel most "at home".As someone who is typically prepared for any "worst-case scenario", I began to make a list of essentials: hygiene products, cleaning sprays and laundry soap of lavender fragrance, my bedding, TV streaming subscriptions-the list goes on. But, being my overly thorough self, I went a step above and beyond-a mini refrigerator and a travel washing machine. I plugged in the refrigerator three days ahead of leaving home and filled it with cheese, meat, yogurt and milk. When it was time to go, everything, including my clothing, fitted nicely into two extra-large suitcases.But not everything went smoothly. When I arrived in my hotel room, I plugged the refrigerator in and made sure it was set at "cold". I didn't need to get anything from it as everything was brought for the quarantine period. But, on day three, I decided I would try some cheese. To my horror, it was warm inside the refrigerator-around 40 degrees! The cheese had melted. Fortunately there was a refrigerator in the room so I plugged it in and transferred everything. You may think all was lost. I sure did. However, the yogurt and meat survived and I was able to get more cheese from the dining hall at the Games.Once we began quarantine, all participants (222 people) were put into a group chat with the staff and volunteers. After a few hours, the chat was filled with special requests and specific food orders. Aside from those who wanted to avoid food waste or having food allergies and religious diet restrictions, it was making quarantine more stressful. The chat group made me feel terrible for the members of staff who were trying their best to fulfill everyone's commands and make people feel comfortable. Finally, I sent my own message, which read more or less: The hotel staff are working very hard. When you make so many demands, you put more work on the staff. Let's all be grateful for what we have, which is food and a place to live. Not everyone in the world has these things. Let's say thank you to the staff for their hard work.My message received support and the group went quiet for about three hours. The lesson learned: add the hotel staff in the instance where you might need something urgent and then leave the group so you can enjoy your quarantine with as little bickering as possible.On day five of quarantine, I woke up with a sore throat. Beijing is quite dry so I shrugged it off and played video games. On day six, I could barely swallow without wincing. On day seven, I was dealing with a low-grade fever. What does one do when one is in quarantine to prevent the spread of a virus? I was conflicted. I decided to wait it out. After all, it wasn't a full-on fever and I was still functioning. I was hesitant because I wasn't clear on the protocol-would they immediately take me to a hospital? Would everyone need to complete an extra seven days of quarantine because of me?On day eight, it became clear that I needed assistance as my fever had spiked to almost 39 degrees. I thought my best course of action was to reach out to my team leader, who contacted the appropriate party. The staff was more than understanding and got in touch with a doctor who was able to diagnose me with streptococcus, who then provided me with an antibiotic. Since all of my PCR tests for COVID-19 had come back negative over the course of being inside the closed loop, there was no fanfare or worry.People might be put off by the idea of quarantining outside their homes, but if you can prepare yourself with the items that you know will make you most comfortable and adopt the attitude that you have more than many others around the world, you'll find it's not as bad as it might seem.Space-based lectures, with the aim to popularize science, inspire generations. Zhao Lei reports.Song Guoliang, a spacecraft engineer in Beijing, remembers a special lesson-China's first space-based science lecture-that led him to join the industry."I can clearly recall the lecture that took place in June 2013, near the end of my fifth year in middle school. I was most impressed by the experiment using a rotating top that showed us how the law of conservation of angular momentum works. After the lecture, I was still fascinated by the rotating top and went to my physics teacher to discuss details of the interesting experiment," the young researcher said.The lecture lasted some 45 minutes, but it was long enough to spark Song's interest in spaceflights. He chose to apply for Beijing Institute of Technology's School of Aerospace Engineering the next summer, determined to devote himself to China's space endeavors."Studying spacecraft engineering made me realize the reason why the rotating-top experiment was selected for the space lecture-it was because the astronauts wanted to show us the physical laws behind a spaceflight," he said. "The lecture injected curiosity about space journeys and explorations in countless students like me and succeeded in spreading space knowledge."After his graduation, Song landed a job at what appeared to be a most suitable place for a space enthusiast-the China Academy of Space Technology in the northwestern suburbs of Beijing. The academy is a major pillar of China's space program and has developed most of the country's satellites and lunar probes, and all manned spaceships.Song is not the only one at the academy who has been inspired by space lessons.Cao Hangchang, also a spacecraft engineer at the academy, said he was in awe when watching astronauts displaying interesting physical phenomena only possible in microgravity and was motivated to learn more about the universe and space travel.Like Song, Cao took the national college entrance exam in July 2014. He was admitted by Beihang University in Beijing, the alma mater of many renowned Chinese space scientists and engineers."The lecture was a key driving force that made me select Beihang and then this academy. Now, I work with many people to design and build our country's new spacecraft, doing the job I had dreamed of nine years ago," he said.Longwang community is now the last shanty town in Luyang district in ever-expanding Hefei, capital of Anhui province. The area is home to thousands of migrant workers who have come from their rural hometowns to work in Hefei.Liu Yuhan, 12, lives with his parents in a single-room accommodation of a two-storied building, for which they pay a monthly rent of about 500 yuan ($78.45).Liu's parents brought him to Hefei years ago. In the early days, when his parents were out at work during the day, Liu had nowhere to go after school. Until help arrived, in the form of Zhang Letian, a 32-year-old woman who returned to Hefei in 2017 after doing a bachelor's course in international communication followed by a master's course in professional accounting, both in Australia.With her qualification, she could easily have found a stable job and settled down. But a chance encounter with the migrants opened her eyes to the plight of migrant children and it made her change her plans.Rapid development in the cities is making many rural residents flock to urban areas in search of jobs. In the early years, many of them would leave their children behind, because of the high cost of living and education in the cities.The few who did bring their children with them could never spare enough time to look after their needs and education or spend on their extracurricular activities."Not all migrants know the importance of giving attention to their children," says Zhang, who made use of donations to establish the Hefei Luyang Evergreen Social Work Service Center, a non-government organization to look after the welfare and education of migrant workers' children.The center has the use of a three-storied building that the local government has provided for free. Zhang has also hired 12 full-time workers to help look after the children.Thanks to Zhang's efforts, Liu and hundreds of other children like him now have a place to go to after school where they can play, do their homework and engage in activities, such as painting."We charge each child about 200 yuan for about four months, to cover the cost of the painting tools," says Zhang.Last April, she organized a hiking trip for these children and their parents to the local Shushan Mountain."As I was relaxing there, the mother of one of the kids came up to me and said she had not had the luxury, all these days, of spending time with her kids under the sun, busy as she had been all these days, working endlessly at a restaurant," says Zhang."That's when I realized how my work had made a difference to someone and I will keep doing it."No haste, no waste in this scientist's laboratory with infinite possibilities.As graduation time approaches, Zhang Xin rearranges her shelves to make room for more empty Champagne bottles. "To me, each empty bottle is full of memories," says Zhang, adding that 10 such bottles adorn the shelves in her office.A leading interdisciplinary researcher in China, Zhang is also an academic supervisor to master's and doctorate students. She is the deputy director and principal investigator of the High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences."After master's and doctorate students finish their dissertation and pass the defense, we open a bottle of Champagne for each of them to celebrate," says Zhang. "After we drink from it, they sign their name on the bottle and put the date they graduated in to mark the wonderful time they have spent in our lab," says Zhang, admiring a bottle left by her first PhD student in 2016.Zhang, who was born in 1979, studied medical science at the Beijing Medical University, which later became part of Peking University in 2000, and went to study at the Indiana University in the United States in 2001.She has been focusing on research involving magnetic fields and how to use them to improve human health.After completing her PhD, she did post-doctoral work at the Harvard Medical School until 2012. Since then she has been working at the CAS institute based in Hefei, capital of East China's Anhui province.The institute has state-of-the-art research facilities, and using these Zhang's team has achieved many breakthroughs. For example, the team concluded that healthy mice are safe in environments having magnetic fields of up to 30 tesla-a unit to measure magnetic flux density. The earlier known safe upper limit was 16 tesla.The results proved very important in the development of ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, equipment, which is widely used in hospitals.Diagnosing different diseases using MRI requires various magnetic flux densities, but scientists need to first verify the safe upper limit by exposing animals to different magnetic fields in experiments, she says.Zhang's team also observed for the first time that the orientation and morphology of mitotic spindles-a structure that separates chromosomes during mitosis (cell division)-can be changed using a ultra-high magnetic field. This finding is also helping in cancer research.Yu Biao, one of Zhang's PhD students, says the supervisor's office seemingly has a magical power to solve problems and calm nerves. Yang Xingxing, another PhD student, says Zhang has always been the first person to open the door of the laboratory in the morning.Calligraphy art work done by her father-in-law adorns the walls in Zhang's office. One of them reads: "What we know is limited, while what we don't know is infinite." Another piece says: "Haste makes waste."Zhang strives to avoid any haste, while maximizing the time she can spend at work.Zhang notes that there are fewer women than men in research institutes. "For example, about 20 percent of scientists at the associate professor level in our institute are women," the professor says. "At my level, it's less than 10 percent."She hopes more women will break the mold and do what they like in life, rather than playing traditional roles that were expected of them in the past. She regrets that the society often takes it for granted that women should spend more time caring for their families.One of Zhang's students mentioned in the acknowledgments section of her dissertation that Zhang was a role model for her, balancing her career and family life well."I try to take all the help I can get," Zhang says, noting that she gets a lot of help from her parents-in-law.Her husband, himself a scientist, too, spends as much time as possible with their children, Zhang says. On second thoughts, she says that the cooperation she receives from her husband should not be called "help". It is just what being a father entails. And she wants more fathers to do their bit.NEW DELHI－Acupuncture has become a bridge of friendship between India and China, with more Indians accepting the form of traditional Chinese medicine over the past few decades, experts say.Acupuncture, a technique to cure various ailments, was introduced in India in 1959 by B.K.Basu in the eastern city of Kolkata, capital of West Bengal state, according to Mrigendranath Gantait, president of the Acupuncture Association of India.Over the past six decades, it has spread to rural, semi-urban and urban areas in India, particularly in the states of West Bengal, Maharashtra and Punjab.While the state governments of West Bengal and Maharashtra have officially recognized acupuncture as a way of treatment, the Indian central government recognized it as a "system of healthcare" in 2019.Acupuncture is a complementary medical practice that entails stimulating certain points in the body, usually with needles penetrating the skin, to alleviate pain or help treat various health conditions.Efforts are also on to popularize it more in the South Asian nation, experts say.Acupuncture therapy in India is related to the story of the Indian medical mission that was dispatched to China to provide medical assistance during the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45).Basu, as a colleague of Dwarkanath Kotnis (widely known as Ke Dihua in China) and a torchbearer of the Indian medical mission, stayed in China from 1938 to 1943, and later worked for 43 years in India until his death in 1986.From 1958 to 1959, Basu stayed in China to learn acupuncture before introducing the needle techniques in India. In 1973, Basu was invited to China to learn newly developed acupuncture anesthesia.From the very beginning, Basu tried to spread acupuncture to doctors by free teaching to broad masses of people. Basu, who established the Dr Dwarkanath Kotnis Memorial Committee and the Acupuncture Association of India, donated his house and savings to the government of West Bengal state for the purpose of acupuncture development.Under the leadership of the committee, free health service clinics have been set up where acupuncture is taken as the main treatment modality, because the cost of acupuncture treatment is low, and acupuncture is effective for many ailments. The committee has also produced many acupuncturists who run these clinics without taking any remuneration, according to Gantait."Acupuncture has played a unique role to promote people's friendship between India and China," he says. "When Basu returned to India after learning acupuncture anesthesia, the Indian media described it as acupuncture diplomacy, and it was highly praised in the country."Inderjeet Singh Dhingra, who is a leading acupuncture practitioner in India's northern state of Punjab, runs a small hospital in the industrial town of Ludhiana, treating people with tiny needles.He says acupuncture can bring relief for many diseases, including body pain, gynecological problems, paralytic dysfunction and arthritis.Xinhua  Program backing China's golden generation of Paralympians set to provide far-reaching benefits for accessibility in winter sports, Fang Aiqing reports.The relentless effort of Chinese athletes reaped great rewards as, between them, they won an unprecedented 61 medals at the recent Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games.They wouldn't have been able to reach such sporting heights without the technological support that kept them safe in both training and the competition itself, while also helping them to improve performance.These assistive devices and items of sporting equipment are the result of a research program launched in 2018 and led by Ji Linhong, a mechanical engineering professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing."Science and technology are like catalysts for these athletes with physical challenges to tap their potential and realize their dreams," he says.In the past four years, a dozen sports colleges and research institutes involved in the program have been implementing knowledge of material science, biomechanics and mechanical engineering to discover and solve problems for the Paralympians.They paid close attention to physical strength and skills training, nutrition and psychological conditioning, injury prevention, fatigue recovery and rehabilitation of the athletes.For example, the sit-skis Chinese cross-country skiers used and the "capsule" part of the mono-ski and outrigger setup some alpine skiers employed were all tailored to each individual competitor, taking into account different postures and range of movements."It's important that we're comfortable with the equipment, as it has to be integrated with our bodies and be able to move as one. They (Ji's team) modified the equipment whenever we needed them to," Zheng Peng, Paralympian cross-country skier and twotime gold medal winner, told China Youth Daily.Mao Zhongwu, 36, who bagged one gold and two silvers in cross-country skiing, had, alone, swapped out a dozen sit-skis, as did other skiers, who also constantly needed to change their equipment, Ji says.He explains that the material, structure, weight and intensity, and even the conjuncture of the artificial limb and human joints, can affect competitive performances.The team also designed a digital platform to simulate real scenarios in laboratory conditions to analyze the way the skiers moved, from the way they used their poles and the skis, to the corresponding muscle activities.As spring equinox approaches, the day and night balance across the globe. In the Chinese traditional calendar, spring equinox, or Chunfen in Chinese, is the best time to go outdoors to fly kites. Also, people cook sprouting vegetables to welcome a season of renewal and rebirth.Falling on March 20, Chunfen is the fourth of the Twenty-four Solar Terms following Awakening of Insects about half a month ago. Usually, Chinese people do farm work based on the solar terms. However, Chunfen is one of the few solar terms that has little relevance to agriculture, according to Nie Yuanlong, an expert on traditional culture.Chun in Chinese means spring while fen refers to divide the spring. It signals half of the season. After Chunfen, daytime gets longer and warm weather heralds colorful landscapes."People in different places have different traditions to celebrate Chunfen. They often go out to take part in various activities to enjoy the good weather and also have fresh vegetables on their tables," Nie says.For kite makers like Yang Liping, Chunfen is the best time to fly them. Since he was a little boy, it was a tradition for him and his friends to fly kites on Chunfen because the wind is stable and kites can easily soar.Yang is good at making swallow-shaped kites, a typical type of kite in Beijing. In ancient Chinese poems, poets described the migration of swallows from south to north in spring.City residents spring into action to tackle the latest COVID-19 outbreak, Xing Yi reports.People in Shanghai are doing their best to break the transmission chain in the latest outbreak in the city, Gu Honghui, head of the office leading the city's COVID-19 response, said in a news conference on Tuesday.According to the municipal health commission, there have been more than 1,000 new locally transmitted COVID-19 infections since the start of March, with the majority being asymptomatic."The latest outbreak is the toughest challenge to our epidemic prevention and control," says Gu, who is also the deputy secretary-general of the Shanghai municipal government."We've detected the virus in places with dense traffic, including shopping malls, schools, hospitals and public toilets," he adds. "We are now at a critical stage and the task of curbing the spread of the virus remains arduous."Having grown up in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, where there is a growing Chinese population, Syed Shams ul-Hassan naturally had many Chinese friends who shared with him what China was like.As such, when it came to choosing a country to further his studies, China seemed the obvious choice."My Chinese friends often told me about Chinese culture and history. I already knew about Shanghai and Beijing at an early age, but I felt that I needed to know even more," says the 31-year-old.In 2014, Hassan traveled to Hangzhou to pursue his master's degree in pharmacy. As well as knowledge, the Pakistani has also found love. In 2017, Hassan met a Hangzhou native, whom he married two years later. This was also why he decided to pursue his PhD at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, even though he was offered a place at the University of Sydney in Australia. Hassan will earn his doctorate in June.Apart from Shanghai, Hassan has also been to other cities including Hangzhou, Henan province's Zhengzhou, Jiangsu province's Nanjing and Shandong province's Qingdao, where he was amazed by "the kindness and warmth of Chinese people".This constant interaction with the locals has also taught him more about traditional Chinese medicine and shaped his personal habits."The pharmacology of traditional Chinese medicine, which has thousands of years of history, is complex and intriguing. Due to the few side effects that they have on the human body, I now turn to traditional Chinese medicine for minor ailments like coughs and colds," he says.Looking ahead, Hassan hopes to maintain his role as a bridge between two cultures by becoming a university lecturer who fosters greater levels of collaboration between China and Pakistan.Attention to detail and efficiency guarantee events go smoothly, Wang Ru reports.During the closing ceremony of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics held on Feb 20, a video about the work of volunteers was broadcast, and representatives of the volunteers were honored for their contributions to the Games.According to Teng Shengping, director-general of the volunteer department of the Beijing organizing committee, there were more than 18,000 volunteers at the Games, providing services related to venue management, language and media to ensure the event was completed successfully. Among them were students from the City University of Zhengzhou, who, after helping at the Olympics, worked to ensure the success of the Paralympics.On Jan 7, 34 students from the university, led by their 25-year-old supervisor Li Xinping, embarked on the journey from Zhengzhou, Central China's Henan province, to Beijing. It was the first time some of them had visited China's capital, and all of them felt excited."It may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work as a volunteer for the Winter Olympics, so I signed up for it," says 20-year-old Gao Ruikai, one of the students.They arrived in Beijing on Jan 8, and were appointed to work as security in Chaoyang district, checking the trucks and people transporting goods and materials to the Winter Olympics.They received strict training for eight days. Sometimes when they found what they learned too difficult to remember, Li would give them extra tutoring at night to help them memorize the knowledge so that they could pass both the theory and practical exams, and begin work, which started on Jan 21.They were separated into two groups, responsible for checking people and trucks respectively, according to Chen Mengjiao, 21, who was appointed to check for forbidden objects. The volunteers worked in teams, each consisting of four people. In one team, two people cooperated to work for two hours, before swapping places with the other two. Each day, the whole group checked about 300 people, on average.Bilibili star uses her platform to promote greater understanding of the lives and needs of disabled people, He Qi reports in Shanghai.Compared to most people with disabilities, Zhao Hongcheng is lucky.Born in 1990, a wheelchair has been part of Zhao's life since she was 1 year old due to the aftereffects of poliomyelitis. However, it did not stop her from completing her college and graduate studies before becoming a white-collar worker in Shanghai. And now, as a video content creator who has over 84,000 followers on the video-sharing platform Bilibili, Zhao wants to be a bridge between the disabled and the rest of society.Growing up in Shaodong, a small county in Hunan province, Zhao's childhood was relatively smooth thanks to the support of her parents."Maybe because my parents are teachers, they attached great importance to my education, so I successfully completed my studies," says Zhao, who majored in English at a university in Hunan province and later pursued a master's degree in English literature at a university in Shanghai.After graduating, Zhao was hired by e-commerce giant Alibaba in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. She spent the next five years working in the internet industry as a product manager for both gaming giant NetEase and service company Meituan.First attempt"I made my first video in 2019," Zhao says, adding that it was also the year she moved to Shanghai."My original purpose was to find an emotional outlet. I always encountered inconvenience caused by my wheelchair when going out, which made me feel sad. However, I barely had any disabled friends, so I had no one to talk to. I felt quite lonely," Zhao explains.In 2019, the rising popularity of short videos inspired Zhao."I felt that I should make some videos of what I experienced in my daily life. If it went well, it could give people with disabilities references and suggestions, and if not, at least it would draw people's attention to related issues," Zhao says.Under the username Da Chengzi Hao Meimei on Bilibili, her first vlog was about a trip to Guangzhou with friends. The video was viewed more than 2,000 times on the first day, which surprised Zhao."I had no idea that this content would attract such a large audience," she says. She had joined many disabled communities during that time and received a lot of positive feedback about that video."This made me feel that there were many things worth sharing in my life, and it also gave me a sense of mission," she explains. That first video has since been viewed over 48,000 times.Her fourth video, displaying how she got to work in a wheelchair, made her even more popular.In the video, she rides her wheelchair to work, gets lunch in the canteen, and goes on an outing with colleagues. "I just want to show how convenient it is for me to work in an office and to encourage more disabled people to find a job and live a regular lifestyle."The video received more than 300,000 views on Bilibili in a short period of time."During that time, I received many private messages on Bilibili, besides many invitations from the media, which made me realize that I'm not just followed by a small group of people, as I had previously thought," she adds.Rising ambitionAfter her fourth video went viral, she continued to make short videos and, in 2021, became a full-time content creator on Bilibili.In her video about an accessibility bus tour in Shanghai, she put forward a piece of advice for such facilities. Fortunately, her proposal was adopted by the city and is currently being optimized.To test the convenience of barrier-free public transport in Shanghai, she showed up at the bus station alone. After waiting for nearly 10 buses with no sign of accessibility facilities, she finally managed to get on one. Although she got on the bus and arrived at her destination, the trip was not very smooth."If people with disabilities face such service every day, they will definitely give up traveling," she says in her video.Therefore, Zhao penned suggestions to related administrations, including providing information on bus routes with accessibility facilities and standardizing the service for disabled passengers."I hope my travel can be guaranteed by the system, rather than relying on the kindness and consciousness of bus drivers," Zhao says in her video.Before long, the Shanghai Municipal Road Transport Administrative Bureau provided its feedback to Zhao. As well as accepting the suggestion, they also improved the situation.Zhao's other videos, including a list of praise and criticism for various daily travel experiences in Shanghai, have also received wide attention. Her trips include those to theaters, cinemas, and bookstores, all of which have resonated with many disabled people, leading her to call for equal treatment of the disabled in public places."One of the great things about being a content creator is that I feel like I have the initiative of discourse-that is, (talking about) the real difficulties and pains that a disabled person faces," Zhao says."Many stories or reports on people with disabilities are covered by the so-called able-bodied, and rarely report from the perspective of a disabled person," she says. "We go to college, find a job, go on dates-but these are just our daily lives."Dedication and determination prove winning combination as she leads a committed team tackling COVID-19, Yuan Quan and Zhou Zhou report.The proverb "great power in small things" has a great many applications, but it very aptly describes Wang Qihui, a petite Chinese woman who has taken on a challenging mission: to develop new antibody drugs that can defeat COVID-19.Since January 2020, when Wang first volunteered to work on COVID-19, the virologist at one of China's top academic institutions has been racing against the clock to find ways of defeating the deadly virus. Her efforts have yielded significant results, although she continues to conduct research on further solutions.Wang, 37, works at the Institute of Microbiology, affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in the north of Beijing. Her office is a bright room filled with books, simple furniture and a light floral fragrance. It could be mistaken for business premises, were it not for the white-coated personnel walking around the laboratory opposite.Over the past two years, Wang has led her laboratory team in conducting research on the development of reagent testing, neutralizing antibodies and recombinant vaccines. She has worked around the clock, often foregoing food and sleep.Tasked with finding effective antibodies in a short time, Wang conducted experiments day and night, and for half a month, she didn't leave the lab at all. Whenever she could not continue, she would collapse in a chair for a few hours."I felt like I had died," Wang says, recalling the early days of the pandemic.Her painstaking efforts were not in vain. Five months after the novel coronavirus first broke out, her team announced that JS016, the neutralizing antibody against COVID-19 that they had developed, had entered human testing following approval by China's drug regulator. It was the world's first monoclonal antibody targeting COVID-19 to be administered to healthy people in clinical trials.In November, the antibody was granted emergency use authorization in 15 countries, including the United States and several European countries.It was only then that Wang was relieved of the great mental pressure she had been under. In the early days of the pandemic, the pressure had been amplified by publicly stated doubts regarding Chinese scientists. Feeling aggrieved by such views, she was determined to accelerate her research and take the lead in the global race to defeat the virus.Aside from all the hard work, Wang attributes her achievements in COVID-19 research largely to her previous experience in the field of viral infectious diseases. After obtaining her doctorate in 2012, Wang joined the Institute of Microbiology and participated in the research on Middle East respiratory syndrome, also known as MERS.Four years later, she completed the mission of isolating antibodies from the blood of patients who had recovered from the Zika virus.Over the past 10 years, she has published dozens of papers in the world's leading academic journals and translated an English-language science book. Wang's work brought her wide acclaim and a host of accolades.NPC deputy overcomes challenges to live a life dedicated to others, Fang Aiqing reports.Wang Jiapeng, 41, is an inspirational figure who keeps encouraging people to be, what he describes as, the architect of their own life.Wang knows how precarious life can be as he was severely injured in an air crash. Despite these injuries, he is a para cross-country skiing champion, founder of one of China's most well-known schools with an International Baccalaureate Diploma Program curriculum and a deputy to the 13th National People's Congress. This is a man who lives life true to his own word.In 1993, as a result of the crash, he was paralyzed from the waist down and he had to undergo five years of rehabilitation.But Wang never ceased exploring the possibilities of his body, despite the pain he had to endure.The winter of 1998-99 saw the 17-year-old regain something that he thought he had lost forever-the exhilaration of skiing on a snow-covered slope, about two kilometers long with a drop of hundreds of meters.Wang had to use an adapted sit-ski, sitting on a chair attached to a mono-ski and using outriggers for stability. Skiing this way means that the body's center of gravity is much lower than regular skiing, and the speed can exceed that achieved by able-bodied Alpine skiers.Veteran DJ recalls his experience of playing music at the 2022 Winter Games, Chen Nan reports.When Su Yiming, 17, won a silver medal for snowboard slopestyle on Feb 7, during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, with his stellar performance of a triple cork 1800, he soared into the sky over the Genting Snow Park in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, to the hearty Chinese song Flying Higher.When well-known athlete Gu Ailing was enjoying jiucai hezi (pan-fried dumplings stuffed with chives) while she waited for her score in the women's freeski slopestyle qualifying round at the same venue on Feb 14, she was shown on camera as the Chinese song Your Smile Is So Beautiful played in the background.The man who played the songs is Li Honglei, one of the 30 DJs working at the Winter Games. Li was in charge of music for two courses-halfpipe and slopestyle-held at the venue."It's not like being a DJ to make people dance. It's totally different from playing music in a nightclub. It's more like you're there to create a vibe, an atmosphere and a musical experience for the athletes and everybody else, both for the spectators at the events and those watching on TV at home," Li says.A week before the 2022 Winter Games, Li, who lives and works in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, arrived in Beijing to prepare. He got up at 6 am and worked at the venue till midnight.During the Games, he played up to 5,000 songs, which were selected from more than 16,000 songs in different languages.Sometimes that meant choosing songs to ramp up or relax the competitive tension or to cheer up athletes who failed, or to build up an atmosphere when some important moments were about to take place, such as the award ceremonies and the appearance of the mascot Bing Dwen Dwen."The right music was as important as the Games. The second the music was heard, the atmosphere was bursting with energy to the songs," says the 38-year-old DJ.Like thousands of people working behind the scenes at the Games, DJs did jobs that are often invisible yet important. Li says he felt happy about sharing great moments in sports with people by contributing with music.The State Council has released a plan for the development of the country's elderly care services during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25), in its latest step to implement a national strategy to address the aging population.The plan specifies major goals and tasks, including expanding the supply of elderly care services, improving health support for the elderly, and advancing the innovative and integrated development of service models.It lists nine major indicators, such as the number of care beds and the ratio of nursing care beds in care institutions, to mobilize society as a whole to actively respond to its aging population.Detailed tasks include strengthening the safety net for elderly services, expanding inclusive services coverage, developing the "silver economy", and safeguarding the legitimate interests of the aging population.China will step up institutional innovation, and boost policy support and financial input to enable the elderly to share in China's developmental achievements, according to the plan.According to the latest census data, Chinese people aged 60 or above accounted for 18.7 percent of the country's total population in 2020, 5.44 percentage points higher than in 2010.With a solid material foundation, sufficient human resources and a long-standing culture of filial piety, China is confident in its ability to solve its aging population issue.It also underlines the development of the silver economy, which, according to a government official, requires the country to provide "equal, attainable services and products for seniors with particular difficulties".The country should give full play to both state and social capital in expanding the domestic market, and create systematic, integrated policies to ensure the sound and sustainable development of the silver economy, according to the plan.China will also establish about 10 industrial parks dedicated to the silver economy and build a string of cities into models in this regard, and facilities to be used for elderly care will be prioritized in the construction layout.At least 55 percent of the funds raised by the country's welfare lottery will be used to support elderly care services from this year, and elderly care institutions are encouraged to explore further approaches to financing, according to the plan. For many swimmers the activity can bring cooling relief in the warmest months. For another breed, cool or cold water is not so much a relief as a challenge.Xing Yuesheng jumps into the ice-cold waters of South Moat, breaking the calm of Longtan Lake Park in the Xicheng district of Beijing. It is Feb 13, and the swimming fanatic is holding the flag of the 24th Beijing Winter Olympics, intent on making a splash as he expresses his joy that the Games are unfolding successfully.The first time Xing made a mark on river ice was in Yuyuantan Park in the Haidian district of the capital in January 2009. He was inspired by a classmate who had occasionally gone winter swimming on a whim, and the pair started to take a cold indoor bath every morning. They continue to do so and reckon that in all those years they have never suffered a cold.Behind China's millions of cancer patients are an army of devoted family members taking care of them, giving comfort and dealing with high bills, while battling with their own stress, frustration and frequent self-blame.Liu Xingyi, 29, whose mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2014 before passing away the following year, reveals the story of her family battling cancer and what it means to have a loved one with the illness."Cancer patients and families have a burning will to share the burden and help each other, and just talking with friends who undergo a similar experience makes them feel supported and understood," says the woman from Jiangsu province.Within half a year after surgery and chemotherapy at a local hospital, her mother's cancer returned.They went to Shanghai, a city with more medical resources. Top medical institutions are highly clustered in Beijing, Shanghai and several major cities, but this means that these hospitals are overcrowded and quality medical care is difficult to access. Doctors, patients and accompanying family members are all under stress.When Liu asked, in a WeChat group of cancer-hit families, whether there was a way she could get an earlier registration number, a woman two years older than her offered to transfer one she wouldn't have to use.The woman invited Liu to dinner at her home, a small, shabby apartment in an old building near the hospital, rented by the day, specially for patients and families coming from other parts of the country like them. The woman was from Central China's Henan province, unmarried, and her advanced ovarian cancer had gone into relapse.Liu donated some money, but before long, heard about her death via a post on WeChat.Today many young patients, and family members of cancer patients, are sharing their experiences or seeking support and comfort online.WoshiCathy has posted three of her journals on Q&A and knowledge sharing website Zhihu about the time she accompanied her father, who was battling gastric cancer, and received more than 3,000 likes.Apart from care experiences, treatment details and explanations of basic medical concepts, she also shares her thoughts and changes of emotion, as well as recounting dialogues with the doctors and interactions between family members.Hundreds of people encourage her with their comments, or say they gained knowledge and strength from her words.For Liu, the trauma has remained.In those days, Liu's father continued to work as usual, earning an income, cooking for her mother and commuting between hospital and home taking care of his wife, while Liu had been looking through materials, from domestic sources and the United States National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, to various medical research papers and clinical cases.She also looked at all kinds of anecdotal and "secret" folk remedies, hoping there was one that was credible and effective. In despair, the doctoral candidate, majoring in mechanical engineering, even resorted to fortunetelling and Taoist rites.To make full use of the limited briefing time at the hospital in Shanghai, she presented graphs and line charts of data she summarized to show the cancer development and introduced her mother's medical history in a simple and clear way."You're so considerate, but it's too late," doctors said.Over the years, Liu has felt guilty that what she did could not benefit her mother nor lessen her pain. She remembers the time when the cancer returned, Liu tried hard to find proof that the cancer antigen indicator CA125 going high again was just an accident, before her mother bluntly pointed out she was just not strong enough to face the reality.Sometimes, she wondered whether it was her resistance that delayed the treatment, thinking it must be hard for her father to bear the loneliness since her mother passed away.WoshiCathy also noted that she was not even 25 years old when her father was confirmed to have cancer, too young to have adequate savings, and she dreaded the day she had to say, "sorry dad, I cannot afford the medicine".It's common that patients don't trust doctors, and the doctors are not satisfied with the patients, considering the high expectations and expenses patients bear and the heavy workload of the doctors, Liu says.As the family member of a cancer patient, Liu is aware that doctors and medical science are not omnipotent, but she expects the doctors to generally follow the guidelines and be able to acknowledge their own limitations and ask for help.According to the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer, China's 4.57 million new cancer cases in 2020 account for around 24 percent of the global total, corresponding with its population proportion. However, among the 9.96 million cancer deaths worldwide that year, the country had 3 million.Wang Xing, a Shanghai-based thoracic surgeon who has recently published Bingren Jiashu, Qing Laiyixia (Excuse Me, the Doctor Would Like a Word), says that Chinese doctors are trustworthy and very good at doing surgery because there are a large number of cases upon which to operate.He has been attending and speaking at the World Conference on Lung Cancer annually from 2015 to 2019, saying that he observes that around one-third of presentations shared during the event come from China.However, creating an early screening mechanism and encouraging new drug research and development are key to improving recovery rates that are currently relatively lower than that of developed countries, Wang says.Technology enables a futuristic interpretation of traditional Chinese elements, such as the solar terms, to kick off showpiece event, Xu Haoyu reports.The opening ceremony of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics was widely praised for its creativity and innovation. Through teamwork, guided by famed filmmaker Zhang Yimou, many directors and choreographers created the show together.Tao Wenting, a lecturer from the College of Military Culture at the PLA National Defense University, was a member of the creative team that directed the first several sections of the ceremony.The ceremony was held on the day of li chun, the beginning of spring, the first of 24 Chinese solar terms. And the namesake opening show presented the charm of the season with 10-meter tall luminous poles simulating green grass and white dandelions.Tao claimed that in order to present this show perfectly, in addition to the precise selection of materials, supported by projection onto the floor of the stadium, the biggest difficulty was actually the simulation of the two plants.A team from Beijing Institute of Technology offered a helping hand, creating a detailed manual with markings on the longitude and latitude, and from various angles, to make rehearsals more efficient and the overall visual effect more vivid.A total of 393 students were selected from two martial arts schools in Laizhou and Yuncheng, Shandong province. They trained for about four months to practice holding and waving the poles in the right place, at the right time and at the right angle.Tao also directed the raising of the national flag, which involved 176 people, including representatives of China's 56 ethnic groups, people from different industries in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region-from an astronaut to a deliveryman-model workers and outstanding members of the Communist Party of China.As a military officer herself, Tao says she felt deeply moved."They are all the backbone of the country and they make something great from ordinary life. I think their feelings for the flag are deep and heartfelt, and they can express their love for the nation on behalf of the people," says Tao.Modern artistic installation techniques and technology were also highlighted at the ceremony.At one point, a cube of "water "appeared on the stage thanks to augmented reality and the application of an artificial intelligence image processing algorithm.Fitness activity is gaining new acceptance and adherents, He Qi reports in Shanghai.Song Yanyi, a 26-year-old white-collar worker in Shanghai, had her first interaction with pole-dancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Staying at home every day after the outbreak allowed Song to reexamine the importance of physical health for the first time.Song, who doesn't like sports at all, wanted to find a gym near her home, and the closest one was a pole-dancing studio.For the trial class, she was able to complete a set of movements quickly after her trainer showed them to her, which gave Song a sense of accomplishment and encouraged her to continue unlocking new movements.She soon started taking classes regularly and now takes six classes a week, spending about 10,000 yuan ($1,572) a year on pole-dancing.After practicing it for some time, Song found out the intensity of exercises. Beginners who don't exert power can easily get injured, and her body has been bruised. But she doesn't see these as difficulties."All hobbies have a threshold and need a long time to practice. Exercise brings high level of satisfaction, and I enjoy it very much," Song says.It was an ordinary afternoon in 2011, and 9-year-old Zhou Xi was on her way home, together with her father, still thinking about the exam that she had in school. Suddenly she felt a bang on the head and fell unconscious.As she woke up she was lying in bed at home. Her father says that she suffered convulsions, with saliva coming out of her mouth. Zhou was rushed to hospital and was diagnosed with epilepsy.Names matterFor 10 years, Zhou has been struggling with the disorder. Her family took her to a top hospital in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi province where they live.Her father stood in the queue for the entire bitterly cold night to get a chance of seeing the doctor. She got a prescription and took the medicine regularly, and is now spending her first year in a local university, with the condition under control.The disorder is frequently called yang dian feng by the public, literally meaning "as crazy as a goat". According to Chen Kui, a neurologist at Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, the exact history of that name is no longer traceable."In some places, it was even called 'pig craziness'," Chen says. "The comparison with farm animals is so bad that it made patients feel they were treated like animals."Whenever hearing anyone utter that word, she was reduced to tears; she did not tell her classmates that she had the disorder, and when someone asked her about the medicine she took, she said it was vitamins."Now I am OK with it, but you can imagine how hard it is for a child to accept that", Zhou says,"And we must allow grown-up patients to feel bad, too."A vicious circleAn An experienced an epileptic fit in 2019 when she was on an internship. Things were better for her because her classmates had more medical knowledge, but still she would tremble at the word yang dian feng.Xiao Bai, another 19-year-old patient who first suffered from the disorder in primary school, is much more determined. "I bet I would kick anyone who mentions the word to me."On a popular job show Attractive Offer in November 2021, a 50-year-old epilepsy patient, who had lived with the disorder for 29 years, asked the doctors in the program to launch a call to the public to not use the insulting names any more. Tao Yong, a senior ophthalmologist at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, who was on the program, launched a campaign on his micro blog, which has 1.97 million followers."Some disorders are difficult to cure, and more difficult to heal spiritually," he says."Those suffering from epilepsy are often ashamed when they have an attack in public. The stigma in society is such that patients are not fully healed even after being cured of the disorder."Chen also says the insulting names might hinder the patient from seeking medical help."Epilepsy involves damage to the brain's neural cells and is curable if the patient takes the proper prescription," he says."But with the insulting names, some might avoid seeing the doctor to avoid their condition being known by others.Accuracy countsTao says epilepsy is only one disorder that carries an insulting name.Being forgetful in old age is often associated with Alzheimer's disease, according to the medical list published by the then Ministry of Health in 1995.However, in many cases it is called senile dementia, which is often associated with "foolishness" or "stupidity" in common parlance conversation.In 2012, China Central Television launched a survey about selecting a word to replace senile dementia that garnered 1.35 million respondents, of which 500,000 voted for the word "brain degeneration".The words did gain popularity though, and now the most commonly used name is "Alzheimer's disease".Psoriasis, an itchy rash on the skin, was once called niu pi xuan, literally meaning "ox skin plague" in Chinese.Tan Shuai, a doctor on skin diseases at Shenzhen Hospital of South Medical University, says the origin of the insulting name is untraceable, too, but no serious doctor should use the name."To use cattle in naming a syndrome implies comparing the patient with the cattle and giving up on the patient", Tan says."That should not happen today with modern medical science. We doctors hope to guide the public to learn the formal names of the diseases so as to get rid of the old, insulting ones, which in turn needs the effort of the whole of society."As well as the insulting names listed above, some conditions are often misunderstood, too.Depression, a major neural disorder affecting over 350 million people worldwide that can lead to suicide, is often distorted by some as "being just too vulnerable".Re Yizha, an actress who gained popularity in 2019, once said she had depression via her microblog account, but in the responses, there were several comments asking her why she was still alive.Furthermore, whenever anyone is found to carry HIV, often, the first response from those near them is to question their sexual relations.Tao says he has met many patients who were shy to submit their materials to him, and when he saw the materials he always found a "HIV positive" sign on it. That only prevents the patients from entering the hospital and might cause more infections.Upon learning the theme of this story, Zhou says she has some words to share with the readers."For the public, I hope people can avoid mentioning such words, because you don't know whether a patient is there beside you. For anybody suffering from such conditions, I hope they can stay strong and be optimistic about it. The day will come when all discrimination is gone."Pseudonyms were used for all patients mentioned in the story.Yang Xiaoheng contributed to this story.An ongoing exhibition on the Winter Olympics at the Shanghai Sports Museum will run until March 13.Featuring 116 exhibits, divided into three categories, the exhibition showcases the history of the Winter Games, China's participation in the Olympics and stories of winter sports related to Shanghai.The first documented attempt to create an ice rink in Shanghai was in the late 19th century. Then several Britons made the attempt but failed as the city wasn't cold enough. As a result, people turned to roller-skating. The city's first roller-skating rink was built in Hongkou district in the early 1900s.Today, Shanghai has more than a dozen indoor ice rinks, three curling tracks and over 40 indoor skiing venues.One of the featured exhibits is a single-person bobsleigh used by Shao Yijun, the first athlete from Shanghai who competed in the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Other exhibits include previous Olympic torches, medals and clothes worn by athletes of various disciplines.In the chapter dedicated to the 2022 Winter Games, visitors are given an overview of the venues across the competition zones of Beijing and Zhangjiakou in Hebei province.Yan Jiadong, chairman of Shanghai Ice and Snow Sports Association, said at the opening ceremony of the exhibition that he hopes the Winter Olympics in China will further promote the popularity of winter sports in Shanghai.Another exhibition on promotional sporting posters from the early days of the People's Republic of China opened at the Shanghai History Museum on Jan 25 and will run until Feb 25.Sixty posters created between the 1950s and '80s, including those for the first five editions of the national games and the poster celebrating "ping-pong diplomacy" between China and the United States in the 1970s, are on display.Interest in winter sports is growing with millions of residents participating last year and various venues have been busy reaping the benefits, Xing Yi reports.Shanghai rarely sees snow but the enthusiasm for "cool sports" in the city is nevertheless growing due to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing and Zhangjiakou in Hebei province, and the efforts of local authorities to promote them.In the city's Lujiazui financial area, an open-air ice rink located next to the landmark Oriental Pearl TV Tower has been welcoming hordes of visitors since 2019. The rink is the brainchild of Yang Yang, a retired speed skater who won China's first Winter Olympics gold medal in 2002."I remember when the rink first opened in 2019, people were so amazed that many would wait hours to get on the ice," says Yang."I practiced skating outdoors when I was young, so this open-air ice rink brings back many memories. The Winter Olympics will become a fond memory for this generation of Chinese, so I founded this ice rink to let more people in this city experience the charm of winter sports," she adds.Called Ice Live, the rink opened this year on Jan 18 and will be available throughout the Winter Games, which runs from Feb 4 to Feb 20.True friends always stay united in spirit, as exemplified and lauded in Chinese folk tales throughout history. Among such tales, the story of Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya is a good case in point.Despite the passage of time since it was recorded by historians, the saga of their friendship has always been regarded as a fine example for junzi, the moral exemplar in Chinese philosophy.Both Guan and Bao were politicians during the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC), under Qi Huangong, or Duke Huan of Qi, the ruler of the State of Qi, and the first of the five overlords of that era.They were born in Yingshang, in modern-day Anhui province in East China, and became acquainted with each other at an early age.Compared to Guan's family, Bao's was relatively wealthy. Nevertheless, the two became best friends, and Bao admired Guan's talent and erudition.Known for being a loyal friend, Bao could always comprehend Guan's difficulties and feelings, and never blamed him for his failures and shortcomings.Before entering politics, they were engaged in business and took part in joint ventures together. But Guan always took a greater share of the profits than he actually deserved. Bao was well aware of this but never accused him of avarice, on account of Guan's poverty.Guan was dismissed from his posts several times, but Bao believed Guan was not given enough opportunities to fully demonstrate his abilities. Guan also fled battlefields on multiple occasions, and Bao made exceptions for Guan's need to take care of his elderly mother rather than accusing him of cowardice.The two friends later entered politics as tutors to two princes of Qi. Guan was appointed tutor to Prince Jiu. Bao, meanwhile, became tutor to Jiu's brother, Prince Xiaobai.After a series of murders and coups, Prince Xiaobai became Duke Huan of Qi, the state's new ruler. Subsequently, the new ruler won the war against the State of Lu which sheltered Prince Jiu and tried to enforce his claim.Consequently, Qi pressured Lu to kill the prince and send Guan back.With Guan's repatriation, the two friends were reunited. But the new ruler, Duke Huan of Qi, still bore a grudge against Guan, since Guan had tried to assassinate him. Meanwhile, the ruler planned to elevate Bao, his tutor and guardian, to the post of chancellor.Bao, however, defended his friend's allegiance to his former master and lauded his talent, persuading the duke to exonerate Guan and elevate him to the position of chancellor instead of Bao. He also persuaded Guan to shift his loyalty to the new ruler.Duke Huan of Qi took Bao's suggestion into consideration. Years later, based on Duke Huan's governance and Guan's reforms and deft diplomacy, Qi became the most powerful state of that time.Historian Sima Qian documented in Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian) a quote of Guan regarding his lifelong friend: "My parents gave birth to me, but it is Bao who knows me best."True friendship and the mutual trust and understanding between friends, as represented in the story of Guan and Bao, have been highly regarded in China for thousands of years and continue to have practical significance in contemporary society and international relations.XinhuaWhen I was a little boy, my parents and I would sometimes visit Glasgow, which was the nearest city to my hometown. My parents would often remark how much the city had changed between each of our visits.We didn't visit Glasgow very often, maybe four or five times a year, so the "changes" they would point out, such as new buildings under construction, were actually not that remarkable as they were just part and parcel of the city's regular development: particularly in the 1970s and early 1980s, when Glasgow was undergoing the most rapid phase of its postwar redevelopment.This was a time when a great deal of the substandard housing in the city was being demolished, a new road network was being built in the city and Glasgow's antiquated subway system from the late 19th century was being modernized.Actually, a lot of the "changes "that my parents noticed were based on them comparing the city with the area in which they lived in the 1950s and 1960s.So, when we notice "change", it's actually a relative concept.Living in Beijing, the pace of change is not one that is measured in years or decades, it can often be measured in months.A recent example of this change, and yet another measure which has been taken in recent years to make Beijing a better city to live in, has been the introduction of "greenways "throughout many parts of the city.These "greenways" are like green arteries running through the city, allowing residents to get more exercise to benefit their own health and also provide an opportunity for them to pursue a more carbon-free lifestyle. In addition, these "greenways" also live up to their name by greening more of the city with much-needed trees and vegetation.The most outstanding example is the "Beijing Greenway", a large part of which runs adjacent to the ancient city moat nearby the Second Ring Road. This wonderful "narrow park "not only offers ample opportunities for walking and cycling, but is also dotted with numerous areas for seating and exercise.It gives a whole new perspective on the city, and allows its residents to shed the feeling of constantly being in an urban space dominated by large buildings and automobiles.The "Beijing Greenway" has been hailed as "a model that should be considered in car-centric cities, to embrace a more people and environmentally friendly way forward for city planning" by the Australia-based Town Planning Group, which said it is "one of the exciting projects from a people perspective, in an increasingly car-dominated city".As I said, change is something that happens quite rapidly in Beijing, so it was only within the space of a couple of months that I noticed such a change with the appearance of another "green artery", the "Chaoyang Greenway". So far, it covers a distance of around 10 kilometers in Beijing's Chaoyang district from Lishuiqiao in the north, to Wanghe Park at its southern end. This combined walking and cycling path is a new and welcome addition and provides yet another "green artery" to help Beijing become a greener and better place to live in.Contact the writer at ian@chinadaily.com.cnBEIJING－Hundreds of thousands of adolescents in China have benefited from a mental health service project co-initiated by the United Nations Children's Fund and the National Health Commission of China.The five-year "Adolescent Health and Development Project" has been carried out since 2016 in 14 districts and counties of 11 provincial regions in China, such as Beijing, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu and Chongqing.The project focuses on preventive intervention to build awareness, knowledge and skills among adolescents for better mental health and to provide information on how they can access mental health services, which are expected to reach over half a million adolescents from more than 430 schools around China.Under this project, a service package has been delivered to trained counselors and teachers, to better guide them on how to tackle adolescent mental health issues.More than 13 percent of adolescents aged 10 to 19 around the world are afflicted with a mental disorder as defined by the World Health Organization, according to "The State of the World's Children 2021"released by UNICEF.Compared to adults, adolescents tend not to seek help for mental health problems due to fears about confidentiality and public stigma, as well as a lack of relevant knowledge about mental health services, according to UNICEF."Mental health issues not only refer to severe diseases like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but can also be embodied by the common problems in daily life, which must be taken seriously," says Zheng Yi, a chief physician with the Beijing Anding Hospital of Capital Medical University.The service package involves positive psychology in devising multiple measures, including group sessions, mindfulness-based stress reduction and attention exercises, screening and referral for mental health disorders in health facilities, as well as social media and hotline communication.Adolescent "health camp" activities, meant for emotion management, stress relief and anxiety elimination, have been held during public holidays and weekends in pilot schools, and have been attended by more than 1,000 adolescents.The five-year project is just the first step to address people's awareness and reduce related social stigma, according to Cynthia McCaffrey, UNICEF representative to China."Stigma is preventing children and young people from seeking treatment and limiting their opportunities to grow, learn and thrive," she says. "Parents, other caregivers, teachers and public figures need to create an environment where young people feel that it's safe to talk about their mental health."The incidence rate of self-harm and severe injury has witnessed a marked drop, says Mo Min, a doctor with Maternal and Child Care Service Center in Beibei district, one of the pilot districts in Southwest China's Chongqing."I have acquired the techniques of how to deal with adolescent mental health issues via the project. Also, we realized that we should not only attend to sexual and reproductive health but also take initiatives to offer help to adolescents in school," Mo notes."We absorbed the advanced experience of the project into our own service model. As well as the current two pilots in this project, we will spread the service model to more counties and districts," says Zhang Haiyan, an associate chief physician from the Maternal and Child Care Service Center in Chongqing."We have delivered more than 100 lectures across the city and carried out more than 200 mobile clinic services in schools," says Zhang. "In the future, we will develop a more suitable service model for key groups, such as 'left-behind' children whose parents work in big cities."XinhuaCaricature artist Zhai Jin is finding innovative ways to fully embrace life and fuel his creativity, Cheng Yuezhu reports.From the age of 18 to 32, caricaturist Zhai Jin hardly left his own home in Anhui province. He was diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as the brittle bone disease, an illness that made him prone to fractures.Even though he has loving family members, for a long time he felt that he was trapped in a small space, with little knowledge of, and limited access to, society, and he longed to see the outside world.In 2016, he left for Beijing to attend a training program named "independent living" hosted by the China-Dolls Center for Rare Disorders."One day, I went outside and had a late-night meal with my friends at 3 o'clock in the morning. On my way home, I was the only person on that road, apart, perhaps, from a few drunken men. At that moment, I suddenly felt that the road belonged only to me," Zhai told the third UK-China Disability Arts Forum on Dec 3."This feeling seems very simple. Maybe a lot of people feel it occasionally and naturally when they grow up. But it was a whole new experience for me. I felt that I had acquired something for the first time, simply by journeying alone on the road."It was also in Beijing when he was introduced to symbiotic dance-the principle of which is that everyone, disabled or not, can enjoy dancing-and contact improvisation, a dance form that encourages physical contact with others."Once, a dance session that incorporated contact improvisation truly changed me. That day, I descended from my wheelchair to the floor, and a 70-kilogram man rolled over me," Zhai says."I don't know why, but I suddenly felt that I was a useful person, that my body was useful, too. It could support a strong man, even two people. I felt a sense of confidence from the bottom of my heart."Wheelchair basketball player inspires but more commercial help needed, Zhang Zhouxiang reports.The basketball flew through the air. Dai Jiameng moved her wheelchair with an athletic dexterity before controlling the ball with her right hand and maneuvering by just using her left hand.She got the ball, made a 60-degree arc turn, dodging those trying to mark her, and seemed to coax the ball into the basket. Net! But no time to waste soaking up the congratulations of her teammates; she turned back and took up her "combat "position.Dai, 26, has been playing basketball for 12 years.At the age of 4, an accident resulted in Dai losing her left leg. As a child, Dai's favorite activity was watching the NBA on TV together with her father. Her favorite star was Dwyane Wade.She followed Wade's career closely, including his "wheelchair" game in Guangzhou city, Guangdong province, in 2007, when he was injured.It was then that Dai got to know that people with impairments could also play basketball, which prompted her to watch the 2008 Paralympics in Beijing.Yet it was not until 2009 that she realized she could become one of those in the playground. Having got help from the local federation for the physically challenged to make a new artificial limb, she and her father went to collect it.A staff member noticed that she was in good shape and asked her: "We are recruiting wheelchair basketball players. Are you interested in joining us?""I was very happy to hear that question," Dai says in retrospect. "I asked myself: Why hadn't I come earlier?"Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council, an agency established by the Malaysian government to develop and promote the healthcare travel industry, renewed a cooperation agreement with Taiorient International, a medical service provider based in Xiamen, Southeast China's Fujian province, on Wednesday.The company is committed to offering medical consultation services to pregnant women as well as infertile couples from countries such as the United States, Thailand and Russian. It has also set up branches in Beijing, Shanghai, and other 40 major cities across China. It has been a strategic partner of MHTC for the past three years.Mohd Daud Mohd Arif, CEO of MHTC, said that the council aims to develop Malaysia into a popular medical tourism destination in the next five years by improving its healthcare service quality. He hoped that its strategic partnership with Taiorient International could help further develop the cooperation on medical tourism between China and Malaysia.Producers of the upcoming documentary Once Upon a Life -- a tear-jerker that follows two cancer patients on their final days -- announced they would donate all profit earned from the movie's advanced screening to China Charities Aid Foundation For Children.The movie, which will be released across domestic theaters on March 4, is a follow-up of the highly applauded TV documentary with the same title. The first season was broadcast in 2016 and second season in 2019. There was also a 40-minute short film screened in 2020.Continuing the franchise, the 92-minute film turns its lens on people fighting severe illnesses and their final moments. Two patients were featured: a 35-year-old mother who died of liver cancer in 2018, and a 14-year-old girl who passed away from bone cancer on the same year.Tao Tao, one of the four directors, said they chose the two patients and their families because they showed courage to face the trauma and suffering brought on by the diseases."What we want to tell the most to the audience is that people could also obtain a lot of love and re-examine their relationship with their family members while they are in the face of death. It will give them the strength to live more optimistically," added Tao.After the advanced screening concluded in a downtown cinema in Beijing on March 4, its producers formalized with the China Charities Aid Foundation For Children their commitment to donate gross profit from the box office (after deducting the budget and other fees such as marketing cost) to the foundation. The money will go to support charity films for teenagers and children.Neighborhood revitalization project brings generations together in creative ways that celebrate a real feeling of belonging, Cheng Yuezhu reports.The oasis in central Beijing's Dongcheng district provides shelter from the hustle and bustle of the capital. Its name offers no clue to its traditional appeal but 27 Yard is actually a Beijing-style courtyard, with gray tile roofs, crimson doors, a tree that has witnessed passing generations taking shade, and cats lying lazily nearby soaking up what sunlight there is.The courtyard has a vibrancy, a pulse of its own, with a variety of events taking place on a daily basis in its 10 main spaces that host a shop, a gallery, a reading area and a multimedia hall.Since 2016, it has been offering refreshing experiences to both nearby residents and visitors attracted by its reputation, from hobby groups and workshops to exhibitions and performances.However, when Niu Ruixue, founder of 27 Yard, also known as the Chaoyangmen Cultural Center, first visited the courtyard in 2016, it was down at heel, with dusty, undecorated rooms and shabby facilities.A comprehensive online platform to provide people with disabilities with updated news and social services was launched on Friday, International Day of Persons with Disabilities that falls on Dec 3 every year.The Love Sunshine China Disabled Person's Comprehensive Service Cloud Platform -- initiated by Beijing-based Huaxia Publishing House and the China Commission of Promotion of Publicity for the Undertakings of Chinese Disabled Persons -- aims to integrate physically and mentally impaired people into society to share the progress of material and spiritual civilization, according to Pan Ping, head of the publishing house.Focused on the practical needs of people with disabilities and their families, the platform aggregated recent news and policies regarding education resources, information on job opportunities, prevention and rehabilitation, assistance as well as legal services.The platform will provide vocational trainings on fields like e-commerce, livestream broadcast, nail beauty, tea art and coffee making, and launch career skills competitions in 2022.The website of the platform: https://cdpservice.com.Removing barriers and improving the environment brings people closer to each other and nature, Fang Aiqing reports.A good structure is one that people think is both convenient and considerate for users, architect Xue Feng says.As chief architect of Beijing-based China Construction Engineering Design and Research Institute Corp, Xue has been exploring construction and renovation of barrier-free facilities for the past eight years.One of their recent works is part of a micro-space regeneration project launched by the Beijing city government involving eight old neighborhoods. The project was completed earlier this year.Key focuses of this project include making better use of small patches of deserted land in the city and improving the quality of public spaces.The Min'an community in Dongcheng district, constructed in 2003, is located at the northeastern corner of the Second Ring Road, not far from Dongzhimen subway station.Its southern area has a U-shaped building with more than 700 households, enclosing a broad open space that, due to a tall building on its southern elevation, gets little direct sunlight.Elderly people make up around 40 percent of the residents. In the past, the undeveloped land made it difficult for them to kill time within their own community.To go to her old school in the city, 11-year-old Katlego Tshuma used to wake up at 4 am on every school day to get prepared for a school bus that would take her to the school about 8 kilometers away from her home.Tshuma lives in Mogoditshane, a small town located on the outskirts of Botswana's capital Gaborone. "It picked me up at 5 am because of the traffic congestion," she said.But her old routine to wake up so early in the morning came to an end after she was transferred to the China-aided Mmopane Primary School in Mmopane village, which was inaugurated in January this year. Because the traffic to the new school is light during the morning, she never has to wake up so early again."Ever since I transferred to this school, I wake up at 5 am," she enthused.What compels many children to wake up very early to travel to school is a lack of education facilities in some areas in Botswana, according to the Headmistress of Mmopane Primary School, Gagoitsiwe Marata."The construction and opening of the China-aided school in Mmopane have been a welcome development," said Marata.Mmopane Primary School is one of the three primary schools China has aided in Botswana over the years, with the other two being Kubung Primary School and Serowe Primary School.In the three China-aided schools functioning in the country, computer labs, science labs, disability-friendly facilities such as toilets, sick bays, libraries, dining halls, as well as football, basketball, and netball fields are common."These primary schools have everything you can think of that can benefit a child. Honestly, children are treated better than those in junior and senior schools," said Esther Maokisa, Headmistress of Kubung Primary School.She said that the constant support in the form of regular school maintenance they have received from the Chinese Embassy to date has helped the school to excel in academic and cocurricular activities.Overall, Kubung Primary is among the most excelling schools in the country since 2012. In 2018 for example, the school scored 97.3 percent in the national Primary School Leaving Examination. It also scored 75 percent and 83.3 percent in 2019 and 2020, respectively.Keloreng Makata, a senior teacher at Kubung Primary, said many parents want their children enrolled in the school."We represented the northwest region in the national competition because of what the Chinese government had done. Our school has been producing competent students who have continued to do well in higher schools," Makata and Maokisa told Xinhua.The three elementary schools aided by China have effectively improved educational conditions for children and strongly supported the development of Botswana's basic education, said Chinese Ambassador to Botswana, Wang Xuefeng.On Oct 15, 2019, the groundbreaking ceremony for Kazungula Primary School was held in northern Botswana's Kasane town. It is the fourth primary school project aided by the Chinese government. The primary school is expected to host 560 students. Upon completion, it is expected to improve local education.At around 7 pm, You Zuming, 73, leaves home with a table tennis bat in hand. He is going to play table tennis with neighbors in the smart gym located in the community where he lives.You, who lives in Guiyang city, capital of Southwest China's Guizhou province, is an out-and-out sports fan and enjoyed competing regularly in his youth. But as he aged, he gradually changed his exercise routine and became fond of playing table tennis."I take part in this exercise almost every day," he says.Equipped with various exercise machines, the gym is the first one to provide a 24-hour service in Guizhou. It opened on July 10 last year.According to gym manager Chen Lei, it provides most of the equipment to the community residents free of charge, except for running and spinning machines, and has also hired several professional instructors to offer fitness courses, such as yoga and aerobics, to community residents at a lower price than commercial gyms.Chen says the annual card for this gym costs only 240 yuan ($37.68) while the seasonal card costs 68 yuan. What's more, residents can also choose an annual family card for 480 yuan, which allows three family members to share it simultaneously.Wei Rong, who works at a bank, signed up for a seasonal card about two months ago and is planning to sign up for another annual one later. "I come here five times a week and exercise for about one hour each time. I usually run and spin," she says.At the start, Wei used to have sore muscles after exercising, but now she feels much better."After workouts, citizens can access their physical tests and exercise data by scanning the QR code with their mobile phones, based on which they can make a more scientific exercise plan," Chen says.Data released by the General Administration of Sport of China shows that nearly 60 percent of people who take part in sports choose to exercise within one kilometer of their home.In Chen's view, smart gyms meet the needs of those users. "About 500 residents in the community have signed up for memberships at our gym, most of which are annual cards, and about 50 of them come to exercise every day," he adds.Smart gyms have popped up in other cities in China for several years, such as Beijing, and Chongqing in Southwest China. Earlier this year, at least two other intelligent fitness venues were newly opened to the public in Guiyang, thus making it more convenient for residents living there to exercise.In China, with the continuous improvement of living standards, physical exercise now plays a much more important role in people's daily lives.According to You and others, smart gyms not only provide them with sports venues, but also enrich their lives. "Doing exercise every day keeps me in good health, ensures that I can enjoy my life better and enhances my happiness," You says, smiling.From robots to aircraft, a new generation is providing thrust for innovation, Wang Qian reports.While most people were stuck at home last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, feeling isolated and maybe even caged in, some young people were thinking outside the box and reached for the sky as they created an impressive array of work, from robots to rockets.It's difficult to predict what will be the next big thing to materialize from this tech-savvy generation. On videosharing and livestreaming platform Bilibili, it seems that anything is possible. No dream, it seemed, was beyond imagination. At first, they did not know each other but were united by a spirit of creativity.When Bilibili uploader Lin Xiao, nicknamed Lingshiqi online, had too many bags to carry, instead of asking someone for help, the then 18-year-old spent 200 days addressing the problem. The devil was in the detail you could say. He built a robot, which can follow him wherever he goes, and upon which he can ride. The robot's name? Devil!Tech influencer Peng Zhihui, whose online handle is Zhihuijun, is already a household name. A 16-minute video clip features the 28-year-old Huawei engineer designing and creating a robotic arm, named Dummy. Powered by Huawei's 5G technology, it can be remotely controlled to do the most precise activity. To prove it, Dummy can even stitch grape skins together.New method by farmers is helping harvest a tourism wave in South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, Yang Feiyue reports.The fall harvest is always a picturesque time in the Sanjiang Dong autonomous county.Farmers are busy harvesting the rice paddies amid the golden farmland and fishing the ponds in October, and the air was filled with joy and optimism for a big harvest in the county, in South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.Wei Fahong seems content with the harvest from his family's farmland of 3 mu (0.2 hectares) in Linlue village of Sanjiang.He reaped more than 1,500 kilograms of rice, which will bring his family an income of more than 10,000 yuan ($1,566).Amid the high wheat straw in the pond, fish were fattened perfectly for the dining table.Some farmers already celebrated harvest ahead of time with fresh roast fish."It's harvest season, and having fish is an auspicious practice that expresses our wish for a surplus harvest," says Shi Shilian, a villager from Sanjiang.Traditional Chinese medicine theories emphasize the importance of prevention over cure, thus, finding remedies to strengthen the body during winter has proved an effective method for urban dwellers to keep themselves safe from the season's illnesses, especially taking into consideration their busy city lives.Gaofang, a condensed semisolid paste, includes a dozen different herbal medicines and specialist ingredients. In addition, foods such as lotus seeds, dates and crystal sugar are added to improve the taste. Some varieties are available ready-made while other variations can be made directly by pharmacists according to a TCM prescription.Originating in the Han (206 BC-AD 220) and Tang (618-907) dynasties, the TCM tonics and remedies, particularly useful among those with weak immune systems and chronic diseases, have been hailed as an important part of Chinese medical theory and mechanism, with the core principle being a "unity of man and nature, and curing through differentiation and a combination of nutrition and recuperation to gain better health", according to a brochure introducing gaofang at Fang Hui Chun Tang TCM clinic in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province."Many people think gaofang can only be taken in winter. In fact, as long as a doctor deems it necessary and writes prescriptions in line with the patient's own physical and health condition, it is a therapy that has proved effective and helpful throughout all the seasons," Yu Botang, an intangible cultural heritage inheritor and TCM practitioner at the clinic, says.Located in Hefang Street, a historical scenic area in Hangzhou, the clinic is one of China's oldest medicine shops dating back to 1649, preserving the long-lasting tradition of making gaofang by hand.According to Yu, who's in his 60s, the gaofang is usually prepared over a variety of steps, including prescription writing, preparing and soaking the ingredients, brewing, settling and condensing and then the final packaging.Ancient fur-covered footwear enjoys a revival in Xinjiang as nation's interest in snow sports ramps up, Xing Wen and Mao Weihua report in Urumqi.Today's skiers and snowboarders are used to relying on ski lifts at resorts to take them to the top of a mountain before experiencing the addictive thrill of swooshing down the powdery slopes.However, in some snow-covered villages in Altay prefecture of Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, it is common in winter to see local herdsmen, with planks attached to their feet, climbing the snowy inclines without any other form of assistance. And they do so in a relatively nimble way.The pair of planks are wrapped with horsehide, which serves a double purpose. Remarkably, the horsehide not only provides friction to prevent skiers from slipping during their ascent, but also helps them slide more smoothly in the opposite direction.According to rock carvings uncovered in the area by archaeologists, such skis have served as a means of transportation for the snowfield inhabitants of Altay for around 12,000 years, especially those who had to trek a long way in the snow to herd animals or hunt.In recent decades, the fur skis gradually lost their popularity as paved roads began linking houses to the outside world. Consequently, craftsmen who made the fur skis had little chance to display their skills.Now, however, in response to the nation's goal of kindling grassroots enthusiasm for winter sports, Altay plans to protect and promote its skiing culture and better pass down its skiing tradition to future generations.The prefecture is working to promote itself as the place where skiing might have originated, and it hopes to develop the area as a popular destination for skiers and snowboarders. As a result, the ancient fur skis and the craft of making them have found a new lease of life in modern times.Silambek Sakish, 67, a herdsman in the village of Lasti in Altay, began learning the craft from his father at the age of 15."When I was young, most people in my village would wear the fur skis to go out in search of firewood or to graze their animals. Being one of the few families in the village who knew how to make the special footwear, we could make money from selling the fur skis every snow season," he recalls.The skis sold well in winter, but to prepare for the surge in sales, the family usually began production during summer, drying pine wood in the sun and purchasing horsehides from slaughterhouses.Sakish will first cut the high-quality pine into a plank before heating it to the point where it becomes pliable enough to bend the front end upward. Wrapping the plank with horsehide is the last step."I would wear the newly made fur skis to test them by sliding on the snow to see if they were durable and practical," he says.Reality show's latest installment sheds light on the trials and tribulations of medical students transitioning from classroom to clinic, Wang Kaihao reports.As medical students, they may have the envied privilege of remaining in their ivory tower longer than other majors. Nevertheless, sooner or later, they still have to face pressure of looking for a job amid intense competition.The third season of The Exciting Offer, a reality show on streaming platform Tencent, was released on Nov 9 to follow the stories of these future doctors.In the show, eight medical students from around the country become interns at the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, in Hangzhou.They are tutored by the respective doctors from the departments of cardiology, neurosurgery, and hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery in checking sickbeds, writing medical reports and finishing other daily tasks. They also take part in simulated diagnoses of patients and provide medical suggestions.By the end of the season, the most outstanding student will be offered an interview by the hospital director.Whether they are PhD candidates who have already been job-hunting or first-year graduate students who are still dreaming of future possibilities, their clinical inexperience is captured by the cameras.Savannah College of Art and Design, a private nonprofit university founded in 1978, is cultivating talented students for professional careers in multiple growing industries.

Just over a week ago, he could hardly shake hands with anyone without wincing in pain.Jackson says he had undergone conventional medical treatment on his wrists, but to no avail.Then he heard about the Zimbabwe-China Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Center at the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, where treatments included the use of acupuncture. He decided to give it a try.The treatment has been effective for Jackson, who is one of the thousands of Zimbabweans who have turned to the traditional Chinese medicine center to have their ailments treated.The center was designated by the Ministry of Health and Child Care in January 2020, following the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Zimbabwean and Chinese governments on cooperation in the field of TCM and acupuncture.The facility, which will also house the country's largest TCM training school and research center, started taking patients in November 2020.By April, it had treated more than 150 people suffering from various ailments such as hypertension, lumbar pain, diabetes, hernia and other health problems.The center's executive director, Sun Shuang, says that 48 percent of the patients were now locals, compared to when the center opened and it was mostly Chinese nationals who sought treatment there."We accept patients with emergency and urgent problems when there's no other option for them. We don't do advertisements. We have lots of patients only because of the good results we've had with others," she says.The doctor says the center was training more local doctors in traditional medicine, hoping that, with time, similar facilities will be opened throughout the country.Karen Gurure, a China-trained Zimbabwean medical doctor who is interning at the clinic, says the major advantage of TCM is that it has fewer side effects.Gurure, who had studied at China's Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, says more benefits can be derived from adopting TCM, which uses imbalances in complex patterns within the body to determine a diagnosis while Western medicine tends to focus on diagnosing and treating illnesses based on a patient's symptoms."In the case of back pain, conventional medicine will treat just the back pain, while TCM looks to treat the whole body," she says.Gurure says China offered valuable lessons to Zimbabwe in terms of modernizing and codifying traditional medicine. Zimbabwe has a long history of using traditional herbal remedies, which are still the most affordable and easily accessible source of treatment for many people.Beijing's culinary scene took on a global flair during the Mid-Autumn Festival with the launch of the 6th Belt and Road International Food Fest at Langyuan Station.

Baduanjin — which translates as 'eight pieces of brocade — is a form of qigong, a set of traditional Chinese fitness exercises combining physical movement, with breathing and meditation."I knew nothing about baduanjin until I saw videos of people practicing on social media platforms. The movements are very slow, like tai chi, so I naturally associated it with the kind of exercise favored by the elderly," says Huang, who is from Hubei province.Nevertheless, she decided to give baduanjin a try because she has issues with her cervical vertebrae, spleen and stomach."I read reviews, saying that it can be helpful to these kinds of problems," she says.The practice doesn't require much space or time. Baduanjin uses breathing and concentration techniques to improve body and mind, through eight, well-designed sequences. Huang usually practices about half an hour after breakfast. She enjoys the exercise, which stretches and relaxes her whole body."I feel my body slowing down, as well as my mind. I concentrate on my movements while listening to beautiful, smoothing music. It only takes me 12 minus to finish the eight sequences. I feel refreshed and full of energy before starting my day," says Huang, who now practices baduanjin every day, in addition to going to the gym to do weight training and cardio.When she found out that one of her favorite fitness influencers, German Pamela Reif, had added baduanjin to her workout videos, Huang was surprised and excited.The video, which is 1 minute and 50 seconds long, has received more than 900,000 views, 49,000 likes and 24,000 reposts in the three weeks since it was posted on Bilibili, a popular video sharing platform, on Aug 8. It has helped introduce the ancient exercise to a wider audience, especially to young people like Huang. Film stars and fitness influencers who do baduanjin have also shared videos online, which has attracted many new practitioners."The popularity of baduanjin among young people is increasing, especially since people spent so much time at home during COVID-19," says 28-year-old Li Jianlin, who works as a fitness content creator for Keep, one of the most popular apps for sports lovers in China, and which offers online fitness programs."Many young people go to the gym, and workout regularly. However, a phased and slow approach to resuming exercise after COVID-19 is the best way to regain pre-COVID-19 fitness levels. So baduanjin, which is slow and smooth, has won the hearts of the young during recovery," says Li.Li, who graduated from the Capital University of Physical Education And Sports with a major in aerobics in 2018, has created baduanjin exercise programs for the platform's users, which were launched earlier this year. Available in three different levels, the programs have received warm feedback from users."Seventy percent are young people, under the age of 30. The programs give detailed instructions and demonstrate the movements from different angles," says Li.Keep's baduanjin programs have been watched more than 5.41 million times, and about 36,000 users have added them to their favorites."Since it also involves meditation and breathing exercises, it's also regarded as a way for young people to relax and cope with stress," he adds.According to Wang Zhen, a professor at the Shanghai University of Sport, who teaches in its traditional Chinese sports program, baduanjin dates back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279).Compared with other types of qigong exercise, such as tai chi and wuqinxi (in which practitioners imitate the movements of a bear, a tiger, a monkey, a deer and birds), baduanjin is more suited to beginners thanks to its simple, gentle movements."Each movement has its own set of rhyming instructions, which allows practitioners to easily memorize them, and move in time," says Wang."You can practice at almost any time and anywhere. For example, you can practice a standing posture by the table after sitting in front of the computer for a long time," Wang adds.He started learning qigong when he was 12, introduced to the practice by his mother, who had high blood pressure, high cholesterol and hyperglycemia."She exercised at home so I followed her, just for fun," says Wang, who graduated from the Shanghai University of Sport in 1999 with a master's degree in traditional Chinese sports. He started to teach at the university later that year.On June 5, 2001, the General Administration of Sport set up the Health Qigong Administrative Center, which provides scientific and professional guidance on qigong. In 2004, the Center published four books about four types of qigong, including baduanjin."Government support helped promote qigong exercises and baduanjin has developed a large fan base, not only among the elderly, but also among the young," says Wang.In 2009, the university launched the Shanghai University of Sport National Science & Technology Park, which serves as an incubation center for sports enterprises, including traditional Chinese sports.One of Wang's students is 23-year-old Liu Xueqing, who has been practicing baduanjin since 2019. Now pursuing her master's degree in traditional Chinese sports science at the Shanghai University of Sport, the 23-year-old also teaches seniors, young people and children in communities around Shanghai."I first learned baduanjin with my PE teacher when I was a freshman majoring in sports rehabilitation. At the beginning, it was boring because the movements are slow," says Liu. "But later, I found that it's very helpful for relaxing my muscles, especially after sitting for hours reading or writing.""Now, baduanjin is a new fashion among the young," says Liu Xiaolei, associate professor of the martial arts school at the Beijing Sport University, who has posted baduanjin videos on social media platforms. One of them has been viewed over 200,000 times on Bilibili."In the past, only the elderly practiced baduanjin in parks or at home because it is not difficult. Now, I see many young people, either students or white-collar workers, practicing baduanjin," says Liu.Liu served as president of the jury at the 11th Session of National Traditional Sports in Beijing, between Aug 21 and 25. Baduanjin was among the competitive games held at the event, which began in Beijing in 1985, and which includes a wide variety of traditional sports, such as martial arts, wresting and bahe (tug-of-war)."We have people of all ages practicing baduanjin and like many traditions, such as hanfu (historic Chinese attire) and music, traditional sports is making a return to daily life," she says.Related:'Baduanjin' by yourself"If everybody had an ocean, across the USA, then everybody'd be surfin', like Californi-a," The Beach Boys sang in Surfin' USA, in the late 1960s, capturing the vibrant summer feel of the state still known for its surfing culture.Today, thanks to the surge in surfskating — a trend that allows riders to emulate the fluid feel of surfing on terra firma — even in inland cities, people can enjoy the similar liberating sense of euphoria they'd get from riding the waves.That thrill only gets stronger when you enter a skate bowl, gliding smoothly between the curved walls and flat bottom to build up speed and sustain momentum.Since getting my own surfskate board, I often visit a nearby park where two skateboarding bowls have been built amid of the trees.I still remember the day I first went there.Against a sunset backdrop in hues of pink and orange, I took to my board, poised to glide into the bowl.Each moment was heavy with a sense of anticipation, causing a rush of adrenaline, my focus on how to carve higher up the bowl's walls, and execute my next transition flawlessly.The wind flowed across every inch of my skin, carrying with it the damp, earthy aroma of grass. In that moment, a certainty washed over me: I had truly embraced the summer.I find that even though the bowl is just a skate spot, it feels like a miniature world of its own, distinct from the fast-paced, bustling and socially distant metropolis of Beijing where it is located.Every time I take my board there, I'm met with friendly greetings from fellow skaters.It's a place where veteran riders willingly assist beginners. The concerns of utilitarianism take a back seat, giving way to discussions about tomorrow's weather, or how to perform a new trick.The rhythmic echo of skateboards gliding over the cement mingles with the pulsating beats of hip-hop resonating from a loudspeaker.At such times, the only apt description for my feelings is an undeniable sense of "chill".The more I frequented the park, the better I got to know some of my fellow skaters.I found that apart from their shared passion for skateboarding, they also shared other joys within the collective.Take Qiao Dawang, for instance. Rather than trying to improve his boarding skills, he has a distinct fixation with skateboard maintenance.Every time he visits the park, he comes with tools and is always ready to be a problem solver.Often, he can be found seated beside the bowl, meticulously observing whether the other skaters' boards possess the desired flexibility, assessing any unusual sounds they make during a ride, or thinking about changing certain components to enhance the board's compatibility with a skater's style.When asked why he's always there to help out, he shrugs and explains that he's aware of his own limits."I want to support and cheer others on, and help them break their own barriers, so that more skaters can dive into the thrill and have fun," he says.Duo Lan is another surfskater I encountered. It's hard to miss the lively woman with her sun-kissed skin, well-defined leg muscles and radiant smile. She glides around the bowl with ease, her long hair trailing gracefully behind her.Duo believes that women differ from men physically and psychologically, and that they encounter distinct challenges when they engage in extreme sports. She says that similarities among people of the same gender tend to foster understanding and mutual support."One day, while I was practicing a trick, I was quite scared. A male skater nearby told me he couldn't understand my fear, but we women can better understand and encourage each other," she explains.That's why, back in April last year, she founded the Beijing Girls Surfskating Community and since then, has been organizing a weekly free training session for women near the National Stadium.Sports like surfskating, Frisbee and paddleboarding surged in popularity among urban residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. The public fervor for certain trendy sports has diminished since then, but Duo says that she hasn't observed any waning interest in surfskating."The community has expanded to nearly 2,000 members and, every Saturday, our gatherings consistently attract around 100 participants," she says.As she runs the community and connects to a larger group of people, she finds that her confidence has grown."Nowadays, I feel like this city empowers me in so many ways," she says."Every time I'm out surfskating, I'm attuned to its weather, air quality, humidity, temperature and the very breeze that sweeps across it."Close to her home is a secluded spot where she often practices alone."There, I'm acutely aware of the changing seasons as they unfold through the shifting landscape of grass and trees," she says."A surfskate board is my conduit for forging a deeper connection with the city I'm living in."These feelings evoked by surfskating are also supported by theoretical underpinnings. Li Chuang, an assistant researcher at the Institute of Sociology at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences says that surfskating is a kind of lifestyle sport that revolves around community engagement and that, in today's society, young people are more used to surfing the internet, resulting in fewer chances for real-world interaction."At this point, the community-driven nature of surfskating provides opportunities for young people to foster better connections with the people and environments around them," he says.Li mentions the concept of fujin (the nearby) proposed by anthropologist Xiang Biao, which refers to a shared space where one encounters people of diverse backgrounds on a regular basis.Xiang has observed that, in urban China, the public is simultaneously preoccupied with the very near (the self) and the very far (the imagined world). Meanwhile, young people can rarely offer an account of the people they meet every day, or of the recent changes to the place where they live, a phenomenon he calls "the displacement of fujin".Li believes that the enthusiasm people exhibit for surfskating reveals their yearning to reclaim this sense of fujin."As an illustration, by partaking in this activity near their homes or elsewhere in their city, they uncover hidden corners that normally escape their attention. This exploration gradually fosters an emotional connection with these locations," Li adds.Indeed, the park that I have been frequenting recently to surfskate has already become one of my favorite places in Beijing. Whenever I find myself among the surfskaters, it's a reminder that in the midst of life's hustle and bustle, there's always room to chase after what it is that ignites the fire in our souls.Contact the writer at xingwen@chinadaily.com.cnQinghai province in Northwest China is a mysterious land with a fantastic landscape.As night descends, the mesmerizing starry sky unveils the breathtaking beauty of this place, showcasing the province's exceptional ecological conditions.This video is co-produced by the culture and tourism bureau of Qinghai, China Tourism News and China StarVision Alliance.Chinese-American singer Coco Lee died on Wednesday following a suicide attempt at the age of 48.

However, discoveries at Sanxingdui have changed people's preconceptions, and the site has attracted international attention.The increasing popularity of Sanxingdui is a good thing, Xu says. Bronze ware and gold decorations unearthed there have given people fresh glimpses of the ancient Shu Kingdom, illustrating the inclusiveness of Chinese civilization.Speaking of the pit team, Xu says more than half the members were born in the 1990s. The process of excavation entails meticulous teamwork, and everyone performs their duties extremely conscientiously."Archaeology involves long-term devotion, and one does not expect quick success or instant rewards.

Soon they will be performing at the opening ceremony of the upcoming provincial games for the disabled.Founded in 1908, Changsha Special Education School is one of the oldest such schools in China. It provides preschool rehabilitation, nine-year compulsory education, and secondary vocational education to students with visual and hearing impairments, learning disabilities, and developmental disorders.Based on its rich teaching experience, the school has released a series of research results introduced to over 300 similar schools nationwide, according to Nie Bing, Party secretary of the school.In 2005, the school established the "Dream of Wings" art ensemble with musical instruments, vocal music, dance, and other extracurricular training to encourage students' comprehensive development.Zeng Liyuan, head of the troupe, believes by engaging in such training, students can improve physical coordination, build self-confidence, and gain a sense of accomplishment.It also gives special children chances to display their talents in the spotlight. Over the years, these students have brought back dozens of trophies from art competitions held at home and abroad.For the visually impaired dancers, the whole learning and practicing process was quite challenging, especially at the beginning, recalled Chen Lu, dance director of the art ensemble."To learn the movements and postures precisely, the students had to touch the instructors' body to imitate and try to form muscle memory after countless repetitions. They also need to prick up their ears to figure out their moving directions while changing formations," said Chen.Nian Nian, a 13-year-old dance troupe member, used to be self-abased due to his severe visual impairment. But things have changed since he started dancing two years ago."I made many friends in the troupe," he said. "I'm a slow learner, but the troupe members and instructors never gave up on me and kept practicing with me, encouraging me to do my best."China has attached great importance to the education of disabled children. Counties with a population of more than 300,000 have special education schools, and the enrollment rate of disabled children in compulsory education is above 95 percent, according to the Ministry of Education.Earlier this year, the central government put forward an action plan asking to accelerate the high-quality development of special education during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025).It also requires the enrollment rate of disabled children in compulsory education to reach 97 percent in 2025.The school in Changsha has established tailored vocational courses to prepare students for their future career development. They include fashion design for hearing-impaired students, traditional Chinese medicinal physical therapy for the visually impaired, and domestic services courses for students with learning disabilities and development disorders."By attending the courses, children can learn in advance what skills they should master in doing a certain profession," said Zeng Qianlan, a teacher at the school.Li Haixia, whose son is learning baking at the school, found the child has become happier since the course started."My son loves baking. He delighted the whole family during the past Mid-Autumn Festival by bringing home self-made mooncakes, and they tasted so good," Li said cheerfully.Born in Douai, a city in northern France, Corentin Delcroix fell in love with Chinese food in 2002 when he was studying in Beijing.Delcroix is presently a chef, an entrepreneur and a food blogger who boasts millions of followers on Chinese social media platforms.After learning how to prepare some of the popular local dishes, Delcroix found himself fusing elements of Chinese and French cuisines.Zheng Zheng contributed to the story.Wu Yang, a 35-year-old chef in Shenyang, Northeast China's Liaoning province, has been making the pastry for 10 years.Inspired by the Chinese folk art of traditional lion dance, Wu created a special pastry in the shape of lion head.

Featuring "The Future of Builders", 36 fashion brands gathered in a digital livestreaming event through the video sharing platform Douyin, presenting creative fashion shows in the form of virtual catwalks and videos made through the latest technology."We were informed of the confirmation of the digital fashion show on the evening of June 2," said Xia Yiqi, founder and designer of 2016-founded Leaf Xia, adding they only had half a month for preparation. "Though we had a digital show plan, related personnel such as models and persons in charge of the digital sector were not in Shanghai."Employing a 3D technology supporter for her show filming is an ultraexpensive burden for the startup company, the post-90s designer said.Luckily, Xia found a team from Tongji University to support her, which guaranteed the shooting on June 8 and the release of the virtual show on June 19."What you need for a virtual show is a professional team that understands games, interaction design, and modeling. Meanwhile, our models completed their catwalk on the treadmills," Xia said, adding that all the elements, including background flowers and strawberries, were first drawn in 2D by Xia's team before being modeled into 3D.The digital fashion show came to a successful conclusion, Xia felt amazed and moved when reviewing this trial."The fashion week committee really made us feel that we could make it work," Xia said,"When watching the online fashion show of other brands, I could feel everyone's fighting spirit after resuming work in this round of outbreak. Everyone is a fighter," she added.Lulusmile, a local brand founded by fashion company Lulualways in 2019, released a virtual fashion show with the world's leading shared digital platform Roblox."It's very much like having a real show director," said Shao Minxue, PR director of Lulualways. "You need to know which character comes out first, their actions, and also the accompanying music. All these are very similar to offline shows, but need to be carried out online through technology."As one of the most recognized metaverse communities in the world, Roblox has cooperated with leading brands such as Gucci and Nike. Lulusmile is the first Chinese brand that released a metaverse show through the platform, Shao introduced.Jarelzhang, a women's fashion brand founded in 2016, made its fourth appearance at Shanghai Fashion Week. It released its first animation online fashion show on June 18."Affected by COVID-19, we tried the digital release for the first time in 2020 when knowing that we could attend the fashion week in Paris," said Zhang Chenxuan, the fifth Chinese designer to release collections in Paris Fashion Week in succession."As of now, we have released collections in virtual three-dimensional forms for three consecutive seasons, but for the first time we tried to use animation to express our collection in this season."Jarelzhang's fashion video cooperated with IP "Invisible Friends", "Coolcats", and "Coolman's Universe" in the NFT (non-fungible tokens) world, setting them in different scenes to look at the ecology from the perspective of fashion."Each set of looks in the collection is presented in the form of hand-drawn cartoons, which has a heavy workload because they need to be drawn frame by frame. We also need to build several sub-scenes and integrate the music and action sound effects,"Zhang said, adding that most of the work was completed by the team members at home due to the epidemic prevention measures.Many designers participated in this unique fashion show, referring the digitalization will be the focus of the next development of many brands.According to Zhang, Jarelzhang started to buy land in blockchain gaming platform Sandbox and virtual world website Decentraland, from the United States, years ago to build brand spaces and develop multidimensional virtual products."Leading brands such as Adidas, Gucci, and Prada have developed NFT ecological chains, which also promote the global fashion industry to enter a new dimension of the digital blockchain era. The cooperation between fashion brands will become more convenient and safe while the uniqueness of blockchain will solve the risk of product replication," Zhang explained.Lulusmile has been cooperating with virtual idol Hanser at short-video platform Bilibili since last year, setting metaverse cooperation as their goal."Releasing the show is the first step in our business schedule of the metaverse. We want to build the world's largest platform for sales and experience of virtual clothing. Because clothing, whether in the real world or the virtual world, is a rigid demand," said Shao.Although online fashion shows could reach more audiences, the cost might be similar to an offline one, Shao explained."When holding online shows, fixed costs such as models and venues will be reduced, but the cost of new technologies is high because there are still various new breakthroughs in online technologies," she explained. "At the same time, people still have a deep-rooted sense of feast for traditional fashion shows."Besides digital, sustainability is still a highlight in the latest season's fashion show.Women's fashion brand Ming Ma made the jacquard fabric from the furniture market into a corset. More than 60 percent of the Shuting Qiu's design used recycled materials from previous seasons and maintained long-term cooperation with a women's handicraft group in Hangzhou."Sustainability guides us to choose fabric manufacturers and factories, rather than the opposite," said Yang Guidong, designer of Samuel Guì Yang. His suppliers include Recycltex, a Chinese company dedicated to turning plastic bottles, discarded clothes, and textile waste into new fabrics.This year is the 20th anniversary of Shanghai Fashion Week. Taking "Future" as the annual theme keyword, Shanghai Fashion Week reviews the past at this time point and looks forward to the new development paths.As of June 20, livestreams of the fashion week on Douyin received 2.532 million views. Topics related to Shanghai Fashion Week on the platform had also received 1.07 billion video views. On Weibo, views of related topics grew by 1.04 billion compared with the previous edition. Fashion week content on other platforms such as Bilibili, YouTube and Instagram also grew significantly.Vogue China editor-in-chief Margaret Zhang previewed all the new collections in this year's Shanghai Fashion Week and talked to some designers and she concluded this event as the most spectacular fashion season in her essay released before the beginning of the fashion week.Zhang, also the youngest person to land an editor-in-chief role at the magazine, observed a strong sense of optimism through this year's digital shows and prominently continues the electrooptical tone on the global autumn and winter shows. Magenta, yellow, ruby and turquoise can be widely seen in this year's collections which creates a pleasing color palette.What makes her pleasant is that local fashion designers never paused their creativity around the world during the COVID-19 wave. Compared with New York, London, Paris and Milan, the 28-year-old Chinese-Australian fashion influencer felt Shanghai is more energetic.Zhang also pointed out that more young Chinese designers moved back to China. Meanwhile, batches of graduates from the Parsons School of Design and Central Saint Martins also changed their internship plans at overseas fashion houses and returned to China. This has gifted the fashion industry in Shanghai with a new and blooming picture, she wrote in her story for this year's Shanghai Fashion Week.Designer Xia, who graduated from Parsons School of Design in New York in 2015, said that the batch of returning designers like her has more or less been supported by local market resources. In recent years, they have had more open thinking as they grow."Chinese designers have become more and more outstanding. They will no longer define themselves as someone else or a certain style. Their own style and consciousness are gradually taking shape," said Shao from Lulualways."The fashion week is a platform that hopes to support designers to turn the brand from creativity and awareness to business," she added.A set of specially designed workout exercise that combines movements of popular functional exercise, traditional tai chi and folk dance is gaining popularity among students in China. A rare fancy vivid blue diamond weighing 15.10 carats and expected to achieve in excess of 305 million yuan ($48 million) will go under the hammer at Sotheby's.The gem, called De Beers Cullinan Blue, is among the most valuable blue diamonds ever offered at auction and the largest internally flawless step cut vivid blue diamond that the Gemological Institute of America has ever graded.The De Beers Cullinan Blue will anchor Sotheby's Hong Kong Luxury Week, and will be offered in a stand-alone, single lot live auction in Hong Kong at 8 pm on April 27.Given the global interest in this gem, it will be showcased on a worldwide tour, traveling to cities such as New York, London, Dubai, Singapore, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, and Taipei."Blue diamonds of any kind are rare on the market, but this is the rarest of the rare; nothing of remotely similar caliber has appeared at auction in recent years," Patti Wong, chairman of Sotheby's Asia, said."The De Beers Cullinan Blue stands as a proud masterpiece that has been gifted from nature with the hues of the sky and sea, perfected through a step-cut that is bold, distinctive and masterful," Wenhao Yu, chairman of jewelry and watches at Sotheby's Asia, added.The diamond was discovered at the Cullinan Mine in South Africa in 2021. With only five 10-carat+ blue diamonds ever having come to auction, none of the predecessors have exceeded 15 carats, making the appearance of The De Beers Cullinan Blue a landmark event in itself.A different language is a different vision of life.

The world's best Cymbidium hybridum can be found in Yunnan, while Yunnan's best Cymbidium hybridum can be found in Songming county.Located in the middle of Yunnan, east of Kunming, Songming provides the perfect natural growing conditions for the flower, such as abundant sunlight and air circulation, ideal temperature, making it one of the most important flower production centers in China.With Chinese New Year around the corner, the flower is seeing significant growth in sales after a slump in 2019-2020. Driven by domestic and international demand, the flower market continues to rise."2016 is the year I saw the highest price of Chinese New Year's Eve flowers, when the factory price was about 170. Affected by the pandemic in the past two years, the price hit bottom last year. However, in 2022, flower prices are finally starting to recover," said Dai Jianxiong, head of a flower company in Songming.Unlike previous years' sales, Cymbidium hybridum entered e-commerce platforms in 2021, with a large number of livestreamers selling the flowers. When dealers started livestreaming themselves, farms were also catching up, directly broadcasting from their planting centers. The rise of livestreaming led to prices remaining on an upward trend at the end of the year."When we made our livestreaming debut, the data showed nobody was watching. So it is necessary for us to constantly exercise to improve ourselves, because e-commerce livestreaming requires perseverance and a certain amount of stamina. Only then can we survive the toughest start-up phase. Once you have survived the toughest period, you will be able to see the sunshine, this is for sure. Every time there are new rules on the livestreaming platform, I will constantly study and update my livestream, orders of goods, and other content," said Guo Yan, an e-commerce livestreamer.Nowadays, consumers can buy the best and freshest flowers from the internet while also receiving professional flower care solutions, specialized knowledge about the species. With the rise of e-commerce, a new consumer base will grow geometrically.Jiang Yixian, head of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Songming County, said there are 32 flower-planting enterprises in Songming, with a total cultivation area of 28,100 acres. The output of fresh-cut flowers has reached 1.03 billion and reached a total value of 2.98 billion yuan. The development of the flower industry has not only driven the local economy, but also contributed to rural revitalization. Seedlings, seeds, and new technology demonstrations from Songming are being promoted both at home and abroad, radiating to adjacent counties and many prefectures and cities in Yunnan, as well as cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and countries such as Dubai, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Vietnam, and Laos.2021 saw many excellent new Chinese TV dramas.

It is usually a fixed item of dinner on any Beijingtour itinerary. Eating Beijing doast duck is also one of the two things you are absolutely supposed to do while in Beijing-- the other one is climbing the Great Wall.Peking ducks are called force-fed ducks, which are raised for the sole purpose of making the food. Force-fed, they are kept in cages which restrain them from moving about, so as to fatten them up and make the meat comparably tender.Peking roast duck is always served in well-cut slices. The chef cuts the meat into thin slices, each having a piece of skin and perfect with the complete layers of the meat. Then the meat is served with very thin pancakes, Chinese onions and special sauce -- usually sweet bean sauce. The way to eat it is to coat the thin pancake with sauce, slap on a few pieces of meat and roll up the pancake. Chopsticks are optional: it is much easier just to grab the thing with your bare hands. Normally there are many dishes served with the duck, including a dish of fine-cut shallot bars, a dish of cucumber bars and finally a dish of paste-like soy of fermented wheat flour. The dinner usually ends with a rich cream-colored duck soup made from the duck.The International Symposium for the 10th Anniversary of the Nutrition Improvement Plan took place in Beijing on Dec 18, with participation from more than 120 government officials, scholars and representatives of international organizations and enterprises.Carrying the title "Investing in Child Nutrition for Healthy Future", the symposium was hosted by the China Development Research Foundation and co-organized by the United Nations World Food Program and covered topics including the achievements of the plan in the past decade, rural revitalization and international experience.In 2011, China launched a nutrition improvement plan for students receiving compulsory education in rural areas. According to statistics from CDRF, by the end of 2020, 1,732 counties from 28 provinces have participated in the program, covering approximately 131,600 schools and 37.98 million students."In both high-quality economic development and promoting common prosperity, children's development should be a key focal point. In the future, stronger initiatives must be taken quickly and effectively to increase public investment in children's nutrition, health, nurturing and education, and to improve the comprehensiveness, balance, coordination and inclusiveness of children's development," Li Wei, chairman of the foundation, said at the opening ceremony.Video provided by China Development Research Foundation.It is said that in each dynasty there were different costumes in China.

"I've seen some mapping projection shows but the unique architecture of the Shanghai Concert Hall brought new visual impact and historical depth. I am very impressed and this is more than I could expect."A Story of Sound and Light was created by Motion Magic, a leading digital entertainment company in Shanghai.According to Tang Hao, the general manager of the company, the main objective was to design a visual extravaganza that could match the glory and importance of the 90-year-old Shanghai Concert Hall.Built in 1930 and originally named the Nanking Theater, the building was the first classic Western style architecture designed by Chinese architects. It was also one of the first cinemas in Shanghai to screen foreign movies at the same time as the West. Maestro Mei Lanfang used to perform Peking opera here, and in the latter half of the 20th century it was the prime location for classical concerts.In 2003, the building was moved southeastward by more than 66 meters to make space for the new elevated Yan'an Road."We decided to highlight all these important pages in the history of the concert hall," Tang said, before adding that the building's outline, columns and windows were highlighted with carefully designed laser projections. Studies were done ahead of the project to ensure the laser would not harm the wall or structure of the building.The 3D mapping show was followed by the New Oriental Chinese Music Scene concert presented by the Shanghai Chinese Orchestra. The concert premiered in 2016 and has toured many countries in the past few years. The new edition features eight chapters that take audiences on a journey through natural elements such as water, wind and fire to modern civilization and the wishes of all human beings for a shared future, said Yao Shenshen, conductor of the concert.The concert is accompanied by new digital visual effects created by Motion Magic. New costumes and stage settings were designed for the Shanghai Concert Hall.The mapping projection of "A Story of Sound and Light", together with the New Oriental concert production and a multi-media exhibition about Chinese music on the fourth floor of Shanghai Concert Hall forms part of the city's new efforts to present its culture, history and architecture to tourists and locals, said Fang Jing, general manager of the Shanghai Concert Hall.The 14th National Games is now underway in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi province. The event has triggered great interest — not only in sports and fitness, but also in the host city itself.Due to its status as the longest-running capital in ancient China and for giving birth to most dynasties, Xi'an, with a history of over 3,000 years, has had a deep impact on the life and culture of the country.Home to the Terracotta Warriors, Xi'an enjoys a reputation as a "Living History Museum" due to its rich, diverse collection of historical and cultural treasures.If you are planning a tour of Xi'an taking less than 3 days, you’ll want to hit all the highlights. Check out these recommended attractions, which we think best capture the spirit of the ancient city.1 The Terracotta ArmyThe Terracotta Army is not just China's premier historical attraction, it is one of the most significant archeological finds in the world and one of the greatest discoveries of the 20th century.Discovered in 1974, the army of Terracotta Warriors was constructed by China's First Emperor Qinshihuang of the Qin Dynasty (221 BC-207 BC). It is a collection of thousands of life-size terracotta soldiers, horses and chariots in battle formation, showing the emperor’s armies in full splendor.The Terracotta Warriors and Horses Museum consists of three vaults and an exhibition hall: Vault One, Vault Two, Vault Three and the Exhibition Hall of the Bronze Chariots. Of the three pits, Pit 1 is the largest and the most impressive, with over 6,000 terracotta figures in total and fewer than 2,000 on regular display. Each figure differs in facial features and expressions, clothing, hairstyle and also body position.

Culture has played an important role in the country's rural revitalization program.Swiss designer Didier Rudolf Quarroz's love of Chinese tea culture has inspired him to design innovative new items to brew the beverage.The graduate of the renowned Swiss design school, ECAL (University of Art and Design Lausanne), developed an interest in Chinese tea after working at a Shanghai-based design company, where he was by chance engaged in a tea project.His research helped him hone a deep understanding of the differences between Chinese and Western tea products. And this made him think about designing items for foreigners to brew Chinese tea."I hope to design easy-to-use and modern tea-making tools to help foreigners try Chinese traditional tea and give them an interesting experience in brewing tea," Quarroz says.In 2017, he moved to Hangzhou, capital of East China's Zhejiang province and a major tea-production base, to explore the possibilities of applying Western concepts in designing wares for Chinese tea."I want to focus on the tea industry, and Hangzhou is a great fit because of the long history and profound culture of tea here," Quarroz says.He opened his design company, Shateso, with the help of local incubator Nihub in the city's Binjiang district.Quarroz began to concentrate on the design of a tea infuser to make brewing easier for foreigners.It's a cone-shaped container with frosted glass and a silicone lid. All users need to do is to put the leaves inside, place it in a cup and add hot water."The infuser can be taken out from the cup easily without (users') fingers being scalded by the hot water," Quarroz says.He adds that the container with tea inside can be brewed several times by putting it in and taking it out of the water, and the flavor's strength can be sustained at the same time.Hangzhou boasts a booming tea industry, which has offered the Swiss designer many opportunities to cooperate with local plantations and companies."Driven by the love of Chinese tea, I cooperate with local companies and help them to develop new kinds of tea products. Also, we sometimes organize workshops to introduce different teas to the public," Quarroz says.Hangzhou also enables smooth business operations, he adds."In general, it is easy to start a business in Hangzhou. And the government and agencies are ramping up efforts to help and support young entrepreneurs, including us from foreign countries," he adds.Quarroz says he plans to design 10 innovative tea-related products by combining Chinese tea culture with international elements.A new walking route marked out in rainbow colors has attracted lots of attention at Gonghuwan Wetland Park in Wuxi, Jiangsu province.

Hao Jingfang, a Tsinghua University alumna, is pursuing her passion for writing and education.In 2016, she won the prestigious Hugo Award with her novella, Folding Beijing, which made her the first female writer in China to bring home this prize. Later on, the author turned to education. She set up Tongxing Academy for public welfare education and WePlanets to foster children's creativity after school.In this interview with Easy Talk, Hao discusses her life experience — not only as a writer and educator, but also a parent."The major task for society is to help people get better education, to elevate their skill set in line with future technological advancements, and to broaden their horizons," Hao said.Since founding her company, Hao has been carrying out voluntary teaching programs in rural areas. "We really want these kids to have better education resources like kids from the cities," she said. "We hope that the children from rural China, if one day they manage to live in the cities, can do more than car maintenance, for example. They will have the skills to take on other jobs."Different from the typical Chinese parents so ambitious for their children, Hao suggests giving kids more space for trial and error. "I do believe the best mentality for parents is to stand behind your children," Hao said. "Let the child cope with the reality and decide for themselves. If they struggle with obstacles, you can offer them some guidance or encouragement.""I've had a wide variety of interests since childhood. I've got used to doing different things," says the 35-year-old.Being an economic researcher, a writer and entrepreneur herself, she encourages all women to discover their passions.

[Video provided by Jinan Times]Roland Emmerich and his thrilling box office hits over the years — from Independence Day to Godzilla and The Day after Tomorrow — have been etched into the minds of Chinese film fans as the definition of Hollywood blockbusters.The director's excellence in shooting special effects has won him a reputation among his Chinese fan base as, jokingly, "the man who is best at destroying Earth" in Hollywood.Recently, Emmerich returned to Chinese theaters with his war epic Midway, which revisits one of the most pivotal battles in the United States Navy's history.As of Wednesday, the film, which opened across Chinese mainland on Friday, had grossed 142 million yuan ($20.2 million).Recently knocking down local hit Better Days, Midway has occupied the top place in the box office charts and obtained a score of 7.6 points out of 10 on Chinese review website Douban.The idea for the film came from a documentary that Emmerich watched around 20 years ago, recalls the 64-year-old German director following a preview screening at a downtown Beijing cinema on Nov 3."I immediately realized it (the Battle of Midway) is one of the biggest comeback stories in World War II. It was interesting to find that the Americans were the underdog and the Japanese naval forces were much more well-trained and stronger," says the director.An epic conflict between the United States and Japan that played out six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Midway — lasting from June 3 to June 6 in 1942 — saw US forces destroy Japan's first-line carrier strength and most of its elite naval pilots, forcing the turning point in the Pacific theater where the war swung in favor of the Allies.Although Emmerich formed an idea for the film as early as the 1990s, he failed to get a green light from Columbia Pictures, which had recently been purchased by Sony Pictures with backing from Japanese banks.However, in 2017, the stalled project reached its own turning point. A Chinese studio, Bona Film Group, staked around $80 million to lead the investment on Midway, which became the biggest deal made during the 70th Cannes Film Festival.Yu Dong, founder and president of Bona, who also attended the Beijing premiere, recalls that Emmerich talked for two hours to elaborate upon his idea and express his passion for Midway near the French seaside city two years ago."I was completely convinced and decided to get on board immediately," says Yu.This also brought China a bigger presence in Midway, which has some scenes featuring the surviving American pilot, Jimmy Doolittle, protected by locals during Japanese searches and bombing raids in southeastern China after the Tokyo Raid is carried out.Also known as the Doolittle Raid, the aerial bombardment was the American revenge for the Pearl Harbor attack, and took place on April 18, 1942. However, the raid over the Japanese capital and other places on Honshu forced most of the crew to land in China due to a lack of fuel to return to their aircraft carriers.For Yu, the new film can also be viewed as a sort of follow-up to Michael Bay's 2001 film Pearl Harbor. He added the improvement of cinematic technology over past two decades means that Midway delivers more spectacular visual effects.Ingredients1. 1 catty of Pork Belly (whole piece)2. ½ catty approximately 2 stalks (Mui Choi /preserved vegetables)3. 2 Tbsps oyster sauce4. 1 tsp salt5. 1 tsp granulated sugar6. 120ml dark soy sauce7. 2 tbsps light soy sauce8. 1 screw cap Shaoxing wine9. 500 ml cooking oil10. 1 Tbsp garlic (finely chopped)11. ½ tbsp crushed rock sugarInstructions:1.

One of the most popular is that Singles Day originated from campus culture. In 1993, four senior students at Nanjing University came up with the idea of organizing activities on Nov 11 as a day for single people. With more and more people joining in, this festival was gradually adopted by society; with the spread of media and online culture, Singles Day is now hugely popular.At the same time, Nov 11 is also a shopping carnival. "Double 11" originated from the online promotion held by Taobao (Tmall) on Nov 11, 2009. With the popularity of online shopping, the turnover of "Double 11" Shopping Festival reached 213.5 billion in 2018, up from 52 million in 2009.When shopping day meets Singles Day, what will people do? What "professional advice" can "skilled insiders" give? In the eyes of others, what items can make you more attractive?Welcome to the "Double 11" special program— "I won't be available next year."One of the year's most anticipated blockbusters – the disaster film The Captain adapted from actual events -- will hit domestic theaters on Sept 30.Starring actor Zhang Hanyu as the protagonist, the film is based on the heroic Sichuan Airlines pilot Liu Chuanjian, whose emergency landing last year marked one of the biggest miracles in China's civil aviation history.On May 14, 2018, Liu steered an airliner with 119 passengers heading from Chongqing to Lhasa. After around 40 minutes at a height of nearly 10,000 meters above ground, a piece of the cockpit windshield shattered, sucking out half the body of Liu's copilot. Luckily, the man wore a seatbelt and was clinging tightly against the window.Without the glass, temperature inside the cockpit abruptly fell to -40 C, and the pilots were just wearing shirts. The plane also lost most of its automatic controls. Liu, a former air force veteran who had flown the same route over 100 times, safely landed at an airport in Chengdu, relying on his experience and courage.In this day and age, urban dwellers are either cocooned in the digital world, minds boggled by a myriad of content online; or subconsciously tyrannized by the always-being-connected lifestyle, bombarded 24/7 by push notifications on ever-smarter phones.Buffeted and drained by the hustle and bustle in big cities, do you sometimes fancy zoning out a bit to go back to nature and regain peace and quiet within?Uruguay, a diamond embedded between Brazil and Argentina, now promises its Cabo Polonio, a hamlet many people call “Shangri-La” on the country’s eastern coast, can shelter and nourish weary souls in modern life.Dr. Leonardo Segalerba, 54, born in Uruguay’s capital, Montevideo, used to work as a lawyer in the capital city. Tired of hectic city life, he retired at 40, moved to Cabo Polonio and became one of its 120 permanent residents.“Basically every 20 seconds at night, you can spot a meteor shooting across the sky,” said Segalerba, press representative for Cabo Polonio at a promotional event held at the Cervantes Institute in Beijing.Cabo, meaning “cape” in English, is a peninsula infamous for its rocky shores and fierce seas that wrecked many ships. Polonio, a Spanish ship, was just one of those misfortunes. It crashed into the peninsula on a stormy night in 1735, leaving its name as a legacy to the place where it was destroyed.Isolated from surrounding cities by sand dunes and without roads directly leading to it, Cabo Polonio is geographically removed from urban civilization. The only way to get there is by taking a double-decker truck that routinely picks up tourists at a station and takes them on a 20-minute bumpy ride.Electricity, genesis of modern comfort and entertainment, isn’t available. But it is worth noting the iconic lighthouse erected in 1881 by the Uruguayan government is powered by the national grid to prevent shipwrecks.Moreover, there is no running water in the area, and villagers there rely on water from wells and collected rain water.Recognized as a national park in 2009 by the Uruguayan government, Cabo Polonio embraces a mix of natural environments, such as beaches, sand dunes, and wetland. Meanwhile, the park is home to Uruguay’s second-largest colony of sea lions, which number roughly 200,000.With its breathtaking natural beauty and primitiveness, Cabo Polonio strikes visitors as the Shangri-La of South America. Since the 1980s, the site has been sought after by American and European tourists who desire to escape suffocating city life and reconnect with the freshness and tranquility of nature.“Many writers live here around the year focusing on their books as it’s a place where they can disconnect themselves from the chaos of the modern world,” Segalerba said.“It is only in the last two years that Chinese tourists began to come to Cabo Polonio,” Segalerba told China Daily in an interview.Zhang Qi, 32, a travel enthusiast whose footsteps have been left in more than 60 countries, is among the first batch of Chinese tourists to the area.Zhang has traveled to Uruguay four times and to Cabo Polonio twice, in 2017 and 2018. He spent more than 20 days during his recent trip to the village with his brother and sister-in-law, who were on their honeymoon.Calling Cabo Polonio his favorite place in the world, the well-traveled man opened a café in Beijing’s always buzzing and alcohol-laden Sanlitun in May and named it “Cabo Coffee”, serving both excellent coffee and South Americans’ favorite drink, the mate tea, a caffeine-rich infused drink.“In Cabo, I saw the biggest-ever setting sun, the most beautiful sunset, and the most spectacular galaxy of the southern hemisphere,” Zhang fondly recalled, adding that “There is no electricity in Cabo, but it makes the place cooler and gives me a sense of primitiveness.”Like Zhang’s observation, Cabo Polonio is at its finest at night.As the lighthouse is the sole artificial light after sunset, the region is free from light pollution, making it a vantage point in the Southern Hemisphere for appreciating thousands of stars punctuating the night sky.Another night feast for the eye is watching the second-largest sea lion colony in Uruguay behind the iconic lighthouse, where the creatures can be seen singing and dancing.During the day, Cabo Polonio also has much fun to offer. Surfing, sunbathing on the beaches, running up and sliding down the sand dunes, or hiking along the shores are among the activities.The village, covering an area of about 26,000 hectares, is inhabited only by 120 permanent residents, with most engaged in tourism, running restaurants or renting their houses to tourists.During the peak season, from mid-December to mid-January, some 3,000 tourists will flock to Cabo Polonio and spend days or even weeks there. This has aroused the concern of many environmentalists, fearing swarms of tourists may pose a threat or even damage protected wildlife and the fragile ecosystem that the country values.“The isolation created by the surroundings prevents swarms of tourists from reaching Cabo, acting as a ‘natural shield’ that protects and preserves its culture and distinct way of life,” Segalerba explained.Segalerba also pointed out that planning, analyzing and monitoring tourists’ behavioral patterns can help achieve a fragile balance between environmental protection and the sustainable development of the area.In addition, the authority in charge of the site will adopt measures such as managing tourist flow of the year and involving the local community in environmental protection to handle problems that may arise with the arrival of more and more international tourists.Yang Xiaoyu contributed to the story    When people think of China, their minds often fill with images of historic monuments and unique cultural traditions that have become such an intrinsic part of the country’s image around the world. The Great Wall, Terracotta Warriors, kung fu...these are but a small part of a vast country that would take a lifetime to fully explore.My brother and I have seen much of what China has to offer. We’ve walked the Great Wall, eaten Chongqing hot pot, and studied at several Chinese universities, but just when we thought we were starting to understand what this immense country was all about, we arrived in the coastal city of Yantai, East China’s Shandong province.Now don’t get me wrong, I have been to Shandong before. My brother and I lived in Jinan for almost a year, traveled to the coastal paradise of Qingdao, and climbed the enigmatic Mount Tai. But none of this was enough to prepare us for the stunning beauty that was Yantai.After arriving at Yantai Penglai International Airport, we immediately set off for our hotel, which would take us through miles and miles of stunning greenery dotted with quaint little red-roofed buildings, which almost made us feel as if we were touring the Italian countryside. But if this wasn’t enough to sell us on the city (which it was), then the hotel we were staying at surely would be. It was a grand structure with a luxurious interior that some might say gives the Hilton a run for its money. But the most spectacular thing about the hotel was its location, right next to a vast expanse of blue nothingness. Yes, I’m referring to the ocean. Like Qingdao, Yantai is a coastal paradise, but while Qingdao can be considered China’s city of beer, Yantai is home to something even more alluring - wine.Now wine is certainly not something that comes to mind with China, so you can imagine our complete and utter surprise at hearing that Yantai was home to one of the world’s leading wine brands and many of the leading domestic brands, including Changyu and Great Wall. In fact, Yantai produces as much as 40 percent of the wine in China. A number like that is no joke.Indeed, this trip was all about wine.

Pain Chaud, co-founded by a Belgian entrepreneur in Shanghai that has grown into a chain with three locations, won the award of Best Viennoiserie with its puffy pastries.

And their works should be a regular item from their menu in daily business.The festival was first introduced to China 10 years ago as a professional gathering of industry insider to discuss and exchange the localization methods of the European staple food in the country. Today, as more Chinese include the doughy goods in their diets, the festival has shifted its role to promoting the diversity and improving the quality of breads, according to organizers of the festival.Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview that he wanted the traditional baguette to be protected as a world treasure by the UNESCO, like Belgian beer and Japanese washoku.Ingredients:400g Pork Belly (cut into cubes)1 can Canned Pineapple (cut into cubes)Half of each Red, Green and Yellow Bell Peppers1/2 pcs Onion (sliced)150g Dried Hawthorn Berries (rinsed)200 ml Water150g Corn Starch7 to 8 sections Scallion700ml Cooking Oil3 Tbsps Corn Starch Mixture(that is 2 tsps of Corn Starch + 3 Tbsps of Water = Corn Starch Mixture)Marinade:2 tsps Light Soy Sauce2 tsps Oyster Sauce2 tsps Granulated Sugar2 tsps Shaoxing Wine1 pc Egg (beaten)Ingredients for the Sauce:3 Tbsps Ketchup1 Tbsp Lemon Juice100ml Water3 tsps Granulated SugarInstructions:1.

Enjoy!Accupuncture, as one form of Traditional Chinese Medicine, is not only a treasure belonging to the Chinese people, but also an integral part of world civilization and a common benefit for all mankind.One of our China Daily reporters has a fear of needles... will they survive their first ever acupuncture session?"I'd like to see more films made in China reaching out to the world," said American director Rob Minkoff, jury president at the main competition of the 2019 Beijing International Film Festival.Best known for the celebrated Disney classic The Lion King, Minkoff has also directed a number of animated films including Stuart Little, The Haunted Mansion and Mr. Peabody & Sherman.In a press conference held last Thursday, Minkoff said Beijing is the heart of the Chinese film industry. The BIFF attracts film productions from around the world, boosting development of filmmaking. With a global jury panel, the festival has become an international affair.In light of the remarkable progress made by online subscription services like Netflix and Amazon, Minkoff thinks these platforms offer a promising alternative to big-budget Hollywood blockbusters.Having closely worked with Netflix on an original animated series based on Anna Dewdney's picture book franchise Llama Llama, he thinks its business model guarantees more liberty for the creator, thereby leading to more eclectic content."For example, Netflix is investing in really diverse content. They don't have to make one thing that appeals to everybody. Their productions can be quite unique and artist-driven," Minkoff said.He also underlined the significance of a strong audience base in the future. "It's about developing the audience for Chinese animated films – to create projects that are more popular with broader appeal," he said. "The most important thing is to tell a good story with interesting characters, in a way that is fresh and new, different and exciting for the audience."Minkoff said the Chinese animation industry has grown vigorously over the past decade. "I've seen improvements made in the quality of the animation, the production and the filmmaking."With the coming of the 5G era and virtual reality, he thinks it opens up new space for creativity and accessibility. "The changes in technology are going to continue to improve and make it possible to make really interesting, different kinds of films, and put the tools of filmmaking and animation into more people's hands, which I think would be very good," the director said.Besides the animated adaptation of Wolf Totem, Minkoff revealed to China Daily he is working on a "secret" project inspired by Chinese culture. "The movie is based on a Chinese story and Chinese characters. But the idea is to do it as a musical, very much in the vein of Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid."Contact the writer at liwenrui@chinadaily.com.cnSo Long, My Son, the latest film by leading Chinese auteur Wang Xiaoshuai, sets to examine changing times in modern China.It is a family saga about parenthood, friendship, struggle and forgiveness. Covering a large stretch of space and time, the story moves from the 1980s to the present, and from the North to the South of China.Known for realism, Wang is no stranger to prominent international film festivals. This time, his work scooped two Berlin Film Festival awards – Silver Bear for Best Actress and Best Actor.On the occasion of So Long, My Son screening in Chinese cinemas, China Daily spoke with him about the film's production, his life and his view on Chinese auteur film.Guest: Wang XiaoshuaiReporter: Li WenruiCopy editor: Anne Marie RuisiSubtitles: Sun JiaoProducer: Li WenruiExecutive producer: Feng MinghuiContact the producer at liwenrui@chinadaily.com.cnIn recent years, a lot has changed in the global film and TV industry.

How will these changes shape the future cinematic landscape? How can Chinese films and TV shows gain a stronger global presence?China Daily invites award-winning screenwriter Jeppe Gram to share his golden rule on storytelling. Gram is best known for the Danish TV drama Borgen. The show tells the story of a minor female politician who rises to become the first female prime minister of Denmark.

China Fashion Week, which opened Monday, takes the lead in praising the beauty of women of all ages.Wearing beautiful makeup, designer dresses and some in 25cm high heels, these "grannies" impress the audience with their elegant and professional gait. It is really hard to believe the eldest among them is 72-years-old and the youngest, 48!Thirty members of this group come from Central China's Hubei province with a deep passion for modeling."I once saw the 78-year-old supermodel Han Bin walking for fashion weeks online. I feel deeply inspired, and hope that one day I can walk on the runway as well," Li Xun, a 62-year-old group member, said.Li and several friends contacted Hu Sheguang, the designer for China Fashion Week's opening. And so this exciting experiment began."Each one of us keeps on a diet before Chinese New Year," Li said. "We need to exercise a lot more, including yoga and jogging, to walk effortlessly on those heels.""I'd like to introduce the beauty and energy of the Chinese elderly. This show will certainly change the stereotype of 'Chinese Granny'," Hu said.The video is contributed by Zhou Lihua.The annual Francophonie Festival kicked off in Beijing last month, with variety of activities in the field of music, art, book, cinema and sport. Chinese actor Huang Jue, ambassador of the festival, shared his insights on French culture and Chinese films in an interview with China Daily website. He said while there were differences between China and France,  "essentially both Chinese and French films were about people."Guest: Huang JueReporter: Zhang XingjianCamera: Fu RuiEditing: Yu XiaoouSubtitles: Yang XiaoyuExecutive Producer: Feng MinghuiMadcap action, Chinese martial arts, and the Monkey King: If you want to relive the adventures of Journey to the West, Unruly Heroes, a 2D action game by Magic Design Studios in France, is for you.Like Dynasty Warriors (created by Japanese company KOEI from Romance of the Three Kingdoms and deemed by many as the greatest franchise set in China), the game is another example of international talent meets traditional Chinese culture."Creating a game based on the novel, Journey to the West, has actually been my dream since I entered this profession," said Lu Yang, CEO and creative director of MDS. "It is a very dramatic tale set in a vast, legendary world. Every character is depicted vividly.""Everyone in China knows the story, but in European countries or the US, few people know about Journey to the West. I think such an intriguing story should be introduced to more people," he said.Nominated for Best PC Game and Best Visual Art at The Ping Awards 2018, and Most Anticipated Game at the Unity Awards 2018, Unruly Heroes brought home the Best Console Game at the Barcelona Games World. Released in January, the game has received an 80 percent positive reaction on STEAM.Most of its designers previously worked for Ubisoft on acclaimed titles like Assassin's Creed, Prince of Persia and Rayman Legends. The game features a unique story and cast of characters, where players can alternate between four protagonists: Wukong, Sanzang, Kihong and Sandmonk.The creative team integrates many Chinese cultural elements into the art design. "The goal of our art design is to introduce Journey to the West to the world, to make the story more relatable, and be accepted by players from different cultural backgrounds," Lu said.The game builds an immersive world of art, animation and a taste of Chinese folk music."In my eyes, China means colors like a Guzheng harp, or spirits like a bamboo flute, also rhythm like big drums," said Julian Koechlin, musical designer of Unruly Heroes."I really like the old part of Chinese culture, the architecture I think is very interesting," Mary Glaid, the graphic designer, said. To her, Journey to the West is a childhood memory. "My favorite character is the monkey. When I was a kid, I saw an animation movie, I think it was the first animation movie about this story. I loved it so much. I was a really big fan."Set against lushly illustrated environments and a hand-drawn art style, Unruly Heroes updates the Journey to the West classic tale into an epic adventure that is more colorful, humorous and lighthearted. As Lu introduced, the game differed a lot compared with the original story. "For example, we reimagined White Bone Spirit as the owner of a beauty parlor, so gamers need to destroy her mask to defeat her."The game also subverts the stereotype about the underworld – the dark, spooky underworld is transformed into a fantastic amusement park."We add several 'baby' characters as bosses of the Underworld. The Underworld becomes a happy place controlled by babies," Lu said.Lu believes that Chinese culture has strong potential to reach a broader audience, but it needs the efforts of more companies and creative minds."We can integrate Chinese cultural elements into products that are accessible to people around the world. Video games, film and TV series, and other cultural and entertainment products resonate easily internationally," he said."I am not a scholar; I simply want to do what I can to present a story I love to more people far and wide," Lu added.Executive producer: Feng MinghuiReporter: Li WenruiGuest: Lu YangVoiceover: Li WenruiSubtitles: Ai PingAcknowledgement: Perfect World; Magic Design StudiosContact the producer at liwenrui@chinadaily.com.cnFans in London mourn fashion legend Karl Lagerfeld who has died in Paris on Tuesday morning, aged 85.  Learn how to make the traditional Chinese snack Yuanxiao, or glutinous rice ball to celebrate the Lantern Festival, which falls on Feb 19 this year. How do you make traditional cultural heritage come alive and have relevance in today's world? How did Mei Lanfang influence the European theater? Today we learn about these topics and more in a conversation with Stathis Livathinos, artistic director of the National Theater of Greece, a man who always stands at the forefront of the global stage.In February, his bilingual play Agamemnon will open to audiences in Beijing. The work, an extraordinary experiment from the national theaters of China and Greece, will represent the merging of two great theatrical traditions.Livathinos, who has visited China three times, describes each of his journeys to the country with great affection. "My first travel to China was 12 years ago I think, on my way to Xi'an, to see the Terracotta Army and Beijing, which was like a fairy tale for me, very unique," he said. "Then I went to Tibet, which was a journey I will never forget in my life."Last year, the first collaborative project between the two national theaters – The Orphan of Zhao, by Chinese director Wang Xiaoying – became a big success in Athens. "I was thrilled by Zhao. It was a great work, a very interesting epic play and a very difficult one," said Livathinos.Following Zhao, the Greek director agreed to bring a Greek play to China. The upcoming production Agamemnon, by ancient Greek tragedian Aeschylus, often described as the father of tragedy, is the first part of his only extant trilogy. Livathinos chose this particular work to present something both Greek and international."Agamemnon is a part of something bigger that doesn't belong only to Greece. Agamemnon is a part, I think, of the world civilization. It's the same as Bach, like Shakespeare, like Pinter, like Beckett, like Da Vinci. These are the reasons we exist. These are the reasons that keep us human."Using a mostly Chinese cast, to tell a millennia-old tale from the European continent in front of a Chinese audience is more than just daring. And Livathinos is determined to create a distinctive play."Because it's part of an experiment we agreed on two years ago with the director of the National Theater of China. It will be a kind of theatrical and artistic meeting of civilizations onstage. Of course, this will be a very big risk. But it's better to go with a risk than with safety."Thanks to his theatrical education in Moscow, Livathinos is very familiar with the influence Chinese performing artists have had on theater in the West. "Chinese theater and many actors, especially Mei Lanfang, at the beginning of the (20th) century, influenced the European theater very much, especially Meyerhold. And his relation to Meyerhold gave many important results in the world of the Russian classics and through them, as a big river, to the theater of the whole of Europe."Though he points out the language barrier during cultural exchanges, particularly in theatrical arts, what always matters most is the efforts people make. "As a Chinese proverb goes, 'a big journey starts from one step'. It will take generations for real understanding to happen. But this is a good step and for me a very unique experience."If you go:Feb 20-24, Feb 26-March 2.

What is the best approach to appreciate Shakespeare? What are the common misunderstandings people have about actors and actresses? Joseph Graves, a veteran actor and director from the US, will tell you about the fun and reality of this glamorous trade.A teacher at Peking University and an actor on the stage, Graves has been living in China since 2002, dedicating his life to introducing Shakespearean plays to China. As the artistic director of PKU's Institute of World Theater and Film, he wants to help more Chinese university students experience the magic of performance.Graves points out that theater performances, where actors bring the audience together on a theatrical journey, are much more interactive than films. "In the best circumstances, there is a kind of almost spiritual experience that happens between the audience and actors that can never happen in a film."He also demystifies the acting profession. "Most people know actors most from movie stars or television stars. It leads people to think that all 'successful' actors are wealthy and beautiful," Graves said. But the overall picture is much more polarized. "The reality is that 90 percent of actors die in poverty."With only a small group of actors making big money, one should be much more clearheaded when it comes to career choices. "So to dedicate your life to film or television or the theater is a kind of risky life, in terms of financial security."Over the years, he has helped to establish performing arts departments in universities across China. "I have interacted with thousands of students in a lot of different universities," he said. "A lot of students have gone on to become drama teachers, actors, directors, writers here in China, some in America."But many problems are still unresolved. "The slower part is finding a way to encourage the universities and the boards of education to develop these programs in a well-funded and well-staffed style."Graves plays a lot of characters with very strong personalities, such as the Greek hero Achilles and the idealistic knight Don Quixote. "I do identify with someone being willing to spend their life trying to understand it, to understand themselves and other people, and to have the courage to say there are probably some things that are really true."He has been involved in six productions that integrated Chinese opera forms, including the Pulitzer-winning play Our Town written by Thornton Wilder. Shown at Beijing People's Art Theater with an international cast, it boldly combines Peking Opera with English monologues."I'm very familiar with several Chinese opera forms," he said. "They are really quite beautiful and quite powerful once you begin to even have a smattering of understanding of what's going on."Contact the producer at liwenrui@chinadaily.com.cnThis year marks the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening-up.

The Shanghai outpost, which represents an investment of about 30 million yuan ($4.69 million), is located in a shopping mall along East Nanjing Road."Many shopping malls in Shanghai are interested and want to talk to us," said Ryan Shen, the store manager of its Shanghai branch, on May 22. "The location is very important to a restaurant and more outlets may open in a short time," he added.Though the restaurant is still in its soft opening phase, Shen said that business has been brisk. It has seen a mix of customers from home and abroad.He added that a unique point about PF Chang's is that, unlike other Chinese restaurants where locals host their overseas friends, it is where the US expatriates and foreigners bring their Chinese friends to dine.Shen said that the restaurant imports some of its ingredients while others like vegetables are sourced locally."For our international outlets, we have more food safety SOPs than in the US, especially in Shanghai," he said.The dishes at PF Chang's are generally less greasy compared to typical Chinese restaurants. Some foodies approached by China Daily said its dishes are suited to the Chinese palate.Clad in an orange T-shirt bearing the words “master chemist” on the chest and sleeves, actor Zhang Yishan appeared energetic in the clothes of the fashion label he launched at the end of last year.The 26-year-old spoke in Beijing dialect of his experience posing for his first photo album, which will be published on April 10.Related article: Keeping it realRelated story:A tea-scented spring breeze blows from Britain"My work explores fundamental questions about who we are and where we came from," says Professor Meemann Chang, who in a long career examining fish fossils has discovered some of our earliest ancestors."To be able to figure out what a new fossil is, how it is related to other organisms, how it lived, and what it can tell us about the ancient environment" is truly enlightening, she says.On Thursday evening, Chang was honored with a L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science award for the insights she has had, one of which was showing that lungfish were not, as previously thought, the evolutionary link between marine life and mammals－including humans－and that the distinction belonged to the sarcopterygian lobe-finned fish, a marine life form dating back 400 million years.Related: High five: Women scientists and their storiesThere's a good place in Weishan, Dali, Southwest China's Yunnan province, where food lovers can try hundreds of snacks.

Zhou and the company's founder Blake Mycoskie went on a trip to Yunnan province late last year to donate shoes to primary school students.Zhou went to a primary school in Luquan county, Yunnan province where she measured shoe sizes for students and helped them try on shoes. She also joined the students for lunch and played games with them. The students, shy at first, later happily joined in."One for One is my favorite charity model. For every pair of shoes sold, one pair of shoes is given to a child in need," Zhou said. "My conversations with the children today are honest and direct. I am grateful for the day off so that I can experience this."Mycoskie traveled with Zhou for the donation trip. He said TOMS is giving the children not only a pair of new shoes, but memories of happiness, equality and love. He is delighted to have received Zhou's support.Zhou also designed a collaborative Goodwill Capsule Collection for TOMS, which hit shelves in early March at TOMS storefronts and on its official website. This is the actress's first foray into combining charity and fashion. She hopes to encourage more people to join the One for One project and reach out to children in China's remote areas.Through the One for One project, TOMS and its global partners have given away over 75 million pairs of new shoes to children in need over the last 12 years."Green leaf banquet" was born from the old tradition of Jingpo ethnic group's dietary culture.

Her unique traits kept her apart from other girls with the usual, popular aesthetics.But the girl, who was considered to be her family’s "ugly duckling", was spotted by French modeling scouts in Beijing, who asked her to go to Paris, turning her life upside down.Lyu Yan, born in 1981 in a small mining village in De’an county, Jiangxi province, decided to go to France despite that she could not speak French or English at that time.Her decision has led her to become one of the biggest names in the fashion world and the first supermodel to represent the beauty of Chinese women in the 21st Century.Mantou, or steamed buns, are a staple in northern China. They are readily available in most areas of the country for just 1 yuan (15 US cents), or even less depending on the size.But the mantou you find at shops and markets are very different for those made the traditional way, which sometimes can take an entire day.Methods change from place to place. In Weihai, Shandong province, for example, a special kind of yeast is essential to good mantou.The yeast is made by covering rice flour with a locally grown plant called haocao. Weihai families believe only haocao picked on the seventh day of the seventh Chinese lunar month will produce the best yeast.Work to make the buns starts in the evening and finishes at lunchtime the next day.The yeast is mixed with flour, eggs and water to create dough, which is then wrapped in a blanket and left overnight on top of a kang, a traditional earthen-brick bed found in many parts of the Chinese countryside.Smoke from a wood burner is piped through a kang and out through a chimney, creating a warm surface on which to sleep – or heat mantou dough.Overnight, the mixture will rise, and the real work begins in the morning.It takes at least two people to knead, shape and steam the buns, so relatives and friends often help out. There is usually a happy atmosphere as they laugh and joke together.Watch the video to see how one Weihai family makes traditional mantou.      My taxi pulls up at the grand door to Jiangnan University in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, under a summer sky coated in Azure blue as bright and as a baby boy's freshly-painted bedroom.

Sun Yuanqing reports from Shanghai.When it comes to men's style, there are few who are more convincing than David Beckham. Having modeled for Armani, designed for H&M and launched his own fragrance line, the former-footballer-turned-style icon is now carving out his own fashion territory with British menswear brand Kent & Curwen.Beckham visited Shanghai earlier this week bringing the brand's latest collection to the city.As a long-term partner of the brand, this time Beckham is not just the face of the brand, but also the brain behind it.His ambition is to turn this 91-year-old heritage brand into a label that reaches different generations."We are a brand that has been around for many years, but we are evolving in so many different ways and styles … We want to be a brand that hits different ages," he says.The brand showcased its 2017 autumn/winter collection, the first in collaboration with Beckham, which reinterpreted the classic cricket sweater and the rugby shirt.The brand also launched a "Shanghai Club" capsule collection of blazers and polo shirts, which is available in an exclusive pop-up store at Lane Crawford Shanghai.Daniel Kearns, creative director of Kent & Curwen who has worked with Louis Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent, has teamed up with Beckham to reinvent the brand."We want to instill in each piece that sense of heritage, even as the washing and treating give it a contemporary edge. It is about using techniques to marry the heritage of the brand with a contemporary look," Kearns says. The villagers he led only had hand tools－and explosives. He's the stuff of legend－but real. Huang Dafa is arguably an actual, modern incarnation of the ancient myth of Yu Gong.The saying yu gong yi shan－or "the old man moves mountains"－is a parable of persistence that seems foolhardy in the face of unimaginable odds.Fable says two peaks separated Yu Gong's home from the village.So, he decided to dig them away.Another elderly man mocked him. Yu Gong responded that while his descendants could dig for generations, the mountains wouldn't grow any higher.The gods were so moved by his determination that they moved the mountains for him.Huang enjoyed no such divine intervention.He had to rely on pure will.Curry Brand is returning to the region for the first time since 2018, hosting an exhibition game in Shanghai on Monday with NBA star Stephen Curry in attendance.Fans gathered at the Shanghai Gymnasium, where activities including basketball games, three-point shooting contests, and artist performances took place in view of Curry.Headlined by Curry Brand president Stephen Curry, the tour made stops in three cities – Chengdu, Shenyang, and Shanghai – from Sept 10-16.The tour included the opening of the first-ever Curry Brand House globally in Chengdu, Sichuan province, a visit to the UA brand house with a sneaker Q&A session in Shenyang, Liaoning province, and concluded with the finale in Shanghai.Launched in collaboration between UNDER ARMOUR and Stephen Curry, Curry Brand advocates for enhanced equal opportunities in youth sports globally, offering professional gear, innovative coaching, and safe facilities to underprivileged communities.During the event, UNDER ARMOUR and China's 3x3 basketball team announced the continuation of their strategic cooperation agreement from 2019, reaffirming their commitment to supporting 3x3 basketball development in China. As part of the third Shanghai Style Fashion Festival, a fashion show showcasing the city's blend of traditional and modern charm began at Yuyuan Garden on Wednesday.Hosted by Shanghai International Fashion Federation, the show was staged on the garden's Jiuqu (Zigzag) Bridge and Huxin Ting, a pavilion surrounded by a pond.Models were dressed in clothing from local maker Jixiang Yijia, a brand launched in 2012 in Shanghai and that specializes in the delicate mixing of Chinese traditional and modern styles.It is worth noting that this is the second time the Zigzag Bridge has staged a fashion show, following the French fashion house Lanvin's Spring/Summer 2021 collection show in October, 2020.To celebrate upcoming Chinese New Year, Spanish fashion company LOEWE commissioned three master jade carvers, Cheng Lei, Qiu Qijing, and Yin Xiaojin, to create three limited-edition pendants.Each pendant is meticulously hand-carved and comes with an 18K gold chain. Yin's jade carving showcases natural beauty with a pendant in the shape of a Chinese cabbage, adorned with a cricket. Chinese cabbage has a long history of cultivation and symbolizes prosperity and abundance. Qiu's pendant, in a smoky purple color, is in the shape of an eggplant and resembles a crown of success and happiness. Cheng's white jade pendant depicts a pea pod with a snail, carved from an almost flawless jade stone, symbolizing the traditional meanings of blessings, wealth, and longevity.The South Korean eyewear brand Gentle Monster released its 2024 line in optical glasses concurrently at its flagship stores in both Beijing and Seoul.

The brand's website also provides e-cards to visitors who can explore the campus online.Founded in 2011, Gentle Monster eyewear is known for trendy designs, bold colors and high-tech.Understanding China's strategic importance as a market, the US-based fashion brand Anine Bing aims to create an omni-channel experience for local customers."We are seeing that our brand mission and approach to design are resonating well with local consumers. Our Chinese consumers are sophisticated, becoming savvier, and always seeking high-quality, timeless yet stylish pieces that the Anine-Bing collection stands for," said Olivia Gentin, chief operating officer of Anine Bing."We believe the key strategy to serve our customers is to meet where they need us."We have diversified channels to gather customer feedback from China consumers, from social listening to wholesale networks. We also have a local team and trustworthy partners that provide timely market and consumer insights. And of course, we closely monitor product-level performance to navigate through her interests and feedback each season," Gentin added.Inspired by Scandinavian simplicity and American energy, Anine Bing was established by Anine and Nicolai Bing in 2012.Preparing to integrate into the local market, Anine Bing held the 2023 Fall/Winter brand campaign in Shanghai last month, partnering with iconic British supermodel Kate Moss to serve as the face of their new collection.The campaign paid tribute to timeless silhouettes with '90s-inspired details, including a modern take on rock 'n' roll dressing, which remains a central theme of the brand and met with local models and celebrities."Kate Moss has been an inspiration for the brand from the very beginning. She is the epitome of timeless beauty and iconic style, embodying everything that Anine Bing stands for as a brand." Annika Meller, co-founder, said."She's a powerful female who is a businesswoman, entrepreneur, mom, and much more – she reflects our modern-day consumer who leads a very busy life –– between work, family, and kids. Yet she looks for quality and craftsmanship in her wardrobe everyday to make her look and feel her very best," Meller added.Gentin further pointed out that the brand plans to launch the first retail store in China by early 2024.Hong Kong pop diva Karen Mok staged Karen: Reign of MOKnificence, a pop-up exhibit at UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing on Oct 12, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of her debut in showbiz.Featuring photography, video, music and installations, the show, curated by UCCA Lab, sheds light on Mok’s illustrious career; her concern for animal rights and ecological protection; and the star’s reflection on consumerism, ageism and gender issues.A two-time winner of Best Female Mandarin Singer at Taiwan’s Golden Melody Awards, Mok has released more than 30 music albums. She is also an accomplished actress, having starred in over 50 films and TV series.The exhibit is free to the public and runs until Oct 18.How an ethnic group lives their modern life in the meadowsThe Ewenki people are one of the 56 ethnic groups in China, and there is a branch of them called Shilu Ewenki people, named after their reindeer herding skills. The Shilu Ewenki people, who lived in the Aoluguya Ewenki ethnic township of Genhe city, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, are currently the only ethnic group in China that raises reindeer and preserves the "reindeer culture".In 2003, ecological immigrants from Aoluguya Ewenki ethnic township relocated to the western suburbs of Genhe city. With the continuous relocation of their residences, this ethnic group, which used to live by hunting with reindeer on the mountains, gradually integrated into modern society from a simpler state of production and life.According to Wang Chengshi, Party Secretary of Genhe city, the local government has introduced a series of supportive policies to ensure the safety and stability of downhill hunters. Especially since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, all levels of local governments have focused on solving the problems of food, school, transportation, housing, and medical treatment for Ewenki hunters, and promoting industrial development and poverty alleviation.They strut down the catwalk, svelte figures displaying the latest designs with cool, confident looks on their faces to match.The model quartet attracts more than 100 million views and over 3 million fans with their online fashion videos alone, proving that, at an average age of 71 years, when it comes to style, substance and zing, turning silver can increasingly show the way amid youth-dominated digital trends at home and abroad."We wanted to leverage what we felt we're good at — our sense of style, positive perspective on life and healthy living — to show people, via the latest communications platforms, that it's completely possible to age gracefully and attractively," says Wang Nianwen, a retired teacher who, at 77, is the oldest of the four.Together with Wang Xinghuo, 73, Lin Wei, 68, and Sun Yang, 67, the retiree from Beijing is part of the Shishang Nainai (Fashionable Grandmas), a popular group on online platforms like short-video site Douyin producing inspiring content that is helping many to face the challenges of an aging society.The close friends met two decades ago in a modeling workshop and found they held similar interests in an industry that allowed them to be kept busy after retirement, going on to put together the modeling videos — which are also tagged under the group's online English name, Glamma Beijing — that have attracted impressive numbers of viewers in the past four years.Lin was a professional basketball player who went on to study medicine and became a nurse. Standing at 1.8 meters, the statuesque senior is the tallest of the group members, who are all above 1.7 meters."We want to show other elderly people that they can lead meaningful lives like this," Lin says."We also want the message to reach young people, that they can look forward to old age positively, and that they can create a bright future together with the elderly. If you are positive, your life will shine."Shooting videos can reflect our real state of mind and body from all angles. Accepting aging as a natural process, accepting my wrinkles, my gray hair — all this helps us value the fulfillment of daily life."Sun, a teacher who also specialized in the English language, had switched to foreign trade in the clothing sector."I was involved in exports, such as Japanese kimonos and bags. My work was somewhat related to fashion, but I mainly dealt with raw material processing and didn't participate in design. Pursuing fashion was purely a personal preference," she says."None of us had any real experience in fashion. The reason why I joined a modeling class initially was that after retiring, I didn't know what to do and wanted to find something enjoyable to engage in."Sun's daughter-in-law, Zhang He, helps the team shoot and post its videos, on top of liaising with enterprises and industry groups which want to work with the seniors to connect them with customers who are fans.Other than product referrals for the quartet's viewers who are interested in what they wear, carry and use, Zhang also helps involve the senior models in charitable causes as part of their outreach efforts.Sun says: "In general, we do about four livestreaming sessions a month. Those can include presenting and showcasing what we feel are affordable clothing, bags and skincare products."Any funds we generate in promoting products go toward supporting the activities."Wang Xinghuo, who worked in a State-owned enterprise after studying accounting, says a sense of purpose is crucial in sustaining their interests as elderly stakeholders of an aging society."Enriching yourself, like reading more to increase your knowledge, will also help you deal with the development around you, tuning your heart to the outside world," she says."It may be difficult to put yourself completely in the position of the elderly, the challenges they are facing and issues they are dealing with. Tolerance and empathy help."The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, has collected three pieces from celebrated contemporary jewelry artists, including two Chinese designers, Wallace Chan and Feng Ji.The objects are a pair of sapphire tassel earrings by Christian and Yasmin Hemmerle, Forever Dancing: Bright Star by Wallace Chan, and Blue Anthurium by Feng Ji whose house label is Feng J. These are the first works by Wallace Chan and Feng J to enter a US museum collection.The museum in a statement says the new acquisition will be on view in the Rita J and Stanley H Kaplan Family Foundation Gallery for Jewelry when it reopens in spring 2024 following  renovation. The gallery will showcase approximately 150 pieces from the museum's jewelry collection, which includes ornaments crafted over 6,000 years and reflects cultures from around the globe. The three newest high jewels will be part of the gallery's permanent collection."These three gifts are transformational for our outstanding jewelry collection. They represent the best of what is being created in fine jewelry today and will make a great statement about 21st-century creativity, design, materials and craftsmanship," said Emily Stoehrer, the Rita J. Kaplan and Susan B. Kaplan curator of jewelry."Feng J's jewelry blends traditional craftsmanship with 21st century innovation. A brilliant colorist, she paints with gemstones," she added.In the Blue Anthurium, Feng J uses colored stones in a "floating" setting to make the metal disappear around the gems. This technique is enhanced by the delicate way the artist applies color – through electro-forming – to white gold.Another piece by Feng J was acquired in 2022 by Les Arts Decoratifs in Paris. Feng Ji is the first Chinese jewelry artist whose work has been collected by the art museum.Feng, 37, started to learn Chinese painting and calligraphy at 5 in her hometown Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province. And later learn product design at the China Academy of Art. In 2008, she went to learn jewelry design at University of the Arts London.After graduation, she went to the Gemological Institute of America-the world's leading authority on diamonds, colored stones and pearls-to join its graduate gemologist program. There, she gained both technical expertise and practical skills to evaluate gemstones.Later, she went to the Gublin Academy in Switzerland. And in 2016 she was admitted to the Haute Ecole de Joaillerie in Paris, where most jewelry craftsmen of the luxury brands such as Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Chanel, Dior and LVMH come from.The configuration of dual brand principals is not common among the array of independent designer brands in China.However, FFIXXED STUDIOS and RE: by MAISON SANS TITRE have successfully struck a harmonious balance by embracing the diverse contrasts between their two partners.To celebrate unofficial Valentine's Day on May 20 (the number 520 sounds similar to "I love you" in Chinese), these two brands, which both have a decadelong history, have joined forces with renowned luxury department store Lane Crawford to unveil exclusive collections.Fiona Lau, who studied fashion design at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, and Kain Picken, who studied fine arts at Victorian College of the Arts, are the founders of FFIXXED STUDIOS. They are both fashion designers and artists.Lau is generally more involved with the production, while Picken handles media relations and other projects.Lau and Picken started working together while living in Berlin. At that time, Picken was focused on his art projects, while Lau was working for a fashion brand called Bless. They were both intrigued by each other's work and began collaborating on a side project for an exhibition to explore mutual interests in fashion and art together. And when they relocated to China, they founded the menswear and womenswear brand Ffixxed together in 2012."I believe that both of us are indispensable to the brand, as it has grown through our ongoing dialogue," says Lau.Picken says: "While we have also many differences, even opposing views and perspectives, we still share some core values about creativity which allows us to explore different ideas and bring them together in a cohesive way. We also have very different personalities but this difference helps to create a balance between us."Due to Picken's background in art, with a specialization in sculpture, and Lau's experience interning at various fashion brands, their creations embody both an artistic sensibility and a practical, comfortable appeal.Their brand won first place at the International Woolmark Awards Asia with a blanket-inspired women's garment in 2013.An urge to make things easier for his wife has surprisingly changed the career trajectory of Jin Yi. With a measuring tape and a pair of scissors by his side practically all the time at his workshop in Suzhou, East China's Jiangsu province, Jin, in his 30s, is committed to restoring the glamour of the qipao, a traditional Chinese dress also known as cheongsam, which features a form-fitting cut, high neckline and the slit on the side of the skirt."We've been extremely busy after Spring Festival, with orders for custom-made qipao piling up," says Jin, from Xushuguan town, Suzhou."Normally, we promised to deliver goods in 10 to 15 days, but now it has to be in 40 to 50 days," he adds.Jin says he and his team have been working for more than 12 hours every day.When Jin receives an order, he goes to great lengths to get to know his customer's needs before coming up with pertinent style, color scheme, embroidery and fabric."The colors and patterns should vary with different occasions," Jin explains.For example, a bride would be recommended to wear a bright red qipao with peony and butterfly images, while her mother would be advised to dress in a darker red with more shiny flowers."After all is settled, I need to communicate and work with master tailors before delivering a qipao," Jin explains.The prices vary from 1,500 yuan ($218) to 8,000 yuan, depending on fabrics and embroidering methods.Lichun, or Start of Spring, is the first of the traditional Twenty-Four Solar Terms, encompassing the beginning of all things, rebirth and heralding a new cycle.Shuowen Jiezi offers an explanation of Chinese characters and words written during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220), and is considered one of the earliest dictionaries in the world. The classic text denotes that chun (spring), is originally a verb that embodies the meaning of "sprout".The explanatory notes conjure up a lively annotation of the word: The grass feels the call of the sun, vibrates in response to the time, pushes the earth away, and starts to grow.Lichun falls on Saturday this year, and was the namesake Spring Festival in ancient times. The first day of the Lunar New Year was called "yuanri (the starting day)", or "New Year's Day". After China adopted the Gregorian calendar in the early 1900s, the term "New Year's Day" was assigned to Jan 1, and "Spring Festival" was given to the first day of the Lunar New Year.Despite being robbed of the grand Spring Festival title, lichun, a product of an ancient farming civilization, takes on an extremely important role in the foundation of China's traditional culture.The first solar term has an intimidatingly long, swirling list of confusing nicknames: yingchun (greeting spring), songchun (sending spring), dachun (beating spring), yaochun (biting spring), tachun (outing in spring) and taochun (begging for spring). The different verbs in front of the word chun all reveal the joy and eagerness for the arrival of spring."I have never seen a solar term with so many descriptions as lichun. It is almost like a chorus of spring symphony," says folklore expert You Guoqing.Hermes has recently released a new men's collection that holds a blend of practicality and longing.Cashmere and flannel, lamb wool and different textured leather gently caress the body. The design pays attention to the everyday chic and homage to at-home relaxation with, for example, a hidden pocket on the leather back of a pea coat serving as a symbol of patchwork care done to preserve a well-loved piece of clothing. Colors such as charcoal, gravel, fog, caramel, brown, coffee, camel, navy, ivory and black, reveal muted tones that grow in richness and speak to one another, shot through with a flash of light, intense as winter light.The hand of the craftsman filled these clothes with stories through braided leathers and knits that carry the trace of multiple lives, in the palimpsests of scarves on knitwear, in fragments of leather on a jacket, in an Irish cable knit born in color and asserted in stitching, in framing effects and the silk yoke of a cardigan.Coco Chanel once said: "Slavish followers of inner beauty, who completely ignore dressing up, are also superficial." Jewelry has always lit up people's life, becoming a statement of their taste and thoughts.The advancement of the manufacturing industry and the invention of new materials since the 19th century have greatly prompted the design and production of jewelry. Compound metals and artificial gems replaced the precious and natural ones and, thanks to that, new waves took place in jewelry design and more people could afford the glittering ornaments.These changes can be seen at Imprint, an exhibition now ongoing at Tsinghua University Art Museum, which reviews the evolution of jewels and aesthetics throughout the 20th century.On show are mainly brooches and other types of jewelry made between the 1930s and '80s, featuring Trifari, Coro and Boucher and other brands involving vintage pieces that are highly sought after by collectors today. They are from Zheng Yingyan who has accumulated a collection of vintage jewels throughout the years.The exhibition will last until March 26.The village of Beiji is China's northernmost as its name suggests. Beiji means North Pole.Situated in the city of Mohe, Heilongjiang province, it is transformed, like clockwork, into a winter wonderland, receiving thousands of tourists from across the country.Winter lasts for about eight months every year in the village, from October to May. During its coldest time, temperatures can plummet to-50 C. A reliable power supply is vital for the village to operate in, and survive, the long and harsh season.Before 2007, the village's energy was produced by unreliable diesel-powered generators and villagers would often have to deal with power outages.The situation changed in 2007 when the village was connected to the State Grid and the Beiji Village Power Supply Station was set up.As technicians at the station, Ma Guojun and Dai Hongbin are in charge of inspecting and maintaining the power supply and equipment in the village. Overhead and buried cable lines, stretching hundreds of kilometers, have to be checked regularly.Only 10 hours remained before Typhoon Muifa was due to make landfall in eastern China. Su Dike and his teammates decided to head to Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, from Ningbo to "encounter" the storm.Their car hadn't been on the road long before they encountered tire trouble and they had to immediately rent a car and move their equipment in the rainstorm. They finally made it to Zhoushan and found a good position to record the typhoon.There were few people or cars on the road when they witnessed trees falling down under the force of strong winds and street lamps blinking out in the heavy rain. After some 10 minutes, the rain suddenly became lighter and the wind turned softer, meaning that they were now in the eye of the typhoon."While chasing the storm, we collected a lot of data that can reflect the microscopic characteristics of typhoons. We hope the information can help people to better understand such storms," Su says in his video, recording this thrilling trip."People may think we — storm chasers — are looking for excitement, but we actually shoulder the responsibility for each chase, as we need to get to the deepest point of a storm to get first-hand data that will help us to deal with future (climate) change," he explains.In the past three years, the 21-year-old and his fellow storm chasers have visited over a dozen provinces, including Heilongjiang, Shandong and Jilin, racking up a total distance of over 30,000 kilometers.For them, most natural events — a storm, clouds, sunset, a rainbow, lightning, hail or solar corona — provide their own reward. In addition to storms and strong convection, they chase the first snow, cold snaps, floods and dust storms.As a senior student at Communication University of China, majoring in photography, Su has used almost all of his spare time chasing the wind. He is also a popular meteorological science video blogger on Bilibili, a video-sharing platform popular with young Chinese. He posts videos of his storm-chasing adventures and uses them to try and popularize climate science.Hong Kong actress Rosamund Kwan was once considered the most beautiful woman in the metropolitan. She is also a jewelry collector of great passion and discernment.Dozens of vintage pieces by renowned jewelers and designers in her belonging will go under the hammer in Hong Kong with part of the proceeds to benefit charitable purposes. Highlights include a diamond ring featuring a 12.46-carat ruby and a jadeite carving showing Guanyin bodhisattva, the goddess of compassion and mercy.They were exhibited at Christie's previews of autumn auctions in Beijing and Shanghai. The items will be sold at Christie's sales on Nov 28.The multifaceted Paris-meets-Tokyo brand Maison Kitsune's first boutique store in Southwest China opened on Oct 21 in Chengdu city, Sichuan province, bringing a new experience for the fashion senses.The store is located in Chengdu IFS International Financial Center, a prime location in the city's central business district. The interior of the boutique has been carefully designed to lead consumers through an exploration of Maison Kitsune's aesthetic connection with Chengdu.Located on the second floor of the IFS Mall, the 102-square-meter store features a futuristic sculpture of a fox at the entrance and a vibrant orange tone that highlights the brand's passion and desire for an artistic life.With geometric lines and soft light, the bright and eye-catching shop windows create an elegant atmosphere of French minimalism. Besides, the overall space is designed to interpret the aesthetics of Paris-Tokyo with modern concepts.Maison Kitsune is looking for different approaches to communicate with the local culture and continue dialogue with the public. It has launched a Chengdu City Exclusive Collection to celebrate the first store opening in the southwest region.The design combines Chengdu's signature panda head with the brand's iconic fox head to create a versatile unisex collection, including T-shirts, sweatshirts, caps and canvas bags, meeting the needs of daily wear in multiple scenarios and bring out the relaxed and joyful Chengdu culture vividly."There is no doubt that China is a very important market," says Hua Zhener, the chief operation officer of the brand. "When entering each market, Maison Kitsune will make adjustments according to some characteristics of this market. No matter from the design elements and details of stores, each store presents its own characteristics and differences from other cities".In addition, a wide range of products from Maison Kitsune's new co-branded collection and Fall/Winter 2022 collection are also available in the store, waiting for consumers to embark on a casual, relaxed and modern journey in Chengdu.Alexandre Dam, the brand's CEO in China, claims: "In the coming months, Kitsune will also develop activities, with an exciting upgrade of our food offers in Cafe Kitsune Xintiandi, as well as music activities, with events that are planned throughout the year (Kitsune Superseries, Kitsune Club Nights). Indeed, while our fashion activity is starting to be recognized, we still have so much to say as a true lifestyle brand and share the brand's Art de Vivre with our beloved community".Behind a nondescript door on Anhua Road in Shanghai's Changning district lies a sprawling 600-square-meter fashion studio that has been around for more than 20 years.Here, at Hanart's studio for high-end, tailor-made cheongsams, also known as qipao, master artisans can be found hand-stitching exquisite dresses alongside creations that have been around for dozens of years.Founded by Chu Hongsheng in 2000, this studio is the heart of Hanart's operations in China and one of the reasons why this classic dress has been making waves around the world.Born in 1918, Chu had devoted himself to crafting cheongsams for more than 80 years until he died in 2017. A recipient of the Shanghai International Fashion Federation's Lifetime Achievement Award in the field of advanced customization, Chu was renowned in the fashion world for his skills in creating highly customized cheongsams and traditional men's clothing.Chu made at least 5,000 cheongsams in his lifetime, many of which were worn by celebrities and artists, including the popular Shanghai actress Hu Die and Soong Mei-ling, the second wife of Chiang Kai-shek.The Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, refers to the area in the northwestern part of Yunnan province featuring three rivers:Jinsha (upstream of the Yangtze)Lancang (known as Mekong outside of China) andNujiang (known as Salween in Myanmar)They run roughly parallel, north to south, for more than 170 kilometers. The shortest distance between the Jinsha and Lancang rivers is 66 km, while between Lancang and Nujiang it is less than 19 km.With an altitude ranging from 760 meters to 6,740 meters above sea level, the site includes 15 protected areas categorized into eight geographical clusters.Here are 10 iconic species found in the area:01 YUNNAN SNUB-NOSED MONKEYThe Yunnan snub-nosed monkey lives at the highest altitude of any primate, apart from humans. The primary forests, 3,000 meters above sea level in Yunnan Baima Snow Mountain National Nature Reserve, are its main habitat. Recognized by its pink, pouting lips and "punk hairstyle", it's a social animal with strong family bonds and is considered to be the "elf of the snow mountains".A Chinese-style garden complete with pavilions, a pond, ornamental rocks and bonsai, is now open on the roof of Shanghai Museum East.The roof garden opened simultaneously with the exhibition The Resonance of Wood and Stone, featuring scholar's rocks and Shanghai-style penjing (miniature potted landscapes) on Sept 6, which also marked the launch of the new Jiangnan Gallery.Located on the fourth floor, the gallery is dedicated to the exhibition of the craftsmanship, aesthetics and lifestyle in the lower range of the Yangtze River Delta, known in Chinese as Jiangnan, which has remained an important center for the Chinese civilization for thousands of years.For several millennia, Chinese literati admired the natural landscapes as the embodiment of their spiritual ideals. The appreciation of ornament rocks was born from such spiritual pursuit. People picked rocks for their aesthetic values, often favoring those that look like the mountains and cliffs. They would have matching wood stands, shelves or pots made for each rock, and placed them on the desk, curio rack in their studios or in the garden.As visitors step into the atrium of the gallery, they will find a series of scholar's rocks on exhibition on one side, and on the other side a set of classical Chinese furniture with stationery, arranged to look like an ancient Chinese scholar's study. A long table stands in the middle with a penjing installation on the top, consisting of rocks, orchids and moss, emulating the natural mountainous landscape."Collecting and appreciating rocks is a long tradition in China," Yang Zhigang, former director of Shanghai Museum, wrote in his preface to the exhibition Elegant Friends for a Lofty Studio: Scholar's Rocks Presented by Ms Hu Kemin, in 2020. "Scholar's rocks, or gongshi in Chinese, displayed as part of the accouterments in a learned man's study, have found favor with generations of the literati."According to Shi Yuan, head of the handicraft department of Shanghai Museum, since Hu's donation of her collection of scholar's rocks in 2018 and the 2020 exhibition at Shanghai Museum, the museum has developed into an important platform for collection, research and showcasing of traditional Chinese ornamental rocks.In 2004, the China National Academy of Painting set up mentoring workshops so that its resources would benefit artists outside Beijing.The academy encouraged resident artists to open studios and take on students — especially younger-generation artists outside the capital — and help them brush up their skills and improve their artistry.So far, around 40 artists have operated workshops under the mechanism, some of whom are not members of the academy and are running the studios by invitation.An exhibition now on at the academy marks this two-decade endeavor with a display of the latest work produced by the mentors and their students.Cheng Dali, an ink artist and mentor, says the mentoring system has allowed him and his students to think about ways of carrying on the xieyi tradition, a spontaneous and expressive way of painting that transcribes the idea or the spirit of things, not their appearance.Sculptor Deng Ke says she is pleased to have been able to share her experience with everyone who has attended the workshops, and who has come from all across the country, no matter the material with which they are working.A consummate artist, according to a Chinese saying, is well-versed in painting, calligraphy, poetry and seal engraving. The elite of classic Chinese painting are often fine engravers and seal designers, such as Wu Changshuo, Qi Baishi and Zhang Daqian. Even in a digital age when handwriting has become much less used, a group of people and artists still stick to this tradition of having their own engraved seals.Jinghua Seal Engraving Society is holding the second installment of their Seal Engraving Art Biennial at the capital's Haidian Art Museum to show the latest developments in this unique niche of classical art, and meanwhile celebrating the 75th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.It gathers works of eminent and younger-generation engravers and ink artists who, also at a forum after the opening of the event, discussed the status quo and future of the form, sharing views on how it can be better integrated into the modern cultural landscape and people's life.The Mid-Autumn Festival is a traditional celebration of appreciating the full moon and family reunions. In ancient times, its festive mood was captured in poetry and art.Let's explore the unique charms of the festival through these literary and artistic works.Nonprofit organization Don't Eat Friends launched a charity art sale on Thursday in Beijing, in collaboration with artist Ji Yali, to raise funds and awareness for animal welfare.The Chinese nonprofit animal protection organization frequently hosts art events, including concerts and exhibitions, to promote its message of protecting animals. Ji Yali, an ambassador for the organization, has been actively involved in urban stray animal rescue efforts since 2009 and is known for her animal-inspired paintings. In 2022, she published an illustrated book titled Guesthouse No.11 and donated all royalties to animal protection organizations.For this charity event, Ji contributed her paintings and related merchandise for sale. All proceeds will be donated to the charity organization to fund medical treatment and sterilization for stray dogs and cats. The initiative also aims to raise public awareness about stray animals and encourage more people to engage in animal welfare efforts.Female artists with physical challenges display skills and craftsmanship, as their contributions bring communities together, Li Yingxue reports in Paris.Xing Chunyan and her colleagues were offering a demonstration of traditional wooden comb craftsmanship, captivating an audience keen on understanding the artistry behind these delicate pieces at the China Cultural Center in Paris. The combs, adorned with hand-inlaid shells, shimmered under the lights, showcasing a level of craftsmanship that is both practical and beautiful.Xing, 49, who's physically challenged, carefully demonstrated the intricate process of fitting the individual teeth into the comb — an innovation that allows damaged teeth to be replaced, unlike older designs carved from a single block of wood.Amid the vibrant backdrop of the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, a quiet yet significant cultural exchange took place. On Sept 3, the China Cultural Center in Paris opened an exhibition titled Beautiful Crafts Workshop Blooming in Paris to celebrate the artistry of women with physical challenges.The three-day event showcases nearly 300 handcrafted pieces from more than 30 "Beautiful Crafts" workshops across China, including Guangdong, Shandong and Hebei provinces. The collection features an array of traditional crafts including silk figurines, cloth tigers, fishskin paintings, wooden combs, carvings and ceramics.Sculptor molds the fragile beauty of white marble to transform it into masterpieces, Yang Feiyue reports.Walking along the imperial road behind the Hall of Preserving Harmony in the Forbidden City, one will come across a massive rectangular stone — flanked by steps — on which nine soaring dragons amid mountains and waves are vividly carved.The stone has been lying around for more than six centuries in the historical site in downtown Beijing and has witnessed the comings and goings of generations of imperial families.Behind its royal grandeur lies a profound history of stone carving in Dashiwo town, 90 kilometers away in the city's southwestern Fangshan district.The town abounds in marble resources, including the white marble that has been widely used in royal palaces, gardens and mausoleums for its bright, elegant appearance and smooth texture, as well as for its durability and symbolism of wealth and power."A considerable number of historical buildings were built with white marble from here," says Liu Peng, an inheritor who has been practicing the art of white marble carving, a Beijing intangible cultural heritage, in the town, for over two decades.In August, Liu, who just turned 60, was added to the list of national outstanding individuals in intangible cultural heritage protection by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. It has given him more incentive to carry on his cause of finishing a couple of textbooks on white marble history, culture and craftsmanship."The information used to be so fragmented at the beginning, but now everything seems to be falling into place and I've got to put down the details and piece those bits of theories and experiences together for the craft to pass down," Liu says.Marvelous Realism, the first and largest exhibition of African photography in Asia, opened on Aug 30 at Fotografiska in Shanghai.Co-presented by Fotografiska and the KT Wong Foundation, the exhibition, curated by Ghanaian-British writer Ekow Eshun, brings together 16 established and emerging artists using photography and film as a means to envisage contemporary African cultural identity as a state of ongoing possibility.According to Lady Linda Wong Davies, founder and chairman of the KT Wong Foundation, after having a home for 30 years in South Africa, she has seen the remarkable development and progress that Africa has achieved with the help of China. However, there is still very little understanding of China's culture in Africa and vice versa.The philanthropist and art patron of Chinese descent who has been committed to fostering bridges between China and the wider world through her foundation then decided to initiate and create an exhibition of African photography, which she deemed as "the easiest and fastest way" to show the Chinese audience what contemporary Africa, beyond animals and starving children, really is.Marvelous Realism runs through Dec 1.If you want to go:10:30 am-11 pm, Tuesday to Sunday, Fotografiska, No. 127 Guangfu Road, Jing'an district, ShanghaiExhibition of paintings of court women reveals changing attitudes toward gender and development, Wang Kaihao reports.In the late Eastern Han Dynasty (24-220) period, Cai Wenji, a talented poet and musician, was captured by nomads during a war, and gave birth to two children far away from home.Years later, when the woman finally got the chance to return home, she faced a tough choice, as the journey back meant saying farewell to her children. She shared this poignant experience through her art, becoming a symbol of resilience and the enduring power of culture.Centuries earlier, when a Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24) emperor was frozen in his tracks by an approaching bear, his entourage was too frightened to attempt a rescue, apart from one person: Feng Jieyu, a heroic concubine, who stepped forward to protect him.The actions of these women earned them honor, but they had to face dilemmas as well. Names of many other honorable and heroic women have also been remembered down the generations.Images of these icons are now on display in a new exhibition by the Palace Museum in Beijing, Timeless Beauties: Figure Paintings from Across the Ages in the Palace Museum Collection.Eighty-three pieces of art celebrating the spirit and beauty of Chinese women can be seen in the Wenhua Dian (Hall of Literary Brilliance) in the former imperial palace, which is also known as the Forbidden City. Thanks to vivid artistic portrayals, centuries after these women died, their legends continue to resonate and inspire.Full contribution made by Lin Huiyin highlighted in exhibition detailing the indelible mark she made on China, Hou Chenchen and Zhu Xingxin report in Taiyuan.For young Lin Huiyin (1904-1955), it truly was a case of being in the right place at the wrong time. The 20-year-old had traveled all the way from China to Pennsylvania, United States, no mean feat in the early 1920s, to attend the US state's eponymous university.Lin's designs were clear: to realize a long-held desire to study architecture. However, there was one big problem: She was a woman.Despite her obvious, laudable ambitions, the university's architecture program under its school of fine arts summarily rejected her application on those very grounds.However, its school of fine arts was a little more relaxed, and Lin would enroll there, completing all her courses over the years — including compulsory ones in architecture — with one notable exception. The university's regulations did not countenance women doing live figure drawing, on the grounds that it would expose them to the male body.It would not be until 10 years later, in 1934, that more enlightened attitudes would prevail and women were able to take their rightful place in the architecture program, but of course for Lin it was too late.Lin is widely known in China, not for her architectural talent, but as a prominent figure in novels and television dramas that depict her as a poet and as a romantic heroine.In July, a century after Lin began her studies in Pennsylvania, her granddaughter, Yu Kui, arrived in Shanxi province, where her late grandmother did research, with a special document in hand: the architectural degree for which Lin had worked so assiduously, but which she had been denied. In May, recognizing this historic injustice, the University of Pennsylvania publicly and posthumously bestowed on Lin the degree she so richly deserved.One reason Yu had brought the prized document was to deliver it to the Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin Academic Document Exhibition in Foguang Temple, which is located in Wutai county of Xinzhou city, and to the Changjiang Art Museum in Taiyuan city, both in Shanxi province. The temple played a key role in Lin's studies, as it was the subject of a wellknown architectural survey she undertook with her husband, Liang Sicheng (1901-1972). Also on display in both exhibitions is a manuscript of hers dated June 29, 1937, that details the work.Nympheas, or water lilies, depicted by Claude Monet are among the most iconic painted images in history.When Monet designed and constructed that botanic garden and tranquil pond at his residence in Giverny, in the 1890s, he probably didn't anticipate that he would create a colossal work of nympheas paintings spanning three decades until his death, and that the species blooming on the reflective surface of water would become a timeless motif in art and much beloved by people around the world.It is believed that Monet captured the image of some 300 water lilies, some of which were done in his 80s. He was able to present the vibrancy of plants, the changes of light in open air and the subtlety of the changing atmosphere of the environment — the garden and the pond.Monet concentrated his gaze on the surface of the pond, eschewing traditional perspective. This led to a dazzling, disintegrating, and for the time radically daring, vision. Monet's water lilies become one of the primary reasons for visiting a show or a museum, not only because he showed the beauty and vigor of nature but also because people are touched by the efforts of an aging artist rarely satisfied with what he painted, to challenge his physical limits with the power of the brush and the mind.The bulk of Monet's water lilies have been at museums of repute in various countries. And for a private collection to offer one for sale is guaranteed to draw attention. One such artwork will appear at a Christie's sale in Hong Kong, in late September.Nympheas, painted around 1897 and 1899, about 1 meter in width, will be shown in Shanghai this weekend.Since the mid-1980s, Zhang Peili has been at the forefront of contemporary art scene. He produces work, teaches at his alma mater, the China Academy of Art in Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, and even once managed an art museum.Zhang's wide-ranging experience defines his working method, and has led to a productive output that includes paintings, videos, sculptures, installations, performance art, and mixed media.Marvelous Realism, the first and largest exhibition of African photography in Asia, opened on Aug 30 at Fotografiska in Shanghai.Curated by Ghanaian-British writer Ekow Eshun and co-presented by Fotografiska and the KT Wong Foundation, the exhibition brings together 16 established and emerging artists using photography and film as a means to envisage contemporary African cultural identity as a state of ongoing possibility.According to Eshun, Africa has long been closely associated with famine and poverty owing to the portrayal of Western news and documentaries, which has created the stereotype of the continent. However, the continent brims with vitality and imagination through the lens of African artists and artists of African descent. Some works featured at Marvelous Realism are specific to Africa, whereas others respond to universal questions that can resonate with a global audience.Vincent van Gogh arrived in Paris in 1886 to join his brother and gallery manager Theo, where the unknown painter became fascinated with its vibrant social scenes as the cultural and art center of Europe.During his two-year stay in Paris before relocating to southern France, Van Gogh gained new insights into modern art. The enthusiastic Parisian lifestyle inspired bright colors in his works, a transition from the dark tones and moodiness he portrayed during his time in Amsterdam.Among the sites he painted included Asnieres, a village north of Paris along the Seine, which was a retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. There, Van Gogh deeply embraced nature's colors and a leisurely, peaceful lifestyle.Meanwhile, he attempted to individualize his artistic approach by depicting the plants, flowers and the sun's radiance, rather than the farmers he had previously focused on.This attempt is revealed in Les canots amarres (Moored Canoes) in which Van Gogh illustrated a serene riverside scene in Asnieres of moored boats, blooming flowers and the cloudy sky. His brushstrokes in this piece exhibit a transformative stage in his career.The landscape of 1887 also reflects his introduction to Japanese woodcuts in Paris, of which the cropping composition and the color contrasts were adopted and explored by Van Gogh in establishing his distinctive painting style.The painting is being exhibited in Beijing and will travel to Shanghai on Sept 7 and 8 before going under the hammer at Christie's auction house in Hong Kong on Sept 26.Over decades, ink painting has evolved to integrate traditional East with modern West, Lin Qi reports.City walks are trending among urban travelers these days due to being a low-cost, relaxing transportation mode that saves people from the anxieties of hurrying from one tourist destination to another.Several decades ago, Gu Yizhou and five artists from the Beijing Fine Art Academy who specialized in traditional Chinese ink painting conducted staged city walks from east to west across Beijing.The tour, lasting a couple of months, was initiated from an undertaking of importance — a painting that offered a renewed panoramic view of the capital city in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 1959.The Spring of National Capital, done in the traditional long scroll format, unfolds to 46 meters long. It replicates the blooming spring, documenting the prosperous construction scenes of New China, including landmark architecture along Chang'an Avenue and major industrial projects at the time.The painting has been exhibited several times to evoke nostalgic feelings among viewers, particularly the elderly who recognize the capital's changes over time.The Spring of National Capital has joined dozens of other paintings from the collection of the Beijing Fine Art Academy at Picturesque Land, an exhibition running until Oct 13 at the National Centre for the Performing Arts, one of the landmarks of Chang'an Avenue.This time they are on show to mark the country's 75th anniversary.The Beijing Fine Art Academy was founded in 1957 with a commitment to the research and reform of Chinese art, especially traditional ink painting. Since its founding, it has gathered leading figures, such as Qi Baishi (1864-1957), the founding honorary director.Traditional skill of lacquer tappers faces challenging times as interest saps away, report Wang Qian and Yang Jun in Guiyang.Deep in the forests of Wumeng Mountain in Southwest China's Guizhou province, lacquer tapper Yu Zhongping climbs a tree using a hard leaf to collect the extracted viscous sap through a notch cut into the bark.From May to September every year, Yu, 64, is busy harvesting lacquer, applied as a coating to protect and decorate a variety of everyday items, like bowls and furniture. When the lacquer hardens, it polymerizes and forms a protective surface that repels water and resists corrosion. As an art form originating from China, the amazing material is one of the earliest "plastics" used by humans."I still utilize the traditional way of collecting lacquer and will keep practicing it, which has become a part of my life," Yu from Cengtai town in the city of Bijie, Guizhou, says.He adds that tapping is more than a business; it is a craft that needs to be inherited.Several kilometers away, Yu Zhongping and his elder cousin Yu Zhongding, 73, leave home around 6 am and return at night during harvesting season. With their grandfathers being experts in the craft, they have been lacquer tappers since they were teenagers.Before tapping, the first step is to attach climbing slings to the trunks, which takes about a month.Tappers then gouge small diagonal grooves into the trees to build up its immunity and ensure a more milky and yellowish sap, according to Yu Zhongding. After 10 days, the initial tapping is conducted.A tree can have 10 horizontal incisions in the bark for a harvesting season with the best quality of lacquer collected at notches from the third to the eighth, the senior tapper concludes.The first retrospective exhibition of French artist Georges Mathieu (1921-2012) in China is going on at the Long Museum West Bund in Shanghai from Aug 27 to Oct 27.Founder of lyrical abstraction in 1946, Mathieu was one of the few European painters who made a significant impact on the abstract expressionist scene in New York, according to Wang Wei, director of the Long Museum. He used to paint in front of the public, and these public painting sessions ushered in performance art, and from the 1970s onward, contributed to the emergence of graffiti.As the largest exhibition of Mathieu in Asia, the exhibition showcases more than 80 paintings, covering more than four decades of his creative activity, offering a unique opportunity to explore his prolific body of work.Mathieu grew up in Northern France and Versailles and studied English at the University of Lille. He began experimenting with painting at the age of 21 and turned to abstract in 1944, in order to break free from traditional constraints to assert a new-found freedom, embracing color, impulsive graphic lines, spontaneous pictorial writing and raw materials.He began to create large-scale frescoes, spreading up to nine meters wide in 1952, and invited photographers and cameramen, and members of the public to record and witness his creative process.Mathieu's paintings are instantly recognizable for their calligraphic lyricism and exceptional precision. Despite the speed and spontaneity with which they are executed, every stroke is purposeful, according to art critic Antje Kramer-Mallordy.Claude Viallat's solo show sees his return to city where his style made an impact on art scene, Deng Zhangyu reports.More than two decades ago, in 1999 to be precise, French abstract artist Claude Viallat held his solo show at Kunming Museum in Kunming, Yunnan province, at a time when most Chinese artists rarely had opportunities to travel overseas and experience contemporary Western art. During this show, Viallat drew a Chinese dragon with a pencil on a poster.Twenty-five years later, Viallat's work returns to Kunming at the Contemporary Gallery Kunming, directed by Nie Rongqing, who was also the designer of Viallat's 1999 show and the show's posters. Nie is also the owner of the dragon drawing which he collected at that time."I never imagined that my gallery will hold Viallat's show. Everything seems predestined," says Nie.Squares, circles and triangles of vibrant colors neatly line up on the canvases, forming orderly compositions of mathematical allure that enchant and mystify viewers in equal measure.Those geometric shapes, by Uruguayan artist Carlos Presto, are close to each other but carefully separated with small gaps between them, evoking the social distance that people had to practice when the COVID-19 pandemic was ravaging the world.Presto's paintings are on display at his solo exhibition Games of Illusion at the Uruguayan Art Space in Beijing's 798 art district until Sept 20, offering Chinese audiences a window into the Latin American country's contemporary art.Mostly selected from the artist's Virus Series, with works reflecting the experience during the pandemic, representing in different forms an analysis and recreation of social estrangement and the search for a reunion, said Uruguayan gallerist Diana Saravia, who co-curated the exhibition with Chinese curator Zhang Siyong."The purity of Presto's work makes us wonder how he achieves such technical perfection. His passion for rigorous mathematical calculation turns his circles and squares into a complex and ordered puzzle of great beauty," Saravia told the China Daily website during a recent interview.Presto, 64, is also one of around 20 artists represented by the Diana Saravia Gallery in Montevideo, Uruguay's capital and largest city.Fernando Lugris, Uruguayan ambassador to China, commended Saravia as a leading figure in Uruguay's contemporary art scene. Yet, the 52-year-old gallerist came from humble beginnings."I was born in Cerro de las Cuentas, a small town of 300 inhabitants. At the age of 18 I set out for Montevideo, a city that allowed me to develop my studies and activity and where today, with more than 25 years of work, I position myself as a leading and avant-garde woman in the cultural scene of my country," she said.Calling herself an enthusiastic, courageous woman dedicated to the management, dissemination and marketing of works of art in the local and international circuit, Saravia started as a salesperson, which helped her to learn how to sell artwork at international art fairs.During a talk she gave at the Uruguayan embassy in Beijing on Friday, the curator lamented that despite Uruguay's booming contemporary art, the country has a small art market, which necessitates bringing the country's art to the global market."Believe me, the level of art in Uruguay is marvelous. We just need to be able to show it to the world," she said.If there's one single incident in Homer's Iliad that best underscores the epic poem's themes of friendship, honor and vengeance, it's the death of Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion who was killed by Hector, the Trojan prince, during the Trojan War.One of the most famous conflicts in ancient Greek mythology and literature, the Trojan War saw Greeks fighting the Trojans for 10 bloody years, with gods and goddesses taking their own sides. At one point, Achilles, the greatest Greek warrior, withdrew from battle due to a dispute with the leader of the Greek forces, Agamemnon.Seeing the Greeks struggling and the Trojans advancing, Patroclus took to leading the Greek warriors wearing Achilles' armor, before he was challenged by Hector who delivered his fatal blows.Overcome with sorrow and rage, Achilles returned to the battle to avenge the death of his dear friend. He killed Hector in a dramatic duel before dragging the latter's body with his chariot around the tomb of Patroclus. The scene, vividly and gorily depicted by Homer, can be found on the painted surface of a Greek vase dating to the late 6th century BC that is on display at an exhibition held at the Nanjing Museum."Achilles then went on to honor his friend the Greek way, by organizing elaborate games in his name that included chariot racing, boxing, wrestling and other athletic competitions," says Guan Lin, curator of the Nanjing exhibition Ancient Greek Civilization — the Glory of the Aegean Sea, which features more than 270 pieces from 14 museums and cultural organizations in Greece.Touching almost all aspects of ancient Greek culture, which derived its compelling narrative from a combination of mythology and history, the show has among its main themes the crucial role physical training and sporting games played.One prominent example concerns the origin of the Olympic Games. Greek mythology has it that the Games, taking place annually in the town of Olympia on the Peloponnese Peninsula in Greece, were first held by Heracles (also known as Hercules), the son Zeus had with a mortal woman.From birth, Heracles was subjected to the relentless hatred of Hera, the powerful wife of Zeus, whose most devastating act of vengeance came when she drove Heracles mad, causing him to kill his wife and their children. As atonement and redemption, Heracles was subjected to a series of nearly impossible tasks known as the Twelve Labors, upon the completion of which he founded the games to honor his father and to commemorate his own endeavor, which could only be called herculean.Having offered little protection to his much-tormented son before his tragic and violent death — Heracles set himself ablaze having endured enormous pain after being poisoned — Zeus, the philandering father and king of all Greek gods, did grant Heracles immortality, making him a deity on Mount Olympus."On one hand, the image of Heracles is an embodiment of male power and virility; on the other, his life, a constant struggle against all the toil and torture inflicted upon him, provides a supreme example of heroism, with its inbuilt sense of tragedy and nobility," says Guan."The two aspects combine to make Heracles the athletic ideal."There's another layer of meaning to the story. Heracles was also held by Greek mythology as the first hero to sail the seas. Being worshiped as the divine protector of seafarers, he symbolizes the ambition and efforts of the ancient Greeks to tame and ply the ocean.Another Greek god, although much less valiant, associated with athleticism is Hermes, son of — not surprisingly — Zeus and another of his lovers. Able to move quickly and freely between the worlds of the mortal and the divine aided by his winged sandals, Hermes, thanks to his speed and agility, became a patron of travelers, messengers and athletes.During the sporting games, winners were presented with wreaths woven of laurel or olive tree branches. While the former was sacred to Apollo, the latter was symbolic of Athena — both children Zeus had outside his marriage with Hera.According to Greek mythology, Athena, competing with the sea god Poseidon for the honor to be the patron deity of Athens, planted an olive tree and successfully won the locals' hearts and minds. Vases filled with olive oil were awarded to the winners of the athletic and equestrian competitions, especially those held in honor of Athena.At the Nanjing Museum exhibition, the head of Apollo wearing a laurel wreath appears on one side of a gold Greek coin dating to early 4th century BC. On the other side, the legendary Macedonian King Philip II, with goad in one hand and reins in the other, is driving his two-horse chariot to victory during the Olympic Games of 356 BC.The king also appeared as a chariot driver on a silver coin dating to around the same time that is on view at the exhibition. On this one, the head of Zeus appears on the reverse side.Known as Staters, the coins, widely circulated throughout the Mediterraneans both for large economic transactions and as a store of wealth, had contributed to the spread of Greek culture and influence, something that the Macedonian king was highly aware of.According to Greek biographer Plutarch, Philip II, the unifier of the Greek city-states, and his horse were victorious in the single horse race at the Olympic Games the same year that his son Alexander was born. The boy is remembered as Alexander the Great, responsible for creating one of history's largest empires and for spreading Greek culture throughout his conquered territory.The death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC set in motion a gradual decline of the Greek culture, which culminated with the Roman conquest of Greece in 31 BC. In 393, the ancient Olympic Games were banned by Roman Emperor Theodosius I as part of a broader effort to suppress pagan practices and promote Christianity.However, Heracles, who had a difficult life but eventually gained immortality, had somehow evoked the Christian idea of reward in heaven for sufferings sustained on Earth, says the curator.Despite his destructive strength, the hero-god was worshiped, first and foremost, as a champion, a guardian and a peace-lover, if one listens to a hymn of the 6th century BC:"Heracles, noble of soul, mighty in power… defender of all … you reassure people by driving out wild beasts and by your desire for nurturing greatly honored peace …"An exhibition of award-winning works from the "I Love Color — Young Talents Painting Competition" is running until the end of this month at the Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts Museum in Xi'an, Shaanxi province.Since its launch in April, the 9th edition of this competition received over 1,800 submissions from children across the country within a month. These works, centering around the theme "Love & AI", showcase the children's unique understanding and rich imagination of the relationship between artificial intelligence and human emotions.The judges carefully evaluated the entries and ultimately selected 136 outstanding pieces.The exhibition has attracted a large number of visitors, particularly families and teachers.The exhibition not only highlights the children's artistic talents but also demonstrates the Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts' active involvement in public education and social welfare activities.At the opening, a fabric art workshop was held, providing children with an opportunity to experience traditional folk art firsthand.Chinese artist Liu Jingtao on Thursday kicked off his solo exhibition of 17 artworks on Chinese landscapes, Tibetan buddhist art, and fine-brush flower-and-bird paintings in New York City.Included are several thangka paintings bearing innovative characteristics, one of which was displayed in the Carrousel Hall of the Louvre in Paris, France, in 2023.Liu, an artist from Central China's Hubei province, said his thangka paintings were designed to entertain modern aesthetic interests with innovations on design, use of mineral pigments and intrinsic contents.The exhibition, staged at Murray Hill Art Museum in Flushing of Queens borough, New York, is expected to open through the end of August, according to the museum.Born in 1977, Liu has a doctorate in design art and a doctorate in literature.Over the years, Liu's creation of meticulous landscapes, meticulous flower-and-birds, large thangkas and heavy color freehand brushwork reflects his cognition, inheritance and innovation of Chinese traditional paintings, according to the exhibition.As one of Shanghai's most representative Chinese ink painting artists, Wu Hufan (1894-1968) is famous for his landscape paintings which showcase his superb use of light and vivid colors. An ongoing exhibition at the China Art Museum Shanghai displays some of his most celebrated creations.Opened on Aug 6, A Unique Peak of Shanghai: the Exhibition of Wu Hufan brings more than 80 paintings and calligraphy works from collections of the China Art Museum Shanghai, the Shanghai Chinese Painting Academy, Suzhou Museum in Jiangsu province, the Shanghai History Museum and Duoyunxuan, as well as private collectors. The exhibition runs until Oct 27.The China Art Museum Shanghai has hosted a series of group exhibitions in the past few years, elaborating on the characteristics and development of a distinctive "Shanghai Style", or haipai, of modern Chinese art, according to Wang Yichuan, executive director of the museum."We wanted to explore this direction and focus on specific artists. We chose Wu as the first featured figure because he made a great impact on China's art scene in the latter half of the 20th century." A new exhibition at Jiushi Art Salon has transformed the paintings of contemporary artist Li Wenguang into multimedia installations and invites visitors to walk into a world of kaleidoscopic visual fantasy.The exhibition Venus, which began on Aug 9 and runs until the end of Sept, features different series of Li's paintings created in the past decade and multimedia installations reconstructing the visual vocabulary in Li's art.Shanghai is set to host a major event in the furniture industry.The 29th China International Furniture Expo & China High-end Furniture Manufacturing Expo FMC China 2024, alongside the 2024 Modern Shanghai Fashion Home Expo, will be held from Sept 10-13.The event at Shanghai New International Expo Center and the Expo Exhibition Hall, will draw in an estimated 200,000 professional visitors from more than 160 countries and regions worldwide. Covering a vast exhibition area of 350,000 square meters at the Shanghai Pudong Double Pavilion, attendees will witness the latest in home trade, design, and lifestyle innovations.As the world's top furniture producer, exporter, and consumer, China plays a pivotal role in the global furniture industry, supplying products to over 200 countries and regions. The expo will showcase the best of Chinese furniture brands, highlighting both established names and emerging talent in design, materials, and business models.A key feature of the expo is the "Chinese Brands Exhibition," emphasizing design, quality, and innovation in furniture as a means to promote Chinese cultural concepts globally. Through themed spaces like "Heaven, Earth, and People," "Friends," "Nature," "Living," and "Reunion," visitors will experience contemporary Chinese stories told through the lens of these brands.Additionally, five major overseas exhibition groups from France, Belgium, Singapore, Malaysia, and Turkey, as well as exhibitors from Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, the US, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, totaling 25 countries and regions, will bring a mix of emerging trends and diverse styles, collectively showcasing design essence with an international perspective, the fusion of Eastern and Western craftsmanship, and the subtlety and elegance of home art.The first China Xinjiang Folk Art Season is set to start in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, on Aug 20, according to a news conference by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism on Friday.The event seeks to promote the integration of culture and tourism by taking folk art troupes from different parts of the country to perform in Xinjiang.The event will include exhibitions of farmer paintings, intangible cultural heritage projects, and other cultural and creative products, while promoting travel routes in Xinjiang, and setting up gourmet markets.Offline activities will run from August 2024 to 2025 in several stages set up in markets, squares, commercial districts and tourist attractions around the region to permit the participation of people of its various ethnic groups. New media platforms will be leveraged to promote the folk art season online.A series of folk performances will be organized. More than 50 troupes comprising around 1,700 performers will take part in the event and will be performing at the Urumqi Cultural Center.Stage productions will take place in some prefectures in Xinjiang from August 20 until the end of October, according to Yu Jie, deputy director of Xinjiang's regional bureau of culture and tourism.In August 1502, 75-year-old Shen Zhou, a cultural icon and painting-calligraphy master based in today's Suzhou city, eastern China's Jiangsu province, lost his eldest son to disease. Three years later in the spring of 1505, an anguished Shen, who called himself "a wretched old tree with nothing for support", composed a number of poems — 30 to be exact — and collectively titled them Poetry of the Fallen Flower.Probably still feeling inconsolable, the old man then started to paint, in the same vein as he did the poems. The result, which shows a solitary Shen standing on a big rock, leaning against his cane and looking into the afar, is inscribed with his own words: "The mountains stand empty, no soul in sight; water flows as blossoms fall."The work is now on view at the Nanjing Museum, part of an exhibition focusing on the artistic influence of Su Shi (1037-1101), a Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127) polymath who's equally great at poetry and prose, painting and calligraphy."By saying that painting could be just as cathartic a process as poetry-writing, Su effectively fostered mutual inspiration between the two," says Pang Ou, the exhibition curator."By the time of Shen, it had become almost standard practice for a literati painter like him to paint under the admitted influence of a piece of writing, be that writing from himself or someone else."Given Shen's esteemed status within his circle of friends, it was no surprise that many more poems elegizing the fallen flowers were composed, and paintings done, by others who felt compelled to respond in their own way."In that sense, Su Shi had made painting a crucial way for educated members of ancient Chinese society to communicate on paper, something they had previously been doing almost exclusively through poetry," the curator says."It also made possible the mining by literati painters of all poems written throughout Chinese history, including those from the great poets of the Tang Dynasty (618-907)."Those who had struck a particularly deep chord with the literati painters are farewell poems, of which Su had written more than a few. "An old man bids farewell to his parting friends by the water's edge, where the sandy shore bears the traces of horse hooves," goes one of Su's farewell poems.Another person who felt old — and disillusioned — was Wen Zhengming (1470-1559), a protege and close friend of Shen who commanded a big following of his own as a much-emulated painter-calligrapher.By introducing the concept of literati painting, Su Shi changed the landscape of creativity, Zhao Xu reports.'It took someone as talented and revered as Su Shi to propel Chinese art forward. Anyone other than him would not do," says Pang Ou, ancient Chinese painting and calligraphy expert from the prestigious Nanjing Museum, located in Nanjing city, eastern China's Jiangsu province.The man Pang was talking about was a prominent figure living largely in the 11th century during the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), a man whose lengthy career in the bureaucracy had brought him inevitable damage and led him to focus more on matters of writing and art, the dual fields in which he has been enshrined.Such was his influence that Pang has decided that a full-blown exhibition, with more than 150 paintings and calligraphy pieces from eight Chinese museums, is what he needs to do the man justice."Today we talk about literati painting — the term coined by Su himself to refer to paintings by educated men to convey their inner thoughts, as well as their own state of being — as dominating the history of Chinese art. Yet without Su, the genre, which was also a trend lasting for nearly a millennium, may not have formed until a few centuries later, if it was formed at all," says Pang."By saying that you can express what's in your heart through painting, in very much the same way men of words were doing through poetry during his time, Su elevated the former to the same artistic height of the latter."Before Su, painting was mainly for decorative purposes, and routinely appeared as frescoes or on folding screens which served as room dividers; after him, painting, done in the spirit and sensibilities of the literati, was an ordained form of high art, a worthy pursuit for anyone who considered himself culturally sophisticated."So what constitutes a literati painting for Su? The curator attempts an answer with a Su Shi painting that opens the show. It is a simple depiction of two rocks and a few stalks of bamboo, against a misty backdrop of distant mountains and waters. According to Pang, the work was a self-portrait in the metaphorical sense of the words, reflective of how Su saw himself at the end of a long exile, between 1079 and 1084.Before 1079, Su had had a rather smooth sailing in court politics. Then his detractors pointed at some of his writings and accused him of being scornful of the emperor's reform initiatives. Those men had the emperor's ear, and Su, as a result, was sent to Huangzhou in modern-day Huanggang city of Central China's Hubei province."The experience represented for Su a major turning point. For five years, he was forced to reflect, transcribing his thoughts on paper in monumental pieces that we still learn today," says Pang. "It was also in Huangzhou that the man started to truly engage himself with nature, art and self."The bamboo as rendered by Su sprouted from underneath of the rock to enjoy random growth, a symbol of endurance in face of hardship. The hazy landscape on the background was the Xiaoxiang region in modernday Yongzhou city, Hunan province. A watery patch of land about 600 kilometers from Huangzhou, Xiaoxiang had been known in Chinese history as the land of exile, both forced and self-imposed, where a sense of tragic beauty permeated nature's wilderness.Su, who once summed up his entire life with the names of the remote locales to which he had been banished — Huangzhou was the first one — was clearly being allegorical, if not sadly prophetic.The work is considered one of the only two surviving paintings by Su. From there, the show meanders through the ensuing millennium, during which those who came after Su and looked up to him found themselves in comparable situations or sentiments. And they, like Su, turned to painting, the very purpose of which, to quote Su himself, "is not to create a simple likeness, but to help one probe his own thinking and reveal his mind".This was especially true for those living through the turbulent times of dynastic transitions. One of them was Zhu Da (1626-1705), who had the good luck to be born out of the royal family of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and the bad luck to witness its fall when he was 18.Two of his works are on view. In one, bamboo plants grow from behind a rock in front of a window, which in turn frames an interior view comprising a table, a urinal-shaped container and some rare fungus known as lingzhi."For all the mythical healing power accorded to lingzhi by ancient Chinese, it has appeared in a urinal, an item associated with filth. That for me was the painter's perception of himself and the world around," says Pang.That world was a cold one, where all birds as depicted by Zhu had to stand on one foot and keep the other tucked close to the body for warmth. A few of these birds are on view at the Nanjing exhibition that runs till Aug 18.And warmth was what Su must have longed for when he wrote in Huangzhou in the spring of 1082 that "cold vegetables were being heated in the empty kitchen, by wet reeds smoldering in a broken stove"."Such misery! Su Shi wasn't born to laugh at the ups and downs of life — no one was. Although his followers tend to forget it, the sense of transcendence exuded by his writings wouldn't have existed without some intense personal struggle," Pang says.One of these writings recorded the building in Huangzhou of a small dwelling, which Su named "the Snow Hall", before going on to paint its four walls with snowscape.Pang had the story in mind when he decided to include in the exhibition a painting from an unknown Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) artist that shows towering snowy mountains under a leaden sky. The canvas is occupied on its lower left corner by two scholarly-looking gentlemen sitting inside a thatched hut, and on its lower right corner, by a boatman who, with a pole, is maneuvering himself away from the bank, having enabled the meeting between the two friends."Companionship in solitude — that's what the painting was about," says Pang.Su must have understood this. Two of his most celebrated pieces of prose were written in Huangzhou, at the end of two separate boat trips with friends. (The boat trips themselves were later taken up as a major painting subject, rendered tirelessly by those in awe with Su's talents.)"The clear breeze over the river and the bright moon amid the mountains ... are the infinite treasures of Nature the Creator, shared in joy by both you and me," he wrote in one of the pieces.Pang says: "Wu jin zang — that's the Chinese for 'infinite treasure', which gives the title to our exhibition."What Su Shi had considered nature was for him, he has been for generations of Chinese." Forty works of late sculptor Yan Dehui are on display at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing, Lin Qi reports.Wu Weishan, director of the National Art Museum of China, recollects a long car ride one winter morning in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comte region, eastern France in 2018.Through the woods delivering "a poetic mood to remind one of the landscapes of Barbizon school", Wu and his colleagues arrived at the end of a country road where stood the former studio of Yan Dehui (1908-87), the Chinese sculptor who lived and worked in France since the 1930s till death.They were greeted by Yan's daughter, Marianne Yen, who ushered the visiting group into the house, in which "sculptures filled almost every corner of the room, the desks and the top of packed book cabinets," Wu recalls, "and there were unfinished works and chunks of huangyangmu (boxwood) left for carving".Wu says he had never met Yan, but "seeing his works, as if I had seen the man". He adds: "The works, carrying the marks of his hands and fingers, whether been done or not, touched us deeply, all the while conveying his homesickness."GUANGZHOU — It is now possible for art enthusiast Lin Yali to visit museums and exhibitions at will, as new walk-in policies exempt her from having to reserve in advance.The Guangzhou Museum of Art has allowed visitors to enter without a reservation, as long as they pass the security checks, since last month. The museum has also extended its hours of opening until the end of this month, to offer a cool, art-filled summer experience.Lin, who comes from Hunan province, decided to travel to Guangdong province to visit the 14th National Exhibition of Fine Arts after hearing about the new policy."I was worried I wouldn't be able to get a spot in advance because of the large summer crowds. Now everything has become easier and I can take my time enjoying these amazing paintings," Lin says.Shenzhen in Guangdong similarly announced late last month the elimination of its reservation policies for 133 sites in the city, including 17 tourist attractions, 61 museums, 33 art galleries, 12 libraries and 10 cultural centers.Museums and historical sites have recently become popular choices for tourism in China. Data from the National Cultural Heritage Administration showed that museums hosted over 40,000 exhibitions and more than 380,000 educational activities last year, attracting a record-breaking 1.29 billion visitors.To better serve them, the administration recently recommended that museums extend opening hours and eliminate reservation policies.In response, numerous museums, including the Capital Museum, the Sanxingdui Museum, the Shanghai Museum and the Guangzhou Museum of Art, have extended their hours and introduced visitor-friendly programs, including nighttime visits and immersive experiences, to enhance the accessibility and appeal of Chinese cultural heritage.Li Cheng, a senior middle school graduate has an infatuation for China's history and traditional culture and has made local museums his top destinations, as the new policy enables him to visit more historical sites.This summer, he visited Chengdu in Sichuan province with his mother after the college entrance exam. Their first stop was the Chengdu Jinsha Site Museum. The Sanxingdui Museum and Chengdu Museum were also added to his itinerary.Data shows a significant increase in tourists following the elimination of the reservation policies in multiple tourist cities.According to the big-data research institute of online travel service provider Qunar, the search volume for tickets to Beijing scenic spots has nearly tripled since the capital eliminated its reservation policies for all of its tourist attractions apart from the Palace Museum and the National Museum of China.Several attractions and museums in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, have also experienced a peak in visitor flow after the elimination of reservation policies.China currently has 59 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and by the end of last year, it was home to 6,833 museums, which attracted over 1.2 billion visitors last year.The lifting of the reservation policies gives international visitors interested in Chinese culture new choices besides scenery and food tours, particularly in light of the 144-hour visa-free transit policy available to nationals of certain countries, which facilitates entry to China.According to the online travel service provider Ctrip, domestic inbound travel orders in the first half of the year increased by more than 1.6 times year-on-year.According to a survey conducted by the China Tourism Academy about inbound tourist satisfaction, over 60 percent of respondents cited the desire to experience culture as the main reason for their visit to China.Dai Bin, director of the China Tourism Academy, says that the integration of culture and tourism has become a trend in China as living standards improve and people travel more frequently. Cultural and historical landmarks, such as museums and historical cities, have become must-visit destinations for many tourists.XinhuaIn geometric patterns and sacred snowy mountains, one painter found his destiny, Lin Qi reports.In 2000, artist and educator Zhao Dajun (1937-2023) was forced to stop painting with oils, his passion since the day in 1954 when he first enrolled at the Attached Secondary Art School of the Luxun Academy of Fine Arts in Shenyang, Liaoning province.Overwork and neurological allergies, caused by prolonged exposure to oil paint, had led him to his second round of hospitalization.Over the following eight years, Zhao painted sparingly, opting instead for rest. During his recovery period, he found solace and healing in nature."I began with excursions. I bought a tent, cooking pots and other necessaries for outdoor activities like camping," he said.Mythologies represent the boundless creativity and vivid imaginations of ancient civilizations as they sought to articulate their perceptions of the world and the universe, realms that remained largely enigmatic to them. Through these narratives, contemporary individuals can glimpse into the emotional landscapes of our forebears, draw inspiration, and embark on even grander flights of fancy.Where Are the Mythologies, an art show at Beijing Today Art Museum until Oct 13, unfolds to the audience a world intertwined by those beautiful imaginations from the past and envisions of the future.Graphics, video installations and virtual tours assisted by VR devices allow people to feel the extensiveness of the mythological world in the descriptions of ancient Chinese texts. Meanwhile, artists have injected the renewed understanding of the relations between men and nature, cosmos, as technology has expanded human activities to new realms.A new exhibition featuring the Chinese revolution and national achievements in the construction of the country opened at the Long Museum in Shanghai on July 26, celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.The exhibition, Keep Pace with the Times, which will run until Oct 7 at the Long Museum West Bund, features about 150 oil and ink paintings, sculptures, prints and so on, selected from the museum’s collection of 300 strong artworks."My collection of New China themed artworks cover all periods of creation since the 1930s, and there are many masterpieces of both artistic and historical value, all of which are very dear to me," said Wang Wei, founding director of the museum."I have selected some of the most iconic artworks for this exhibition in commemoration of the founding of New China, because I believe the history represented is worth remembering and sharing with new generations."Literary and art creation featuring China's revolutionary history has always been an important subject in the Chinese art scene. The government, the National Museum of China, and the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution have all organized national creative campaigns of artworks featuring major historical subjects, and subsequently produced a large number of outstanding artworks representing the decisive moments, national heroes, and important events in the Chinese revolutionary history.Wang started her collection of these artworks in the 1990s. Today the Long Museum boasts the largest and most systematic collection of revolutionary art among the private institutions in China.The universe has been a recurring theme in artworks, be it a poem, a piece of music or a painting.In his works, Hu Jue shares his feelings about things that reveal the extensiveness of the cosmos, the passing of time and the breadth of life. While he steps aside from a symbolic approach, he has combined physical elements of objects and lives to form a distinctive semi-abstract style of his own.Hu's ongoing exhibition Blow Towards the Sky at the Young Art Museum in Shanghai through Aug 26, presents his unique vocabulary of art built over the years since he attended the Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts in Shaanxi province.Since launching the first Beaux-Arts Olympiades in 2008 to celebrate the Beijing Olympic Games, the China National Society for the Promotion of Arts and Culture has turned this exhibition into a platform of international exchanges by organizing art exhibitions during the Summer and Winter Olympics and touring the world to uphold the Olympic spirit.The new edition celebrating the Paris Summer Olympics will be unveiled at La Seine Musicale on Aug 8. It will show the works — paintings and calligraphy pieces — by 60 Chinese artists, juxtaposed with over 120 works by artists from other countries and regions.At an exhibition, a mother and her child stand side by side, each captivated by different aspects of the display. The mother recognizes elements from her own youth, while her daughter is entranced by the interactive, dreamlike environment — a blend of maze, theater and amusement park — presented through virtual reality and multimedia.This scene has vividly played out in artist Cao Fei's mind, illustrating how her work resonates across generations. She imagines older visitors appreciating the historical context and social commentary, while younger ones are drawn to the immersive, surreal aspects.Cao's solo show, Chaoxi Zhouhe (Tidal Flux), is now running at the Museum of Art Pudong in Shanghai till Nov 17.The "Bridging Eras: The Copper Art of Zhu Bingren through Eight Decades" exhibition opened at the National Museum of China on Monday, signifying a new chapter in Zhu's illustrious career and celebrating his lifelong dedication to the art of bronze.The exhibition showcases over 100 bronze masterpieces created by Zhu Bingren, a master copper sculptor and national intangible cultural heritage inheritor. The displayed works weigh a collective 35.6 tons, including one piece weighing 3.7 tons, making it the "heaviest" exhibition in the museum's history.A unique feature of the exhibition is the display of ten national bronze treasures from the Warring States period (475-221 BC). It represents a convergence of modern copper-melting techniques with ancient bronze civilization."Being able to exhibit at the National Museum is the greatest fortune in my life. I am grateful for this great era," said Zhu. "My first molten copper artwork was collected by the National Museum in 2007, and now many of my other works with this technique have been proudly returned home."The exhibition is divided into four sections: Traditional Innovation, Mastery of Copper, Skillful Copper Carving and Artistic Innovation.Zhu's latest work, "Yellow River", captures the river's dynamic flow by transforming molten copper into solid form. It honors the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, reflecting the enduring spirit of the Chinese nation.Zhu Sidi contributed to this story.The Grand Canal of China spans 3,200km and has a history of more than 2,500 years, making it the biggest, longest and most enduring canal in the world. It can be described as a treasure of Chinese civilization and an epic passed down on the vast land of China, continuing to play an important role to this day. 2025 marks the tenth anniversary of China's successful bid to inscribe the Grand Canal as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Over the past decade, new progress has been made in the preservation, inheritance and utilization of the Grand Canal. The eight provinces bordering the Grand Canal have built a splendid cultural belt, a green and ecological belt, and a colorful tourist belt along the canal, boasting countless breathtaking sights that witness the canal's history, current status and future. This ancient relic has renewed its charm after undergoing restoration and protection; the "new arrivals" in museums and the "talking" historical and cultural relics play a crucial role in preserving the culture of the Grand Canal. Let's delve into and draw inspiration from the long history, blend it with modern fashion, and create picture scrolls with our creativity.What sparks will ignite when precious cultural relics and heritage inherited through a millennium collide with a canal chic?To celebrate the tenth anniversary of China's successful bid to inscribe the Grand Canal as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, China Daily Website launches Canal Chic: Reviving China's Heritage to call for creative visual works worldwide.

Contact details of the Organizing Committee of "Canal Chic: Reviving China's Heritage": 010-84883703, 010-84883737An exhibition featuring Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) artist Hua Yan, which opened at Guangdong Museum on July 10 in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, allows audiences to sense and appreciate the essence and beauty of landscape paintings from the dynasty. It also offers a chance to understand the painter, a representative figure of Yangzhou School, a loose artists' group in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province.Hua (1682-1765) was known for his flower-and-bird, figure and landscape paintings, according to Chen Xun, director of the collection management department of Guangdong Museum and the exhibition's curator.The exhibition, Elegance, Refinement, Style: Paintings of Hua Yan, runs until Oct 7 and displays more than 70 pieces or sets of Hua's exquisite works, with precious cultural relics, accounting for more than 90 percent of the total, collected by eight units from Guangdong, Liaoning, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces and Tianjin municipality, Chen says.Many items are being displayed to the public for the first time.It is the first systematic and concentrated exhibition of Hua's paintings in Guangdong and also the first domestic exhibition of original works with his paintings as the theme, Chen adds.Digital technology helps display and create an immersive experience, allowing viewers to delve into his paintings to explore the beauty of mountains and rivers, as well as the poetic and picturesque scenery in his works.The exhibition has received support from the School of Chinese Painting, the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts. The cooperation between the museum and the academy and their in-depth analysis of Hua's painting techniques guides visitors into his world from multiple dimensions."With the help of the exhibition, visitors learn the characteristics of the painter and can better understand the ancient Chinese paintings, thus appreciate more of the creative transformation and innovative features that originated in traditional Chinese culture," Chen says."Please bring my song back to your home" (a line from "Song and Smile…", a popular Chinese youth song) — hundreds of US and Chinese students sang together at the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC at an art exchange gala to mark the 45th anniversary of China-US diplomatic relations on Tuesday.The Beijing Golden Sail Art Troupe, composed of teachers and students from Beijing 101 Middle School and Zhongguancun No. 3 Elementary School, as well as students from the Chinese embassy's Sunshine School and 14 American schools from around DC, jointly presented cultural performances, showcasing that the future of the China-US relationship lies in the youth. More than 400 people attended the event.Minister Jing Quan delivered remarks at the event. He said that since China and the United States established diplomatic relations 45 years ago, the two peoples have enhanced mutual understanding and friendship through exchanges. In particular, youth exchanges have played an important role. In San Francisco last November, President Xi Jinping announced that China is ready to invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years. Since then, many young American students have eagerly embraced the opportunities to experience China firsthand. They were amazed by China's culture and long history and marveled at China's progress in green transition. He encouraged the students attending the gala to understand each other better and become friends.On Wednesday, the exhibition The Freedom Reconstructed by Lines and Philosophical Thoughts: Another World of Jidi Majia opened at the Tingtaoguzhong Art Museum in Xichang, Liangshan prefecture, Southwest China's Sichuan province. The exhibition features 42 calligraphy works and 43 paintings created by Jidi Majia, a poet and artist of the Yi ethnic group.The comprehensive exhibition runs until Aug 15 and encompasses poetry, calligraphy and painting, showcasing Jidi Majia's representative works and artistic essence. Each piece reflects profound thought and exquisite skill, presenting his creative style and artistic concepts.A contemporary Chinese poet, Jidi Majia's work has been widely acclaimed at home and abroad, with many of his poems translated into nearly 40 languages and published worldwide.At the opening ceremony, poet Li Guofu praised Jidi Majia's calligraphy and paintings for their vigorous strokes and lively charm, revealing a profound understanding and unique perspective on traditional culture. He noted that Jidi Majia's works possess rich cultural connotations, philosophical expressions and ethereal aesthetic realms.Wu Liyang, vice-chairman of the Sichuan Writers Association, said that Jidi Majia's greatest strength as a calligrapher and painter lies in achieving "a high unity of contradictions". His works reflect the profound heritage of traditional inscriptions and modern calligraphy styles, integrating elements of the humanities, history, geography and ethnic customs.Jidi Majia said that as a native of Liangshan prefecture's Yi ethnic group, this exhibition in his homeland is like "presenting a report to his mother". He emphasized that his creations are deeply rooted in local culture, and the rich and diverse culture of Yi people has profoundly influenced his poetry, calligraphy and painting. He said the exhibition will serve as a communication medium, allowing more people to learn about his hometown.Jidi Majia uses lines and colors as carriers to convey his inner thoughts and meanings. He said that "another world", referring to a world beyond poetry, is also closely connected to his spiritual world."Many people know me through my poetry, but each person's spiritual world is rich and composed of poetry, calligraphy, painting and other forms of creation. Therefore, in terms of language expression, another world is different from my poetic world, but on a more fundamental level, my spiritual world remains consistent," he said.Jidi Majia hopes that through this exhibition, he can showcase his years of exploration and achievements in poetry, calligraphy and painting. He also hopes to inspire more people to develop a love for and pursuit of art. He emphasizes that art is interconnected and inclusive; only through continuous cross-disciplinary exploration and courageous innovation can one create more works of art that embody the spirit of the times and personal style.Zhang Shangqing contributed to this story. Technology, solutions, design and social issues gather industries to put their best inventions forward, Lin Qi reports.Recollecting his experience on a jury at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in Cannes, France, in June, Li Chao finds it difficult not to share the groundbreaking ideas he came across at the event. He hails the award-winning works, yet feels regretful for those not awarded but presenting equally in innovative spirit and humanitarian issues.The annual festival and awards are a get-together for those from the advertising and communication industries. Li and his team won a Bronze Cannes Lions award last year for their Alibaba Healthy Fonts Project.The project is a pinyin-based keyboard input method automatically translating pinyin text into braille."It is free, and accessible to everyone. All you need to do is download the font and install it," says Li, a designer and the marketing and branding vice-president of Alibaba and Ant Group Macao Pass Group who initiated the development of the font in 2022.Zhang Shuangmin might look a bit haphazard as she drips pigment onto a square container of water. The pigments immediately disperse into small circles once they touch the surface of the transparent liquid, and without wasting any time, Zhang swirls them with an awl in seemingly casual movements.As minutes pass, the random arrangement of pigments begins to take shape and eventually evolves into stunning floral patterns.A bigger surprise comes when she gently places a white porcelain plate into the water and lifts it in slow motion. The pattern then magically transfers onto the plate.This procedure never fails to elicit a gasp of amazement from her audience.This type of printing art is known as tangliucai (Tang flowing colors), and Zhang, 53, has practiced the craft for more than three decades."It requires calculation and precision every step of the way," says Zhang, who was born and raised in Xi'an, Shaanxi province."I need to have a design in mind before execution. If I want a pattern to appear in warm colors, I need to plan ahead and use cool colors for the background."I also have to consider beforehand if I will place it on a folding or round fan, a porcelain plate, silk, leather, or any other medium, which will determine the composition of the pattern and ultimately the success of the work."Years of practice has seen Zhang develop a strong leaning toward bringing out Tang Dynasty (618-907) elements when practicing the craft of tangliucai, which was named an intangible cultural heritage in Xi'an in 2020."I want it to match the historical thickness of the art, which boasts a long history," Zhang says.Zhang was first attracted to a rough version of the craft from her grandmother, who would steep various fabrics into dyes, resulting in intriguing patterns.This childhood predisposition to the dyeing art prompted her to pursue design and environmental art at a local art institute in the 1990s, when she got to know her grandmother's daily life production might be associated with the ancient water-printing technique.In Youyang Zazu (The Miscellaneous Morsels From Youyang), a compilation of diverse social and folk narratives by Tang Dynasty writer Duan Chengshi, an ancient technique of coloring paper on water was detailed.Experts regard this collection as the earliest documentation of the historical roots of the practice.Then, in the compilation titled Four Treasures of a Scholar's Study by Song Dynasty (960-1279) scholar Su Yijian, a kind of decorative paper called liushajian, meaning flowing-sand notepaper, was mentioned of being made in what is now Sichuan province.According to this collection, the process of notepaper production involved pulling a sheet of paper through a fermented flour paste combined with an array of colors, resulting in spontaneous and asymmetrical patterns.Furthermore, the compilation described an alternative method using a paste derived from a regional plant blended with croton oil and diluted with water.Ginger extract was subsequently employed to scatter the hues. Then a hairbrush was used to create designs resembling human figures, clouds or flying birds.These intricate designs were then transferred onto a paper surface, showcasing the artistry and skill of the creators."It was so fascinating, yet a great pity," Zhang says about the fact that the art form failed to prosper and was almost on the brink of extinction in the country.As she delved further into her research, she discovered that this art form had transcended borders and acquired unique local characteristics, such as in Turkiye, where the marbling art known as Ebru was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO in 2014.She made a point to pursue the art through scraps of information from historical documents."Many people said it had died. It is not true since we can still find the water-printing technique continuously being applied in marbling Xuan paper," Zhang says.Handmade Xuan paper, or rice paper, was originally produced during the Tang Dynasty in Jingxian county in today's Anhui province, and calligraphy and painting artists have put a premium on it ever since.With an art background, Zhang managed to piece together bits of information and restore the craft through consultations from experts and her own expertise.Eternal beautyRituals of Repetition: Portals to Eternity, at the Art Museum of the Central Academy of Fine Arts until Aug 25, features the work of four South Korean artists, whose creative methods have refreshed the look of ceramic, paper and ink, three traditional materials widely used in East Asia. By embracing their cultural heritage while taking on an international perspective, the creations express, in an experimental way, the beauty of eternity, and celebrate the endeavor to excel.Lee Jin-woo's work hails water as a symbol of the renewal of life, purification and regeneration. Chang Jin-won began using traditional techniques, then turned to abstraction and now tries to bridge the past and the present. Lee Seung-hee has been at the forefront of ceramic art, and his pieces on display renew the impression of the possibilities of ceramics. Shin Young-ho's exploration of the ink tradition reflects on the passing of time and meaning of life.9:30 am-5:30 pm, closed on Mondays. 8 Huajiadi Nanjie, Chaoyang district, Beijing. 010-6477-1575.The ancient art of seal engraving holds a vital role in Chinese cultural heritage, where seal impressions are extensively employed in the realms of painting and calligraphy.Traditionally crafted from exquisite stones, ceramics are occasionally chosen but are less common due to the intricate engraving techniques required, which must withstand high-temperature firings.The Institute of Calligraphy and Seal Art at the China National Academy of Painting has curated an exhibition showcasing the exquisite fusion of two traditional Chinese art forms.On display at the Beijing Ceramic Art Museum until July 21 are meticulously crafted seals and impressions, born from a meticulous process: Artisans intricately carve designs onto clay models, which are then fired in kilns, transforming them into porcelain seals through high-temperature processes.The current exhibit features works by seasoned artists, with pieces from emerging seal enthusiasts set to be displayed until Aug 4.In an article he wrote in 1979, Landscapes Under the Sun, the prolific artist Huang Yongyu (1924-2023) recounted anecdotes about his uncle-once-removed, Shen Congwen (1902-88), a writer and scholar of repute, and how his attitude toward life and academic research had influenced his own.At the end of the article, he wrote: "What a long life (Shen) lived, and (his experiences were) so rich, and colorful."Today, Huang is also regarded as a prominent figure in art and culture, whose life and career were, like Shen's, long and substantial.A phrase from his commentary about his uncle, For So Long, and Colorful, has become the title of an exhibition of his work being held at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing until Thursday.In 2013, Huang held an exhibition at the National Museum of China to commemorate his 90th birthday. It was an all-encompassing show to display his accomplishments in painting, design and literature — the artist was also an avid writer who published dozens of novels and collections of essays and prose articles.The current exhibition at the National Art Museum is a show of 159 ink paintings, all made after he turned 90.It is not billed as a retrospective — the usual practice for a late, accomplished artist — but per Huang's request, as a show of his "latest work". It is one he had planned for some time."None of the paintings in the show will have been seen before in art and cultural circles," he once said. "I'm pretty serious about making it happen."BARCELONA — Prominent illustrators and writers from China and Spain gathered in Barcelona on Thursday to celebrate the art and literature of comics from both countries.The event "A World of Comics — Closer to Chinese and Spanish Literature and Illustration" was held in the Espai Sol room of Barcelona's Nord train station.Chinese comic artists Xiao Lin Manga and Nie Jun, as well as writer Cai Jun shared their thoughts, methods and experiences in a roundtable discussion with Spanish comic artists, writers and publishers."Comics are very powerful, possessing a language that has no borders. I think the most important part of this type of exchange is that people can learn each other's thoughts through comics," Nie says.The illustrator points out that while Western comics are very popular among young people in China, demand for Chinese comics in Europe is also increasing. Nie's work has been published in France and will soon hit bookshelves in Denmark.Munir Hachemi, a Spanish writer who also lectures at Peking University, says comics are ideal for showing how different Chinese contemporary culture is from outdated preconceptions that often persist in foreign societies."Comics can reach young people, which is ... important and powerful... there's no such thing as traditional Chinese comics, which makes them good for sharing contemporary Chinese culture," he says.The event was also the inauguration of an exhibition of the same name running until July 27, which will display some 200 artworks by comic artists from Spain, China and other parts of the world."A World of Comics" is part of the Get to Know China initiative created by China's State Council Information Office."Publishers say that most of the demand is for manga, both Chinese and Japanese. These days, Asian culture is much more present in Europe than before, in food, fashion, music, literature ... everything," Spanish comic artist Igor Sarralde says.The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization also participated in the event, since Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province, and Barcelona are part of the Cities of Literature network, which consists of 53 cities in 39 countries.In his studio, Tang Chuansong is modifying a draft for a piece of tiehua, or iron painting.Originating from Wuhu, Anhui province, Wuhu iron painting is crafted from iron sheets and wires, heated using a furnace or spot welder. Artisans shape these materials through forging, drilling, welding, filing, chiseling and other techniques, placing the intricate patterns on a white base before framing them into a painting.Dating back over 300 years to the late Ming (1368-1644) and early Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, Wuhu iron painting was recognized in 2006 as a national intangible cultural heritage. This art form portrays landscapes, figures, flowers, insects, birds and animals, blending traditional Chinese painting and ink wash techniques with 3D modeling to create a distinctive style.At 80 years old, Tang serves as the technical director of the Wuhu arts and crafts factory and is the provincial-level inheritor of the craft.Beginning as an apprentice at 15 years old, Tang's passion for the art form led to becoming a prominent figure in the field. In the 1970s, he revolutionized iron painting techniques by introducing modified spot welding machines, replacing traditional furnaces and enhancing both the craft's process and working conditions for craftsmen.Today, Tang is committed to preserving and passing on the legacy of Wuhu iron painting craftsmanship to the next generation of artists, ensuring that his knowledge and expertise continue to inspire and guide aspiring learners.On July 1, the founding day of the Communist Party of China, two Party members from Beijing visited the National Art Museum of China to partake in a special event — serving as models for sculptors to craft bust statues.This event marked the most recent installment of the museum's public initiative, "Sculpting for Models", where individuals from diverse professions who have excelled in their fields are selected to sit for on-site sculpted portraits.The honored participants on this occasion were Liu Li, a senior judge at the Beijing Chaoyang District People's Court, and Wang Kerong, a seasoned nurse at Beijing Ditan Hospital.Addition of six new permanent galleries since February vastly increases institution's scope and appeal, Zhang Kun reports.Shanghai Museum East reopened on June 26 after being closed for just over a month, with new galleries and more objects, and artifacts that invite visitors to touch and feel them.The new wing of the Shanghai Museum had its soft opening on Feb 2 with the exhibition Stars Over China: The Ancient Shu Civilization of Sanxingdui and Jinsha. Upon its conclusion on May 20, the museum closed doors to carry on with the construction, decoration and preparation of additional galleries and spaces.Including the Gallery for Ancient Chinese Sculpture and the Ancient Chinese Bronze Gallery, which opened in February, six permanent galleries of ancient Chinese art are now open in the east wing. The four new galleries are dedicated to ceramics, jade, seals, and numismatics.Also open are two themed galleries, one on the history of Shanghai, and the other called China and the World: Ceramics and Exchanges, which explores the role porcelain played in the development of international trade and communications.Four interactive spaces have also been introduced: Curio-City, an amusement-park-style gallery for young visitors, The Digital Gallery: Poetic Jiangnan, the Conservation Lab, and new merchandise shops."This is the second phase of the grand opening of the Shanghai Museum East," says Chu Xiaobo, director of the institution. "So far, we have finished 80 percent of the planned exhibition space, with 10 new galleries and interactive spaces open to the public."Construction of the new wing of the Shanghai Museum has taken seven years. It received 1.05 million visitors during the first phase of its soft opening from Feb 2 to May 20. "This was far beyond our expectations. We are greatly moved and encouraged by people's love and support for the Shanghai Museum East," Chu says.With the additional galleries and new exhibitions, the Shanghai Museum East will be able to receive more visitors every day. "People have complained about how difficult it was to secure a reservation to visit the new facility, so we have doubled the daily quota to 20,000. I believe this will largely relieve the pressure on the reservation system."People can log into the museum's WeChat mini program, and make a reservation to visit the Shanghai Museum up to 14 days in advance.The Shanghai Museum was founded in 1952 and had its first home at 325 Nanjing Road West, the location of the Shanghai Race Club in the 1930s. In 1959, the museum moved to 16 Henan Road South, another historical building dating to 1934.In 1996, the new Shanghai Museum opened on People's Square. The building, with its square-shaped base and circular top is reminiscent of an ancient Chinese caldron. It has floor space of 39,300 square meters, with individual galleries dedicated to categories such as bronzes, sculpture, ceramics, paintings and calligraphy.The new wing in Pudong New Area has a total floor space of 113,200 square meters, which has allowed the galleries to expand significantly in terms of the number of objects on display.The ceramic hall is one of the four new galleries open to public. It contains 558 objects, about half of which are on display for the first time. "We decided to remove one of the exhibits from its glass cabinet and allow visitors to touch it," Chu says. "This is rarely done in museums in China, but we believe the multisensory experience of artifacts is important. It helps people better appreciate the detail and the craft of porcelain."Peng Tao, deputy head of the ceramic department, says that museum was very careful in its selection of the piece to ensure it wouldn't be damaged. "It had to be an underglazed object because otherwise frequent touching could erase the pigments for an overglazed piece … Also, it couldn't be too light or thin, or too valuable."The object finally selected is a blue-and-white porcelain vase dating to the Kangxi (1654-1722) period. "It demonstrates the main characteristics of blue-and-white porcelain of this particular period," Peng says. "We have arranged a special insurance policy, and are confident that visitors will appreciate and cherish the opportunity to touch it."From Florence to Beijing, between figurative and abstract, creative talent blazes its own paths, Lin Qi reports.In 1715, Giuseppe Castiglione, a young man from Milan, Italy, arrived in Macao. His ultimate destination was the imperial court of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) in Beijing, where he was to serve the emperor as a painter.At that time, Castiglione didn't expect that his service at the court would last for decades until he died in 1766. As one of Emperor Qianlong's favorite artists, he left paintings depicting the ruler, his activities and imperial life. Meanwhile, he helped train several Chinese pupils to master Western painting techniques. Return of bronze heads from France to China signifies how countries can build bridges to the future, Lin Qi reports.François-Henri Pinault visited the National Museum of China in Beijing for "memory reviving" on Friday.There, the chairman and chief executive officer of the French luxury group, Kering, saw the rat and rabbit bronze heads, two of the 12 zodiac animal sculptures that had been looted from Beijing's Old Summer Palace.On June 28, 2013, François-Henri Pinault accompanied his father, François Pinault, founder of Kering, to a ceremony at the National Museum of China, where the family's donation of the two heads was officially unveiled and added to the museum's collection.By getting answers, some surprising, to 90 questions, curator displays multifaceted perspectives in new project, Li Yingxue reports.A mannequin head, feather duster, straw hat, toy goldfish, pigeon sculpture, coin and a motorcycle license plate … Hundreds of seemingly unrelated objects are intricately connected, moving in a mesmerizing, chaotic dance.This 10-meter long, 3-meter-high installation titled The Squad Is Burning Out is the brainchild of young artist Tong Kunniao. The piece features a myriad of discarded consumables that he has meticulously collected from urban and rural settings, transforming forgotten debris into captivating art."They have been removed from progressive lives and a savage society. I envision their mixture and existence as another world; a consumer world brimming with immense energy," Tong remarks."This chaotic yet unified installation is intended to remind us that society is an expansive arena, a battleground where countless elements compete for attention and struggle for basic survival," explains the 34-year-old artist from Changsha, Hunan province.Sino-French Artistic Dialogue Exhibition was held at the China Cultural Center in Paris on June 18. Jean Audouze, President of Honour of the French National Commission for UNESCO, Aymeri de Montesquiou, the member of the French Senate, and over 100 art professionals from China and France attended the event.Thirty-three artworks were displayed at the exhibition, which were created by Chinese artists Ji Guoqiang and Zhu Wei, as well as French artists Matthieu Dorval, Marie-Angèle Castillo and Philippe de Lestrange. The exhibition was curated by An Xiaotong, a Chinese artist who lived and worked in France. An was also the academic host of the exhibition.Organized by the China Cultural Center in Paris, the exhibition presented both the Eastern ink paintings and Western oil paintings, traditional paintings and contemporary art at the same time, which enabled different cultures and values to interact and integrate with each other, and thus demonstrated the beauty of harmony and cultural integration between Chinese and French civilizations.A new exhibition at Jiushi Art Museum brought together the artworks of Zao Wou-ki (1920-2013), a Chinese-French artist, and poems composed by renowned authors such as Henri Michaux, Rene Char, Ezra Pound, Andre Malraux and so on.Going on from June 29 to Oct 13, "Echoes of Verses: The Poetic Palimpsests of Zao Wou-ki" is showing in China, for the first time, more than a dozen sets of print-poetry collections created in collaboration between Zao and various poets. More than 90 prints and 60 translated poems are on exhibition, spanning Zao's career from the late 1940s to the 2000s.According to Ma Nan, curator of the exhibition, Zao encountered Michaux in 1948, soon after his arrival in Paris. They became life-long friends. "It was through Henri Michaux that Zao Wou-ki entered the French elite intellectuals' circle and embarked his collaboration with many of these artists and poets."When researchers study the art history, a lot of the times we are studying their friendship and interactions," she said. "You can make lots of findings about their perspective for the world, and how the important cultural trends were developed."During the lifetime of Zao, the cultural exchange between the East and West was of great importance both in China and Europe. "In China we saw the introduction of many modern academic achievements, ideas and science discoveries, while in the West, the intellectuals looked for remedies to lots of the social problems emerging after World War II," Ma said.In the Hangzhou National Academy of Arts where he used to study in the 1940s, there was a tradition among the teachers, Ma explained. They were ready to give out paintings as gifts to students and friends, whether to help someone poor or to celebrate someone's wedding. Later in France, Zao gave lots of paintings to others and received gift paintings from many French artists as well.Among the first series of artworks Zao created were a group of eight lithographs, and when Michaux saw the artworks he composed eight poems for them. On exhibition is the seventh poem, going with a print that depicts a horse pulling a coffin. "It was a lithograph work Zao created in memory of his deceased baby son," Ma said. "It is a sad story, but just like Michaux wrote in the poem, inside the trees we see in the picture, there is still strong signs of life."This piece in a way encapsulated Zao's bumpy life, Ma said. "In spite of the misfortunes and losses in his life, Zao always managed to continuously gain strength in art and creation. I think here lies an important message of the exhibition: we can find in the work of Zao the power of truth, beauty and goodness."Step off Barkhor Bazaar and into the narrow surrounding alleyways and you soon feel as if you are entering another world, away from the hustle and bustle beyond.Silence is restored upon entering one of the old courtyards and closing its doors, where you are let into the home of Penba, a female group leader of the courtyard, designated by the community, and her secret back garden.Having lived here since she was a child, the 61-year-old sometimes begins her day by getting up at 6 am to sweep the courtyard and clean the shared toilet on the second floor of the two-story structure. As she goes about her routine, she records it on her mobile phone and later uploads the short video to a group chat on WeChat.The members are all courtyard residents from some 18 households, who take it in turns to do the morning cleaning, and prove they've done their job via short videos.She says it is necessary for everyone to obey the rules and ensure the public environment is welcoming to all.Penba lives with her husband, daughter and two school-age grandchildren in the house on the first floor where she grew up. The family of five shares a home about 36 square meters in size.She tries to keep the inside and outside of her home clean and cozy."I hope every member of the courtyard also feels the same," she says.This is why she always encourages her neighbors to clean thoroughly and on time, and why every household grows potted flowers to make the old courtyard lively.The courtyard is home to 45 inhabitants including her family, according to the notice on the wall at the entrance of the courtyard that displays details of the courtyard.Next to the notice is an emergency box containing medicines for different ailments.The courtyard has undergone several transformations. Penba says the earliest she can remember took place between 1995 and 1996."The structure was reinforced while the original Tibetan style was retained. The ground was repaved so that when it rains, there isn't dirt everywhere and rooms aren't flooded." Water pipes have also been installed and now residents enjoy the convenience of fetching water from a pump in the courtyard.According to Xu Meng, an urban planner at the China Academy of Urban Planning and Design, since the peaceful liberation of Xizang in 1951 the historical architecture of Barkhor Bazaar and its neighboring alleys and courtyards, known as the Old City of Barkhor, have been renovated, making daily life for people living in the area more comfortable in the process."The renovations have been carried on in several stages," he says. "First the protection of certain historical buildings, then the conservation of the layout of the streets and the Old City, and in recent years the improvements to the infrastructure."Shigatse-born artist Trinley Dechen's current exhibition in Beijing provides a retrospective of his personal journey of self-exploration spanning the last decade. Hailing from the Xizang autonomous region, Dechen's artistic evolution reflects a departure from traditional brushwork techniques as he sought to find his unique voice in the realm of painting.Growing up with a penchant for art, particularly the figurative style prevalent in thangka paintings and Tibetan murals, Dechen's exposure to diverse artistic styles during his time at an art college in Lhasa steered him toward embracing a more abstract approach.An immersive digital art exhibition titled Confucius Code kicked off on June 21 at the Confucius Museum in Qufu, Shandong province.The exhibition showcases a fusion of ancient Chinese elements related to Confucianism through digital art, including Han Dynasty (260 BC-220) paintings, bronze mirror patterns, tiles of traditional Chinese buildings and sayings from The Analects and The Book of Songs.These elements are brought to life using advanced digital technologies such as naked-eye 3D, digital imagery and light-shadow sculpture, offering visitors a unique exploration of Confucian thought and cultural heritage.For ink artists, the pursuit of harmonizing nature and humanity while conveying timeless principles through their art has been a lifelong endeavor. When Lyu Cuixia joined veteran artist Lu Yushun's studio at the China National Academy of Painting years ago, she was already a skilled landscape painter adept at capturing natural marvels and personal sentiments, as noted by Lu.While recognizing Lyu's proficiency in traditional brushwork, Lu encouraged her to push boundaries and infuse new elements into her art to align with evolving aesthetic sensibilities. At Lyu's current exhibition at the Art News of China gallery, visitors witness her artistic growth — stepping beyond her familiar techniques to modernize compositions and explore innovative approaches to color and form.Lyu's artistic experiments not only reflect her dedication to preserving the essence of the northern school of Chinese landscape painting, known for its rugged landscapes of North China, but also her aspiration to incorporate the elegance and fluidity characteristic of the southern school.In her artistic journey, Lyu showcases a delicate balance between honoring tradition and embracing innovation, illustrating a captivating evolution in the realm of Chinese landscape painting.The exhibition of graduates' works from the Academy of Arts and Design at Tsinghua University is currently captivating audiences with its dynamic and bold explorations utilizing new technology.Running at both the academy's buildings and the Tsinghua University Art Museum until June 27, the showcase embodies the graduates' embrace of traditional culture, their engagement with social issues, and their visions of artificial intelligence seamlessly integrated into various facets of human society.The exhibition not only presents the graduates' creative interpretations of festival folklore and classical furniture but also highlights their contributions to designing community spaces, tools for disaster relief, art therapy, and elderly-friendly living environments. Furthermore, the showcase delves into futuristic themes such as men's prospective life in space and the deepening integration of AI, vividly illustrating the graduates' imaginative explorations in these areas.Han Shuo in a solo exhibition shares more than 100 works that highlight his studies of historic figures and stage characters, Lin Qi reports.Ink artist Han Shuo says painting demands the ability to coordinate smartly.He says that if you compare a painting to a stage play, the painter assumes several roles, including director, performer, and designer of the stage set and lighting.In his works, Han, who was born in 1945 and has long been committed to figure painting, presents vivid theater plays in which he arranges these characters living in the past, or from fairy tales and folklore. His paintings aim to show the weight of history and the beauty of simple but elegant brushwork.More than 100 ink figure paintings from Han's industrious output since the 1980s are now on display at his solo exhibition The Pursuit of Pure Perfection, which is set to run through to Sunday at the Art Museum of the Beijing Fine Art Academy. Several of the works being shown have won important accolades, including the National Exhibition of Fine Arts, the top prize in art held by the China Artists Association every five years since 1949.Of the three main kinds of Chinese ink painting, figure painting took shape and matured before the other two categories — mountain and water (shanshui), the flower and bird (huaniao) — which can be traced to the Warring States Period (475-221 BC) when early examples of figure painting genre were made on silk.Han's work shows an accumulation of his studies of these great historical figure artists whose brushwork focused greatly on attention to detail while favoring a minimalist tendency. Han has been exploring that style to convey rich meanings out of simple lines and fewer layers of color, to assume a pure, aloof perspective.Wu Hongliang, head of the Beijing Fine Art Academy, says, "Han has been endeavoring in the depiction of figures of various social backgrounds and motifs. Whether it is the personas of luminosity in the commissions he undertakes, with a grand historical theme, or the ordinary ones earning a living, he can address the aesthetic needs of the time while integrating his personal style."The 2024 Printmaking Exhibition of Chinese and American Young Artists opened at the Zhiyuan Art Museum in Bencha ancient town, Rudong county, on June 16. It is the first international printmaking exhibition since the museum's establishment.Featuring over 60 artworks, this exhibition showcases the latest creations from students at Michigan State University, New York University, State University of New York, and Purdue University, as well as a collection from students at William Paterson University, alongside works by 20 outstanding young Chinese printmakers. The exhibit highlights distinctive artistry in terms of techniques, materials, and concepts.China is the global birthplace of printmaking, and the connection between printmaking and Bencha ancient town dates back to the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), where China's earliest woodcut book was compiled by Song Boren, the then salt official of Bencha.At the exhibition's opening ceremony, Richard J. Helldobler, president of William Paterson University, expressed confidence that this exhibition will make significant strides in advancing the artistic goals of the museum and all participating artists.Skills that originated centuries ago among Mongolian craftspeople still used by artisans today brings about a revival, Yang Feiyue reports.Blooming flowers, galloping horses and spectacular mountainous landscapes seem to spike your senses when walking into Jia Hongwei's leather painting facility in Hohhot, North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region.Those vivid images give off a leathery sheen under the light. Observed at close quarters, they are all delicately sculpted out of a single cowhide."Leather carving artworks feature a rich variety of subjects, including life scenes of various ethnic groups along the Yellow River, vibrant and beautiful peony flowers, majestic eagles spreading their wings in flight, and proud, elegant peacocks," says Jia who was born and raised in the region."Anything that can be painted on paper can also be depicted on leather," he says.Widely considered a microcosm of herdsman culture and an important cargo on the tea road that used to connect East China's Fujian province all the way to Mongolia and Russia, leather painting from the autonomous region was named a national intangible cultural heritage in 2021.The art form evolved from the Mongolian people's long-term use of leather and has a rich history and culture.During the Song (960-1279) and Liao (916-1125) dynasties, the Mongolian people not only made leather clothing, boots and bags but also engraved texts and recorded events on the material.This marked the emergence of the earliest leather carving work, according to Yan Lirong, a scholar from the School of Art and Design, Inner Mongolia University of Science and Technology based in the region's Baotou city.In the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), the variety of leather materials used in Mongolian carving expanded to include sheepskin, bearskin and cowhide.The leather was also made into protective clothing for the army and boots for civilians. Known for its long history in processing, Zhenping county hopes to integrate culture and tourism, Yang Feiyue and Shi Baoyin report.Just when the dawn breaks, hundreds of umbrellas pop open as in a domino effect at the International Jade City in Shifosi town in early June. Beneath them, vendors tout a large variety of jade, ranging from necklaces and bracelets to decorative sculptures of various shapes and sizes. Some vigorously engage in livestreaming to broadcast what they have to offer to potential buyers from afar.Although the market opens at around 6 am, eager early bird customers have already flocked in to hunt for treasures in the town of Zhenping county, Nanyang city, Central China's Henan province."It (the market) is only the tip of the iceberg," says Song Zhe, director of the management committee of Zhenping's jade culture reform and development pilot zone.The county abounds in jade design and processing businesses, involving about 400,000 practitioners, Song says.Nearly 50 villages in Zhenping have developed specialized jade carving operations, and 10 large-scale jade trade markets dot the county.The jade-carving workforce accounts for 70 percent of all jade workers nationwide, making Zhenping the country's largest jade carving and sales hub, according to local authorities."You can find practically all kinds of good jade materials here," Song says, adding that the most popular ones are Hetian, Lantian and Dushan jades.In particular, Dushan jade is made out of raw materials that used to be mined about 40 kilometers away from Nanyang's Wolong district."The biggest feature of Dushan jade is its rich color, with seven major colors and more than 100 transitional ones, making it perfect for intricate multicolored jade artworks," Song says.Although Zhenping does not produce jade, it has been widely known for its jade carvings for thousands of years."We have the Zhaohe River, whose upper reach is rich in hard sand, which comes in handy for jade processing," Song says.There is a unique type of porcelain that appears to be covered with small "holes" yet can still hold water without leaking. Known as "Linglong porcelain", it is one of the four esteemed traditional porcelains from Jingdezhen, often referred to as the "city of porcelain" in East China's Jiangxi province.Unlike ordinary ceramics, Linglong porcelain is meticulously crafted by first carving tiny holes into the porcelain body, which are then filled with a unique glaze. After undergoing high-temperature firing, the outcome is a piece adorned with small, translucent "windows "embedded within it, earning it the nickname "porcelain inlaid with glass".Due to the complexity of its production process, only a limited number of Linglong porcelain pieces have survived over time. Today, carrying forward this elaborate glazing technique is Lyu Yating, an artisan born in 1993.Lyu comes from a family in Jingdezhen deeply rooted in the porcelain industry, a heritage dating back to her great-grandfather. In 1993, her father established the Linglong porcelain brand, Fuyu Porcelain."I spent my childhood in the ceramic workshop, playing with clay every day," Lyu recalled.While studying international business in the UK, Lyu noticed that many foreign museums exhibited Chinese porcelain. "Seeing those ceramics made me really want to preserve this tradition. It's a crucial part of Chinese culture, reflecting generations of craftsmanship," she said.Upon graduating in 2014 at the age of 21, Lyu made the unconventional choice to give up further academic pursuits and lucrative offers from multinational corporations. Instead, she returned to her roots, taking on the responsibility of mastering the art of Linglong porcelain from her father.Rather than immediately taking on a managerial role, Lyu's father emphasized the importance of her learning the craft of porcelain making. For more than a decade, Lyu diligently apprenticed under the factory's artisans, immersing herself in the intricacies of ceramic techniques.This hands-on experience allowed her to develop a deep understanding of both professional ceramic practices and her family's unique glaze formulas. She also started innovating her own techniques for glaze preparation."The essence of Linglong porcelain lies in its glaze, so I focused on innovating from that foundation," she explained.Through continuous experimentation and adjustments to the glaze materials, Lyu's factory has achieved a high level of light transmittance for their Linglong porcelain, giving it a shimmering quality under light. She also introduced colored glazes and developed an easy-to-clean, oil-resistant surface, enhancing both the artistic and practical appeal of the porcelain.Today, under her leadership, Fuyu Porcelain holds two ceramic invention patents and over 100 ceramic design patents.Lyu explained that in ancient China, the artistic trends of dynasties were largely shaped by the aesthetic preferences of emperors. Jingdezhen was tasked with producing ceramics for the imperial palace, and those approved by the emperor would be mass-produced."However, Linglong porcelain was too difficult to make, so it remained rare in the market; even our museums display very few examples of it," she said.Today, thanks to modern technology, Linglong porcelain has transcended its niche status. Lyu explained that certain tasks such as carving and painting have been partially mechanized to reduce manual labor."I believe it's important for intangible cultural heritage to reach every household. My achievements aim to translate into everyday ceramic items, making it possible for more people to enjoy the beauty of this cultural heritage at an affordable price," she said.Lyu also observed the changing tastes of young consumers in Linglong porcelain products over time. In 2023, for example, her innovative creation — the rotating cup — attracted significant attention from young buyers due to its practicality and entertainment value.However, Lyu has recently noticed a rising fascination among young individuals with traditional decorative arts."Our sales of cups and tableware featuring traditional crafts have surged, indicating a renewed appreciation and recognition of traditional culture and art among young people," she said.Beyond integrating intangible cultural heritage into the daily lives of young people, Lyu has even greater ambitions."I aim to create something completely new for international audiences, drawing global attention to Jingdezhen's Linglong porcelain and highlighting its richness and diversity. I'm confident I can accomplish this," she said.Decades ago, Li Keran (1907-89) embarked on transformative sketch journeys with fellow artists, venturing across China's picturesque landscapes to draw inspiration directly from nature. These expeditions, driven by a desire to innovate Chinese ink painting, led Li to develop a unique brushstroke style that captured the essence of the country's diverse scenery and reflected its societal changes.The upcoming preview exhibition at Beijing Yongle's spring sales, commencing on Thursday and running until Saturday, features works stemming from Li's groundbreaking sketch-journeys, highlighting his revolutionary artistic approach. The showcase not only celebrates Li's new artistic style but also encompass a diverse array of Chinese painting, calligraphy, antique craftsmanship, and modern and contemporary artworks.In addition to Li Keran's masterpieces, the exhibition will present works by other prominent figures in modern art such as Zhang Daqian, Qi Baishi and Xu Beihong, offering a comprehensive glimpse into the artistic innovation and cultural heritage in China.The Art Museum of Central Academy of Fine Arts came alive on a vibrant Saturday night, brimming with joy, laughter, and delightful surprises. The diverse audience, comprising many young children and their parents, immersed themselves in the ongoing exhibition of graduation works — an annual showcase by the academy not only to display the achievements of its fresh graduates but also to share their creativity with the wider public.The exhibition featured a rich array of artistic expressions, including paintings, prints, sculptures, installations, and designs. Graduates, alongside their mentors and seasoned members from galleries and auction houses, engaged with visitors, offering insights into the artworks and sharing the intricacies of the fine arts world.Adding a unique touch to the event was the unveiling of a digital platform, a collaborative effort between CAFA and Mofangyan, a technology firm. This platform enabled remote appreciation of the artworks with interactive elements, enhancing the overall experience for attendees. Notably, parents of the graduating students, hailing from various parts of the country, were able to partake in the real-time excitement, bridging the physical distance to share in their children's artistic journey.Shanghai show is largest exhibition of legendary Brazilian designers' work in Asia, He Qi reports.From a chair pieced together out of countless dolls that has been bought by many fashion celebrities; to a chair made of broken wood blocks which inspired the design of the Brazil Pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo; to another chair made by twining 500 meters of red thread around its frame which is part of the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, behind all these eye-catching pieces are the legendary design duo from Brazil — brothers Humberto and Fernando Campana.Founded in 1984, Estudio Campana has achieved international recognition for its intriguing furniture design.In collaboration with the power station of DESIGN at the Power Station of Art, the studio is presenting Impermanence — 40 Years of Estudio Campana in Shanghai from June 8 to Sept 8, its first large-scale exhibition in Asia.Fifty pieces take visitors into the duo's fantasy world, tracing the history of their ideas and creations."This is our first large-scale exhibition in Asia, and it is a new challenge for us, as well as a new process of exploring our inner world and inner universe," says Humberto Campana, who designed the exhibition's scenography.Marco Sammicheli, co-curator of the exhibition and the curator for Design, Fashion, Crafts at the Triennale Milano, says that Estudio Campana has demonstrated the possibility of connecting decoration and value, function and fiction, culture and nature over its 40-year career.Two bronze sculptures of the great Chinese philosophers Confucius and Lao Tzu were recently unveiled at Batlle Park in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay.The artwork, In Search of Wisdom — Confucius Asking Lao Tzu About the Tao, consists of two figures standing 7.8 meters tall and weighing 6.6 tons. It is a masterpiece by renowned sculptor Wu Weishan, who is the curator of the National Art Museum of China."The sculptures are the tallest and farthest-traveled pieces of all my works abroad," Wu says, emphasizing that the great sages of Chinese history transcend national boundaries, belonging not only to China but also to the world. "I want the world to see more Chinese figures standing tall."The base of the artwork bears inscriptions narrating the story behind the sculptures in both Chinese and Spanish. The sculptures show Confucius asking Lao Tzu about the Tao, a central idea in Taoism. Both men lived more than two millennia ago.The Tao represents the fundamental nature and source of the universe, and encompasses the underlying order and flow of all life.During her visit to China in 2018, then vice-president of Uruguay Lucia Topolansky made a special trip to Wu's studio. Immediately captivated by the sculptures, she told Wu that she hoped his pieces would find a home in Uruguay in the hope of exposing future generations to the historic dialogue between these two momentous figures.Six years later, the sculptures crossed the ocean and were placed among the trees in Batlle Park. When they were slowly lowered from a giant crane and finally touched the ground, Wu, who was watching the proceedings remotely, was extremely excited."The two sages have left their homeland, but they are not alone. They have kindred spirits all over the world who enjoy hearing them speak about benevolence, the Tao, and virtue," he says.Over the last 2,000 years, the teachings of Confucius have spread to East Asia, Europe, and the Americas, leaving their mark the world over.In the 16th century, Italian missionary Matteo Ricci translated the Confucian classics, known collectively as The Four Books, into Latin, and introduced them to Europe, sparking a wave of "Confucianism fever "and providing intellectual support for the European Enlightenment.Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching is one of the most widely translated Chinese classics. According to American Sinologist Misha Tadd, it has been translated into 97 languages, and appeared in 2,052 versions."The sculptures tell the story of Confucius and Lao Tzu seeking and sharing wisdom. In reality, this is also the relationship between China and the world," Wu says.The sculptor explains that China first seeks wisdom from the world, saying that he aspires to demonstrate the Chinese people's modesty and curiousness through his work."At the same time, I hope to make Chinese culture known to the rest of the world, helping it expand and integrate with other cultures. This process itself is also sharing wisdom," Wu says.Renowned artist Ai Jing, in collaboration with Peng Feng, unveiled the captivating All We Need Is Love — Ai Jing 2024 exhibition on Thursday at Victory Cinema in Shanghai, marking her return to the city's art scene after a decade.The exhibition, a reflection on love, will captivate audiences until June 21, showcasing 27 of Ai's masterpieces from the past 10 years, ranging from vibrant canvas paintings like I Love Color and Walking in the Sun to evocative installations such as The Strings and My Mom, alongside the visually compelling video piece My Mother and My Hometown.Visitors are invited to embark on a sensory-rich artistic journey, delving into the artist's profound exploration of nature, love, and peace. A standout feature of the exhibition is Ai's latest sculpture, Flower Power #1, a tribute to independent women inspired by Christian Dior's sister, Catherine Dior, and created in collaboration with Dior.During the exhibition's opening ceremony, Ai emphasized the significance of love in today's tumultuous world, stressing the need for unity, healing, and the cultivation of a nurturing environment amid global challenges. Her poignant words resonated with attendees, underscoring the exhibition's message of using love as a transformative force for building a harmonious and compassionate world.The Xie Zilong Photography Museum is set to unveil its latest exhibition, Anselm Reyle: Magic Shine Ray 800, on June 22 in Changsha, Hunan province. This exhibition will spotlight the German artist's creative journey spanning the past 12 years, featuring a diverse collection of his renowned neon installations, foil paintings, straw bale sculptures, and abstract photography pieces.Noteworthy displays will include a bespoke neon installation created by Reyle specifically for the museum's space, alongside the artwork Windspiel (Cured Rhombus) now housed within the museum's collection.Residing in Berlin while imparting knowledge at the State Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe, Reyle is known for his adept use of found objects and materials that evoke the industrial essence of urban landscapes. His oeuvre, characterized by grandiose scale and profound intensity, delves into the intricate interplay between art's decorative allure and the realms of consumerism and industrialization.With the frequent emergence of extreme weather events, environmental issues have recently garnered increased attention.On the 16th World Ocean Day, which just passed, Chinese artist Kong Ning unveiled her latest creation "Blue Fish" in Beijing on Saturday. This artwork aims to raise public awareness about the importance of protecting the world's oceans. The installation features a blue "planet", 100 small blue "whales" and four large "whales". Kong emphasized that since the ocean covers more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface, protecting the ocean is tantamount to protecting the planet.As both an artist and environmentalist, Kong plans to donate her "Blue Fish" creation to a kindergarten later for recycling purposes.Earlier this year, on World Earth Day, she showcased her creation "Transparent Earth" in Beijing, which conveyed the message of cherishing the Earth and promoting harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.In the coming months, she will continue her environmental art initiatives overseas, advocating for the protection of the Earth and world peace. For instance, she will launch the "Little Blue Man" project in Paris in July, and will work on green earth-themed creations in South American countries from August to October.Renowned Finnish artist Fred Dervin, currently residing in Beijing, has embraced the Latin term Carpe Diem, meaning "seize the day", as the poignant title for his solo exhibition at the Ici Labas gallery. The showcase features paintings that embody the essence of this timeless phrase.Dervin's collection, displayed on canvas and paper, exudes a kaleidoscope of colors and a simplistic composition that evokes the unfiltered creativity of a child's artwork. Each piece serves as a visual ode to the beauty found in life's simplest pleasures, urging viewers to appreciate the diverse manifestations of happiness cherished across various cultures and social landscapes — a profound lesson inspired by the artist's grandmother.Through his art, Dervin endeavors to redirect our gaze toward the elegance of the uncomplicated amid life's intricacies, inviting contemplation on the multifaceted nature of joy and contentment.The exhibition is set to conclude on Saturday, offering a limited time to seize the enriching experience of Carpe Diem.Suzhou exhibition focuses on art during Ming and Qing dynasties, Zhao Xu reports."A camera of the Ming (Dynasty of China)" is how Yang Danxia, an expert on ancient Chinese painting from the prestigious Palace Museum in Beijing, describes Zeng Jing, a leading portraitist active in the late 16th century to mid-17th century China.Of the many works he presumably painted, only around 20 have lasted to date.One of them, owned by the museum, depicts a man named Wu Yunzhao, a lyricist-poet and member of the literati among whom Zeng had commanded a large following.Donning a monochromatic robe and a black headscarf befitting a scholar-recluse, Wu was placed amid forested mountains, where he was accompanied by his own read, which he held by hand, as well as two boy attendants rendered skillfully by Zeng.It's worth noting that the scenery was done by Zeng's contemporary Hu Zongxin, one of the several landscapists Zeng had cooperated with in an effort to bring out the inner tableau of those he portrayed."Zeng brought something new into a long tradition of ancient Chinese portraiture, with huge success," Yang says.That reason alone has guaranteed his position in art history, and his inclusion in an ongoing exhibition focusing on the art form during the country's Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties between the mid-14th and early 20th century."Why Ming and Qing? Because in between those centuries, Chinese portraiture, steeped in the thoughts and aesthetics of Confucianism, underwent big changes, of which Zeng was a key figure," says Yang Zewen, the exhibition's curator.Featuring around 100 pieces of work ranging from ancestral and royal portraits to images of eminent officials and celebrated men of words, the exhibition is held by the Suzhou Museum in Suzhou city, Jiangsu province, whose modern-day capital Nanjing, around 200 kilometers from Suzhou, was where Zeng spent his most productive years.In 1582, around 18 years after Zeng was born, Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit priest, arrived in Macao, where he studied the Chinese language and customs.It eventually took him 13 years to arrive in Nanjing, where he stayed for a couple more years before making his way further north to Beijing. There he was given an audience by Emperor Wanli of the Ming Dynasty in 1601.Among the gifts he presented to the Chinese ruler were three oil portraits. The emperor was believed to have been astounded by how lifelike the images were. In the following two centuries, more Jesuit missionaries followed Ricci's footsteps, among whom were many painter-portraitists with an innate understanding of the power of art."Two artistic traditions intersected — one embraced by traditional Chinese portraitists; the other, by Western artists who had previously been trained, among other things, to carve a vivid image with light and shadow, " says Yang Zewen.Light and shadow — prominent factors in Western painting including portraiture — had largely been ignored by ancient Chinese portraitists "for a deeper, philosophical reason", to quote Yang Danxia from the Palace Museum."For them, it was the perceived truth about an individual rather than physical likeness that mattered. So, instead of going after a heightened sense of existence and momentariness often conveyed by the employment of intense light and shadow, they went for something more constant, more indispensable of the man, as seen through their mind's eye," she says.However, that doesn't mean that the Chinese portraitists who had contact with the missionaries and their art weren't tempted to reflect on their own way of painting. In fact, some of them did, including Zeng, who soon came up with what's known today as the mogu fa, or the technique of structuring with ink.The new dance drama Li Qingzhao, which portrays the life of the Song Dynasty (960-1279) female poet by combing the traditional Chinese aesthetic style and modern taste, had its preview at the Shanghai International Dance Center from Friday to Monday.After the dance drama project was launched in November 2022, the Shanghai Dance Theatre Co Ltd, its producer, extensively researched historical materials and conducted field research trips to places, including Shandong and Zhejiang provinces, in 2023, delving deep into understanding Li's life and the historical context of the era.Experts in the Chinese department of Fudan University in Shanghai also provided academic help, engaging in workshops and providing lectures for the cast and crew to enrich their professional knowledge for the creation of the dance drama.The creation team said that they focused on exploring the cultural elements of the poet's era, aiming to convey the essence of her poetry through dance and artistic expression, delving into her inner world and portraying her life insights and emotional experiences.The Song Dynasty is a significant period for the development of classical aesthetics in China, characterized by a pursuit of simplicity and purity in aesthetics. Li spent part of her life in Jiangnan (south of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River). In the dance drama, the creators worked to showcase the aesthetic charm of Song Dynasty life and the unique allure of Jiangnan culture."Through dance, we aimed to showcase Li's literary essence and personal spirit, as well as present the representative traditional Chinese cultural elements of her time, such as some intangible cultural heritages, Jiangnan culture, and folk culture, in a meticulously way," said Zhang Disha, one of the chief choreographer of the dance drama."We hope that through this production, the audience can not only feel the warmth and power of Li's poetry but also be inspired to show more interest and love for traditional culture," said Liu Xiaohe, another chief choreographer of the dance drama.Chinese-French artist Zao Wou-Ki (1920-2013) will be featured at the upcoming exhibition of the Jiushi Art Museum in Shanghai from June 29 to Oct 13.Echoes of Verses: The Poetic Palimpsests of Zao Wou-Ki will present more than 80 prints the artist created from the 1950s to the early 2000s in collaboration with poets such as Henri Michaux, Rene Char and Claude Roy, as well as those inspired by ancient Chinese poets such as Qu Yuan, Du Fu and Li Bai.Zao used to say, "If I had not become a painter, I would have been a poet." Inspired by this statement, the curator of the exhibition Ma Nan decided to explore the poetry in Zao's creation.The exhibition will particularly focus on the imagery and metaphors in Zao's prints, highlighting the unique charm of his poetic creations and exploring the intricate intertextual relationship between the visual arts and literary poetry.One of the most celebrated artists from China in the modern art world, Zao was born into a family with deep cultural traditions and moved to Shanghai with his parents when he was a baby. He then became a lecturer at the Hangzhou National Academy of Arts and moved to Paris in 1948, where he embarked on a career path overlapping Chinese and Western artistic traditions, and developed a signature style of lyrical abstraction.In the great Confucianism text The Analects, Confucius was quoted as saying: "A workman who wants to do his job well must first refine the tools he will use."For artists of classical Chinese painting, their ideal working companions in their quest for perfection include brushes, ink, paper and ink slabs, all of high quality.In reality, many painters were used to working on coarse paper, such as Qi Baishi (1864-1957), who came from a humble background and lived frugally even when he became well-known and received commissions from buyers.Regarded as one of the most productive and influential ink artists of the 20th century, Qi left an oeuvre of not only formal pieces done on fine paper but also drawings and sketches made casually and on paper that was inferior in quality often meant for other purposes.In a momentous occasion this May, the Ou's Traditional Woodwork Exhibition Hall in Zhongshan, Guangdong province, has unveiled its inaugural exhibition, Seat of Honor — Ancient Chinese Seating Furniture From the Collection of Liuyu Study, marking a significant milestone for traditional Chinese woodworking enthusiasts.Dedicated to preserving and showcasing the intricate artistry and cultural significance of traditional Chinese woodworking, the museum serves as a nonprofit institution, offering a platform for the public to delve into the rich heritage of Chinese craftsmanship.Ou Jinze, the visionary behind the exhibition hall and the driving force behind the esteemed furniture brand Ous, expressed his deep admiration for ancient craftsmen's wisdom and skills, emphasizing the importance of promoting the beauty of traditional Chinese culture to a wider audience.Spanning two expansive floors, the museum boasts a captivating array of artifacts across themed displays, with the first floor spanning over 2,200 square meters dedicated to unraveling the historical tapestry of ancient Chinese furniture. The thematic exhibitions, such as The Story of Wood, provide insight into the profound connection between the Chinese people and wood.An exhibition spanning 10 days featuring oil paintings by Chinese and Russian artists, commencing on May 14 at the Beijing Russian Culture Center, captivated visitors with scenes ranging from a picturesque church at sunset to vibrant outdoor cafes and traditional dress adorned with multicolored floral prints.Wang Tieniu, a professor at the Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University, and an alumnus of the renowned I. Repin St Petersburg State Academy Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture in Russia, noted the prevalent theme of realism in the showcased oil paintings. He emphasized the enduring influence of the Russian school on Chinese oil painting styles, citing the realism that resonates with people's aspirations for a better life.The exhibition, held in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, was a collaborative effort by the China Western Returned Scholars Association (Russia returned scholars branch), Beijing Russian Culture Center, I. Repin St Petersburg State Academy Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, and the International College of the Central Academy of Fine Arts.Zhang Dongkai, the executive dean of the International College of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, highlighted the diverse range of artworks on display, showcasing landscape sketches, figure paintings, and still life compositions by artists from both academies, reflecting their innovative approaches to art education.Urzhumtseva Tatiana, the director of the Beijing Russian Culture Center, expressed the deep artistic exchanges between Chinese and Russian artists, noting the challenge visitors may face in distinguishing the paintings' origins.Ye Nan, a professor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts and a former student of the I. Repin St Petersburg State Academy Institute, reminisced about the warm reception and artistic camaraderie she experienced while sketching outdoors in Russia.With an estimated 600 Chinese art students having studied at the I. Repin St Petersburg State Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture since the late 1980s, the enduring cultural exchange between the two nations continues to shape and enrich the artistic landscapes of both countries. "As there happened to be a volume of Du Fu's poetry on the table, I selected one suitable couplet for inscription on each of my landscapes," wrote Wang Jian, a much celebrated painter living in 17th-century China, on the final page of an album of pictures he painted for a longtime friend.Wang also wrote that he had genuinely enjoyed the friendship since the days "when we were young and vigorous".For Joseph Dolberg, an expert on ancient Chinese painting from New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the painted album, with each page in the style of an old master who had come before Wang, is a priceless item of art.It is also a testament to the friendship between two deeply cultured men who shared not only a passion for art, but also pain and suffering.Moreover, it provides a partial understanding of a phenomenon in Chinese art history."When painters sat down to paint in ancient China, why were they so often painting poetic themes?" asked Dolberg, who has attempted to answer that question through an exhibition titled Vision and Verse: The Poetry of Chinese Painting. The exhibition is on at The Met Fifth Avenue galleries in New York and features 90 works drawn almost entirely from The Met's collection.Although Wang made his choice of poems sound purely accidental, in reality this may not be the case, said Dolberg."Based on my unscientific observation of Chinese painting history, Du Fu (712-770) is the most often inscribed poet from the Tang Dynasty (618-907)," he said, referring to an era in Chinese history when poetry writing is believed to have reached an artistic pinnacle.Around 1,150 poems attributed to Du that have survived to this day offer proof to the immensity of his oeuvre, which a latter-day painter could "go to and grab whatever he wanted… to deepen and expand his viewer's pictorial experience and imagination", to quote Dolberg.But that number alone can't explain it all. "The prestige of Du Fu the poet started to grow posthumously, during the final century of the Tang Dynasty," said Zhang Yinan from the National Library of China who specializes in ancient Chinese poetry."It reached such a height in the succeeding Song Dynasty (960-1279) that Du Fu became a cult in himself, commonly worshipped by educated members of society, some of whom, Su Shi included, had used brushes to write and paint," said Zhang, referring to the Song Dynasty polymath who was in turn immortalized by his own words.This was despite — some might say because of — the fact that for a large part of his life, Du had endured, if not outright anonymity, then repeated rejection and constant poverty. "Du's personal travails had certainly struck a strong chord with those who were subjected to similar experiences at one point or another, and who constituted the bulk of the literati group in pre-modern China," Zhang said.In another painting on view at the museum, a speck of a figure stands atop a low cliff facing the magnitude of nature. The painter, from the 17th century, adorned his fanned-out work with two lines from a Du poem that goes: "The emerald cliff catches the breeze, a lone cloud thin; Red maples, their backs to the sun, ten thousand trees dense."In a heartwarming gesture, acclaimed ink painter Yang Liuyi unveiled a cultural park in Daxing village, Suiping county, Zhumadian of Henan province, as a token of gratitude to his roots. The park, adorned with galleries, libraries, and various public amenities, stands as a testament to Yang's commitment to his community, with the artist generously sponsoring its construction and donating his artworks for public display.Yang Liuyi is celebrated for his innovative fusion of traditional mountain-and-water painting techniques with modern urban themes, capturing the essence of city development and urban landscapes in his distinctive style. In addition to his artistic contributions, Yang's philanthropy extends to the cultural enrichment of the park, as he has gifted a diverse collection of art pieces and over 3,000 books to the venue.Reflecting on his deep connection to his hometown, Yang said: "Hometown is the cradle of my artistic journey and aspirations. Now, I wish to share my dreams with the people of my community, providing them with a space to admire paintings, calligraphy, photography, and various artistic exhibitions."   Ahush of anticipation explodes into rapturous applause in a concert hall in Changzhou city, Jiangsu province, as Edwin Montealegre, a young conductor from Costa Rica, strides onto the stage. He takes a moment to sweep his gaze over the auditorium before raising his baton to begin the performance.This is a culmination of years of hard work and a dream — to establish his own professional orchestra in China.The 37-year-old conductor's journey, beginning in Shanghai, has been an unconventional one. Growing up in the tropical Central American country of Costa Rica, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in conducting in 2017."In 2018, my professor advised me to go to China because there was a good teacher from the Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory teaching at Shanghai Conservatory of Music," Montealegre recalls. "It was an opportunity I couldn't pass up."So, he took the plunge, arriving in Shanghai later that year to first learn Mandarin — no easy feat when learning it simultaneously with English. However, the challenge was worthwhile when he gained admission to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music's master's program in 2019.During his studies, he became enthralled by Shanghai's vibrant arts scene and the wealth of opportunities for musicians. "Here is one of the most beautiful places in the world, especially if you're a musician. There are so many important musicians from around the world here. You have opportunities at every turn," he says.Since its inception in 2011, the Capital Theatre Boutique Performance Invitation Exhibition has gathered prestigious domestic and international drama troupes in Beijing, enriching the city's theatrical landscape and providing a high-quality platform for global exchanges.On Sept 5, the Beijing People's Art Theatre, the annual event's organizer, announced the upcoming edition, which will be renamed and upgraded as the Beijing People's Art Theatre International Drama Invitation Exhibition.The event, from Oct 11 to Nov 10, will bring together nine acclaimed international and domestic drama troupes, including several performances making their Beijing debut, announced Feng Yuanzheng, actor, director and president of the Beijing People's Art Theatre."The Beijing People's Art Theatre has launched its four venues, which will make this international event more diverse and offer a richer theatrical experience to the audience," says Feng, adding that this year's edition will be themed Jing, meaning "realm" or "dimension", which is designed to embody the concept of "freeing people's minds".Founded in 1952, the Beijing People's Art Theatre, located a 20-minute walk from the bustling Wangfujing pedestrian shopping street, is considered the flagship of Chinese drama.

The cities with the highest ticket sales include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Beijing, and Chengdu.On Thursday, West took to Instagram to share a childhood photo of himself in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, with the caption: "BACK (I'm back)."West lived in China for one year during his childhood when he moved to Nanjing at the age of 10. His mother was a foreign expert teaching English at Nanjing University during that time.In 2008, West held concerts in Beijing and Shanghai. This time, he performs in Haikou in a listening party format, with a program lineup that is expected to be different from his previous concerts.Prior to the performance, Haikou faced severe damage to its infrastructure and the western grandstand canopy of the Wuyuan River Sports Stadium as a result of the powerful Super Typhoon Yagi, which made landfall on Sept 6.Despite the challenges posed by the natural disaster, with support pouring in from various parts of China, and officials, frontline workers, and volunteers coming together to address the damage and restore normal operations in the city.An internet user commented that Kanye West must have a special connection with Hainan.

Against a pure black backdrop, supported only by simple art installations, they shared their own feelings or stories, some through poetic and abstract lines, others via lucid accounts of their own life episodes.As the last performer, in a gentle yet firm tone, shared her poignant childhood experiences growing up with an abusive father, the other performers joined her on stage and sat in a circle, quietly listening to her.Each performer had close experiences with depression, most having been diagnosed themselves, while others have friends grappling with the condition. These monologues were their responses to a question they've been too often asked, also the production's title, "What Happened to You?"Directed by contemporary art critic and curator Liao Wen, the production was staged at the theater between Aug 30 and Sept 1, as a part of this year's sixth Luminous Festival, an annual event highlighting inclusive arts with stage performances, seminars and workshops.The fame of China's porcelain capital Jingdezhen, a city in Jiangxi province, has drawn tourists and artists from all over the country and the world, who have added their creative touch to the old city, where ancient porcelain production stretches back to the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220).About two years ago, musicians of the China National Traditional Orchestra traveled to the city, hoping to get inspired by the Jingdezhen porcelain music instruments, a unique category of musical instruments crafted from porcelain.These instruments blend the traditional art of porcelain making with musical functionality and cover different categories of instruments, such as chimes, drum, erhu (Chinese fiddle), and flutes.On Sept 6, the China National Traditional Orchestra signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Jingdezhen government in Beijing, aiming at fostering in-depth collaboration in performances, music creation, musician training and collaborative programs."We traveled to Jingdezhen many times to do research on those porcelain music instruments, which are very beautiful," says Zhao Cong, a veteran pipa (four-stringed Chinese lute) player, who is the president of the China National Traditional Orchestra. "We were impressed by the city. The once old city has undergone a remarkable transformation, evolving from an old landmark to a vibrant place brimming with youthful energy, especially young entrepreneurs, artists and tourists."The rich heritage of porcelain making, the architectural charm and the porcelain musical instruments — all become our inspiration," she adds.Zhao also says that the orchestra explored over 20 research sites in Jingdezhen to study the tonal qualities and production techniques of porcelain instruments, as well as the history of Jingdezhen's porcelain-making.This new partnership will bring an innovative approach to blending traditional culture with modern music elements. The orchestra aims to explore and expand the integration boundaries of traditional music in contemporary scene, drawing inspiration from the porcelain to unlock new possibilities for musical expression, Zhao says."These instruments are valued not only for their musical properties but also for their artistic craftsmanship. They represent a fusion of Jingdezhen's porcelain artistry with traditional Chinese musical instruments," says Cui Suxiang, deputy mayor of Jingdezhen, in Beijing on Sept 6. "The porcelain material contributes to a unique tonal quality, often characterized by a clear, resonant, and sometimes delicate sound that is distinct from wooden or metal instruments."Cui says that Jingdezhen boasts a rich history spanning more than 2,000 years of pottery-making, 1,000 years of official kiln history, and 600 years of imperial kiln heritage. Known globally for qualities that show they are "white as jade, bright as a mirror, thin as paper, and resonant as a chime", Jingdezhen's porcelain musical instruments are not so well documented but hold significant artistic and cultural value.Jingdezhen porcelain instruments reflect the city's historical and cultural heritage, symbolizing a blend of artistic excellence and musical tradition. They are often used in performances to highlight this unique aspect of Chinese culture, Cui notes.The collaboration will also have musicians from the China National Traditional Orchestra to work with local musicians, including the Jingdezhen Singing and Dancing Troupe, which has been known for producing and developing musical instruments made of porcelain since 1985.Jingdezhen's porcelain ensembles, which perform daily for tourists, will participate in the performances with the China National Traditional Orchestra, allowing more audiences to enjoy the beauty of porcelain music, according to Cui. Additionally, the orchestra will create and arrange porcelain music programs by working with local musicians. When we think of music, our minds are often filled with the melodies and harmonies produced by various instruments. One category of instrument that stands out for its unique and captivating sounds is percussion. From drums to cymbals, tambourines to marimbas, percussion instruments span a wide range of forms and sizes.In 2010, percussionist-conductor Li Biao, along with the National Centre for the Performing Arts, had a bold idea to launch the first NCPA Percussion Festival, hoping to highlight and popularize these instruments. Over nine days, percussionists from around the world staged various shows at the NCPA, allowing every corner of the grand venue to be immersed with rhythmic beats.Now, 14 years later, the festival, which is held every two years, returns. On Aug 29, Li announced that the 2024 NCPA Percussion Festival is bringing an exciting celebration of rhythm from Saturday to Oct 7.Under the theme "Dragon Soars Across the Seas", the festival will showcase diverse percussion performances from artists and ensembles from around the world, including 11 from China, Brazil, Germany, and Denmark.This year, the festival opens with a concert by the China National Traditional Orchestra on Saturday, with musicians displaying the charm of traditional Chinese percussion instruments, such as the folk gongs and drums of Jiangzhou, Shanxi province, and Xi'an Guyue, a type of music integrating drums and wind instruments, which has been played in China's ancient capital of Xi'an, Shaanxi province."If you've always been captivated by the rhythm and energy of percussion instruments, then you're in the right place, whether it's the primal beat of the drums or the intricate sounds of the xylophone," said Li at the NCPA in Beijing on Aug 29, adding that he still recalls the exciting moments when the first festival was launched. "If you hope to discover something new about percussion instruments that you may have never experienced before, then you are in the right place too.Shanghai Symphony Orchestra will hold a concert on Sept 12 commemorating the 130th anniversary of the birth of the musician Aaron Avshalomov, conducted by his grandson, David Avshalomov.Aaron Avshalomov (1894-1964), a musician from Siberia, Russia, orchestrated the theme song for a movie of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, Children of Troubled Times, at the request of the Chinese musician He Lyuting in 1935. Later the song March of the Volunteers became the interim national anthem for the newly founded People's Republic of China.Aaron Avshalomov lived and worked in China from the 1920s to 1947, and served from 1945-46 as a guest conductor for the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra, the predecessor of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra.During his stay in China and later years in the United States, he composed music where he combined elements of Chinese music with his Russian roots, applying Western symphony orchestra and some Chinese percussion instruments. Many of his compositions were premiered in Shanghai and were warmly welcomed by the local critics.The concert on Thursday evening will open with the musician's most well-known work, the tone poem Peiping Hutongs, created in 1934. It was composed as a recollection of the sounds and images of ancient Beijing (named Peiping then). According to Jacob Avshalomov, the son of the composer, in the tone poem, "We are led through (Beijing's) byways and broadways, from dawn to dusk," when the audience would hear some popular Peking opera tunes, a bustle at a market place, and a solemn funeral procession.The second on the program will be Violin Concerto in D, created when he was director of the Municipal Council Library. In this piece, the relationship between the soloist and the orchestra is like "a talented child in a family, who would do everything they could to help her succeed," David said, during a visit to the old venue of Pathe Recordings in Shanghai, where his grandfather used to work, and the first recording of the March of the Volunteers was made.The second half of the concert will feature Aaron's composition of Symphony No. 2 in E minor, a piece commissioned by Leonard Bernstein after he went to the US to join his family. The symphony not only requires a large orchestra with triple woodwinds, but also incorporates Chinese-style cymbals, cymbals, gongs, drums, and wood-blocks in the percussion band.A theater production about the life story of the legendary Peking opera artist Mei Lanfang will be presented at BOCOM New Bund 31 Performing Arts Center on Oct 30-31.Starring Bai Yongcheng, the play was premiered 30 years ago.

Facial movement and delivery are two, and most importantly, a vivid imagination.Basak Ng, a 41-year-old owner of a dessert and drinks restaurant in Macao, likely has a deep understanding of this.Alongside other learners, Ng took part in a six-day sketch comedy training camp organized by Mahua FunAge, a popular Beijing-based comedy company. As the first of its kind, the program was held in the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin, Guangdong province, from Aug 21-26.On the final day of the camp, Ng made her debut with five partners in a sketch comedy performance titled Wo Shi Dahuajia (I am a Great Painter) during a gala where all students showcased what they had learned.During the performance, an audience member suggested the keyword "coffee", which led the six performers to take turns portraying various scenarios involving the beverage.The performer who received the most acclaim would then, in turn, have their created imagery involve a new keyword, creating a cycle that amused, naturally, the viewers.Recalling that a friend recommended she join the camp, Ng tells China Daily that she has been impressed with the weeklong learning experience, which taught her valuable skills such as observation, improvisation and teamwork."I hope that after this learning experience, I will have the ability to convey and spread happiness, inspiring others with my words and actions to share joy and love," says Ng, who is also a fan of Shen Teng, one of the most renowned comedy stars of Mahua FunAge.A production fusing modern dance and ancient Chinese martial arts has been praised as a landmark that will inspire people for years to come as it ended a run of performances in London on Sept 7.Wing Chun, presented by the Shenzhen Opera and Dance Theater at the Sadler's Wells dance venue, tells the story of martial arts master Yip Man.The Seeing Dance website called it "a stunning evening … everything about Wing Chun exceeds expectations", while Everything Theatre described it as "a breathtaking show that will leave you with a feeling of awe and a newfound respect for martial arts and dance".In an end-of-run academic seminar, guests from the worlds of dance and theater production shared thoughts about the show and its impact.Christopher Bannerman, a visiting professor at the London Contemporary Dance School and founding director of the Cross-Art project at Beijing Dance Academy, said blending dance with what he called "the body culture of martial arts, handed down through thousands of years of Chinese history … has unlocked something — by cleverly channeling that energy, a new movement language has emerged"."I believe for the next 10 years, young choreographers in China will be inspired by this (show) and we will see a great flowering of Chinese creativity," he said.Glynis Hall, founder of Glynis Henderson Productions who has put on award-winning shows in the West End and on Broadway and who is deeply involved with Chinese productions, said she was delighted to see a show with such global appeal."In the past, I've seen so many Chinese artists who wanted us to take their work abroad but it was hard, because what they did was difficult to export, but what we have seen here is a million miles away from that," she said. "This is obviously the beginning of a very different future for Chinese work internationally. I congratulate you on crossing that bridge."Wang Yun, counselor of China's Embassy in the United Kingdom, praised the work of the show's creative team and said that one audience member, Josephine Chanter, deputy director of London's Design Museum, had commented how the performers "flew around the stage like birds" and said the performance had "opened a window to allow the audience to get into the spirit of wing chun and recognize Chinese culture".Wing Chun was first performed in China less than two years ago and made its overseas debut in Singapore 12 months ago. The show celebrated its 200th performance during the London run and will have a short run in Paris in October, with the producers keen to take it elsewhere.Hall said the fusion of dance and martial arts gave the show an obvious global audience appeal, and she hoped it could be the start of something bigger."Artists working together from different art forms is the chemistry that fires something brilliant, when they make each other better, and I think collaborations between China and the outside world are a larger form of that," she said.

Thousands of music fans, dressed in raincoats and holding umbrellas, were so quiet they seemed to merge with the night.After the first song ends, long applause and cheers erupted from the audience. The fatigue of the early morning and the discomfort in the rain instantly vanished.Thanking his fans, the 73-year-old singer then performed the popular song, Olive Tree, with lyrics by San Mao and music by Li Tai-Hsiang. Following songs like Hastily, Endless, and Blowin' in the Wind — all familiar classics to the fans — the singer's profound voice and the gently played piano created a sense of tranquil certainty.At 6 o'clock, as the song, The Wind of the Pacific, finished, dawn broke, and in just an hour, the sky transited from complete darkness to a dim light and finally to full brightness.From Friday to Sunday, the Xiami Music & Arts Festival brought together more than 20 groups of musicians from home and abroad.

Today, Sun Island is a renowned scenic area, attracting domestic and foreign visitors."As a child, visiting Sun Island was a highlight," says Yu, a soprano hailing from Harbin. "This song introduced many to our city. Seeing the changes on Sun Island over the decades is remarkable.

I hope it continues to be sung for decades to come," says Wang. Artist and choreographer responsible for devising dance tradition based on Mogao's images are focus of touring exhibition, Chen Nan reports.In a grand hall at Beijing's Chinese Traditional Culture Museum, a captivating scene unfolds as 93-year-old artist Chang Shana and 89-year-old choreographer Gao Jinrong walk into the room holding hands.Their bond has been forged by their shared vision of breathing life into Dunhuang's ancient murals through dance, ensuring that their beauty and significance continue to captivate and inspire.Home of the Mogao Caves — a UNESCO World Heritage Site that was created between the 4th to the 14th centuries — Dunhuang is renowned for its Buddhist murals and statues, masterpieces that not only vividly illustrate the spread of Buddhism across China, but are also enduring symbols of Chinese civilization.As Chang and Gao pored over images of the frescoes, their conversation flowed effortlessly, blending reverence for the past with excitement for their creative endeavor.Their meeting was part of an ongoing exhibition on tour at the Chinese Traditional Culture Museum, Everlasting Beauty of Dunhuang. The 400-odd exhibits include Chang's reproductions of the murals, and are a showcase of the lifetime achievements of the respectable scholar of the Dunhuang art.During the meeting, young dancers from the Beijing Dance Academy and the Art Vocational College at the Lanzhou University of Arts and Science in Gansu province, performed pieces choreographed by Gao based on the murals, transforming their timeless beauty into a live dance experience.To the music of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, nearly 20 Hong Kong dancers put on a display of the shared origin of martial arts and dance through demonstrations of martial arts including tai chi, tuishou (a kind of battling techniques) and sanda (freestyle fighting).Miranda Chin, artistic director of Hong Kong-based Miranda Chin Dance Company, says that countless artists around the world have interpreted The Rite of Spring through their own cultures, which inspired her to create a dance drama that integrates Chinese elements and aesthetics.After more than 20 years of refinement, He and The Rite of Spring ("he" means "harmony" in Chinese) made its debut at French May, an art and cultural event in Hong Kong, in June last year.It was one of 12 arts projects in Hong Kong to receive awards from the China National Arts Fund 2024.The funding enabled Chin's dance company to go on tour throughout the year.Later this year, the company will take the production to France. Chin looks forward to seeing a foreign audience appreciate Chinese culture, which values harmony and peace, through music that is familiar to them.Chin began creating the dance drama in 2002 when she developed a passion for tai chi and martial arts. Based on ancient Chinese sacrificial rites, Chin incorporated tai chi and the other previously mentioned battling arts in her initial creation."Being able to devise new connotations for a classic like The Rite of Spring from the perspective of Chinese aesthetics and modern dance not only reflects the beauty of traditional Chinese culture, but also shows the innovation of contemporary artistic creation," says Chin.She says she will continue to explore possibilities for the integration of Chinese and European cultures in the future.As a dancer in the 1960s, Chin was exposed to a range of dance styles, including ballet and jazz. Of them all, she was most passionate about Chinese dances."The costumes, music and movements of Chinese dance are rich, which fascinates me," Chin says, adding that she has always sought to understand her culture through dance.Over the decades, Chin has choreographed and directed nearly 100 dances, many of which were rooted in Chinese culture. "I hope these dances will serve as ambassadors of cultural exchange, spreading Chinese culture more widely," she says.The worlds of dance and martial arts may not have the most obvious crossover but lovers of both art forms will head to Sadler's Wells dance theater in north London this week to see the Shenzhen Opera and Dance Theater company put on a show combining them to spectacular effect, Wing Chun.The show's two-stranded storyline tells the tale of legendary martial arts master Yip Man, and also a film being made about his life.The first half is mainly dance, with brief flashes of martial arts, which take center stage in the second half, showcasing the skills of China's unique cultural calling card that is so instantly recognized and widely admired around the world.There are also passing references to the enduring influence of kung fu on popular culture in movies such as The Matrix.There are set to be 12 performances in London, running until Sept 7, and then in October the company will perform four shows in Paris.Wing Chun made its domestic debut in December 2022, before its first overseas visit, to Singapore in September 2023, and its 200th performance will take place during the London run.Before the London premiere, China's Ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Zeguang praised the show and its cast for increasing cultural understanding."I am sure (the performances) will help the UK audience better understand both Chinese martial arts and the philosophy and value championed by the practitioners," he said, while also praising Shenzhen for its growing role as a cultural hub. "Shenzhen is at the forefront of China's reform and opening-up and technological innovation. Nowadays, the city is also building itself into a leader of culture."Zheng highlighted the city's role by mentioning how the Shenzhen Symphony Orchestra had toured the UK this year, and he also drew attention to a recent visit to the city by the United Kingdom's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Zeng Xianglai, executive vice-president of the Shenzhen International Cultural Exchange Association, also praised the show as a cultural ambassador for the region and a traditional product showcased within it."Wing Chun showcases the allure of exquisite traditional Chinese culture through the harmonious fusion of two Chinese intangible cultural heritages: wing chun and gambiered Guangdong gauze," he said. "This innovative fusion not only bridges ancient Chinese kung fu and contemporary dance but also promotes mutual exchange, learning, and communication, transcending cultural boundaries."The show has been well received, with The Guardian newspaper praising its "smart staging, sleek designs, awesome revolving sets, tricks of the light, a pulse-quickening soundtrack, uplifting storytainment, and above all exceptional dance, acrobatics and martial arts".Hong Kong-born choreographer and opera director Caroline Chao called it "stunning ... beautiful, fluid, seamlessly combining dance with martial arts into one brilliant whole".At a public question and answer session, the show's creative team and performers gave some insight into the lengths they went to putting it together."The biggest challenge was combining martial arts with dance," said Zhou Liya, who for the sixth time shares a joint choreography credit with collaborator Han Zhen. "Most dancers have foundation-level knowledge of martial arts, but that's not enough for a production like this, so they spent over a year learning different martial arts styles from the masters, so they were familiar with what was required."In the main role of Yip Man, Chang Hongji is the central character in a uniformly top-class cast, and he revealed the extreme level of study that went into the demanding role."Wing chun says we must be diligent and practice, and that has informed my involvement in this production," he said. "I spent a lot of time researching my character and my moves, so when it looks like we are taking hard falls, we don't get injured. We spent many hours finding the right level of force to make the required impact without hurting ourselves."With a cast-mate, he gave audience members a close-up view of the intricate moves used in fight scenes, which require hundreds of repetitions to look authentic, and Zhou Liya revealed "this needs so much practice that even in lunch breaks and at the start of the day when they greet each other, this is how they do it".Wing Chun runs at the Sadler's Wells theater in London until Sept 7.julian@mail.chinadailyuk.comOne of Broadway's longest-running musicals, Chicago, to return to Chinese stages this October, Chen Nan reports.The Broadway musical Chicago plans to captivate audiences in China with dazzling performances and sultry jazz. An upcoming tour, which will kick off in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, this October, will include visits to 11 cities, including Hangzhou, Suzhou, Xi'an and Chongqing, for a 70-show run.Director and choreographer Bob Fosse first had a vision for Chicago in 1975, when he obtained the copyright to the book by Maurine Watkins, and joined forces with composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb to create the initial version of the musical.The show ran for about 600 performances until 1979. It was revived on Broadway in 1996, and then a year later in the West End. The famous tale of love, murder and corruption holds the record for one of the longest-running shows on Broadway.Set in 1920s Chicago, and based on real-life murders and trials, it follows Roxie Hart, a wannabe vaudeville star who murders her lover and is arrested. In jail, Hart meets her hero, the famed nightclub performer Velma Kelly, who is serving time for killing her husband and sister after finding the two in bed together. When they both land the same lawyer, tensions come to a head as they vie for the media spotlight.Since 1996, the musical has toured 38 countries and has been performed more than 35,000 times, attracting some 34 million people. Honored with six Tony Awards, two Olivier Awards, and a Grammy, it made its debut in China in 2018, visiting five cities, according to Yang Hongya, deputy general manager of One World Culture Communication, a Beijing-headquartered company, which is the organizer of the upcoming tour."The musical market in China is growing fast. When we brought the cast members over to take photos in Beijing, many fans recognized them," Yang said at the announcement for the tour on Aug 23. It will play 14 shows at Beijing's Century Theater from Nov 14 to 24."Although almost 30 years have passed since it was revived, it's still the one musical with everything: a universal tale of fame, fortune, and all that jazz, with one show-stopping song after another and the most astonishing dancing you've ever seen," says Yang.Nine theater productions from Italy, Thailand, Greece, Portugal, Croatia and China will be performed in Shanghai during the upcoming ACT festival, from Sep 6 to Oct 13.This is the 15th installment of the Shanghai Contemporary Theater Festival, which started as Asian Contemporary Theater Festival in 2005.Hosted by Shanghai Media Group and organized by Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center (SDAC) and the Shanghai Dramatists' Association, ACT is dedicated to presenting in Shanghai the latest achievements of the international theater art scene, as an important platform for communications between theaters, dramatists and theater festivals from all over the world.The opening production of the festival, Angel of History will be making its Asian debut at the SDAC on Sep 6.

Created in 2022 the Angel of History was inspired by philosopher Walter Benjamin's work elaborating on the angel of history who flies with his gaze turned to the past and back to the future.An award-winning play by Thai writer and director Wichaya Artamat will make its premiere in Chinese at SDAC on Sep 19. This Song Father Used to Sing (Three Days in May) features two siblings in a small kitchen in Bangkok, where they spend three days there every year to commemorate their deceased father in a traditional Chinese ceremony.Of the two Chinese productions, A Rose for Emily by Yu Erge Dance Theater will premiere on Oct 12 at the Experimental Theatre of Shanghai International Dance Theater, inspired by the short story of the same title by William Faulkner.With the rise of the giant chandelier to the roof of the auditorium at Shanghai Grand Theatre, one of the most celebrated musicals, Phantom of the Opera, kicked off its six-week performance schedule in the city, on Tuesday. Its run will go on until Oct 13.It has been 20 years since the epic musical's first show in Shanghai, with 100 performances given at the theater in 2004.Marni Raab, who played the heroine Christian Daae in the 2004 tour to Shanghai, has returned to the show, playing Madame Giry, a role who knows all the secrets behind the Paris Opera, in the current world tour production."The city is so much bigger and even more cosmopolitan, even more beautiful if that's possible," she told the media on Sunday."And what's really remarkable is that the show is the same. It's the same beautiful production, with all its glorious sets and lush music."It's just a testament to how wonderful Phantom of the Opera is. And we are really grateful for all the people who are coming back, and those coming for the first time to see the show."Widely considered one of the most spectacular live theater productions in history, the musical composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber with lyrics by Charles Hart and Richard Stilgoe, has played to more than 160 million audiences in 46 countries and 193 cities, with productions in 21 languages. In 2023, the show celebrated its 35th anniversary on Broadway, and closed the Broadway version later the same year.One of the Chinese audience members, Wu Nan, recalls the impact he had watching the show at the Shanghai theater for the first time 20 years ago."I was fresh from university and worked in the office building opposite the Shanghai Grand Theatre. I was not well-off and could only afford to buy the cheapest ticket at that time. I remember sitting on the third floor with my eyes glued to a giant prop covered in dark cloth hanging near the ceiling of the theater."Then the theater turned dark, and the music started, I was so overwhelmed to see the beautiful chandelier lit up and falling all the way down to the stage. Later on, I saw the show several more times, including at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, but nothing compared to the strong emotional impact I experienced the first time."Since then, the musical made another two tours of China, in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Last year, the Chinese version of the musical was produced and successfully toured nine cities across the country.A concert of his music and lectures to be given in Shanghai and Beijing after the ceremony, Chen Nan reports.In a world where artistic boundaries often reflect cultural divides, an unexpected connection between two composers from different corners of the world has been created.In 2023, as renowned composer Guo Wenjing was watching the 65th Grammy Awards ceremony, he learned of Kevin Puts, and the US composer's triple concerto Contact, written for string trio Time for Three. The concerto, which had just won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition, featured on a Deutsche Grammophon recording by the trio, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and Chinese-American conductor Xian Zhan, Letters for the Future.Guo also learned that the collaborative process between Puts and Time for Three deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the poignant exploration of human connection and longing that resulted resonated with newfound significance in a world then marked by isolation and a yearning for contact."Before that, I had never heard his music. When I listened to Contact, I was very touched and impressed by his storytelling instinct, which made contemporary music accessible to a wider audience," says the 68-year-old, who is known for his contributions to contemporary Chinese music, and for having composed concertos and operas for both Western and Chinese instruments. The latest chamber music piece, Man Jiang Hong, or Full River Red, which is named after the famous poem of the same title by Yue Fei, an ancient Chinese military general who lived during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279), was released by China National Traditional Orchestra.By the orchestra's resident composer Zhao Zeming, the music piece, performed by a chamber music ensemble of the orchestra, was inspired by the famous poem.Like the poem, which delivers strong patriotic feelings and expresses conviction for defending the motherland, the music piece is also powerful and warm in expressing love for the country. Chinese musical, Su Dongpo, by China Oriental Performing Arts Group, had its premiere at Beijing's Poly Theater with shows running from Aug 23 to 25.Telling stories of the famed Chinese poet Su Dongpo from the Song Dynasty (960-1279), the Chinese musical highlights the experience of the poet when he was banished to Huangzhou, now Huanggang in Hubei province. At that time, Huangzhou was a place of poverty, and Su and his family endured a harsh existence there, making a living by farming. Despite his completely altered life circumstances, Su's love for literature and artistic creation remained unwavering. His optimism can also be seen in his poems, many of which vividly describe his experiences.Su's legacy, including his calligraphy, painting and his broad influence in various fields, as well as his poetry, is celebrated even today. He began a long and distinguished career as an official in various government positions, where he went through a series of political setbacks, including appointments to minor posts in distant locations.Featuring 25 original Chinese songs, the musical employs a large number of paintings and poems by Su, ushering the audience into the world of the poet during his darkest years.It's not the first time that the company delves into the Chinese history and the life story of Su. Last year, it premiered a contemporary dance production called Dongpo: Life in Poems, with Shen Wei serving as the show's director, choreographer, scriptwriter, costume designer, visual artistic director and set designer.After the Beijing stop, the musical will tour nationwide.The Qiandeng Lake Fringe Festival will take place in Nanhai, Foshan, Guangdong province, from Sept 15 to 28, and will feature more than 60 performances staged by over 100 artists from around the country.Named after Qiandeng Lake, a key tourist attraction of Foshan, the festival will be held in six indoor and outdoor spaces and nine venues, all located in popular areas among young people. Besides theatrical productions, live band performances, exhibitions, flea markets and installations will also be featured during the event.According to Hu Yu, chief adviser of the festival, who is also the head of the Institute for Culture Creativity of Tsinghua University, young artists will be the major force and will showcase their talent on and off the stage.Highlights will include a Chinese play, titled Victory, by young director Wang Anbang, who is pursuing his master's degree at School of Liberal Arts, Nanjing University, and mime performances featuring director and actor Wang Zi.The 2024 Cloud Super Music Awards, organized by the China Musical Instrument Association, concluded in Beijing on Aug 22.Four professional groups and six amateur groups received awards. Divided by age and into five categories, including chamber music, violin, viola and cello, the competition attracted students from music schools around the country, including the China Conservatory of Music, the Central Conservatory of Music, and the Shanghai Conservatory of Music.Firebird, the string ensemble of the China Philharmonic Orchestra, and winner of the chamber music award, gave a performance during the event.Chen Yun, a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music and president of the Chinese Musicians Association Chamber Music Society, was artistic director and chair of the panel. Nearly 70 well-known players of chamber music and string instruments participated in judging.The award seeks to create a platform to promote young musicians, as well as to discover and showcase talented ensembles and soloists.Accompanied by the music of composer Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, nearly 20 Hong Kong dancers showcased the charm of the "shared origin of martial arts and dance" through Chinese martial arts including Tai Chi, Tuishou and Sanda.The Rite of Spring is a great piece of classical music. Miranda Chin, artistic director of Hong Kong-based Miranda Chin Dance Company, said that countless artists around the world have interpreted this work through their own cultures, inspiring her to create a dance drama that integrates Chinese elements and oriental aesthetics.After more than 20 years of creation and refinement, Chin's team's He and The Rite of Spring ("He" means "harmony" in Chinese) made its debut at French May, a large-scale art and cultural event in Hong Kong, in June 2023.The dance drama was one of 12 arts projects in Hong Kong selected and awarded by the China National Arts Fund 2024. The funding enables Chin's dance company to go on a tour in various places throughout the year.Later this year, Chin's team will bring the dance drama to France. Chin looks forward to seeing foreign audiences appreciate Chinese culture which values harmony and peace through familiar music.The dance drama is a successful attempt to blend East and West. In 2002, Chin began creating the dance drama when she was passionate about learning Tai Chi and martial arts. Based on ancient Chinese sacrificial rites, Chin incorporated Tai Chi, Tuishou and Sanda in her initial creation."Being able to interpret new connotations for the classic work The Rite of Spring from a unique Chinese aesthetic perspective and modern dance style not only reflects the charm of traditional Chinese culture, but also shows the innovation of contemporary artistic creation," said Chin, who will continue to explore more possibilities for the integration of Eastern and Western cultures in the future.In the 1960s, as a dancer, Chin had the opportunity to be exposed to a diverse range of dance styles, including ballet and jazz. Among all dances, she was most passionate about Chinese dance."The costumes, music and movements of Chinese dance are very unique and rich, which fascinates me," Chin said, adding that she had always hoped to understand her own culture through dance.Over the past decades, Chin has choreographed and directed nearly 100 dance works, many of which were rooted in Chinese culture. "I hope these dances will serve as ambassadors of cultural exchange, spreading Chinese culture more widely," she said.Concerts are the latest in China National Traditional Orchestra's ongoing mission to preserve and celebrate country's musical traditions, Chen Nan reports.It was a heartwarming scene as 5-year-old Lan Mijia from the small village of Xiage in Zhaoxing town, Liping county of Guizhou province, took the stage at Beijing's National Centre for the Performing Arts on Tuesday.With innocence shining in her bright eyes and tentative steps, Mijia began to sing, her beautiful voice filling the auditorium with the sound of the traditional Dong ethnic folk song Xiao Shan Yang (Little Goat), a melody rich in the essence of her heritage. Mijia's giggles punctuated the performance, adding a touch of joy and spontaneity that captivated the audience."The song is about a mother goat feeding her kid, which kneels down to drink her milk. It delivers a message about respecting and feeling grateful to our mothers," Mijia said in an interview before her performance in which 6-year-old Wu Zixi, who is from the same village, also took part.In the concert hall of Tianjin Juilliard School on Aug 17, young pianists were immersed in a scene of intense focus and excitement. As the musicians tuned their instruments, each took their turn on stage, fingers dancing across the keys. In contrast, the harmonies of the Tianjin Juilliard Festival Orchestra — comprising musicians from the Suzhou Symphony Orchestra, Tianjin Symphony Orchestra and the Chinese string quartet QingXin Ensemble — swelled around them.The hall buzzed with octave scales and piano arpeggios blending to create a rich, collaborative tapestry of music.Conductor Ken Lam's baton moved with precision, guiding the ensemble through intricate passages. At the same time, the young pianists adjusted their tempo and dynamics in response, learning to synchronize their performances with the ebb and flow of the music.The experience was both exhilarating and humbling, as the pianists navigated the challenge of balancing their artistry with the collective power of the orchestra, discovering the art of musical dialogue and shared expression.In its second year, 80 students from 13 countries and regions including China, Japan, the United States and Turkiye, along with 12 faculty members and 115 auditors, gathered at the Tianjin Juilliard School from Aug 4 to Sunday.Private lessons, master classes, lectures and a diverse range of concerts, including solo recitals, concertos and an outdoor performance, enrich their professional growth while sharing the music with a wider audience.Applicants could apply to two age categories — young artists ages 16 to 28 and the junior group ages 8 to 15."It's amazing to see how young the pianists are but they play these complex music works, which are challenging for any pianist no matter how famous they are," says conductor Lam, who is the director of orchestral studies at the Tianjin Juilliard School and resident conductor of the Tianjin Juilliard Orchestra. "They put in a lot of effort but made it look easy."The piano occupies a unique position in the orchestra, shifting between a backdrop harmonizer and a central soloist."The best pianist has two roles — to lead and to listen," says the conductor. "A pianist can go into a room and practice for hours, but collaborating with an orchestra is also important."During the festival, the young pianists were given a lot of rehearsal time. They learned by having real people play with them, not computers. Every musician has his or her ideas and, as a pianist, you must know how to communicate, how to think and how to listen to others," says Lam.One of the 10 pianists who performed at the closing concert on Sunday is 12-year-old Evelyn Shengxi Yang, who was accepted to the pre-college of Juilliard in New York at age 9."I already performed with many orchestras, which opened my ears," Evelyn says. "The reason why the piano is an important instrument is that it wants to communicate and express the way other instruments cannot do. It's a great accomplishment when people say that you perform the piano like a singer or you sound like a flute.""Collaborating with orchestras allows me to learn more about other people's interpretations. If I stayed in my little world, I wouldn't create as much as I want," she adds.Led by artistic co-directors pianist Wang Xiaohan, who is a Tianjin Juilliard faculty member and chair of pre-college piano studies in Tianjin, and Yoheved Kaplinsky, the chair of the piano department of the Juilliard School and the artistic director of its pre-college division, the festival invited leading pianists from around the world.These included Jan Jiracek von Arnim, a professor of piano at the Vienna University of Music and Performing Arts in Austria, and Claudio Martinez Mehner, a professor of piano at Musikhochschule Basel in Switzerland and the Cologne University of Music and Dance in Germany."One of my favorite artists is Yeol Eum Son, who also gave a recital during the festival," says pianist Xu Leyu, 16, who is currently studying in the pre-college program of Tianjin Juilliard School. "I am impressed by her refined artistry, from the technical control to the profound emotion she delivered. I want to become a great pianist like her."Xu participated in the inaugural Tianjin Juilliard Piano Festival last year, which, she says, widened her repertoire and helped her to gain more depth in the music by sharing it with her peers, learning with professors and collaborating with the orchestra.Pianist Wang recalls his own limited experiences with orchestras as a teenager and emphasized the importance of these opportunities for young pianists."I can still remember my first collaboration with orchestra in 1997 when I was 17. It was a terrible experience because no one told me how to work with an orchestra or taught me how to find and correct my mistakes," recalls Wang, who learned to play piano at age 5 and won several top international music awards, including the ARD International Music Competition in Munich and the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition."Playing with an orchestra exposes pianists to a broader range of textures and timbres. It challenges them to interpret their music in the context of a larger sound palette, enriching their overall understanding and creativity," says Wang. "Interaction with different musicians and conductors helps pianists gain new perspectives and insights into their repertoire, fostering artistic development beyond what is achievable in solitary practice."Thirty percent of the attendees of this year's festival participated in the event last year, according to Robert Ross, administrative director of the piano festival."One of the attractions for people to come back year after year is the stellar faculties that we assemble from around the world, representing all the major conservatories and schools of music. We bring them all to one place," says Ross. "For most of the students that come from the Chinese mainland, they have access to all those teachers in one festival."Opened in 2019, Tianjin Juilliard School is the first overseas campus of the New York-headquartered Juilliard School, which is also the first such institution in China that confers a US-accredited music degree.The festival not only supported the participants but also engaged the local community. The concerts, including a free outdoor event, drew thousands of attendees.As CEO and artistic director of the Tianjin school, He Wei says: "The festival showcases our artistic and educational excellence while fulfilling our social responsibility as a city festival."A gala evening titled The Spirit of the Great Wall, performed by China’s Jilin Provincial International Cultural Exchange Center, was held in London on Monday.Inspired by stories surrounding China’s architectural masterpiece the Great Wall, the event featured a variety of performances, including dance, traditional folk opera, acrobatics, and martial arts, showcasing the country’s diverse ethnic cultures.The show featured 13 performances, starting with a grand display that wowed spectators with the powerful and spirited beats of Chinese drums.The audience was also captivated by the graceful elegance of the folk dances. A group of dancers, wearing red straw hats and flowing red skirts, moved gracefully to the center of the stage, with their nimble dance steps showcasing the unique beauty of the East.The art troupe from Northeast China's Jilin province also brought their show to Edinburgh from August 12 to 14 during the Edinburgh International Festival, one of the world’s most prestigious arts festivals, held in the Scottish capital.“We hope that, through the performance, United Kingdom audiences can understand the profoundness of traditional Chinese culture and experience its diverse ethnic traditions,” said Sha Bin, director of the Jilin Provincial International Cultural Exchange Center.On the morning of Thursday, about 60 guqin (a plucked seven-stringed instrument created in ancient China) enthusiasts from across the country gathered at the Forbidden City Concert Hall in Beijing, performing together in a concert, bringing the curtains down on a guqin summer camp.Ranging in age from 7 to 51, they shared a two-and-a-half-day summer camp experience filled with music and friendship. Guqin teacher Li Fengyun, xun (Chinese vessel flute made of pottery, one of the oldest known Chinese instruments), dizi (flute) and xiao (end-blown bamboo flute) teacher Wang Jianxin, and their assistants gave demonstrations, and one-on-one guidance to the guqin lovers.During the concert, they presented a refined performance, featuring ensembles and solos, and performances combining guqin, dance, and poetry recitations, including pieces such as Ode to Joy, Gusu Travel, and Remembering Old Friends, which received enthusiastic applause from the audience.After the concert, the teachers awarded certificates of completion to all participants and took group photos to commemorate this precious musical experience."This is already our fourth year of hosting the guqin and xiao summer camp. Some participants are new, while others have shared many wonderful summers with us. We are committed to preserving and transmitting the most authentic Chinese cultural heritage," said Li."Among the students, there are both new faces and returning participants. I am deeply moved that students can revisit and delve into learning dizi, xiao, and xun. After the initial novelty, they gradually appreciate how these instruments harmonize the mind and body and deepen their understanding of beauty," said Wang.The summer camp is part of the ongoing annual Gateway to Arts summer festival, which runs till Aug 31. Since 1995, the annual festival, which is one of Beijing's biggest arts festivals for children during the summer vacation, has gained a large fan base.The Xiamen Little Egret Folk Dance Art Center staged two shows of its dance drama Bailu Sanzhang, or Three Chapters of Little Egret, in Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday, featuring nearly 70 young students of Xiamen Art School.Co-produced by Xiamen Little Egret Folk Dance Art Center and Xiamen Art School, the performance offered audiences a visually stunning feast rich in local ethnic characteristics.The dance drama features over 20 classic dance works from the art center's 30-year history of preserving and innovating folk and ethnic dance. The show is divided into three main chapters — the Poetic Wind Era, focusing on ethnic and folk dance; Poetic Rhythm of the Strait, highlighting the beauty of Minnan life; and the Poetic Vision of the Future, integrating elements from multiple countries to present a world of diverse, harmonious dance arts.Minnan denotes the southern region of Fujian province, characterized by its unique origins, distinct features, and historical significance.Premiering at the Minnan Grand Theater in December last year, the production, which coincided with the art center's 30th anniversary, received widespread acclaim. This year, the show has been further refined to better showcase the rich cultural essence of Minnan.The Xiamen Little Egret Folk Dance Art Center was formerly known as the Beijing Dance Academy's experimental class for Xiamen folk dance. In April, the Xiamen Little Egret Folk Dance Art Center performed in the capital, celebrating the Beijing Dance Academy's 70th anniversary and the unique, enduring bond between the art center and the esteemed academy.The shows are part of the ongoing selected stage works for the Beijing exhibition to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, combining theater performances with online broadcasts. In addition to over 80 performances across major Beijing theaters, there will also be online broadcasts.An upcoming acrobatic show in Shenyang offers a taste of ways the art continues to evolve, Cheng Yuezhu reports.Forming human pyramids on bicycles, swinging midair on a flying trapeze, walking along a tightrope while another performer balances on top doing a handstand — acrobatic performances often draw gasps and applause for their spine-tingling feats.For many contemporary Chinese acrobatic troupes, these physical stunts have more to offer and some believe that these manifestations of human ability can be used to complement dramatic narratives, and embody the strength, bravery and resolution of characters.Among troupes thinking this way is the Shenyang Acrobatic Performing Arts Corp from Liaoning province, which has merged acrobatics with storytelling in a drama titled Xiansheng (Starting Sounds). With its gripping acrobatic battle scenes, the production presents tales of Shenyang's resilience during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45).The production is set to open the 12th China Acrobatic Exhibition, which is taking place until Sept 5 in Shenyang. The event promises an extravaganza of acrobatics from troupes around China, according to a news conference at the Ministry of Culture and Tourism on Aug 14.Over the two weeks, 36 acts, eight dramas and 10 magic shows will be held. These include 32 acts and five dramas chosen from 109 submissions from around the country. The other four acts and three dramas are supported by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism's 2024 China Acrobatic Art Innovation Project.The event has grown out of the National Acrobatic Competition, which was founded in 1984. From its 10th edition in 2019, it was renamed the China Acrobatic Exhibition, and the competition was replaced by a series of performances.Taking place in Shenyang this year, the event is hosted by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the People's Government of Liaoning Province.According to Huang Xiaoju, deputy director of the art department of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, this year's program features a wide range of productions from 25 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, including those presented by 15 provincial-level acrobatic troupes, 20 troupes at municipal level or lower, as well as national troupes, and will provide an overview of acrobatic standards around China.A monthlong training program for young erhu (two-stringed vertical fiddle) players wrapped up with a concert in Shanghai on Aug 15.The young musicians performed a variety of genres and styles, from chamber music and solo performances, to accompanying a traditional Chinese orchestra.They played classic and contemporary music, including Erquan Yingyue (The Moon Reflected in the Second Spring), one of the most famous erhu compositions by Abing (1893-1950), and Yangguan Sandie(Parting at Yangguan Pass).Organized by the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, this year's training program, which ran from July 15 to Aug 15, paid tribute to erhu maestro Min Huifen (1945-2014).Marking the 10th anniversary of Min's death, the program included composers and conductors who closely worked with Min. They gave lectures, sharing stories of working with Min, and their views on passing down and promoting the erhu.The musicians visited Yixing in Jiangsu province, which was Min's hometown, to see his former residence and learn about his life.They also gave two other concerts in Shanghai on July 15 and Yixing on Aug 13.Teen students perform two post-event concerts in Beijing and Hong Kong, Chen Nan reports.In a small backstage room, the air is buzzing with a mix of excitement and nervous energy as teenagers from Beijing and Hong Kong prepare to give a joint concert as part of the Beijing-Hong Kong Students Tsinghua Summer Music Camp. The room is scattered with sheets of music, instruments, and personal belongings. Dressed in concert attire, the teens exchange last-minute tips and encouragement. Some practice, or adjust their instruments, while others chat animatedly to release tension.At 7 pm, the concert at Mong Man Wai Concert Hall in Tsinghua University starts.During the performance, which took place last Friday, the conductorless string ensemble performed famous Chinese and classical pieces, among them Zhang Jingping's Celebration of a Bumper Harvest and Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, K 525, with the aim of demonstrating the students' musical talent, and celebrating the harmony resulting from their collaborative effort."The anticipation is almost tangible. I am happy to see these young people celebrating music and cultural exchange, creating a tapestry of youthful excitement with their different backgrounds and vibrant personalities," says well-known violinist Lyu Siqing, who is artistic director of the camp.Shanghai Media Group launched SEE YOU IN SHANGHAI, a new residential live show brand, on Aug 20.In the past few years, SMG Live has been a pioneer in China's show industry, exploring residential shows as a new business model, and successfully hosting the long-term performance of productions such as the acrobatic show Era, the immersive theater production Sleep No More, as well as dance theater shows The Eternal Wave and The Crested Ibises, according to Wang Jian'er, president of the SMG Group. These shows have attracted large number of tourists to the city, and made "see a good show in Shanghai" a first choice for visitors from home and abroad, he said.By introducing the new brand SEE YOU IN SHANGHAI, SMG Live hoped to attract even more audiences from other parts of China and abroad, said Ma Chencheng, president of SMG Live.The company announced the first series of residential shows of the new brand.Six, a musical written by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, was adapted from the true story of six ex-wives of King Henry VIII. It has won 35 international awards since its premiere in 2017. Starting in May next year, the original English musical production will be a residential show at the Majestic Theatre in Shanghai.In November, Les Miserables the Arena Spectacular, produced by Cameron Mackintosh, will kick off a residential show of eight weeks at Shanghai Grand Theatre from Nov 4, 2025. The production commemorated the 40th anniversary of the musical's record-breaking performance at London's West End. With new stage designs, it features a large British cast and staff totaling more than 110 people.Arcane: The Immersive Theatrical Experience is a spinoff production for the TV series Arcane, which is based on the online strategy game League of Legends by Riot Games. The immersive theater is being made by SMG Live in collaboration with Punchdrunk, the creator of Sleep No More. It will open next year at the Shanghai Hotel, a 40-year-old facility at the heart of Jing'an district.Play examines the heartbreaking decisions a daughter must make, a dilemma actress fully understands, Chen Nan reports.In the rehearsal room, where the boundaries between reality and performance blur, veteran actress Tian Shui grapples with an intense personal struggle that she had never experienced before.It was a day in July when Tian was in rehearsals for the Chinese stage adaptation of Le Pere (The Father), the award-winning work of one of France's most popular young playwrights, Florian Zeller.Le Pere is the winner of the 2014 Moliere Award for Best Play. A film by the same name, which was adapted and directed by Zeller himself, gained six Oscar nominations in 2021 and won in Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor categories.The role she plays is Anne, a middle-aged woman whose father, Anthony, suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Reality gradually dissolves in the father's mind, creating many problems between the father and the daughter. Shouldering filial love and responsibility to her family, Anne is under tremendous pressure. She is forced to make an "appropriate" decision — whether to take care of her father or send him to hospital.This role resonates deeply with Tian because she lost her own mother to the same debilitating illness last year. As Tian steps into the character's shoes, she is compelled to relive the pain and sadness she has worked so hard to overcome.In one sense, the destination for 9-year-old Pu Huobin, from a town in Ruili city, Southwest China's Yunnan province, on the Myanmar border, was Shanghai.It was the first major trip for Huobin, who was traveling with his mother to the eastern metropolis in early August.It involved a 90-minute car ride to the airport in Mangshi city, Dehong Dai and Jingpo autonomous prefecture, for a flight to Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan.A flight to Shanghai rounded off the daylong adventure.But this was not any ordinary trip. Shanghai was the destination for destiny. The boy, a member of the Jingpo ethnic group, took the long journey to attend a national piano competition.Piano players from 34 provincial-level regions of the country gathered in Shanghai for the national finals of the 17th Shanghai International Youth Piano Competition from Saturday to Tuesday. Huobin was one of the 800 amateur and professional piano players who took part in this year's final contest.He started learning to play the piano, or the electric organ to be more precise, at 5. His parents had planned to let him embark on the path of learning the piano, but the instrument was not available in the rural area, where his family lived, back then."Now we live in a town, and take my son to the downtown area of Mangshi city to attend piano lessons once a week. Children learning to play the piano are emerging in our hometown," says Chang Lanxiu, the boy's proud mother.When a pianist steps onto the stage, their goal is not just to perform but to engage and captivate the audience. A successful concert hinges on selecting pieces that resonate emotionally, demonstrate technical prowess, and maintain the audience's interest from start to finish.That is what pianist Wu Peixi plans to do when she gives a concert.On Sunday, she will perform at the Anglican Art Centre, a new hub in Tianjin housed in the Anglican church, a historical landmark, an imposing Gothic-style structure whose foundations were laid in 1900.On Friday, she will play at Spaceless in Shanghai, an art space housed in a former Union Church, which is more than 130 years old.She has previously performed at Beijing's Mofan Bookstore, hidden in a hutong (alleyway) in the downtown area of the capital, which is also housed in a century-old church."For many pianists, crafting a compelling program is both an art and a science," Wu says. "When I prepared the music for the concerts, I designed for the old churches. The repertoire you choose can significantly influence the dynamic and the audience experience."Compared to traditional concert halls, staging concerts in unconventional venues inspires and excites her as a pianist, the 37-year-old says.Born into a musical family in Shanghai, Wu regularly attended classical concerts as a child. Her father, Wu Ying, and her mother, Shao Dan, are both pianists. As both of her parents gave classes at home, she has been listening to classical music from as early as she can remember. When she learned a new piece, she tried to remember the score quickly, then practiced it hard and frequently added her own interpretation."Music has been a part of my life, so I understand how much joy it brings to people," Wu Peixi says. "I want to create performances that linger in the minds of the audience long after the final note has been played."A graduate of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music and the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna, she has staged recitals at home and abroad.In 2023, she released her first album, Franz Schubert, playing the great Austrian composer's Piano Sonata No 16 and Four Impromptus."I did the recording in just a couple of hours in a beautiful studio in Tokyo," she recalls. "I felt the music flow out naturally from my hands and the whole recording was very smooth. At that moment, it just felt right to play the pieces."For the first half of the concerts in Tianjin and Shanghai, she will play pieces such as Bach's Sheep May Safely Graze, BWV 208, Mozart's Piano Sonata in G Major, K283, and Brahms' Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel, Op 24. For the second half of the concerts, she will bring a sense of fun, humor and relaxation, with pieces from American composer William Bolcom's The Garden of Eden, and six excerpts from the late Ukrainian pianist Nikolai Kapustin's Preludes in Jazz Style, Op 53."I hope the diversity in the repertoire helps to sustain interest and offers a journey through different emotional landscapes," Wu Peixi says.She adds that the reason for their inclusion was to draw more interest from younger audiences, as she has noticed in previous performances that children find it difficult to remain seated."Once, I performed in the bookstore in Beijing, and there were many children in the audience," she says. "They found it challenging to sit for nearly two hours for the concert so they stood up, walked around the bookstore, and came back to their seats."Beyond technical skill, the connection a pianist forges with the audience is crucial," she says, adding that this involves not only the personal interpretation of the music but also the ability to communicate emotions and narratives through performance."I hope that people coming to my concerts can have a memorable experience, from the music I chose for them, to the venues where we share music together," she says.   When harpist Wang Guan started a training program at Beijing's Forbidden City Concert Hall during the 2011 Gateway to Arts Summer Festival, only a few students signed up, none of whom knew anything about the instrument."I wasn't surprised because compared to other Western musical instruments, like the piano and the violin, the harp was less well-known in China," Wang says. "I can still remember that together with my colleagues, we had to start from zero to introduce it to the children."Now, more than a decade later, the harp summer camp program has become one of the most popular organized by the annual festival, which is one of the capital's biggest arts festivals for children during the summer vacation.On Aug 15, the four-day camp program concluded with a concert by students at the Forbidden City Concert Hall.About 30 students performed pieces adapted from Chinese and Western compositions, such as Do Re Mi from The Sound of Music, and the lullaby Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."It's rewarding to witness the changes, and the growing number of harp students over the past 10 years," says Wang.In addition to the harp, the festival also offers art lovers other mini summer camps centered on different arts, such as Peking Opera and percussion. Since it first began in 1995, the festival has developed a large fan base.The Northern Kunqu Opera Theatre's latest contemporary production, Li Pei, which is about the famous applied linguist, will premiere at the Tianqiao Performing Arts Center in Beijing on Sept 20.According to Yang Fengyi, president of the theater, the production is a compelling tribute to Li's remarkable life and legacy, and reflects her resilience, groundbreaking achievements as an educator, and her story with her husband, Guo Yonghuai (1909-68), one of the founding fathers of China's atomic and hydrogen bomb, and satellite programs.Born in Jiangsu province in 1917, Li was admitted to Peking University to study economics in 1936. She continued her studies at Cornell University in the United States in 1947, where she married Guo in 1948. The couple returned to China with their only daughter in 1956. Li passed away in 2017.Li began teaching English at the University of Science and Technology of China in 1961, and transferred to its graduate school in 1978. Later renamed the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, she remained at the graduate school until she retired in 1987.Besides being an educator and linguist, Li is also credited with being one of the most important initiators and promoters of the development of Zhongguancun, which later became the high-tech innovation hub that has been dubbed "the Silicon Valley of China". She also set up the Zhongguancun Forum, and invited eminent scholars from many fields to give lectures, arranging more than 600 between 1998 and 2011."Besides Li's professional life, which established her as a formidable figure in her own right, the production also depicts her family life, from her romance with her husband to her life after his death," says Yang.Guo was the first dean of the chemical physics department at the University of Science and Technology of China. A pioneer of modern Chinese mechanics, he made great contributions to mechanics, applied mathematics and aeronautics and died in a plane crash in 1968, at the age of 59."Li was not only a pioneer educator but also a wife and mother, who coped with the devastating loss of her husband, and later of her only daughter, who died in 1997," says Gong Yingtian, director and scriptwriter of the opera that follows Li's story over the course of 80 years.More than 600 years old and one of the oldest traditional forms of opera still in vogue in China, Kunqu Opera is performed in the Suzhou dialect, and is known for its graceful movements and dance. It has captured hearts of fans with its seemingly endless variety of gestures used to express specific emotions and in 2008, it was inscribed on UNESCO's list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity."There are over 90 performers in the production. We also combine elements such as choral singing, narration and symphonic music, with Kunqu Opera," adds Gong.One of the theater's leading performers is Wei Chunrong, who will play the role of Li."This is the first time for me to play a role in a contemporary Kunqu Opera production, and it's challenging since it is based on a real story. I did a lot of research on Li's life," says Wei, who started to study the ancient art form when she was 10, and has been performing with the Northern Kunqu Opera Theatre since she was 16.As a winner of the Chinese Theatre Plum Blossom Award, the top national performing arts award, Wei is mostly known for her roles as classic Chinese beauties like Du Liniang in The Peony Pavilion and Cui Yingying in The Romance of the West Chamber."Most of the roles I have played are of beautiful, soft and sentimental women. Many have been portrayed by Kunqu Opera actresses in different generations. For Li Pei, I had to put aside all my experiences with other female roles and start afresh," Wei says.Yang Jia, one of Li's students, is also portrayed in the production. She studied under Li after being admitted to pursue her master's degree at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences at the age of 22. Two years later, she became a teacher at the university, and at 29, lost her sight. With Li's encouragement and a great deal of determination, Yang Jia became the first blind person from outside the US to obtain a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University."I can still recall the first time I met Li when I was interviewed for entry to the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences some 30 years ago. Her smile was so heartwarming," says Yang. "I was lucky to have been her student. She was a great woman who inspired me."chennan@chinadily.com.cnThe 11th edition of Wuzhen's festival promises to break ground, offer fresh possibilities to young theater practitioners, Cheng Yuezhu reports.For around 10 days each year, the water town of Wuzhen in Jiaxing, Zhejiang province, which is known for its historical feel and tranquil, tree-shaded rivers, brims with vibrancy as it welcomes the Wuzhen Theatre Festival.The organizers' goal is to create a dynamic, immersive extravaganza for visitors. Each year, the event hosts a variety of cutting-edge, contemporary and classic domestic and international theater productions. Visitors can attend forums and panel discussions, where creators share their interpretations and insights, while those who have simply come to Wuzhen for a holiday can still experience open-air performances and enjoy stilt-walking processions that take place in the town's nooks and crannies. With the markets, exhibitions and live music, the festival embraces visitors with a varied experience of culture and entertainment."I remember sharing my thoughts about what the festival would bring to Wuzhen, when we were planning for the inaugural edition a decade ago. I said that in about 10 years' time, Wuzhen would have an entirely different image, with or without the festival," says cofounder and chairman, Chen Xianghong.Productions sing and dance around the globe as China welcomes more foreign shows, Zhang Kun reports.As the China Shanghai International Arts Festival reaps the rewards of promoting the performing arts to global audiences, eight theater productions from China will be presented in Edinburgh, Scotland, this month."For more than 20 years, we are dedicated to introducing high-quality shows from abroad to China and promoting outstanding local productions to the world," Li Ming, president of the center for the CSIAF said at a news conference held last Thursday, announcing the list of 13 productions it has successfully introduced to the overseas market this year."Last year we saw the return of overseas productions to the Shanghai festival following the pandemic impacts. This year, we are glad to see the overseas art markets are opening up for our shows," he says.Now through to Tuesday, eight productions from China are being presented at the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.These are: Riding Alone, a puppet show about a young performer's journey of self-discovery by the Shenzhen Puppet Art Theatre from Guangdong province; Look at Them!, a dance and physical theater show by Wen Xiaochao; Forging the Swords, a play adapted from a short story of the same title by Lu Xun, produced by the Central Academy of Drama; Hi, Sid! an original musical by the Ju You Yi Si Theatre Troupe; The Love Bridge, a Huju opera program by the Shanghai Huju Opera Theatre; Ancient Ship, an original musical production of the CSIAF Youth Art Troupe; Beautiful Earth, a gala concert by the Little Companion Art Troupe, a company established in 1955 at the China Welfare Institute Children's Palace; and the concert by pipa virtuoso Wu Man.The original musical Ancient Ship tells about the excavation of a shipwreck from more than 150 years ago at the Yangtze River Estuary, revealing the rich cultural heritage and historical development of Shanghai. All the songs but one will be performed in English. The performing group CSIAF Youth Art Troupe was founded last year, consisting of primary and junior middle school students from Shanghai.The original musical Chinese Dreams in Dongguan, co-produced by Mahua Fun Age, one of China's most popular comedy troupes, will be staged in Beijing on Aug 15 and 16.Before its Beijing stops, the musical, which premiered in 2023, is touring other Chinese cities, including Dongguan and Guangzhou in Guangdong province.Set against the backdrop of the country's reform and opening-up in 1978, the musical captures the vibrant spirit of the era, celebrating the dreams and determination of the young people who left their mark in Dongguan, an industrial city in southern Guangdong.Gathering director Gao Ruijia, songwriter Chen Qifeng and scriptwriter Qin Chuan, the musical features over 20 original Chinese songs of diverse music genres, such as rock, pop and jazz.In the musical, Dongguan Railway Station is featured as a key element, symbolizing young people traveling from different parts of the country to work and live in the city.Singer-songwriter Liu Lian and China Daily's "Spotlight" program host Shi Futian visited the Henan Museum, where they experienced ancient musical instruments with the Huaxia Ancient Music Orchestra.Liu Lian tried playing the bianzhong (bronze chime bells) and recalled that she had once been asked whether musicians with an archaeology background composed using chime bells. After this experience, Liu Lian said she is seriously considering incorporating the sound of chime bells into her music, calling it true Chinese-style music.Singer-songwriter Liu Lian and China Daily's "Spotlight" program host Shi Futian visited the Henan Museum, where they experienced ancient musical instruments with the Huaxia Ancient Music Orchestra.Liu Lian played a 1:1 replica of the Jiahu bone flute, which is almost 9,000 years old, and also performed a duet using a modern kazoo and the bone flute, playing music from an animated series filled with childhood memories.NANNING — In a scenic spot among the verdant karst hills of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, a band consisting of five men and a woman, all dressed in ethnic costumes, are putting on a pop concert.These amateur musicians belong to the Zhuang ethnic group and are playing not only modern-day guitars, a keyboard and a drum kit, but also a couple of two-stringed tianqin, zithers made from gourds and played like guitars.The tianqin, or "heavenly zither", was originally played by the Zhuang as a ritual instrument to accompany chants for good fortune. It is currently experiencing a revival, with musicians making efforts to woo young listeners. The band called Dingding is the latest example.Its six members, aged 31 to 48, include three schoolteachers, a factory worker, a former media worker and a health worker. They live in Longzhou county in the city of Chongzuo in Guangxi, forming the band last year out of a common enthusiasm for music. They rehearse twice a week and perform publicly at the scenic spot, as the local government is attempting to promote the traditional instrument by combining it with tourism.The tianqin was included in the national-level intangible cultural heritage list in 2021. Great efforts to preserve and revive this artistic treasure have been made, including by local authorities who have integrated tianqin performances in primary and secondary school curricula, by art colleges to refine its artistic delivery, and by grassroots inheritors working to pass down authentic tianqin performances to the next generation.Dingding is named after the Zhuang word for the tianqin. Apart from playing it alongside Western instruments, the band has also introduced shan'ge, or "mountain song", a genre of folk song, into their repertoire.Traditionally, aside from rituals, the Zhuang sing shan'ge ballads while playing the tianqin. Sung outdoors with improvised or scripted lyrics passed down by oral tradition, shan'ge is another aspect of Zhuang cultural heritage and is part of Guangxi's appeal."As the tianqin is a relatively niche instrument, we decided to amplify the characteristics of shan'ge and infuse them with popular music elements to make the tradition more appealing to young folks," says Lu Qingcong, lead singer of Dingding.Returning for its 27th edition, this year's event is a celebration of sound and the city, Chen Nan reports.October is the month for classical music fans in the capital, as the annual Beijing Music Festival provides a stellar lineup of musical acts from around the world and a rich array of cultural activities.On Friday, the 27th edition of the festival was announced. Running from Oct 5 to 13, this year's event is more than a celebration of global musical traditions, it's also an invitation to explore the rich cultural tapestry of Beijing itself, says Zou Shuang, artistic director of the Beijing Music Festival.Under the theme "Harmony in Beijing, Global Sounds", 10 concerts will be held at different locations around the city in a fusion of music and exploration that will allow both performers and the audience to delve deeply into the cultural heart of the city.The festival opens with a concert by the China National Symphony Orchestra under the baton of composer-conductor Tan Dun on Oct 5 at the National Centre for the Performing Arts.Royal Philharmonic Orchestra returns with concerts building bridges between people and cultures, Chen Nan reports.Under the baton of its music director, Russian-born conductor Vasily Petrenko, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra launched a tour of China on Thursday with nine concerts in seven cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Xiamen, Fujian province.The tour, which concludes on Sunday, marks the orchestra's first visit to China with Petrenko and its first tour of the country since the COVID-19 pandemic.The orchestra and Petrenko are performing a repertoire comprising a rich blend of British, Chinese and Russian music, including works by Benjamin Britten, Tan Dun, Guan Xia, Dmitri Shostakovich and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov."All the programs are designed to show how music bridges and connects cultures and people, to show that classical music is one of the most unique forms of art, which allows people in any nation, background or religion to enjoy and experience the same emotions," the conductor said in Beijing on Wednesday, a day before the orchestra's two concerts at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing on Thursday and Friday. "Nowadays, when the world is in turbulence, it is important to show the world how it is possible to deliver harmony and peace."One of the highlights on the program is a specially arranged orchestral suite from the Chinese opera Mulan by composer Guan. Having premiered 20 years ago, the Chinese opera was based on the legendary story about a young girl named Hua Mulan in ancient China who takes on a male identity to replace her ailing father to join the army and save her country from the intruder."The suite that we are playing combines all the themes from the opera, such as the wedding music, the war music, and the march music. It's very special for me and it's the first time for me to perform it," says Petrenko.Asked about his approach to a new music piece, the conductor says that, "It's like reading a book, but there is difference."When you are reading a book, you read it line by line. When you read the music, you need to see the whole picture. It feels like there are 10 people in the books who are talking at the same time. That's what a conductor hears in an orchestra," he says. "By reading the score, you just hear it in your mind."Violinist Ray Chen, who was born in Taiwan and raised in Australia, will join the orchestra and Petrenko on the tour, performing Austrian-American composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Violin Concerto in D Major, Op 35, which will coincide with the release on the Deutsche Grammophon label of his new recording of the concerto, also with the orchestra.Other music works on the program will be excerpts from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon Cello Concerto by Tan, Shostakovich's Symphony No 5 and Scheherazade, Op 35, an orchestral suite by Russian composer Rimsky-Korsakov that was inspired by the collection of largely Middle Eastern and Indian tales known as The Thousand and One Nights (or The Arabian Nights).British composer Benjamin Britten's Four Sea Interludes from the composer's first successful opera Peter Grimes will also be performed during the tour."I've been to China many times with different orchestras from around the world.

Each performance in Beijing had an average audience of over 1,400 people and Shanghai's 1,800-seat theater registered an average attendance rate of over 92 percent.Wilton says of his second visit: "The excitement for me was that I had not only been to Shanghai and Beijing before but with the first foreign production that had ever been allowed into China since 1949, which is an enormous privilege."As China's reform and opening-up began in 1978, the rare chance to play a Shakespearean character on a Chinese stage was an unforgettable chapter in Wilton's career."We must have performed Hamlet to more people in one night than was ever witnessed for a Shakespeare production," he avers.The visit to Beijing and Shanghai in the winter of 1979 when Hamlet was staged left in his mind lingering images including "everyone in cotton-padded uniforms, in green, blue and gray", "the coal-fired cities", "people cycling in millions through the city", "everything being carried by hand or in handcarts or on bicycles", and in particular, people using the streets of Beijing as refrigerators for Chinese cabbage."The China we've come across this time has astonished us," says Wilton of the architecture and the vast number of electric cars and scooters on the streets.However, what impressed him the most this time was the young and "very intelligent" Chinese audience "who all speak wonderful English". The audiences in China are extremely young, Wilton says."It seems they asked very intelligent questions about the play and the book, and they seem to have read Agatha Christie," says Wilton. "That has been enchanting."What remains unchanged is the warm welcome he received. "What I would emphasize is we've had as warm a welcome now as we had then. We were incredibly well-received and treated as we had been in 1979," Wilton says.The British actor recalled his friendship with the late translator and performance artist Ying Ruocheng, who was among five Chinese actors who did the character voices in Beijing back in 1979. "He was with us throughout the trip and we became great friends."This time, Wilton visited the prestigious Beijing People's Art Theater to revisit the stage where he performed in 1979 and was received by the president of the theater Feng Yuanzheng. "I was astonished by the reception I had by the director who came out of rehearsals to meet me," says Wilton.He was given a book by Feng with photographs from the Hamlet production, including group photos and photos of the banquets and activities they attended during the 1979 visit. "I wept a little bit," the British actor says.Wilton was especially delighted to be accompanied by his wife Lucy Tregear during their China tour this time, who costarred in the play as the female butler Georgina Rogers. She attended a meet-and-greet event with fans in Hangzhou, claiming it is the one thing she loves about China."At the end of every show, when we turn back for photo opportunities with the audience, every light from every phone comes on. It was like looking into the night sky," says Tregear. "I have performed in different countries around the world, but I've never experienced that."

It was at that time that he began to reevaluate his career and life, gaining a new perspective.Today, Gao has expanded his horizons by taking on the role of producer in the world of musical theater. His daily schedule is packed with rehearsals, planning and performances."For a musical theater actor, the key to protecting your voice is to avoid staying up late and speaking less, but I rarely manage to do that," Gao admits.In early July, Gao joined audiences in a cinema to revisit his thoughts, feelings and performance from two years ago captured in the documentary series Xinsheng Yidai (The New Generation of Voices). This eight-episode series, currently streaming online on platforms Tencent Video, iQiyi and Youku, features four main characters — Gao, voice actors Wu Tao and Gu Jiangshan, and tenor singer Ma Jia.These talented individuals share many common traits — youth, charisma, dedicated fan bases and remarkable voices.

Now, fans directly view it and provide valuable feedback. This has boosted my confidence," Wu says.He recalls participating in events like comic conventions during this process and interacting with fans has become less restrained.For Gao, interacting with others and sharing his life is what he enjoys, which is why he agreed to be part of the documentary."I also hope that someone will help me record this process," Gao says.Gao says that the series captures his experiences at 26 and he's willing to continue participating in future recordings if possible, documenting his story at 36, 46 and 56 years old.In 2018, Gao gained fame through the music reality show Super Vocal and starred in his first musical, Daddy Long Legs, in 2019. After working in the musical theater industry for six years, he expanded beyond acting to become a producer in musical theater.Over the years, Gao has noticed changes in his voice, grasping new vocal tones as he ages."On the musical theater stage, I've slowly learned to master my voice and physicality for different roles," he says."I've felt growth in the musical theater industry recently, with various performance styles emerging, but it remains a niche field."As an established figure in the industry, Gao has observed structured growth opportunities for younger actors entering the musical theater domain, from small to large theater venues.Looking to the future, Gao says he maintains a mindset of exploring new ventures. With his voice nearing its prime, he aims to bring more roles and works to the stage.Director Xie Fukun discovered intense dedication within the voice industry, and each protagonist worked harder than he initially imagined.To ensure authenticity, Xie avoided using large lights and boom microphones during filming to capture the subjects in their natural states.

I have seen the increased interest in the ancient musical instrument, which makes me very proud," said Zhang."We designed different courses for those who have already learned to play the pipa and for those who have never touched it before, to allow everyone to enjoy playing the instrument. Though they may not become professional performers, the pipa will become part of their lives," Zhang added.The pipa is a traditional instrument that has existed for over 2,000 years. Its range of sounds and beautiful appearance attract music lovers of different generations.Established in 1995, the annual Gateway to Arts summer festival offer courses in a wide array of arts including classical music, traditional Chinese opera, dance performances and puppet shows.In addition to the pipa, the festival will also host mini-summer camps for young music enthusiasts in disciplines such as choral singing and Chinese musical instruments, providing them with valuable learning experiences under the guidance of seasoned musicians and artists.HAIKOU — With dynamic beats and catchy lyrics, singers battle each other onstage with performances that echo modern-day rap. Except this is something much older with very different roots.Danzhou diaosheng, or Danzhou Rhyming Sounds, is a traditional song-and-dance genre that originated in the city of Danzhou, located northwest of Hainan province.Nicknamed "slow rap" by the locals due to its slower rhythm, this national intangible cultural heritage dates back over 2,000 years to the ancient Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24) and remains popular today."The music makes you happy because the melodies are cheerful. When you feel sulky, rapping the songs can lift your negative mood," says Tang Baoshan, a local inheritor of Danzhou diaosheng, explaining why it is still popular."Sometimes people sing the same songs for hours," he adds.Locals hold competitions and stage performances, often with no participation limit, attracting anywhere from a dozen people to tens of thousands."The scenes are quite spectacular and everyone wants to win the rap battle," says Tang.Tang, 75, started learning the folk songs as a child. He soon demonstrated a talent for it.Later he found a job at a local quarry where he used to sing while working.Encouraged by his colleagues, Tang began composing songs in 1976, of which at least 13 won local prizes. Three years later, he won the diaosheng competition and rose to fame.However, as time passed, he saw fewer young people wanting to learn the art."I used to earn a living by singing," Tang recalls. "For the younger generation, however, the income was too low to attract them."In 2006, Danzhou diaosheng was included in the first national intangible cultural heritage list.To restore the art, Tang joined local experts to compile a book of songs they found by knocking on doors in local communities.More than 1,000 songs were thus recorded.The city of Danzhou has also incorporated the art form into the curriculum of primary schools, hosted art and cultural events, and promoted it at tourist attractions.Social media has also helped popularize the ancient art. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tang composed a rap song calling on people to protect themselves, which went viral.Thanks to these efforts, about 85 percent of Danzhou's residents are familiar with and love the art.Each of the 16 townships is home to at least three troupes, with the city boasting more than 140 troupes of 20 or more members."Danzhou diaosheng has developed. And every village has a big team," Tang says, adding that on the occasion of festivals, worships or marriages, people stage large-scale performances with men and women standing on both sides and singing against each other.Tang directs around 100 diaosheng operas each year, with more than 250 performances staged, attracting an audience of tens of millions.He has also trained more than 100 rappers, actors and actresses, bringing the art to every village.It is now a favored pastime for the local people.Tang notes that in the future, he will compose not only in the local dialect but also in Mandarin and English to allow more people to appreciate it."Danzhou diaosheng has thousands of years of history and is an inseparable part of our Danzhou culture."It will never be erased because people pass it down from generation to generation," Tang says."We will make it better and keep passing it on," he adds. Master pianist shares his knowledge as he encourages talent of young learners, Chen Nan reports.Amid the scorching summer temperatures in Beijing, parents take their children to the NCPA Taihu Stage Art Centre, a complex in Tongzhou district, which is part of the National Centre for the Performing Arts.During Wednesday afternoon, the air hummed with anticipation as attendees settled into their seats in the concert hall, their murmurs subdued in reverence for the imminent arrival of Lang Lang, a pianist renowned for his virtuosity and artistry in the world of classical music.He is also the idol of many piano learners in China, especially children.At this afternoon's unique event, the stage is not set for a mere performance but for a profound exchange of musical knowledge and inspiration — a master class led by the pianist himself. The participants, chosen from a pool of aspiring young musicians, include three children of varying ages and an extraordinary young blind man who navigates the world of music through touch and sound."I am very excited to be back here. The first student is going to perform the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No 8, Op 13. I played the music piece many times when I was a child but I have never played it onstage," says Lang.Lang coaches Xu Ziyan during his master class at the NCPA Taihu Stage Art Centre on Wednesday. JIANG DONG/CHINA DAILYThe first student was Xu Ziyan, a teenage girl with hair cascading down her shoulders. Her fingers trembled slightly as she sat at the bench, her feet dangling above the pedals. Lang listened to her performance, nodding to the rhythm."The piano is not just an instrument — it's a storyteller," Lang says to the girl and the audience. "Each note you play is a word in a tale you are weaving. Feel the emotion behind the music and let your heart guide your fingers."For the higher pitches, you play the piano like a soprano singing. For the lower pitches, you should play the keys with a bigger sound, like an earthquake," he tells Ziyan.Nine-year-old Shao Youran walked to the piano next. She played Chopin's Nocturne in C-sharp Minor, which is a short piece — about 3.5 minutes long. Lang watched with keen interest, occasionally nodding in approval as Shao tackled it with youthful exuberance."You have the spirit of a performer. Now, let's shape these phrases together," says Lang, pointing to the score. "Imagine you are sitting on a vast land, watching stars sparkling at night."The sounds you make with the keys should bring a feeling of dancing, clear and lively," he adds.With animated gestures, Lang demonstrated how subtle changes in dynamics and tempo could transform the technical exercise into a heartfelt expression.The third on stage was Zhou Hongyu, also 9 years old, who looked a bit serious. He sat with a quiet intensity, his fingers poised over the keys as he prepared to delve into the first movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata No 16 in C Major, K 545. Lang, leaning in closer, closed his eyes briefly to immerse himself in the beautiful melody.Master pianist encourages talent of young learners, Chen Nan reports.Amid the scorching summer temperatures in Beijing, parents take their children to the NCPA Taihu Stage Art Centre, a complex in Tongzhou district, which is part of the National Centre for the Performing Arts.During Wednesday afternoon, the air hummed with anticipation as attendees settled into seats in the concert hall, their murmurs subdued in reverence for the imminent arrival of Lang Lang, the pianist renowned for his virtuosity and artistry in the world of classical music.He is also the idol of many piano learners in China, especially children.In this afternoon’s unique event, the stage is not set for a mere performance but for a profound exchange of musical knowledge and inspiration — a master class led by the pianist himself.

You made a slight mistake but you dealt with it calmly,” says Lang. “I am also impressed because you have a gift for capturing emotion. Now, let’s explore the depths of this piece together.“Let’s talk about Mozart first. He was a child prodigy. He was also clearly liberal in some degree. I guess that he was a party boy and in his art he wanted to make people happy,” says Lang. “So when we play Mozart’s music, we should be imaginative, not limited. His music is a whole world, not just a small room. We should make some bold interpretation and be ‘naughty’ when we play his music.”Together, they embarked on a journey through the piece again, dissecting each passage with meticulous attention to detail. Lang’s playful banter and encouragement transformed Zhou’s nervousness into confident strides across the keyboard, eliciting laughter from both himself and the audience.Throughout the session, Lang’s wit and humor interjected moments of lightness and relaxation, particularly with the three students, who were initially nervous.“At last, I want to introduce a special friend, Liu Hao, who has been learning with me for a very long time,” says Lang, welcoming the blind, 23-year-old Liu, who is pursuing his studies in the United States, at the Peabody Conservatory, Johns Hopkins University, Maryland.Liu plays Debussy’s Clair de Lune. As he finished the last note, Lang couldn’t help clapping, cheering his performance.“When we first met, Liu Hao was 6 years-old. Now, he is a young man and soon he will be a touring pianist. I am so proud of you,” says Lang.Born in Chifeng, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Liu was blind from birth and displayed his music talent at the age of 3. His mother Kang Guiqin has been devoting herself to helping her son to learn the piano after sensing his talent.“We not only studied together but also performed onstage together. He works very hard and makes progress fast. It doesn’t matter if you are young or old, sighted or blind. What matters is the passion within you, waiting to be unleashed,” says Lang.In 2021, Lang opened his studio at the NCPA Taihu Stage Art Centre, where his photos, albums and trophies are displayed, including an award certificate from 1989, which shows the pianist, 7 years old then, winning a piano competition in his hometown in Liaoning province.Since then, he has been giving master classes to children when he returns to Beijing, despite his hectic schedule.“I want to share with the children that master classes are not just about techniques but bring a transformative journey of self-discovery, a glimpse into the boundless possibilities that music offers,” he says.On Wednesday, Lang made his debut at the Beijing Performing Arts Centre, near the Grand Canal in Tongzhou, one of the most important waterways in ancient China.During his recital, the pianist played works by composers, including Robert Schumann’s Kreisleriana, Op 16, Gabriel Faure’s Pavane, Op 50 and 12 of Chopin’s mazurkas.Actresses from the Ulan Muqir troupe of Sonid Right Banner in Xiliin Gol League, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, perform for herdsmen in a yurt in November. Nomadic families living in remote areas have limited access to cultural events. WANG KAIYAN/XINHUATraveling troupes of entertainers give audiences in remote grassland areas shows to remember, Deng Zhangyu reports.As Guo Liru and her troupe approached a village in a remote area in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region last month, the crackle of firecrackers erupted in the air. This was a signal to the villagers that a troupe had arrived, and a call to gather and watch their performance.Two decades ago, when Guo journeyed to remote grassland pastures, the signal was delivered in even more picturesque fashion. Residents would ride out a day in advance of their arrival, galloping from yurt to yurt to spread word to each nomadic family: "Come tomorrow, the performance is not to be missed".Regardless of the method of notification, a crowd of enthusiastic spectators still awaits Guo and her troupe, and the 59-year-old singer's passion for her audience remains unchanged.She is a performer with one of the Ulan Muqir troupes of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. Meaning "red bud "in Mongolian, the Ulan Muqir troupes originated in this vast grassland. They travel from one encampment to another, performing for herders who live in remote regions."No matter how far the distance, we make our way to the same pastures to perform each year. Our audiences are like family to us," Guo says.After each performance, elderly women often kiss her on the head and invite her to return the following year. With the grassland as its stage and the vast sky as its backdrop, the troupe's repertoire includes singing, dancing and performing small skits, all inspired by the daily lives of local people.Chinese dancer Liu Yan performs in the production Handling Hands, which premiered at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing on July 6. LI XIAOCAO/FOR CHINA DAILYSino-Swiss production discovers new creativity in physical limitations, pushing the boundaries of art, Cheng Yuezhu reports.As dancers, Liu Yan and Alessandro Schiattarella come from different backgrounds — Liu, born and raised in China, specializes in traditional Chinese dance, while Schiattarella, who comes from Switzerland, is trained in ballet.Yet in a new dance theater production, Handling Hands, staged at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing on July 6 and 7, they joined hands, a motif key to both their personal and creative journeys.Schiattarella received ballet training when he was young, but since the age of 15, he has been affected by Hirayama disease, a neurological disorder that gradually weakens the muscles in the hands.The disorder hinders the performance of certain hand gestures required in ballet. For some time, he tried to conceal the deterioration by taping his hands up, and continued to perform onstage."I was good enough to stay, but my hands could not keep up with my other talents. I had this clash between what my body could do and what it could not do in ballet. This slowly made me realize that these challenges can be very heavy in the long term. From then on, I tried to detach for a moment from the canons of beauty in ballet," he says.Schiattarella began to face the weakness in his hands through dance productions, notably Altrove+, a solo dance he performed earlier this year in Beijing, which integrates choreographic elements centered on his hands.The seed for the Sino-Swiss production Handling Hands germinated in May 2023, when Ge Huichao, founder of Beijing Body On&On Cultural Exchange Center, took a trip to Europe.In 2019, Ge established the annual Luminous Festival, which centers on inclusive arts and organizes lectures, forum discussions, stage productions and screenings to promote inclusiveness and equality.Upon learning about Schiattarella, Ge immediately thought of Liu. Inspired by the similar changes to their lives, she envisioned a dance project that would connect them.An acclaimed classical Chinese dancer, Liu was chosen as lead dancer for a performance during the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing, but an accident during a rehearsal resulted in spinal injuries.Hand dancing became Liu's new form of expression, and after finishing a doctoral degree, she became a professor at the Beijing Dance Academy. Her research includes the hand movements in classical Chinese dance, as well as their relationship to Buddhist mudras (symbolic hand gestures)."Over the past 16 years, as I have started to reexamine dance, I feel that my perception has broadened. I still find traditional Chinese dance extremely beautiful, but there are other elements in dance that are more encompassing, powerful, and possess a different quality," Liu says."Another insight is that a new dimension of my life has opened up. While I used to focus solely on performing, I have now also begun to create, teach and research."When the two dancers first met, they jotted their interests down on paper in an attempt to find common directions to explore as part of a collaborative production."The topic of hands was there from almost the first moment, because Liu Yan wrote two books about hands, and I created work about hands that was also presented here in China. This was our first point of connection, and was very strong," Schiattarella says.Chinese director Huang Ying first embarked on his creative journey to envision a play about classical philosopher, Confucius (551-479 BC), who has had a lasting impact on Chinese culture and is a symbol of traditional culture, in 2008. Fourteen years later, he finally completed the initial draft of the play that he titled What Are We Talking About When We Talk About Confucius?Since its premiere in July 2023, the theatrical marathon, which is about seven hours in length, has taken audiences on an adventure. Huang is both director and co-scriptwriter and his play delves deep into historical fact and research, blending it with his own reflections on the philosopher and some tweaks to his story.Between July 5 and 7, and again between July 12 and 14, this play is being staged in Beijing at the Pioneer Theatre, one of the theaters under the National Theatre of China.With two intermissions, it covers only a portion of Confucius' life — from birth to his departure from the state of Lu, in modern-day Shandong province, at the age of 55."Chinese people grew up reading classic texts illustrating the core value and belief systems of Confucianism, even as small children. Confucius' sayings and ideas are everywhere in our daily lives, in textbooks, TV shows and movies. He seems to be someone we are familiar with," says Huang. "But as the title of the play suggests, I wanted to ask the question of what we are talking about when we talk about Confucius. It's also a question that I pose to the audience, who may have their own answers after watching the play."From renowned pianists Martha Argerich and Krystian Zimerman to Grammy award-winning jazz musician Herbie Hancock and Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, the Shanghai Oriental Art Center announced a star-studded autumn/winter season for 2024-25 last week.The theater released a series of 92 shows for 52 productions on July 5 for the upcoming season, which will run from September to January 2025.About 70 percent of the productions will come from overseas, according to Lei Wen, general manager of the Shanghai theater.World-celebrated classical pianist Argerich from Argentina will present two concerts at the Shanghai center on Nov 4 and 5 with violinist Gil Shaham, cellist Mischa Maisky and young pianist Theodosia Ntokou.Known among music lovers as "the reigning high priestess of the piano", Argerich turned 83 this year. When she held her debut concert at Shanghai Symphony Hall in 2019, tickets sold out immediately and music lovers feared it would be her last appearance in Shanghai.The announcement of her upcoming concerts aroused excitement among audiences and journalists at the news conference, who raised their mobile phones to take photos.One of the most recognized halls for symphony concerts in Shanghai, the SHOAC will receive a series of globally recognized orchestras in the new season. The London Symphony Orchestra will be the first to visit, led by its new chief conductor Antonio Pappano, and joined by Chinese pianist Yuja Wang to present three concerts from Oct 8 to 10.On Oct 20, Russian conductor Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra will make their fourth visit to the center, presenting compositions by Mussorgsky, Shostakovich and Tchaikovsky.The esteemed Vienna Philharmonic, led by conductor Andris Nelsons alongside solo pianist Yefim Bronfman, will perform at the center on Oct 30 and 31. In 2016, the Austrian music company signed a partnership with the Shanghai center, promising to hold concerts there annually from 2017. The company managed to perform in Shanghai three years in a row from 2017 to 2019 but was interrupted by the pandemic.The return of the Vienna Philharmonic after five years "could lead to further collaboration and more concerts in Shanghai", Lei tells China Daily.Teodor Currentzis, a rising star in the classical music scene, made his debut in China last year and the Greek conductor will return to Shanghai on Nov 20 and 21 with his MusicAeterna Orchestra playing the works of Wagner, Mahler, Brahms and Shostakovich.The Sao Paulo Symphony Orchestra will play under the baton of Thierry Fischer, violinist Guido Sant'Anna and Chinese soprano Huang Ying at a concert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Sino-Brazilian diplomatic ties.Looking forward to her performance of Bachianas Brasileiras No 5 at the concert, Huang says: "This will be the first time I sing this piece with an authentic Brazilian orchestra."Many years ago, I performed the piece with the 12 Cellists Ensemble of the Berliner Philharmoniker. I was very touched by the beauty of the music and I am confident I will interpret it well and pass on its beauty," Huang says. "Imagine the anticipation as you approach an exhibit dedicated to ancient civilizations. It's a moment akin to hearing the opening chords of a favorite melody," says singer-songwriter Liu Lian, when asked about her recent visit to Henan Museum in Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan province."It's just like the songs of your favorite singer that you've listened to hundreds of times. The artifacts, once distant images in textbooks, are now right in front of you in tangible form," she adds. "Each visit to a museum unfolds like a song, with artifacts resonating like familiar tunes, stirring memories and emotions."The 34-year-old, who rose to fame as one of the members of the pop duo, Mr Miss, graduated from the School of Archaeology and Museology, Peking University, in 2012.Despite her career in music, Liu says that she has always enjoyed visiting museums around the world and is enchanted by artifacts from thousands of years ago.While at the Henan Museum, she saw the Jiahu bone flute. Unearthed from Jiahu Site in Wuyang county, Henan, it is one of the most spectacular objects in the museum's collection, and attracts lots of visitors.The introduction that guides from the museum gave her about the bone flute was intriguing. They said that about 8,700 years ago, a red-crowned crane died and one of the bones from its wing was turned into a flute by drilling holes in it to make music.When Liu was invited to a live performance of the Huaxia Ancient Music Orchestra, the museum's resident ensemble, which is known for reviving ancient musical traditions and which performs using 10 replicas of ancient musical instruments from the museum, she was able to hear a duplicate of the Jiahu flute in action."Like many other artifacts in the museum, these silent objects speak volumes about the lives lived centuries ago. Thanks to the orchestra and the people who replicated ancient musical instruments, we are able to enjoy the sound of instruments from thousands of years ago, which is a magical experience," she says."Much like a masterful conductor interpreting Mozart or Beethoven, historians and curators meticulously present these artifacts to resonate with visitors, turning the museum visit into an immersive experience, and reconnecting us with icons of history in a profoundly personal manner," she adds. "I couldn't help wondering who originally played those instruments, and when, where, and who they played for."Besides the Jiahu flute, Liu also enjoyed performances on other ancient replicas, such as a drum and a panpipe. Even more exciting for her was the opportunity to play a set of replica bianzhong (bronze chime bells) from the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC).Standing in front of the bianzhong, which were hanging from a wooden frame, Liu struck them with a wooden mallet. Under the guidance of Huo Kun, head of the orchestra, she quickly learned how to play simple notes, with each bell producing two different tones depending on where they are struck.She was also told that the bianzhong, which were used as polyphonic instruments, were an important part of Chinese ritual and court music going back to ancient times. To make their performances more attractive to young people, the orchestra has adapted popular songs, including from Harry Potter soundtracks. This prompted Liu to play some of her songs on the instrument."It was so inspiring. Seeing these artifacts up close in the museum, admiring their craftsmanship, and pondering the lives of those who made and used them offered me a deeper understanding of history's multifaceted tapestry. Now, I want to record the sound of them to use in my own work," Liu says. "It will be a beautiful combination, and will allow more people to enjoy sounds that are ancient, and yet still charming."She also says that the visit to Henan Museum reminded her of university, when her teacher would take the class on field trips to experience excavations firsthand and make records of archaeological sites.Russian ballerina Natalia Osipova, a principal of the British Royal Ballet, holds her debut performance in Shanghai this week.Premiering tonight at the Shanghai Grand Theatre is Force of Nature, a ballet gala featuring Osipova and other internationally renowned dancers, such as Jason Kittelberger, Anna Tsygankova, Giorgi Potskhishvili, Daria Pavlenko, and Joseph Kudra.What if a 9,000-year bone flute could be used in the performance of contemporary music, like the themes of the Harry Potter movies, or online games like League of Legends? By using replicas of cultural relics, such as a bone flute and bianzhong (chime bells), the Huaxia Ancient Music Orchestra of the Henan Museum has already made it happen, and become one of the institution's major attractions.To check out China Daily's online exclusive interview with the orchestra and singer-songwriter Liu Lian, and to hear the sound of the past, today, just click the video. The hit music reality show Riding Wind is a stage production showcasing female talent. Since its inception in 2020, it has been a platform for women over 30 to display their charms and talents through various pop music performances.As a spotlight illuminated the vast, empty stage, the camera slowly zoomed in to reveal a handsome figure dressed in exquisite hanfu.Holding a folding fan and radiating an heroic aura through eyes, the performer presented a Yueju Opera song with delicate vocals, portraying the image of a carefree, unambitious knight-errant of ancient China.As the performance concluded, the audience waved red glow sticks and loudly chanted "Chen Lijun", the performer's name, over and over.The energy was palpable, with enthusiastic screams and waving red lights that created an atmosphere more electrifying than a show put on by a pop star.On Friday, the renowned Trio Wanderer from France mesmerized the audience at the Beijing Concert Hall with a captivating concert featuring the chamber music works of Austrian composer Franz Schubert.Comprising three musicians — pianist Vincent Coq, violinist Jean-Marc Phillips-Varjabedian, and cellist Raphael Pidoux — the trio delivered a stellar performance, showcasing Schubert's masterpieces including Piano Trio No. 1 in B-flat Major, Op. 99, Adagio in E-flat Major, Op. posth. 148, D. 897, and Piano Trio in E-flat, Op. 100.What do you expect to hear and see when you attend a concert given by an erhu virtuoso?"I want those with a general idea of the erhu to put aside their impressions, and I hope those who have never seen an erhu concert will get to know the instrument with a fresh eye," says Jiang Jianhua, an erhu player.In the world of traditional Chinese music, Jiang is a luminary, celebrated for her mastery of the traditional two-stringed bowed instrument, which is revered for its emotional sound and rich cultural heritage.The erhu virtuoso will be in concert with pipa (a short-necked, four-stringed lute) player Yang Baoyuan, jazz pianist Huang Jianyi and cellist Mo Mo, on Friday at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing.It will not be Jiang's first time playing chamber music. In 2021, she performed selections from operas, symphonies and chamber music with a string quartet at the NCPA."It's rare for a chamber music concert to feature an erhu, since it is usually played solo or in a big ensemble. I want to offer the audience a fresh take on the erhu and allow them to enjoy the traditional instrument as they never have before," says 63-year-old Jiang, who is a retired professor of the Central Conservatory of Music.During the upcoming concert, she has adapted pieces including Blooming Flowers and Full Moon by composer and conductor Huang Yijun (1915-95), and Carmen Fantasie from French composer Bizet's opera, Carmen. She has also adapted a piece Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto wrote for The Last Emperor, a Bernardo Bertolucci movie that won nine Academy Awards in 1988, including for its soundtrack.For Jiang, the choice carries a deeper meaning.The Forbidden City Concert Hall in Beijing came alive on Friday with the commencement of the annual Gateway to Arts summer festival.

This two-day competition, held during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday on June 9 and 10, was a qualifier for dancers aiming to join the prestigious Electric Boogaloos Family and EB Kids.When a DJ drops the beat at a street dance competition, the dancer's body responds instantly, captivating the audience with a freestyle performance.The Electric Boogaloos, founded by Boogaloo Sam in 1977, are iconic in the popping dance style, having appeared on Soul Train and choreographed for Michael Jackson.Their legacy continues globally through teaching and performances. Its principal members starred in the iconic dance film Breakin'.They then began traveling overseas to teach in Japan, France, South Korea and China, leading to the rise of many world-renowned street dancers who then developed into the EB family, a group dedicated to carrying on the style and tradition.Li, a 28-year-old dancer and dance teacher born and raised in Fuzhou, Fujian province, successfully joined the EB family as a result of an epic battle with the well-known Korean dancer Dokyun during the finals of SFB's open age group competition.Dressed in black, the two young men displayed their command of EB style elements including the twist-o-flex, the master flex, the Old Man, the Puppet and the Scarecrow, as well as their own understanding of body language, music and space. Since a typical popping routine involves quick jumps and the popping of muscles, they demonstrate an extremely precise control of their muscles while dancing freestyle and react quickly to the melody and beat.Popping dancer and SFB co-founder Hu Hongjun and his team are the organizers behind SFB, while Popin Pete, one of the founding members of the Electric Boogaloos, is a co-founder of the event, which includes a training camp, competitions and lectures."SFB emphasizes the passing on of traditions and creation. All dance cultures have historical and cultural roots, and the more cultural elements are absorbed, the greater potential value is gained for further development," Hu says.Shanghai Oriental Art Center (SHOAC) will join hands with the Tchaikovsky Moscow State Conservatory in Russia to host a five-week long educational project in August.A series of events, such as concerts by professors and the Chinese alumni of the conservatory, the SHOAC-Moscow Conservatory Summer Piano Academy, and a picture exhibition on the 160-year history of the esteemed Russian institution, will take place at the Shanghai Theater from Aug 18 to Sept 21.Last year SHOAC signed its second five-year strategic cooperation framework with the conservatory.

The story revolves around a group of young people — members of the Communist Party of China, who use drama to encourage people to fight for the nation.They also use drama to fight enemies and to accomplish their secret missions."Unlike traditional theater, where the stage is a distant platform and the audience remains seated, environmental theater invites participants to roam freely through intricately designed spaces, interacting with performers, exploring scenes from multiple angles, and becoming integral parts of the story themselves," says director Xue Senyu."At its core, environmental theater transforms the traditional theater setting into a playground of possibilities."Xue notes that the script of Fighting of Art has been revised for more than a year. Unlike traditional scripts, which rely on fixed staging and audience perspective, environmental theater scripts must account for the interactive nature of the performance. The script has to create pathways that allow for multiple audience participants, ensuring that each participant's experience remains cohesive and compelling while offering opportunities for exploration and discovery.The creative team of Fighting of Art has used elements of jubensha, which is a role-playing murder mystery game popular among young Chinese people."This production appeals particularly to young audiences who crave experiences that are not only visually and emotionally stimulating but also interactive and participatory," Xue says.In the Tang Dynasty (618-907), a genre of fictional short stories called chuanqi (legends) with themes of heroism, romance and fantasy, embodied the rich imagination of ancient people. Chuanqi endured for generations to influence literature, TV series, films and stage productions.Theater director, dancer and choreographer Zheng Jie has been a fan of these stories since he was young. He was inspired to interpret some of his favorite stories through dance, which he developed into the choreodrama series Three Rules of Admonition.A choreodrama is a drama expressed in dance or with dance as an integral part of its content, performed by a group of dancers.From June 23 to 24, the second production of the series The Tiger Man by Zheng Jie Dance Theater held two performances at the Sibiu International Theatre Festival in Romania.The story is based on a legend from the late Tang Dynasty Ren Hu Zhuan (Tale of the Man Tiger), which was later adapted by Japanese author Atsushi Nakajima into the famed short story The Moon Over the Mountain.Zheng's work is an adaptation merging both versions. The story centers on Li Zheng who gives up his career as a Tang Dynasty official to pursue his aspiration of becoming an accomplished poet. However, his literary pursuits fail, and defeated, he eventually transforms into a tiger."When I first read the story, it resonated deeply," Zheng says. At the time, he was working on the first part of the series, The Assassin, which is based on the tale of Nie Yinniang, a girl who grows up to be an assassin and a recluse."While Nie Yinniang embodies a journey of growing up and deciding who she wants to become, the tiger man starts his life at the peak but gradually falls into disillusionment and emptiness."Yao Shuo, the production's dramaturge, says he sees the dilemma in the story between people's expectations of themselves and reality."This story mirrors the lives of many average individuals who have similar experiences to the protagonist — doing well as students and believing that they will achieve great things only to find themselves in mundane jobs. Facing such disappointment, they might gradually fall into frustration and self-doubt," Yao says.The choreographed drama's poignant themes also make it a fitting component of the Three Rules of Admonition series, which uses ancient Chinese texts as a wake-up call for contemporary audiences, reminding them to reflect on their own lives."As long as people begin to contemplate their life and work, they can find their own paths and solutions. We provide content that evokes empathy, allowing people to consider whether or not they need to make new decisions," Yao says.According to Zheng, the choreodrama series highlights a human-centered approach and takes the audience on a journey of self-discovery and understanding."I enjoy reading Chinese legends centered on human experiences. The story of Nie Yinniang captivated me with its intricate plot and narrative. I became deeply engrossed in it, so the story led to my series," says Zheng."The fantastical and bizarre elements in these legends highlight common questions facing many people in the contemporary era — who am I? What am I going to do? I believe that these stories can resonate with many people, infusing them with inner strength or a sense of connection."In the production, the protagonist is portrayed by three male dancers, each embodying a different phase of the character — the aspiring poet, the troubled soul struggling with inner conflict and finally, the tiger with its bestial nature.In terms of choreography, compared with The Assassin, where Zheng focuses on expressing character relations with different dance genres, the emotions in The Tiger Man drive the dancers' body expressions.The production was commissioned by the China Shanghai International Arts Festival Rising Artists' Works program, an incubation platform helping young artists in various fields create original works.After its premiere at the Shanghai International Dance Center last October, the team received an invitation from the Sibiu International Theatre Festival."For international performances, I made adjustments and created a new version because I want to enhance its appeal to the international market by omitting some storytelling expressions and highlighting the overall emotions," Zheng says.The creators are also working on the third and final production of the series, which will continue to draw insights from ancient texts and express themes relevant today."Traditional culture is not about imitating the ways of ancient people, but rather inheriting our own intellectual history while passing down the tangible culture. I think it is meaningful to find the recurring themes in traditional thought that can strike a chord with what we're facing right now," Yao says.As part of the 2024 Beijing Culture Forum, an event centered around the theme "Cultural Dissemination: Film and Television Production with Relevance to the Present Times" took place in Beijing on Friday.During the forum, the key programs of the TV celebration of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, titled "Marching with the Times, United with the People", were highlighted.The celebration features 10 new dramas being broadcast between July and December by the China Media Group and provincial TV stations. They include Toward the Southwest, a commemoration of the 120th anniversary of the birth of Deng Xiaoping, the revolutionary drama Blood and Glory, and When the Mountain Flowers Bloom, a tribute to rural teacher Zhang Guimei, who was given the title of "model of the times"."These shows not only enrich peoples' lives but also ignite patriotic enthusiasm," says Yin Hong, one of the key speakers at the forum, who's vice-chairman of China Film Association and a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Tsinghua University.Yin also gave a speech on the theme of cross-cultural communication in film and television production, a review of Chinese films and TV dramas that have won awards on the international stage and have been screened or broadcast abroad.Other speakers included Feng Yuanzheng, actor, director and president of the Beijing People's Art Theatre, director Zheng Xiaolong, and international guests, including Oscar-winning director Malcolm Clarke, and French documentary producer Roman Jeanneau, CEO of Doc Services, the company behind international documentary markets, Sunny Side of the Doc and Asian Side of the Doc.The Netherlands Film Festival, organized by the China Film Group Corporation and the Dutch embassy, recently kicked off in Beijing. It will run until Oct 31.With Camiel Schouwenaar's Bigman as the opening film, the festival is set to take place in seven cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu, and Nanjing.Ten acclaimed films, including the documentary Close to Vermeer, the drama road movie Kiddo, and the comedy Rocco, will be screened.Schouwenaar said that he hopes his film conveys a message advocating for parents and teachers to provide their children with the freedom and opportunity to explore their boundaries and discover their potential.Job Tichelman, the scriptwriter on Bigman, said that the film was inspired by childhood experiences, and mentioned that writing the script sometimes felt like conversing with his younger self. He expressed surprise at the opportunity to bring the movie to China, and said they had only been notified two weeks before the festival.Tickets are currently available on major ticketing services such as China Film Pass, Maoyan, and Taopiaopiao.A poignant film designed to raise awareness about the fight against Alzheimer's disease and elderly care, Before Memory Fades is set for domestic release on Friday.The story follows an elderly couple who have lived apart in different cities for years due to caring for their grandchildren. However, a reunion with a former platoon leader prompts the husband to reflect on life and family.On his 66th birthday, he decides to take his wife back to their former home in Taishun, Zhejiang province. Their journey of rediscovering their past life helps them rekindle and strengthen their bond. Unfortunately, the husband receives an Alzheimer's diagnosis, presenting the family with a new and challenging situation but ultimately bringing them closer together.Song Zhiqin, deputy director of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles' movie art center, commented that the film presents a fresh perspective on the critical social issue of elderly care and discovering fulfillment in later life.Zhang Wei, executive vice-president of the China Film Critics Association, added that in addition to its insightful portrayal of aging, the film beautifully captures the scenic charm of Taishun, a town renowned for preserving over 30 covered bridges which were constructed from Tang (618-907) to Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. He suggested that the film could serve as a model for blending culture and tourism, potentially drawing more visitors to the town.Documentary about wartime atrocity seeks to remind world of an overlooked event, Chen Ye reports.Fang Li, a 70-year-old director with 42 years of experience in exploration and marine surveying, and 24 years in the film industry, is both director and producer of The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru. During the documentary's recent national roadshow, Fang shared the emotional and historical significance of his latest project with China Daily. The interview took place online as he was traveling between theaters and universities in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.Fang refers to the tour as "the film returning home", as the story of the Lisbon Maru took place in Zhejiang.In 2014, during a visit to Dongji Island in Zhoushan with his friend and director Han Han for the filming of The Continent, Fang first heard the story of the Lisbon Maru from local boatmen.Late in September 1942, the Japanese military used the ship to transport more than 1,800 British prisoners of war from Hong Kong to Japan. In the waters off Dongji Island, it was torpedoed by a US submarine. Over the course of the next 25 hours, as the ship began to sink, the Japanese sealed the POWs in three holds, nailing the doors shut with wooden planks and canvas. In a heroic act of survival, the POWs managed to break free. Seeing the sinking ship, more than 200 fishermen from Zhoushan risked their lives to save 384 POWs, sheltering some from Japanese search efforts, in a spirit of selflessness and bravery.Fang was shocked. "How had we in China never heard of the Lisbon Maru? We know of the Titanic, the Taiping, and even the sinking of the Awa Maru, but no one here ever mentioned the Lisbon Maru. And for more than 70 years, no one had found its wreck," he says.This mystery piqued Fang's curiosity, leading him to begin the search for the ship in 2016. After a fruitless 10-day effort, his team eventually located a large wreck. In 2017, using sonar technology and robots, they confirmed that its physical properties, contour, and structure matched those of the Lisbon Maru. Fang was elated.As announced at a media conference in Beijing on Thursday, the upcoming 3rd Chinese Documentary Film Festival is set to take place from Oct 24 to 26 in Zhuhai, Guangdong province.The festival will be hosted by China Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio (Group), China Film Association, and the publicity department of Zhuhai.Cao Jun, deputy secretary-general of China Film Association, said in his speech that the annual film festival has become an important platform for Chinese-language documentary filmmakers from home and abroad to come together and seek common development."It is my hope that the festival's third edition will create a grand cinematic event with Chinese characteristics, international vision and a sense of humanism, and become a spiritual home for Chinese-language documentary filmmakers to progress together, so that more excellent works will be seen, recognized and loved, contributing to telling Chinese stories well and enhancing the soft power of Chinese culture," Cao said.According to Zhu Qinxiao, deputy general manager of the China Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio (Group), this year's festival will expand its scope to incorporate stage productions, provide a showcase platform for more documentary films, and feature innovative activities to bring documentaries closer to the public.The festival has announced a diverse program of events, including an opening ceremony and keynote forum, a call for submissions of Chinese-language documentaries, a series of film screenings, panel discussions, new film promotions and gala ceremonies.This year's call for submissions officially opened on Thursday, and will run until Sept 30, inviting Chinese-language documentary production companies and filmmakers to submit works completed between Jan 1, 2022, and Sept 30, 2024.The festival also launched a short video and screenplay event that calls for entries on social media platforms from individuals and organizations. The submission event's promotional video, along with the festival's main poster and promotional videos, were released at the media conference.A media event was held on Sept 1 in Beijing for the seventh season of the romantic social reality show Heart Signal. The show began airing on Tencent Video on Sept 2.This season of Heart Signal is centered around the theme "falling in love across cities", focusing on the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and showcasing the relationships and values of young men and women navigating cross-city lives.Chinese writer Rao Xueman, serving as a first-time celebrity observer, claimed that she was deeply moved by the courage shown by Gen Z in their approach to love.Chief director Chen Zhixiong explained that each city has its own unique character, and by expanding the show's setting from one city to the entire Greater Bay Area, they aimed to present a richer and more diverse range of participants, generating new dynamics. Additionally, by featuring guests traveling between cities, the show highlights their courage in pursuing love across distances.Producer Yang Zhuo emphasized the show's commitment to authentically portraying contemporary love, offering audiences a more relatable and empathetic perspective. She noted that today's young people are increasingly focused on self-growth, showing more bold and individualistic traits."We hope that the audience sees not only romance but also a reflection of themselves within the show," said Yang.Esports is rapidly becoming a key sector in the race for growth within the new economy. A variety of professional clubs and players has emerged, attracting considerable attention and admiration, particularly from young audiences."The seeds of esports were sown earlier than most people realize. However, to truly break into the mainstream and broaden public acceptance, it requires more than professionalism — it needs to tap into its mass appeal," said Bai Hongyu, the executive producer of the third season of the esports training reality show named We Are the Champions during a media preview recently.We Are the Champions is co-produced by Tencent Video and Honor of Kings. It introduces a novel "competition plus reality show" narrative model, paving the way for new thinking and direction in esports-related entertainment.This season, 25 participants will join five professional esports clubs, where they will train, compete, and participate in daily club operations.

Here, rangers and researchers at the Xizang Changtang National Nature Reserve, located at an altitude of 5,000 meters above sea level, observe and monitor the mass migration of Tibetan antelopes.Some 150,000 Tibetan antelopes, also known as chiru, live high up on the plateau and migrate from Qinghai province to the Changtang reserve to birth their young.The species used to be listed as endangered due in part to them being hunted for their fur, but years of conservation work has lifted their number and they are now classified as near threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.This year, the wildlife rangers have been joined by a team of photographers and filmmakers to document the migration, typically ranging from several hundred kilometers to about 1,000 km, across what is known by many as the "roof of the world".Starting from a patrol station in Rungma township, documentary filmmaker Zhang Lina and two photographers, Guo Peng and Xu Qianbo, ride by motorcycle across hills and streams for 3 hours to catch up with the migrating herds."Although the flow of the rivers along the way is not particularly strong, the river channels are deep and long. Adult Tibetan antelopes can generally leap over easily, but young ones are at high risk of being swept away by the currents and drowning," Zhang said."The rangers wait downstream to try and rescue them."Upstream, the latest in a series of thought-provoking Chinese movies to hit the theaters, will leave you breathless.

As the credits roll, you find yourself rooting for each one, especially the protagonist and his family.At the box office this summer, an entire crop of Chinese movies has managed to enthrall with their technical finesse, plot, direction and acting chops, quietly working their magic on viewers, and knocking for a place at the global high table on merit alone. Of course, video streaming platforms such as Netflix do list popular Chinese movies for the global audience, but I fear they may be missing out on a clutch of exciting new offerings.Take Decoded, for instance. I was quite looking forward to its release and it did not disappoint. Here is a thriller about a genius cryptographer that is also an intimate family portrait set from the 1940s to '60s, before and after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The spy thriller — which has dream sequences that are perhaps some of the most imaginative and well-executed in recent memory — is yet another example of how Chinese directors are elevating storytelling to a sublime art.A spate of other blockbusters — with one Cannes winner thrown into the mix — has left film connoisseurs spoiled for choice. Black Dog, which won the top honor in the Un Certain Regard category at Cannes this year, certainly deserves mention for its sensitive portrayal of a mining town on the brink of transition and the uneasy bond forged between its protagonist and a stray black canine.Life Hotel, another gem, is certain to leave one teary-eyed for its deeply moving sketch of a struggling palliative care facility eyed by land sharks, while A Place Called Silence will shatter your cozy assumptions of childhood and the perils children face daily.The Successor is a hilarious comedy — with a message — on how even the most carefully laid-out plans can go wrong, while The Last Frenzy, which is both irreverent and funny, is also ultimately a poignant tale of a miser and social misfit who discovers that he has only a few days to live.Moments We Shared, a heartwarming story of the bond between a doting grandmother and her aimless grandson, can make even the most cynical among us hope for the best, while Dwelling by the West Lake unravels the exquisite tapestry of a mother-son relationship teetering on the brink, only to be salvaged by grit and audacity.Time Still Turns the Pages deals with the suicide of an elder brother, seen through the eyes of the younger years later, and is certain to make your heart ache for days after. Of course, Crisis Negotiators and Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In are other equally taut thrillers which one must not miss.Suffice to say, as the Chinese movie ecosystem puts its stamp on world cinema, big events such as the annual Beijing International Film Festival may even surpass the popularity of Cannes, Venice or Berlin in the future.It is no easy task to hold the interest of viewers, and I am quite sure China's innovative directors will think of even more compelling narratives in the days ahead to satiate them.Contact the writer at biju@chinadaily.com.cnWith the approaching Teachers' Day which will fall on Sept 10, Sowers of Hope, a TV series focused on rural area education, began airing on Shanghai's Dragon Television and Beijing Satellite TV, as well as the streaming sites Mango TV and iQiyi, on Tuesday.Adapted from real-life stories from various countryside schools in southwestern China, the drama revolves around An Yan, a junior high physics teacher portrayed by actress Tong Liya.The protagonist prioritizes the health and education of her students, even at the cost of offending fellow faculty members.

However, they often grappled with the weight of its archetype Legend of the White Snake, a household tale established in folklore that has been reinterpreted over centuries.Its earliest legend may date back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907), where the titular snake demon was consistently depicted as a malevolent character throughout the Song Dynasty (960-1279). However, it was retold in writer Feng Menglong's Jingshi Tongyan (Stories to Caution the World) during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). That's when the tale took its current form — a poignant love story between the snake-turned-woman and a handsome man.In the modern era, the story has been adapted into multiple movies, TV dramas, animated series and stage shows. Some of the most popular titles include the 1992 costume drama New Legend of Madame White Snake starring Hong Kong actress Angie Chiu, and director Tsui Hark's 1993 movie Green Snake, which casts more light on White Snake's sister-like maidservant, Xiaoqing, a green serpent demon.The dilemma for Chan and Li was simple: How could they achieve a breakthrough in retelling a story familiar to Chinese people for generations?They traveled to Hangzhou in October to seek inspiration.

It featured Beijing's Palace Museum as a regular participant across all four seasons. In addition, eight other major museums at the provincial level, as well as famous municipal or themed museums across China, such as the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum, have also been involved. In each episode, the nine institutions each nominated three of their most representative collections. Through performances led by celebrated actors and actresses, the legendary past of these national treasures was brought to life. Following this, professionals connected to these treasures took the stage to share their insights and delve into the enduring relevance of these cultural relics in today's society.Each season concluded with the National Treasure Gala, where the heads of these institutions revealed one artifact of their collections that has been selected for National Treasure's Chinese Civilization Mark.Over seven years and four seasons, National Treasure has showcased a total of 108 cultural relics, each shining brightly within the splendid Chinese civilization. The fourth season continued to deliver constant surprises and emotional moments to the audience.The Casting Guest Ding, nominated by Anhui Museum and weighing about 400 kilograms, is China's second-heaviest ancient ding found to date. A ding is a type of ancient Chinese cauldron symbolizing state power and prosperity, and this particular one was cast for the king of Chu on the eve of Qinshihuang's unification of China. Chu was the second-largest state after Qin and was at a critical juncture of survival at that time.Yue Yueli, a senior Chinese actor who is in his 60s, played the role of the casting guest who, with tears in his eyes, tried to save the state of Chu during its final days.

This banner caused a sensation — drawing over 100 million online views."The most touching aspect of cultural relics is the human spirit they represent. Each artifact featured in National Treasure should present the profoundness of Chinese civilization from different angles, illustrating dreams and accomplishments of the Chinese nation over thousands of years," says Bi Bo, chief director of National Treasure. He adds that the essence of the fourth season lies in conveying the spiritual power embedded in Chinese civilization, which unites and inspires.Revolutionary relics made their debut on National Treasure during the fourth season. Such relics included the poignant letter To My Wife by Lin Juemin, written before the 1911 Huanghuagang Uprising, which evokes shared memories among compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the vases used by Northeast China's communist branch to hide documents during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45), which witnessed life-and-death moments, and the diary of Chang Baokun, an accomplished Chinese cross-talk performer who volunteered to perform for Chinese soldiers on the front line but subsequently lost his young life on the Korean battlefield, exemplifying the artist's unwavering dedication to his country."National treasures are defined by their spirit, not merely their physical form. Revolutionary relics are also crucial witnesses of our nation's civilization," Bi says.Also for the first time, this season introduced foreign guest performers in the past legends segment.Sana Hadhri, a Tunisian woman who obtained her doctorate of communications in China, was one of the two foreign guest performers this season. She and young Chinese actress Chen Duling jointly performed the story behind the beautiful clothing unearthed from the tomb of a Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279) teenager.Hadhri began learning Chinese in high school, and was fascinated by the beauty of pictographic characters. When she went to university in Tunisia, she did not hesitate to choose Chinese as her major. Excelling in her studies, Hadhri was recommended to pursue graduate studies in China and once dreamed of becoming a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner.Hadhri says that apart from the beauty of the natural scenery in China, which she adores, after her presence on the stage of National Treasure, she now finds a strong interest in Chinese cultural relics."Ancient Chinese clothing is so beautiful and stunning. If I get the chance to go to Fujian, I hope to see these garments in person at the Fujian Museum," she says.The Fujian Museum has opened a special exhibition to display the treasures it nominated for National Treasure."On stage, I play a 12th-century Arabian girl who, filled with longing for China, came here via the Maritime Silk Road. This mirrors my real life. I study communication in China, researching the spread of China's voice in the Arab world and vice versa. I love China and I hope to contribute more to cultural exchange," Hadhri says.British martial artist Matt Jane, or MJ, with his striking Chinese name of White Dragon, has been a devoted fan of National Treasure since its inaugural season. He views the show as a significant endeavor that not only provides learning opportunities regarding various cultural relics but also serves as a platform for the world to gain a deeper understanding of China.In keeping with the legendary yellow tracksuit worn by Bruce Lee in his last film, MJ, dressed in a yellow monk's robe and wearing a bamboo hat, swept the ground at the gate of the Shaolin Temple, helping senior Hong Kong kung fu actor Fan Siu-wong's "outdated martial artist" character find the true essence of kung fu.MJ runs a martial arts studio named Temple in north London, having shattered the stereotype that foreigners can't master Chinese kung fu.

It is regarded as one of China's four great folkloric tales.During the film's recent premiere in Beijing, director Li Jiakai said that the new movie is akin to a journey back to the origins of the story.In addition to Bai Niangzi (Miss Bai), the snake demon, and Xu Xian, the young man, the final installment also includes the Buddhist monk, Fahai, who attempts to separate the couple out of a stubborn belief that demons should not live with humans.Following its two-day nationwide preview screening on Aug 3 and 4, the film generated online excitement with several hashtags — highlighting its Chinese aesthetics and animation techniques — becoming trending topics on the country's popular social platforms.A new documentary, titled The Potala Palace, which brings viewers closer to the architectural interiors and collections within the Potala Palace in Lhasa, capital of Southwest China's Xizang autonomous region, is being aired on Tencent's video platform since Tuesday.The documentary's production team spent over three years creating it, analyzing and showcasing this treasure of human civilization from varied perspectives including history, architecture, artifacts, art, cultural folklore, environmental conservation and modern life.Narrated by the renowned actor Hu Ge in Mandarin, the documentary spans seven episodes, each detailing the creation, preservation, and celebration of national culture revolving around the iconic palace.The series not only provides a comprehensive visual exploration of the palace but also delves into the life stories of skilled artisans in Xizang.

This marks the eighth time the 74-year-old director has won the Hundred Flowers awards but the first time to win as best director.“Although I have won many awards, this is my first time winning the Best Director award at the Hundred Flowers. As this award is chosen by the people, it exemplifies that winning the love of the people is the most difficult,” said Zhang, expressing his gratitude to all the cast and crew members.Article 20 also earned Ma Li the Best Actress accolade, causing the veteran actress to shed tears of joy. Beginning her acting career as a member of the comedy troupe Mahua FunAge in 2005, Ma emotionally expressed that it had taken her 20 years to transition from the comedy performance stage to the award ceremony of the Hundred Flowers.“The past two decades have been very challenging. There were times when I even thought about giving up because comedic performers are sometimes not recognized. But I love acting so much that I have persevered for such a long time,” said Ma.

"I've always had a lot of input in my previous action films, like choreography, the camera angles or the editing, so basically, I'm still doing the same thing," Tse tells China Daily in New York. "For me, the most important part is the storytelling."Tse, who made his debut as an action choreographer to international audiences on July 17 in New York, was honored with this year's Screen International Star Asia Award at the New York Asian Film Festival held July 12-28.The festival also featured the North American premiere of his latest film Customs Frontline, an action-packed movie that follows Hong Kong customs officers as they uncover illegal weapons on a cargo ship, leading them on a thrilling international adventure. Tse is the film's action choreographer."I'm not trying to do the action because it looks cool. That's doing the action for the action. I'm doing the action for the storytelling. So, I think that blends in very significantly to not lose the vision in terms of — 'Oh, I'm gonna throw that kick because it looks cool'. You can't really do that because you should only do a movement if it portrays the emotions of that character at the moment."Tse says that body language is crucial in acting, as it helps audiences better understand the plot conveyed through Mandarin or Cantonese dialogue."Body language actually transcends more and breaks all barriers," Tse says. "It's also the true identity of action movies."Hong Kong action movies are popular overseas, gaining a large audience base since the days of Bruce Lee in the 1970s, due to their unique style.Tse, 43, believes that one of the strengths of the films is the choreography and insists on performing his own stunts, despite the physical strain."I've done my own stunts since I was 19," Tse recalls. "All the explosions, all the gunfights, all the hits, and all the falls are real. When the actors are pushing themselves to the edge and feeling the pressure, feeling the danger, that's really how to make the audience be on edge as well."Tse says he also believes it is his responsibility to take care of other actors in different scenes, such as the stunts in traditional Hong Kong action movies.Tse, who has studied martial arts for the screen with Jackie Chan and is a practitioner of Wing Chun, a form of kung fu, says that kung fu attracts international audiences, which is what Hong Kong action movies should take advantage of."It's very important that we keep the advantage, especially Hong Kong action movies; we've really reached so much of the Western world," he says, having witnessed his Western classmates' passion for kung fu during his years at boarding school in Vancouver, Canada."That (kung fu) gives us the advantage. If we lose the tradition now and give in to AI or CG (computer generation), we won't practice this art anymore. I think it's a very, very big loss for action movies."With the popularity of new emerging entertainment, Hong Kong action movies aren't as popular as they were in the past. As of now, Tse doesn't plan to introduce Customs Frontline to Hollywood. While he is open to more collaborations, he wants to get more young people involved in Hong Kong's filmmaking industry.The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in New York hosted a welcome reception for Tse before the premiere of his new film on July 17.The director of the office Maisie Ho and the film festival's executive director Samuel Jamier delivered speeches at the premiere, congratulating Tse on the award and praising his contributions to Hong Kong cinema.In March, Alibaba Digital Media and Entertainment Group released the "Hong Kong Cultural and Art Industry Revitalization Program", in which it will invest no less than HK$5 billion ($640 million) in the next five years in four major fields of Hong Kong's entertainment industry — TV series, movies, performances and training young talent — to further promote the region's industry with the Chinese mainland and the world."Nothing will stay popular forever," Tse says.

This contrast poetically portrays Jiang's resilience, dedication, noble character and deep affection for the land of Xinjiang," Huangfu further reviewed.The film was released on May 20.Beyond his exploits as an actor, singer, songwriter, entrepreneur and TV chef, Nicholas Tse is a storyteller."I've always had a lot of input in my previous action films, like choreography, the camera angles or the editing, so basically for me, I'm still doing the same thing," Tse told China Daily in New York. "For me, the most important part is the storytelling."Tse, who made his debut as an action choreographer to international audiences in New York, was honored with this year's Screen International Star Asia Award at the New York Asian Film Festival (July 12-28).The festival also featured the North American premiere of his latest film, Customs Frontline, an action-packed movie that follows Hong Kong customs officers as they uncover illegal weapons on a cargo ship, leading them on a thrilling international adventure."I'm not trying to do the action because it looks cool, that's called do the action for the action. I'm doing the action for the storytelling. So, I think, you know, that blends in very significantly to not lose the vision in terms of — 'Oh, I'm gonna throw that kick because it looks cool.' You can't really do that because you should only do a movement if it really portrays the emotions of that character at the moment."Tse said that body language is crucial in acting, as it helps audiences better understand the plot conveyed through Mandarin or Cantonese dialogue."Body language actually transcends more, and it breaks all barriers," Tse said. "It's also the true identity of action movies."Hong Kong action movies are popular overseas. They have gained a large audience base since the days of Bruce Lee in the 1970s, due to their unique style.Tse, 43, believes that one of the strengths of the films is the choreography, and insists on performing his own stunts, despite physical strain."I've done my own stunts ever since I was 19," Tse recalled. "All the explosions are real, all the gunfights, all the hits are real, and all the falls are real. When the actors themselves are pushing themselves to the edge and feeling, feeling the pressure, feeling the danger, that's really how to make the audience be on edge as well."Tse said he also believes it is his responsibility to take care of other actors in different scenes, such as the stunts in traditional Hong Kong action movies.Tse, who has studied martial arts for the screen with Jackie Chan and is a practitioner of Wing Chun, a form of kung fu, said that kung fu attracts international audiences, and that's what Hong Kong action movies should take advantage of."It's very important that we keep the advantage, especially Hong Kong action movies; we've really reached so much of the Western world," he said, having witnessed his Western classmates' passion for kung fu during his years at boarding school in Vancouver."That [kung fu] gives us the advantage. If we lose the tradition now and give in to AI or CG (computer generation), we won't practice this art anymore. I think it's a very, very big loss for action movies."With the popularity of new emerging entertainment, Hong Kong action movies aren't so popular as they were in the past. As of now, Tse doesn't plan to introduce Customs Frontline to Hollywood. While he is open to more collaborations, he really wants to get more young people involved in Hong Kong's filmmaking industry. The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in New York hosted a welcome reception for Tse before the premiere of his new film on July 17.The director of the office, Maisie Ho, and Film Festival Director Samuel Jamier delivered speeches at the premiere, congratulating Tse on the award and praising his contributions to Hong Kong cinema.In March, Alibaba Digital Media and Entertainment Group released the "Hong Kong Arts Revitalization Plan", in which it said it will invest no less than HK$5 billion in the next five years in four major fields of Hong Kong's entertainment industry: TV series, movies, performances and training young talent to further promote the region's industry with China and the world. "Nothing will stay popular forever," Tse said. "But if we don't spend time to rejuvenate or reintroduce action movies, or how we do action movies to the younger audience, no one's going to participate. No one's going to train that way. No one's going to do it."Zhao Jinmai stars as Princess Li Rong in the Chinese costume drama The Princess Royal.

However, in the Song Dynasty (960-1279), high-society ladies adorned their faces with these precious orbs, not for any practical purpose, but simply to enhance their beauty with a unique charm.The once-trendy fashion has been revived in the costume drama, The Double, marking actress Wu Jinyan's return to a revenge-themed tale after the phenomenal 2018 hit Story of Yanxi Palace.In a standout episode, Wu, starring in the lead role of Xue Fangfei, partakes in a jili, or hair-pinning ceremony.

Amid this recovery, domestic movies in China have performed exceptionally well, consistently featuring in the global top 10 box office and dominating the national top 10 box office rankings in 2023. Which cities are driving China's box office market? Which city loves movies the most? Cloud River Urban Research Institute provides a detailed analysis using the "Index of Chinese Cities' Cinema Spending" from the China Integrated City Index.1. Global movie market recovers from COVID-19 pandemicIn 2023, the global box office grossed approximately $33.9 billion, marking a 30.8% increase from $25.9 billion in 2022, showcasing a robust recovery. However, it still lags behind the pre-pandemic level of $42.5 billion in 2019.From 2020 to 2023, the global movie market suffered greatly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, global annual box office revenues plummeted by 71% compared to 2019, dropping to just $12.4 billion. That year, thanks to swift pandemic control, China surpassed North America, including the U.S. and Canada, for the first time with $3.12 billion in box office revenue, becoming the largest movie market in the world.In 2021, the global box office rebounded by 72% year on year to $21.3 billion, recovering to 50% of the 2019 level. In the same year, China, with the best pandemic control globally, saw its movie market reach $7.44 billion, 1.6 times larger than North America, retaining the top spot globally.In 2022, the global box office climbed to about $25.9 billion, a 22% increase from 2021. North America reclaimed its position as the largest box office market with $7.37 billion. In contrast, China's box office market fell by 41.7% year on year to $4.33 billion, dropping to second place globally.By 2023, the movie markets in North America and China had significantly outpaced those in other countries, forming a clear lead. North America, the global leader, reached $9.07 billion in box office revenue, roughly four times its 2020 low. China, in second place, restored its box office to $7.71 billion, while Japan, in third, reached only 16% of North America's and 19% of China's box office revenue.2. Two domestic movies among top 10 of global box officeIn the 2023 global box office top 10 ranking, Chinese movies "Full River Red" and "The Wandering Earth II" ranked seventh and eighth, respectively, with box office revenues of $670 million and $610 million. The other eight movies were American productions.Since Wu Jing's "Wolf Warrior II" grossed $800 million in 2017, ranking ninth globally, Chinese movies have increasingly drawn attention for their box office values. In 2020, four Chinese movies made it into the global top 10, with "The Eight Hundred" becoming the highest-grossing movie worldwide. In 2021, "The Battle at Lake Changjin," "Hi, Mom," and "Detective Chinatown Ⅲ" secured the second, third, and sixth spots in the global rankings. In 2022, "The Battle at Lake Changjin II" and "Moon Man" were ninth and 10th in global box office revenues. Chinese movies regularly challenge for the global top 10, forming a competitive duo with Hollywood in terms of box office.According to Zhou Muzhi, a professor at Tokyo Keizai University, "The vast Chinese market has elevated domestic movies into the global top tier. A major future challenge for Chinese movies that rely heavily on the local market will be how to conquer international markets."3. Domestic productions dominate list of 10 highest-grossing movies in ChinaIn 2023, the Chinese movie market staged a strong rally, growing 83.3% compared to the previous year and reaching a four-year peak. In the year, 73 movies raked in over 100 million yuan ($13.77 million) each, 50 of which were domestic productions.Notably, domestic movies dominated the top 10 list of the highest-grossing movies in 2023. They were "Full River Red," "The Wandering Earth II," "No More Bets," "Lost in the Stars," "Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms," "Never Say Never," "Chang'an," "Boonie Bears: Guardian Code," "Under the Light," and "Godspeed," all of which grossed over 1 billion yuan.In contrast, Hollywood movies were losing their luster in the Chinese market. Only three Hollywood movies made their way into the top 20 — "Fast & Furious 10" at 12th, "Meg 2: The Trench" at 17th, and "Avatar: The Way of Water" at 20th.Domestic movies accounted for 83.8% of the total box office revenue in 2023, while imported movies only accounted for 16.2%.Zhou said, "These figures show that domestic movies are gaining popularity, while the appeal of Hollywood movies in China is significantly declining."He pointed out that this reflects the improvement in the quality of Chinese movies on one hand, and on the other hand, it is the result of Hollywood blockbusters' growing departure from life and reality in recent years.4. China's box office is highly concentratedCloud River Urban Research Institute annually releases the "Index of Chinese Cities' Cinema Spending" for 297 Chinese cities at prefecture level and above, drawing on its annual China Integrated City Index.According to the "2023 Index of Chinese Cities' Cinema Spending," the top 10 cities are Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Suzhou, and Xi'an.At 11th to 30th places are Nanjing, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Foshan, Dongguan, Ningbo, Hefei, Wuxi, Qingdao, Shenyang, Kunming, Nantong, Nanchang, Wenzhou, Shijiazhuang, Jinan, Fuzhou, Changchun, and Nanning.An analysis of the index reveals a high concentration of China's box office in these top 30 cities. Here are some key findings:Number of cinemas: The top 10 cities in the index account for 20.6% of the total number of cinemas nationwide, while the top 30 cities represent 38.9%. This means the top 10 cities host one-fifth of China's cinemas, and the top 30 cities nearly 40%.Comparing to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, 223 of 297 prefecture-level and above cities have increased their number of cinemas, 44 have decreased, and 30 have stayed the same.China saw a net increase of 1,394 cinemas over the past four years, despite pandemic headwinds. Chengdu saw the largest increase with 67 new cinemas, followed by Suzhou with 28. Shanghai, which saw a decrease of 12 cinemas, experienced the largest decline in cinema numbers.Cinema attendance: The top 10 cities in terms of cinema attendance account for 28% of the national total, and the top 30 cities account for 49.8%. Thus, the top 10 cities attract nearly one-third of the national audience, and the top 30 cities nearly half.Box office: The top 10 cities in terms of box office represent 30.1% of the national total, and the top 30 cities represent over 51%. This indicates the top 10 cities contribute nearly one-third of China's box office earnings, and the top 30 cities contribute more than half.5. Which Chinese city tops box office?The index offers some insight into the dynamics of Chinese cities' cinema spending.The top 10 cities in terms of box office are Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Suzhou, and Xi'an.The top 10 cities in terms of cinema attendance are Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Xi'an.The top 10 cities in terms of average cinema attendance per capita are Nanjing, Beijing, Zhuhai, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Haikou.The top 10 cities in terms of average box office per capita are Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Nanjing, Zhuhai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xiamen, and Suzhou.Zhou, also head of Cloud River Urban Research Institute commented, "China's box office is mainly concentrated in core cities and cities with developed industries such as Suzhou, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Foshan, and Wuxi. These cities share characteristics — they all have a large population, a strong economy, and a high proportion of young people."The opening ceremony of the first China Chongqing Science and Technology Film Week was held on Wednesday night in Chongqing's Yongchuan district.The six-day film week starting, on Tuesday, themed "Science and Film Coexist, Illuminating the Future", focuses on the cutting-edge film science and technologies.

Music legend Jacky Cheung also makes his return to the silver screen after an eight-year hiatus, playing a customs officer battling high-functioning depression.Tse revealed his attraction to Customs Frontline stemmed from his love for sea-related themes, especially considering Hong Kong's unique coastal identity.He also emphasized the importance of performing real stunts, citing it as a cherished tradition that propelled Hong Kong films to international acclaim. Despite the growing use of special effects in the modern film industry, Tse believes Hong Kong filmmakers should continue to value and uphold this tradition."Many Western movies have learned to craft action choreography from Hong Kong films," Tse said, highlighting the need to preserve this legacy.The animated series Reincarnated Marquis has been making waves on the video streaming platform Bilibili, garnering praise for its stunning visuals, captivating story, and evocative character portrayals.Adapted from a popular online novel originally published between 2007 and 2008, the animation tells the tale of Zheng Shaopeng, a university student who finds himself transported back in time to ancient China after a book falls on his head. Thrust into the body of a poor scholar named Yang Lin, Zheng navigates a turbulent era marked by internal conflict and external threats.Through his wisdom and ingenuity, Yang rises through the ranks of the fictional Danzhu Dynasty, tackling corruption, fending off enemies, and ushering in an era of technological advancement and enlightenment.Reincarnated Marquis has earned a remarkable 9.8 out of 10 rating on Bilibili, with viewers praising its meticulous attention to detail. One user, Shuangfendoubao, remarked on the realistic depiction of rural environments, highlighting the subtle details that enhance the viewer's immersion.Director Xie Dan sheds light on the unique production process employed for the animation. Unlike the typical approach of utilizing motion capture technology on actors after storyboards are finalized, Xie insists on a more immersive method. He engages theater actors to don motion capture suits and fully embody the scenes, ensuring that the animation accurately conveys the intended emotions.This approach stems from Xie's experience directing live-action TV dramas, where he honed his expertise in eliciting powerful performances.A graduate of the Beijing Film Academy's animation department, Xie has witnessed the evolution of animation production techniques and audience preferences over the past two decades. Choosing to remain an independent director, he enjoys the freedom to pursue projects that resonate with his creative vision.Early in his career, Xie directed a 40-episode animated series set in the Song Dynasty, exploring the world of cuju, an ancient Chinese ballgame considered the precursor to modern soccer. At the time, the primary audience for animation was young children. However, Xie notes that the landscape has shifted, with contemporary animation catering to diverse demographics, including youth and middle-aged viewers. He cites his involvement in the project "Capsules", which delves into psychological suspense, science fiction, and themes of female empowerment and social justice.Looking ahead, Xie expresses his eagerness to explore diverse thematic genres and push the boundaries of animated storytelling.Creators of BBC's dark comedy series Inside No. 9, British writer-actor duo Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are on their first visit to China, participating in the 29th Shanghai TV Festival.They watched the first episode of the first season of Inside No.9, and the final episode of the ninth season, which is also conclusion of the whole series, alongside Chinese fans at the Shanghai Grand Theatre on June 24.They also saw the Chinese immersive theater production adapted from the TV series, and revealed that a new theater production of Inside No. 9, created by and starring the two of them, will kick off next year on West End in London.Since the launch of the first season of Inside No. 9 in 2014, the dark comedy anthology series has garnered a global following for the great storytelling with clever plot twists.

Consequently, she has developed a deep affection for French cinema and its creators."There are many cultural exchange activities between China and France. For example, in Beijing, one could watch the musical 'Notre Dame de Paris' and appreciate Rodin's sculpture exhibition. In Paris, there have been exhibitions of Han Dynasty artifacts and various Chinese cultural activities," said Zhang.After the screenings in Beijing, this year's French Film Panorama will continue in Nanjing, Wuhan, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Kunming, Hangzhou, Chengdu, and Jinan, with screenings running until August 31. Renowned for its exceptional chemistry and witty banter, the iconic US sitcom Friends has charmed audiences worldwide.

This growth has not only supported rural revitalization initiatives but has also contributed significantly to the overall progress and prosperity of the region.Nearly a decade ago, Pixar's Inside Out captivated audiences worldwide, heralded as a psychological compass guiding parents through the intricate labyrinth of their children's range of emotions.The groundbreaking film — recipient of the 88th Academy Award for Best Animated Feature — has its sequel, Inside Out 2, which made its debut in theaters across the Chinese mainland in multiple formats including IMAX on Friday.Despite a nine-year hiatus in the real world, Riley Andersen, the young protagonist of the franchise, has transitioned from an 11-year-old in the first installment released in 2015 to embarking on the tumultuous journey of puberty at the age of 13 in Inside Out 2.With the return of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust — the five anthropomorphic characters representing their enigmatic emotions — the film introduces new roles as Riley, now a teenager, experiences more complicated and chaotic situations in her mind.The five newcomers who have moved into Riley's mind — Anxiety, who has orange skin and tousled hair; Embarrassment, a clumsy pink character; Envy, the always-envious green figure; Ennui, a long-haired purple figure who is always bored; and the occasionally appearing Nostalgia, a gray-haired elderly character.Two years after Riley moves to San Francisco with her parents, the new film sees her at a crossroads.With two best friends transitioning to a different high school, Riley is determined to impress a coach during a weekend hockey camp to enhance her prospects for better academic opportunities. However, the arrival of new emotions disrupts her inner balance, leading to turmoil.Director Kelsey Mann recalls in an online interview being approached to lead the project by Pete Docter, the chief creative officer of Pixar Animation Studios and director of the first Inside Out film, who believed in the original film's potential back in January 2020.As a father to a daughter and son, both teenagers, Mann describes the creative process as deeply personal."Even though it's a sequel, I could treat it like an original and bring a lot of my personal experiences and feelings to the story," says Mann, adding that he hopes the new movie will resonate with both children and parents, as well as grandparents.Producer Mark Nielsen, who has also participated in the online interview, adds that the sequel's creators had assembled a team of nine girls aged 13 to 16, holding regular meetings with them every four months over three years.Adapted from one of the best-known works by the renowned martial arts novelist Louis Cha, known as Jin Yong, The Legend of Heroes: Hot Blooded has swiftly gained international acclaim, resonating across diverse overseas markets, as confirmed by its producers.Set in the Song Dynasty (960-1279), the narrative follows the journey of Guo Jing, a diligent yet unremarkable rural youth who evolves into a legendary swordsman through a series of adventures, intertwined with his romance with Huang Rong, the clever daughter of a daring swordsman.The 30-episode series, Hot Blooded, premiered online on June 17 and is currently available on various overseas platforms like WeTV, Netflix, YouTube, and Rakuten Viki. The drama is either already released or scheduled for broadcast on numerous prominent local online platforms in nearly 10 countries, including South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Russia and Cambodia, with plans for further screenings in the United States, France, India, Africa and the Middle East.Part of The Legend of Heroes franchise, which commenced two years ago with a vision of five stand-alone stories, each adapted from different Jin Yong novels and entrusted to five distinct directors, Hot Blooded is the initial installment based on The Legend of the Condor Heroes. This classic tale, serialized in the Hong Kong Commercial Daily from 1957 to 1959, has seen numerous adaptations over the years, including the popular 1983 version starring Felix Wong Yat-wa and Barbara Yung Mei-ling.Directed by Yang Lei, acclaimed for the sci-fi drama Three-Body, and featuring actors Ci Sha as Guo Jing and Bao Shang'en as Huang Rong, Hot Blooded employs a dynamic narrative style to engage a broader audience, particularly the younger generation. The script strategically balances pace and depth, aiming to highlight the chivalrous themes and explore the intricate personas of characters like Yang Kang, a pivotal figure with complex loyalties, as noted by critics.Companies join forces to adapt the Three Body series for cinema audiences, Zhang Kun reports.Beijing Enlight Media revealed that the company has joined hands with the Three Body Universe Cultural Development to work on the movie adaptation of the Three Body trilogy, which will be directed by Zhang Yimou, the international award-winning filmmaker who also directed the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.Wang Changtian, president of Beijing Enlight Media, revealed the project during the forum New Horizons in Film: Embracing Innovation and Diversity, an important part of the ongoing 26th Shanghai International Film Festival where insiders around the world meet to share their insights about the future of the industry and reveal their upcoming projects."We have started the preliminary work on the movie and believe it will be a big-budget production," Wang said during the opening session of the forum on Sunday. "I hope it will achieve breakthroughs in the international market."The trilogy is arguably China's most celebrated science-fiction creation through the past decades. The novel by Liu Cixin won the prestigious Hugo Award and has been made into an animation series and TV series in China. Earlier this year, Netflix released a TV series adaptation, which received more than 123,000 ratings on IMDb.com, a leading worldwide resource platform for movie and TV productions.Wang spoke about the project after sharing his findings that some genre films popular in the global market have not taken an adequate market share of the box office in China.For example, he says, animation films take up more than 15 percent of the total box office in the United States while in China they take an average of 7 to 8 percent. Sci-fi movies are faced with a similar situation. This convinced him that more efforts should be made in the creation of animation and sci-fi films in China.Wang believes that sci-fi movies represent the industrial height of a country and China still has a long way to go in this field.The Chinese-made documentary The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru celebrated its world premiere on June 14 as the first film of the 26th Shanghai International Film Festival.Directed and produced by Fang Li, the film spotlights a human story between British prisoners of war and Chinese fishermen during World War II (1939-45).The Lisbon Maru was a freight vessel that was converted into an armed troop carrier by the Japanese Army. In October 1942, it was carrying more than 1,800 British POWs from Hong Kong to Japan when it was torpedoed by the US navy, sinking off the Zhoushan Islands in East China's Zhejiang province.As the ship sunk, nearby fishermen carried out a great humanitarian rescue, saving 384 prisoners from drowning.Even though survivors and rescuers in the Lisbon Maru incident have passed away, the kindness of the Chinese fishermen has never been forgotten. Their stories have been passed on from generation to generation, both in China and in England.Tony Benham, a Hong Kong-based British historian, wrote the book The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru: Britain's Forgotten War Tragedy, which provided a solid foundation for the documentary."When I started writing that book more than 20 years ago, nobody was interested apart from the families themselves and the survivors. I found it was a forgotten story. I would never have dreamed that this journey would take me to Shanghai 20 years later. The small book I wrote … has turned into one of the most emotionally draining documentaries I've seen in my life," says Benham after the film's premiere in Shanghai.This unknown story shocked Fang as well, making him instinctively seek out survivor families and dig into the story's details.Fang, also a veteran marine technology expert and geophysicist, spent years studying the incident and decided to make the documentary after successfully locating the sunken ship in 2016."There are so many touching stories about love, family affection, friendship among comrades, and more. It was a disaster and carnage that happened at our doorstep and a heroic feat by the most ordinary of Chinese people … of course, the story should be told by us Chinese," said Fang after the premiere.Brian Finch, who was commissioned into the UK's Middlesex Regiment in 1960 and served with one of the survivors of the Lisbon Maru, has helped Fang in contacting soldiers' relatives for the documentary.He told China Daily in an interview earlier this year: "Everyone who knows about the story remembers it and the relatives are very keen to participate, but the vast number of people in the United Kingdom do not know about it. We need to give the story maximum publicity within the UK and internationally to get the story widely known."This echoes Fang's expectations. "I hope everyone can remember Lisbon Maru as they remember the Titanic. Also, we hope the brave and kind acts of the Chinese people during the war will be remembered," says Fang.Hong Kong cinema, once a beacon of cinematic excellence, faces a new era where emerging talents are urged to hone their craft through more grounded works, as highlighted by director Derek Yee during a recent forum in Shanghai.Titled "Emerging Power of Hong Kong Cinema in Conversation with Derek Yee", the forum took place at the 26th Shanghai International Film Festival on June 17. Yee, accompanied by eight young actors and actresses born between the 1990s and 2000s, discussed the industry's shifting landscape and the challenges and opportunities it presents.Notable talents like actress Rachel Leung, actor Henick Chou, and Leung Chung-hang, who starred in the acclaimed film In Broad Daylight, a triple award-winner at the 42nd Hong Kong Film Awards, were part of the panel.Redemptory tale is gritty slice of life filmed in postindustrial Northwest, Xu Fan reports.As A-list actor Eddie Peng sauntered through the streets of Cannes with the dog he adopted following the global premiere of his latest film Black Dog at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, attendees were so captivated by the four-legged celebrity, they barely spared a glance for the human star."People came up to me and crouched down, asking if they could pet it," Peng tells China Daily shortly before a promotional event in Beijing on June 12, three days ahead of the movie's Chinese mainland release.As one of the most acclaimed Chinese-language films at the prestigious international festival, Black Dog clinched the top prize in Un Certain Regard, a category that celebrates unique style and unconventional narratives.Xiaoxin, the canine star playing the enigmatic black dog in the film, basked in its own glory after winning the Palm Dog Award, an annual accolade given by the festival's international film critics to the best canine or group of canine performers.The film is a step out of the comfort zone for director Guan Hu, who is known for blockbusters like the acclaimed Mr Six. Black Dog also pays homage to his late father.Emerging as a prominent figure among China's "sixth-generation directors", Guan's first film Dirt came out in 1994. Since then, the 55-year-old filmmaker has steadily ascended into the echelons of top-tier directors through a string of successful TV dramas and films, including the war epic The Eight Hundred, the highest-grossing blockbuster of 2020.Viewed by some critics as one of Guan's most personal and experimental films, Black Dog is set in a dilapidated town in northwestern China.It follows Peng's character, a former local celebrity named Lang Yonghui, who once had a band and excelled at motorcycle stunts, on his return to hometown on parole after completing a 10-year prison term. Compelled to earn a living, Lang, who is also known as Erlang, reluctantly takes a job on a team assigned to round up stray dogs. This effort is part of the town's initiative to clean up its streets and attract investors for new factory developments.In a twist of fate, the isolated Erlang, who rarely speaks following his stint in prison, bonds with one of the strays, a black dog initially seen as a major problem by the dogcatchers, who suspect it of having rabies.Through a series of harsh experiences, from evading the angry relatives of a person whose death has been blamed on Erlang, to surviving a cold night huddling together to keep warm after a car accident, the dog gradually becomes a companion as Erlang embarks on a journey that ultimately leads to him finding redemption through his connection with the stray.Situated within the historic mansion at 200 Xinhua Road, the Shanghai Film Art Center was unveiled on Friday to provide richer film-related experiences.

Their journey leads them to encounter a captivating princess from the nomadic Xiongnu tribes, setting the stage for their own legendary tale.Despite the digitally rejuvenated younger version of Chan in his late 20s, the grand battlefield scene, featuring over 10,000 galloping warhorses on vast grasslands, was authentically captured using conventional methods in Zhaosu county within the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.Alongside A Legend, Bona Film Group also provided updates on other significant projects, including Hu Mei's The Dream of the Red Chamber, Gao Peng's A Long Shot, and Dante Lam's Operation Leviathan.Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Film Group, revealed that most of the actresses embodying the "Jinling Shi'er Chai", representing the 12 most exceptional female characters, were aged between 14 and 16 during the 2017 filming.He suggested that younger audiences unfamiliar with the classic epic Dream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) should view the film as a succinct introduction to the novel's intricate plot and captivating characters."The Three-Body Problem," a sci-fi magnum opus by Liu Cixin, will enjoy "limitless" investment in its movie adaptation project, its production company said Tuesday.The widely-anticipated film adaptation will be loyal to the original story while placing no upper limit on investment, Wang Changtian, chairman of Beijing Enlight Media Co., Ltd., said at a forum during the 26th Shanghai International Film Festival (SIFF).It was previously announced during the SIFF that acclaimed Chinese director Zhang Yimou will lead the film adaptation of "The Three-Body Problem," considered a milestone in Chinese sci-fi literature.Wang said the company had discussed the project with Zhang for many years before he finally agreed to join.Zhao Jilong, CEO of the copyright holder Three-Body Universe Cultural Development Co., Ltd., expressed hope that the project could eventually produce a movie series.The film adaptation will be jointly developed by Beijing Enlight Media and Three-Body Universe, which manages the copyright of "The Three-Body Problem," except for the original book publication.Hugo Award winner Liu Cixin's sci-fi trilogy "The Three-Body Problem" has been translated into more than 30 languages. It was previously adapted into animation, television and radio dramas.Zhang, who is now in his 70s, has won dozens of awards around the world. His directorial works include "Red Sorghum," "Hero" and "The Great Wall."Comedy film week shows the hard work and creativity that goes into making a mark, Li Yingxue and Wu Yong report in Shenyang.People in Northeast China are noted for their sense of humor. The region's famous fertile black soil, some claim, helps shape their outgoing nature. These traits, along with hard work and humor, are perfectly suited to the film sector. It's no coincidence that more than a century ago, Ren Qingtai from Shenyang, Liaoning province, incorporated comedic elements into China's first domestic film Dingjun Mountain. On Jan 22, 1949, China's first comedic animated film Go After an Easy Prey, premiered at the Hongda Cinema in Shenyang, now the Shenyang Cultural Palace theater.Shenyang, the capital city of Liaoning, has a long and deep connection with comedy films and its "Northeast Style" has become an essential part of Chinese comedy. In recent years, popular comedic films and TV shows such as You Only Live Once, The Last Frenzy and Johnny Keep Walking have featured talents from Northeast China.Early this summer, the city of Shenyang played host to a major comedy event. The inaugural China (Shenyang) Comedy Film Week, a five-day celebration of humor and film, concluded on the evening of June 11, drawing significant attention to the Northeast region.With the theme "Comedy Gathers in Shenyang, Joy Blooms", the event ran from June 7-11, showcasing the region's vibrant comedic culture."By using comedy films as a medium, we've invited renowned comedy stars and showcased high-scoring classics to bring joy to Shenyang and celebrate this festive event," says Deng Song, deputy director of the Publicity Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee."We aim to highlight the beauty, rich culture and development of the Liaoning-Shenyang region to both domestic and international audiences, bolstering our efforts to create a 'high-quality model' for the integrated development of culture, sports and tourism," she says.During the event, eight cinemas in Shenyang screened 15 classic comedy films, including Johnny Keep Walking, If You Are the One and Goodbye Mr Loser.Lin Zhenyu, the chief director of the opening and closing ceremonies of the event, says these 15 films were carefully selected, featuring early realistic comedies, Golden Rooster Award winners, and recent hits with great reviews and box office success."We hope this event showcases the achievements and contributions of comedy since the founding of New China," Lin says.In addition to movie screenings, the Comedy Film Week offered a wide range of activities. Filmmakers visited various cultural and tourist landmarks in the city, interacting closely with fans. They explored places like the Shenyang Imperial Palace, Zhongjie Street and the Xita food street.Organizers also hosted five major events for the public, including "Coffee Youth Movie Time", the classic comedy music game "Guess Guess Guess", a showcase of domestic animated comedy films, visits to film locations of comedy movies, and a display of comedy film dubbing.On the evening of June 11, the film week concluded with a grand event themed "Blending Tradition with Innovation, Combining Joy with Sentiment".

Despite his parents' reservations, Yu, also known as Yosh Yu, chose to veer off the conventional education path, opting instead for a basketball school, a local institution that nurtures future athletic talent for the Chinese Basketball Association.Little did he anticipate that the years ahead would resemble a life akin to that of an ascetic monk. Every winter morning at 5:30, amid the harsh chill of northeastern China with temperatures frequently dropping below — 20 C, he would commence his training, occasionally concluding the session clad only in a gym vest and shorts, sweat crystallizing into ice on his lashes. He and his comrades often longed for rain the following day to provide a brief reprieve from the arduous laps around the field.As Yu saw friends depart one by one due to the demanding regimen, he persisted for five years and ultimately secured admission to Liaoning Technical University based on his sporting prowess.Despite once envisioning his future as a basketball coach or an office worker, the young man's fate took an unexpected turn.In 2018, amid more than 15,000 hopefuls, he emerged as one of the 30 young talents groomed for director Wuershan's fantastic epic trilogy, Creation of the Gods, one of the most financially endowed projects in the annals of Chinese cinema.The epic, loosely inspired by the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) novel Fengshen Yanyi (The Investiture of the Gods), recounts the collapse of a tyrant at the end of the Shang Dynasty (c. 16th century-11th century BC) and the rise of an army of justice led by Ji Fa, who founded the Western Zhou Dynasty (c.11th century-771 BC), portrayed by Yu.A subversive adaptation differing from most previous TV dramas and cinematic remakes of the novel, Creation of the Gods focuses on the growth of a group of young warriors, making the young actors' casting and training crucial for the project.Actor Hu Ge is gearing up for his domestic silver screen comeback in the upcoming film Gold or Shit, where he takes on the role of a down-and-out scriptwriter for the second time, following his performance in the art-house film All Ears last year.Having clinched top honors at the 14th Beijing International Film Festival, the movie triumphed with three Tiantan Awards earlier this year for Best Feature Film, Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress.In collaboration with actress Gao Yuanyuan, who plays a journalist and Hu's character's former classmate, the film follows the journey of Wu Di, an aspiring scriptwriter portrayed by Hu, as he decides to leave behind his pursuits in Beijing and return to his hometown in a small town in Sichuan province.Upon his unexpected homecoming, Wu encounters a lukewarm reception from his family — his strict father, artistically inclined mother, and taxi-driving sister. A meeting with Fan Liuliu, his former classmate played by Gao, presents Wu with a fresh start as she suggests filming a documentary about him, capturing the societal trend of individuals returning to their hometowns for a simpler life.With Fan's help in directing his unsellable script, Wu assembles a modest crew, including the documentary's cameraman as the cinematographer, his sister as the assistant, an unemployed actor, and his mother as the actress. As filming progresses, Wu faces a series of challenges.After an unexpected setback halts production, Wu undergoes a profound reassessment of life's purpose, leading to a transformative moment three years later.At a Beijing premiere on Sunday, director Long Fei described Gold or Shit as a "genre-defying film", drawing inspiration from the intricate details of his and scriptwriter Huang Jia's lives.Hu emphasized that the film aims not to discourage aspiring individuals facing obstacles but to convey an uplifting message. He explained: "The movie offers an alternative perspective on life — when feeling overwhelmed or encountering career hurdles, taking a break to revisit familiar surroundings and focus on overlooked aspects can pave the way for a brighter future."Gold or Shit is slated to hit domestic theaters on Saturday.Wang Ningjing's film documents her journey to find and protect the endangered Chinese immaculate tree frog, highlighting the fragile interdependence between humans and nature.On May 22, this year's International Day for Biological Diversity was celebrated under the theme "Be part of the Plan", urging action to halt and reverse the decline in biodiversity in support of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, also known as The Biodiversity Plan.Wang Ningjing, a 29-year-old Chinese wildlife filmmaker, is actively involved in this plan. Her 15-minute short film, Immaculate, was showcased at the 47th International Wildlife Film Festival in Montana, United States, in April.The documentary follows Wang's journey to find the Chinese immaculate tree frog, or Dryophytes immaculatus, a species native to China that is now on the brink of extinction. It was listed on the 2004 Red List of Threatened Species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Wang's passion for wildlife emerged at a young age. As a child, she was captivated by nature documentaries, often visiting wildlife parks and spending hours observing tadpoles by ponds.This love for nature led Wang to study ecology at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province, and later environmental health sciences at Yale University in the United States.During her field studies and travels, she discovered the power of the camera in capturing the intricate relationships between species and their habitats, as well as the fleeting animal behaviors often overlooked by the human eye."I see myself as a chronicler of the relationship between humans and nature," Wang said. "Even if I cannot change the current status of these species, at least I have documented the evidence of their existence."Wang shares her wildlife photography and related knowledge on social media. As her following grew, she realized the potential of nature photography to attract public attention and promote conservation efforts."I believe China boasts incredibly rich biodiversity and is home to dedicated conservationists," she said. "Through my films, I hope to spotlight these stories."With this mission, Wang became the first Chinese mainland student to enroll in the wildlife filmmaking program at the University of the West of England, UK, in 2022. This program, conducted in collaboration with the BBC Natural History Unit, offers a professional approach to natural documentary filmmaking.The inaugural China (Shenyang) Comedy Film Week is poised to captivate audiences in Shenyang, Liaoning province, from June 7 to 11, encapsulating the spirit of mirth and cinema under the theme "Gathering in Shenyang, Blossoming with Joy".This weeklong event, dedicated to the art of comedy films, will showcase a constellation of comedic luminaries and present a curated selection of timeless masterpieces, all aimed at infusing Shenyang with an abundance of laughter and delight.Attendees can look forward to myriad activities, including comedy film screenings, immersive explorations into Shenyang's comedic landscape, and grand opening and closing ceremonies, all of which will be broadcast across various media platforms.A total of 15 classic comedy films are slated to grace the screens of Shenyang's theaters during the festival, promising uproarious entertainment for all.

In 1898, a US missionary introduced films to Yantai, marking the city's first encounter with the cinematic world.In recent years, Yantai has emerged as a favored destination for film and television productions due to its pleasant climate, scenic coastal vistas and captivating cultural heritage. The successful hosting of this event will further boost Yantai's appeal as a shooting locale.Despite losing her eyesight at 52, Beijing resident Zhang Hua has maintained her enthusiasm for the cinema.For more than a decade, she has been a regular visitor to the China Braille Library to enjoy "barrier-free movies", a special version tailored for people with visual impairments. These movies, typically screened on Tuesdays, feature added audio narratives that explain visual elements such as character movements and settings.However, the main regret for her and fellow movie fans is that most of these films were released several years or even decades ago, primarily due to copyright issues.A new service jointly launched by the technology company Tencent and the library will expand their options. Titled "Barrier-free Cinemas", the service, aimed at benefiting China's more than 17 million visually impaired individuals, is scheduled to release over 600 films and TV dramas.Most highlighted projects include actress-director Jia Ling's YOLO, this year's highest-grossing film, the crime series The Long Season, and the sci-fi TV series Three-Body, adapted from Liu Cixin's Hugo Award-winning novel.Li Daren, deputy senior president of Tencent Video, the streaming site that provides the service, reveals that cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology will be employed to speed up production processes."In the past, creating a special version of a feature-length movie required around 30 days, with professionals needing to watch the film 13 to 15 times, write the narrative script, and perform the voice-over job," he says.The AI models developed by Tencent can automatically generate a script based on the video content. "After the wording is polished, the AI models can also generate the voice-over automatically, allowing our volunteer workers to make slight adjustments and double-check at the end. The entire process can be reduced to 10 days," he adds.The service also plans to recruit a total of 100 volunteers, with most expected to be selected among movie fans in colleges and within the company, to create barrier-free versions of the selected programs, including actress Liu Yifei's costume drama A Dream of Splendor, the romance series The Oath of Love, and actor Wu Lei's Love Like the Galaxy.He Chuan, deputy director of the China Braille Library, says that such movies, known as "audio description" in the West, can be traced back to their earliest exploration in the 1970s.He recalls that the library began to explore the production of barrier-free movies in 2003, with the first title being director Ridley Scott's historical epic, Gladiator.But it was the historical epic The Founding of a Republic, a tribute to the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, that became the first of its kind to be officially released in the barrier-free format on discs in 2011.Since then, more than 860 such movies have been produced and published, adds He."Besides incorporating voice-overs, the remade video content also includes footage of a host performing sign language, framed in a small window at the bottom right. This practice allows people with hearing impairments to comprehend the audio background," he says.With the experience accumulated over past years, He says the library has established a set of criteria to ensure the quality."To write the narrative script is akin to a translation task. The script needs to be accurate, beautifully crafted, and the writer should exercise restraint when incorporating hints within scenes. The creators must discern when to speak and when to hold back," he explains.Acknowledging that achieving such nuance and delicacy remains a challenging task for AI, he says they will conduct further training on AI models to make digital creations more humanlike."Over the past decade, we have noticed that watching films is the preferred form of entertainment for the visually impaired, garnering larger audiences than activities such as reading or learning musical instruments," says He.Nevertheless, with the rapid advancement of the Chinese film industry, he says that they have observed movies becoming increasingly challenging to narrate due to the inclusion of more action sequences, elaborate stunts and complex artistic expressions."It's a significant challenge but we are confident that we will improve in the future," he says.Anticipation mounts as the upcoming Hollywood blockbuster, Despicable Me 4, gears up for its Chinese mainland premiere on July 12.

One trailer released about a week ago by Film American Civil War, one of the official Chinese accounts marketing the film, has garnered around 1.9 million views on Weibo. Another trailer, hosted on the video platform Bilibili, has been played over 1.3 million times.One reason for the popularity of Civil War among Chinese moviegoers is its political theme, according to industry observers.Under an import quota system for films, US films shown in China have mainly focused on genres such as adventure and science fiction, with political films making up a small proportion of imports, said Zhang Yiwu, a professor at Peking University. The showing of a US political film like Civil War in domestic theaters is relatively rare, helping it gain attention, he added.Set in the near-future, the movie, written and directed by Alex Garland, follows a group of reporters who travel across the US as a rapidly escalating civil war engulfs the nation. It features stars including Kirsten Dunst and Wagner Moura.For many Chinese, Civil War offers a window into contemporary issues in US politics and society."I've seen reports in the media about the divisions and conflicts within US society. It would be interesting to watch how Americans see these problems themselves," said Zhou Ruoqi, a 29-year-old employee of a marketing company.The New York Times reported that the film taps into "a dark set of national anxieties that took hold after the Jan 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol".The newspaper went on to detect a "bipartisan sense of unease" among people in the US, and the "violence and chaos that subtly and overtly pervades American politics", citing "violent threats against members of Congress" and adding that "reports of hate crimes in the country's largest cities" have reached record levels."Although many Chinese have already learned about the complex issues in American society through media coverage, they hope to observe more about the situation in America and its attitude toward China through this movie," Zhang said.His view was shared by Sun Chenghao, a fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, who said more Chinese people will come to realize the complicated situation in the US through Civil War, an exaggerated artistic work rooted in reality.Rather than addressing its own problems, the US is distracted by attempting to "solve" the perceived "ills" in other countries, one internet user commented on Weibo.Dubbed by some US media as potentially "the year's most explosive movie", Civil War has topped the North American box office chart for two consecutive weekends.The screening of Civil War on the mainland follows the release of a number of Hollywood productions or joint productions this year, including the MonsterVerse mashup Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the animated film Kung Fu Panda 4 and the sci-fi hit Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes."I predict that Civil War will perform well," Zhang said, stopping short of predicting a blockbuster turnout as he did not expect sensational ticket sales.In recent years, the appeal of Hollywood movies has been waning among Chinese people, while increasingly diverse, high-quality domestic films have gained in popularity."Although they (Hollywood films) present visually impactful spectacles, over time, Chinese audiences have also grown weary of them," said Rao Shuguang, president of the China Film Critics Association.Xinhua The short-video boom in China has changed viewing habits, leading to a surge in a new format known as micro-dramas or miniseries, which feature episodes between tens of seconds to over 10 minutes.Accessible to anyone with a smartphone or smart device, these short series, featuring multiple plot twists and rapid story development, have quickly gained a large following.Last year, the market size of China's online short series was 37.39 billion yuan ($5.26 billion), soaring 268 percent from a year earlier, with the market expected to exceed 100 billion yuan by 2027, according to data compiled by iiMedia Research, a China-based business analysis firm.Boasting short production schedules and small budgets, many successful online miniseries have generated lucrative profits. Usually promoted on short-video platforms, such as Douyin and Kuaishou, their income is largely from users paying to see the complete production.The online miniseries Unparalleled produced by Fung Culture based in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, set a record by earning revenue of over 100 million yuan in the eight days following its release.Many new players have tapped into this market. In 2023, a total of 557 online miniseries were registered with the National Radio and Television Administration, more than double the number in 2022.Along with the rising number of series, miniseries also face an increasing need for upgrades as well as strong regulation.Short online dramas were mostly adapted from online novels with limited themes, such as unbeatable heroes, the growth of characters, or female-perspective romances, but since this year, many producers have begun to try more diverse themes, such as suspense and period dramas, according to an industry insider.China is also improving the industry's regulations. The National Radio and Television Administration removed more than 350,000 episodes of those deemed to contain harmful content, such as violence and obscenity, on multiple platforms from March to November 2023.Starting from this month, all online miniseries released or promoted by online platforms and mini-programs are required to hold an online drama publishing license or a filing number with their corresponding platform.Facing the growing competition in the domestic market, many enterprises have turned their eyes to the overseas market.The scales of the overseas and domestic markets were almost the same in 2022 and the overseas market is about to usher in new developments, according to Li Tao, general manager of Fung Culture.At the end of 2023, Reel Short, a short-series application under the COL Group in China, was among the most downloaded entertainment applications on Apple's App Store in the United States. In February this year, another Chinese application TOPShort recorded more downloads than Netflix on Japan's App Store.Bu Yanfang, a professor at the School of Economics and Management at the Communication University of China, says that Chinese online short videos or miniseries should grasp the advantages of scale, experience and innovation to produce better works and further promote Chinese culture in the international market.     To the Wonder, an 8-episode mini-series produced by iQIYI, often referred to as China’s Netflix, is slated to hit Kazakhstan’s mainstream television channel tv7 in June, featuring Kazakh dubbing, according to a recent announcement by iQIYI.Following its debut on tv7, the series will also be broadcast on other major Kazakhstani networks, including Khabar TV and Channel 31.Ilkham Ibragim, general director of the tv7 in Kazakhstan, noted that the drama series has already garnered significant attention in the country even prior to its official broadcast. Across social media local audiences have shown interest in the series’ storyline, cast and the featured Kazakh song.Directed by Teng Congcong and starring actresses Ma Yili and Zhou Yiran, along with actor Yu Shi, the show is an adaptation of award-winning essay collection My Altay by Li Juan. The collection recounts her personal experiences in the Altay region of Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.Since its premiere on April 25 in Beijing, the mini-series has attracted widespread acclaim for offering a fresh narrative and sensory experience. It blends light comedy with Li’s literary aesthetics to explore themes of nature reverence, self-discovery and the simple yet resilient spirit of the northern Xinjiang herders.In March, To the Wonder was announced by the CANNESERIES (The Cannes International Series Festival) as part of this year's Official Selection for Long Form Competition. This marks the first time a Chinese language long-form drama series has been selected in this competition since its launch in 2018.The highly anticipated Chinese TV drama Joy of Life 2, a sequel to its successful predecessor, premiered on Tencent Video and CCTV-8 on May 16, captivating audiences both domestically and internationally.Starring renowned actors Zhang Ruoyun, Li Qin, and Chen Daoming, among others, the series, adapted from Mao Ni's popular online novel, has quickly become a sensation, setting new viewership records across multiple platforms.The storyline follows Zhang Qing, a student delving into literary history, who embarks on a journey of self-discovery through writing a novel, seeking the approval of his professor.

A new book on Hotan's history and culture was published by Beijing-based Beijing Times Chinese Press, highlighting archaeological discoveries in the area, including the brocade.Hotan is located in the southern part of Xinjiang and is situated south of the majestic Kunlun Mountains, one of the longest mountain ranges in Asia, and north of the vast Taklimakan Desert. The Hotan River, Keriya River and Niya River flow south to north, creating fertile oases through the region's sedimentation.As a significant town along the Silk Road and a crossroad of cultural exchanges, Hotan has integrated various civilizations — Chinese, Central Asian, Indus Valley, Mesopotamian, and even Greco-Roman.Merged together, a brilliant ancient civilization has risen. Animal husbandry, wool weaving and paper-making industries have flourished. Language, writing, music, dance, painting and sculpture have all left indelible traces in the region.With specialized articles written by eight archaeologists from Xinjiang and 2,000 high-resolution images of archaeological remains and unearthed cultural relics, the book provides readers with a comprehensive display of the glorious humanistic landscape and splendid historical culture of Hotan over several thousand years.Eaten away by time, covered in dust, their yellowing pages testament to the history of Chinese civilization, the modern custodians of China's fragile ancient books have vowed to make full use of them, rather than leaving them slumbering in archives.On Friday, under an initiative led by the National Library of China in Beijing, key libraries around the country released digitized versions of 7,085 ancient books online for free public use.This was the 9th expansion of the national online network known as the Chinese Ancient Book Resources Database, since its launch in 2017. The number of digitized copies on the platform now stands at 105,000, according to Wang Honglei, director of the administration office of the National Center for Preservation and Conservation of Ancient Books. The expansion also celebrated the 115th anniversary of the founding of the national library, which fell on Monday.Wang adds that other libraries have also digitized their collections, with an additional 34,000 books held at 44 institutions also uploaded for the benefit of researchers.For the new expansion, national library contributed 1,024 books, including 274 listed as rare editions.A print edition of the Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian), which was published in 1171, is one such example. Compiled in the 1st century BC by Sima Qian, it is a foundation text of Chinese history, and has been republished as a reference for national governance throughout the centuries.A precious Northern Song period (960-1127) edition of the Houhanshu (Book of Later Han), which is about the history of Eastern Han Dynasty (24-220), was also included.Due to age and conflict, not too many Northern Song books were lucky enough to survive, according to Chen Hongyan, head of the ancient book department at the NLC. Only three books in the collection of the national library, including the Houhanshu, can be definitively credited to the period.Other key texts released include a Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) version of Suwen (Basic Questions), a part of the Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon) — the earliest known book of traditional Chinese medicine, which dates back at least 2,000 years. This classic of medicine was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2011."Our studies of classics in recent years will benefit the digitization of ancient books," Li Hongtao, a researcher at the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, says. "It will help with the revitalization of traditional Chinese medicine in modern society."Nanjing library, the provincial-level public library of Jiangsu province, contributed most of the digitized books to this recent expansion, a total of 3,600 in all. Other than precious Song (960-1279) and Yuan dynasty editions, it also released collected works by Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) writers, and rarely-seen versions of local chronicles.Many ancient books written in scripts other than Chinese characters were also digitized and released to improve understanding of China's collective history. A total of 115 books in Tibetan, Manchu, and Mongolian, as well as in extinct languages like Khitan, Jurchen, and Khotan, were uploaded for the use of researchers from the national library's collection.Separately, the release of 42 books by ethnic groups in Yunnan province, which are part of the collection of the province's office for the publication of ancient books of non-Han ethnic groups, tell a remarkable saga of the southwestern region."Academics have great need of digitized versions of ancient books," Zhang Zhiqing, deputy director of the National Library of China, says. "Referring to original copies is crucial to the study of literature if researchers are to avoid mistakes from using secondary sources."Before the archive's creation, researchers had to come to Beijing and pay to use the national library's resources. And because the new digital database is free to use, the platform has attracted wider public interest.Zhang says that in 2020, 19.7 percent of papers published on The Documentation, an academic journal of textual studies edited by the national library, were credited to the database, a figure that has climbed to 38.7 percent this year.He estimated that only 20 to 25 percent of the national library's ancient book collection has been digitized."There's a long way to go," Zhang says. "Ancient books can be properly preserved only when they are read and used."The Baixin Bookstore, a time-honored Shanghai establishment that dates back to 1912, has recently found a new existence as an integrated cultural and lifestyle space.The century-old bookstore and publisher is located on Fuzhou Road, once one of four main roads in downtown Shanghai. Dotted with bookstores and publishing houses, it is known as the "street of culture".After refurbishment as a cultural and commercial space, the new Baixin Bookstore opened on July 31 as Baixin Book S. With books as its core, it integrates a variety of other offerings including dining and cafe options, exhibitions, shows, a paper and a record store, expanding the role and possibilities of a bookstore.Chen Xinqiao, its 34-year-old general manager, says that the bookstore occupies a prime location close to schools, white collar businesses, as well as tourists and visitors from all over China and the world."A bookstore is a physical space, and we must take into account the demand for offline consumption today, such as dining areas, (cultural) salons for social networking, exhibitions and lectures," says Chen. "We are trying to attract more visitors with the different divisions and layout."Baixin consists of six areas. In addition to its well-designed book store and categorized display areas, its dining space and paper store are equally eye-catching.Named the Bao Du Bookstro, which basically means "to read and be full", the dining space is inspired by the concepts of the "bistro" and the "strolling in books". Chen says that Baixin is like a book itself, as it hopes to provide visitors with a space to stroll among books and become mentally full, as well as become physically full with the tasty food on offer.Superpaper Sonic, the paper store inside the bookstore, is another historical Shanghai brand. Established in 1934, it specializes in selling all kinds of paper, and is now looking to explore more possibilities in the use of paper, and different lifestyle options."Superpaper Sonic is becoming more international. Many of the products on sale are made for it abroad in countries like Thailand and Nepal. It also offers paper lifestyle options. Apart from being used for writing and packaging, paper can also be a form of home decoration, used for curtains, carpets and even vases," he explains.One of China's biggest annual publishing events draws crowds from all over the country in search of something new, Zhang Kun reports.The 20th Shanghai Book Fair, one of China's largest annual fairs for readers and the publishing industry, recently took place at the Shanghai Exhibition Center, attracting visitors from all over the country.

Both exhibitions were organized by China International Book Trading Corporation (CIBTC), New Zealand Culture and Arts Foundation and Prime Media Group of New Zealand.Chen Shijie, Chinese consul-general in Auckland, noted reading is one of the most important ways that Chinese people realize equal dialogue, mutual learning and common development with other countries, including New Zealand."China's relations with the world changed dramatically. The world needs to understand China better, and China also needs to introduce itself to the world better. China's publishing industry has made remarkable achievements in its globalization, supporting China to expand its influence in major book fairs and increase the popularity of Chinese publishing enterprises," he added.Yang Lufeng, vice president of CIBTC, said that CIBTC is a pioneer and main force in the promotion of Chinese culture going global, committing to building a bridge of cultural exchange and friendship between China and other countries, constantly leading Chinese publishing units to go global, and continuously building a platform for Chinese culture to go global. He hoped both exhibitions would further promote cultural exchanges and integration between China and New Zealand, allowing more and more New Zealand readers to understand a real China.Deputy Mayor of Waipa District Council, Liz Stolwyk noted that this is the third time that Waipa people have met both exhibitions. They have become an important window for the local area to understand China, and an important link connecting local Chinese and other ethnic groups. "They bring two nations' people together in such an inspiring way."Local citizen James visited the exhibitions together with his daughter. He said that New Zealanders are eager to learn about China, the country's largest trading partner. "Books and paintings are the best ways to know a country and its culture."The books will be donated to local libraries and schools.Project underscores efforts to promote interest in Chinese literature among readers overseas, Yang Yang reports.Phoenix Publishing & Media Group plans to host a China-Italy international poetry festival in Rome at the end of 2025, based on a mutual translation project of contemporary poems from the two countries, Yuan Nan, vice-president of Phoenix Publishing & Media Inc, says."Of all the literary forms, poetry is the one most suitable for dissemination, and has a strong impact on people from different cultures," Yuan says, adding that the PPMG and its Italian partner Delufa Press are both leading contemporary publishers of poetry.In May, the PPMG and the Jiangsu Writers' Association organized a visit to Hungary and France, with writer and poet Han Dong as one of those representing Jiangsu province.At the 15th Readers’ Conference held on Friday during the ongoing 32nd National Book Expo in Jinan, Shandong province, Rong Xinjiang and Cao Wenxuan led other speakers in presenting the audience with a feast of traditional cultural, life retrospectives, and insights into their reading and writing.The two writers, who are both professors at Peking University, shared their new books — Rong about his search for scrolls and other written material from the Dunhuang Grottoes, and Cao about his new novel.“The lost scrolls and Buddhist texts from Dunhuang help piece together a picture of ancient China and its exchanges with cultures along the Silk Road between the 5th to 8th centuries,” Rong said, adding his search began in the 1980s and has led him to libraries and universities in 48 cities around the world.Cartoonist Bai Cha, the pen name of Liang Kedong, whose illustrated stories about a cat called Wu Huang and his friends have become popular, shared anecdotes about he got involved with books and began his career.David Damrosch embarked on a virtual voyage around the world during the pandemic and now the fruit of his project, Around the World in 80 Books, has been published in the United States and China. It will be one of the highlights at the upcoming Shanghai Book Fair in August.The professor of comparative literature at Harvard University is director of Harvard's Institute for World Literature. In 2020, when the world came to a halt because of the COVID-19 pandemic, he decided to start a new blogging project. "With a whole series of travel plans canceled, I decided in the summer of 2020 to follow the lead of Jules Verne's globe-trotting hero Phileas Fogg. In my case, I went voyaging around the world not in person but through 80 books."One of Damrosch's former students, Chinese American Professor Song Mingwei of Wellesley College, immediately followed up and put together a team of translators to translate the blog into Chinese. Damrosch posted essays every week from May to August in 2020, completing the project in 16 weeks. The Chinese translation was serialized almost simultaneously in the weekly literary journal the Shanghai Book Review from May 21 to Sept 12."This writing project demonstrates resilience in a period of crisis. During the pandemic, there was someone reading and writing, spreading a message of hope," Song said earlier this year, during the book tour for the Chinese edition.Around the World in 80 Books was published by Penguin Books in the US and by Pelican Books in the United Kingdom in 2022.The Chinese edition was published by the Shanghai Translation Publishing House in April.For Shao Quanxi, compiling an encyclopedia is more than a professional endeavor; it is the realization of a personal dream.How many decades does a person have in a lifetime? How many of those decades are spent in one's career? For the editors of the Encyclopedia of Plant Protection in China, the project was like nurturing a child from infancy to adolescence. This monumental work took a decade to complete, representing the dedication of over 3,000 experts in the field of plant protection.Encyclopedia of Plant Protection in China thoroughly introduces the disciplinary system of plant protection, incorporating the latest policies and advancements within the field.Published by the China Forestry Publishing House, it consists of 8 volumes and 16 books, including the Comprehensive Volume, Volume on Plant Pathology, Volume on Insects, Volume on Weeds, Volume on Pesticides, Volume on Rodent Damages, Volume on Biological Controls, and Volume on Biosafety.The book set, primarily compiled between 2012 and 2022, stands as the first systematic, comprehensive and authoritative reference in China's plant protection domain, filling a significant gap in the nation's encyclopedic resources.Shao Quanxi, the chief editor of China Forestry Publishing House and the general leader of the encyclopedia project, is set to retire next year. The publication of the encyclopedia marks a notable achievement at the end of his extensive career.This encyclopedia represents monumental work under the national publishing quality strategy of China Forestry Publishing House. It is a key national publication planning project, a national dictionary compilation and publication planning project, and a project funded by the National Publishing Fund.Despite its academic value, the encyclopedia is accessible to a broad audience. "The encyclopedia is like an open university without walls, representing a country's mature technological development. It can be read by both adults and children, serving an educational role and playing a vital part in the popularization of a country's scientific and cultural education," Shao said.The 20th installment of Shanghai Book Fair will take place at Shanghai Exhibition Center from August 14 to 20, the municipal government announced on Tuesday.

This historical event led to the birth of Peking Opera.Based on the attire of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties, the costumes of Peking Opera underwent a transformation spanning over 200 years. Enriched by the diverse cultural influences from different regions across the country, these costumes evolved into a sophisticated set of elaborate, detailed and majestic dress codes.Costumes are crucial to the artistic beauty of Peking Opera, supporting character portrayals and enhancing the performance's expressiveness.Upon a performer's entrance onto the stage, seasoned spectators can quickly discern the character portrayed based on the attire and makeup. When several performers appear, it is also easy to tell the strata they belong to in the social hierarchy, especially in the stories set in ancient China, in Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, for example."Traditionally, Peking Opera repertoire includes 3,000 stories set in Tang and 800 set in Song, as well as numerous in eras such as the Warring States Period (475-221 BC), Ming and Qing. The presentation of so many stories relies solely on costumes packed in the limited costume trunks owned by a troupe," said author Liu Fei at the recent book launch ceremony of Huafu Nichang (Gorgeous Attire and Iridescent Clothing: On Peking Opera Costumes) in Beijing.The 34th Hong Kong Book Fair opened on Wednesday, kicking off a week-long cultural bonanza featuring over 600 activities.Readers thronged the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center on Wednesday to pick from rigorously curated selections of books from exhibitors.Fairgoers can also meet writers from around the world during this year's event.

It opened its Changfeng branch on West Guangfu Road in Putuo district on July 19, 2022, marking the beginning of dual-site service.With its attractive aesthetics, efficiency, and emphasis on experience, the library said that its two outlets have become beloved institutions for young readers and families.The library has developed an extensive reading service system of "Honey Treasure" that offers both online and offline reading services, such as Honey Treasure Cloud Study Room, offline Honey Treasure Study Rooms, Honey Treasure Book Stations, and Honey Treasure Book Truck services.Highlighting the library's summer calendar this year is the "Read & Encounter" Shanghai Fairy Tale Festival, which features various reading activities, including lectures, exhibitions, art classes, and volunteer programs. Collaborations with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra's "Wonton Wrapper Family Art Festival" and science workshops further enrich the library's offerings.The library's efforts to bring high-quality children's reading services to grassroots levels have been widely praised by visitors for its vast collection, comfortable environment, and educational values."The establishment of such venues really adds value to children's life and makes the city more child friendly. I hope that more such child-friendly facilities can be added in neighborhoods," said a netizen Nayan.Wang Biye contributed to this story.Lei Jingjing emerged last year as the leading borrower at Ordos Library by checking out 540 books. This impressive feat positions her at the top of the library's borrowing charts in Ordos in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region.Lei's frequent visits were primarily to benefit her two children. Each week, she would escort them to the library, where her eldest, a fifth-grader, has a penchant for literature and history and her youngest, a first-grader, finds joy in the picture book section.For over a decade, Ordos Library has consistently published its annual list of top borrowers. Like Lei, the top 10 borrowers each year predominantly check out children's books. With a population of just over 2 million, the city's library sees annual traffic of more than 1,300,000 patrons, the vast majority being children, teenagers and accompanying parents.In 2023, the library's circulation exceeded 700,000, with the peak month being August with checkouts reaching 180,000."The library has dedicated reading areas for children and teenagers, including sections for electronic checkouts and digital experiences. Our peak periods are during the winter and summer months," says Wang Yisha, who has worked at the library since 2009.Wang once encountered a patron who arrived with a suitcase to borrow books, using library cards for the entire family to check out more than 30 volumes in one go. The library restricts each person to borrowing eight books at a time.According to borrowing records from recent years, the top-ranked books are predominantly children's literature that mostly focuses on history and culture."I feel that the reading culture is growing stronger. Parents are keen on fostering their children's reading habits," Wang says.The library adopted an intelligent system more than a decade ago. Machines throughout the facility allow patrons to easily search for and borrow books. Each bookshelf is equipped with smart technology and the massive eight-story library, composed of three interconnected buildings, employs a staff of just over 50.In 1857, British Sinologist Alexander Wylie founded the first Chinese news monthly in Shanghai called Liuhe Congkan (Shanghai Serial), which introduced Western learning to the East and Chinese culture to the West.Columnist Joseph Edkins, who worked for the monthly publication, wrote essays about classic Western literature, including epics by Greek poet Homer and the ancient Greek theaters. In his piece, A Brief Discussion on Greek Poets, he mentioned the tragic and comic poets Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes, as well as their works."The introduction of these cultures and ideas from the West has played a crucial role in the construction of modern Chinese thought, value standards and aesthetic systems," said Luo Tong, a scholar specializing in Greek theater at the Shanghai Theatre Academy, at a recent launch event for the Chinese translation of the book, How to Fit All of Ancient Greece in an Elevator. The book will be released next month.At the start of the 20th century, Western culture was widely introduced to China along with the New Culture Movement."Mr Democracy" and "Mr Science" from the democratic times of ancient Greece, featured in a contemporary way with updated meanings by Chinese intellectuals, greatly influenced Chinese society, which was going through a profound transformation. Old-generation scholars at that time began translating and studying ancient Greek literature and history more systematically, Luo says.Recently launched in Beijing, the Shao Dazhen Collection of Art Criticism shines a spotlight on a new compilation of his insightful art criticism articles dating back to the 1950s.Shao Dazhen, a distinguished critic and professor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, has maintained a continuous output for over six decades since his seminal piece "Donkeys, Chimpanzees, and Others" graced the pages of a magazine in 1958. With a prolific portfolio exceeding 1,000 art criticism articles to date, the majority of his works have emerged since the 1980s.Organized in chronological order based on their publication or writing dates, the articles within his collection offer a window into the evolution of Shao's perspectives on art criticism, allowing readers to trace the development of his thoughts over time.This comprehensive collection spans all of his art criticism articles from the 1950s to the present, alongside previously unpublished commentaries on both Chinese and foreign art. It is categorized into sections covering foreign art criticism, critiques of Chinese painting and oil painting, analysis of artistic trends, phenomena, and issues, as well as evaluations of individual artists. Together, these sections offer a thorough and insightful exploration of his profound reflections on the realms of Chinese and international fine arts.The families of Taiwan writers Yu Guangzhong (1928-2017) and Sanmao (1943-91), born as Chen Maoping and also known to the English-speaking world as Echo Chan, recently donated a selection of their manuscripts and other literary documents to the National Museum of Modern Chinese Literature in Beijing.They made the donation when they attended a forum on June 29 to enhance literary ties across the Taiwan Strait in Xiamen, Fujian province, which was held as part of the Straits Forum, the largest grassroots cross-Strait exchange event.It was the first literary event at the Straits Forum, which attracted 140 renowned writers from both sides, including Shu Ting, Zhang Xiaofeng and A Yi, as well as youth representatives from various universities.Sanmao's younger brother Chen Chieh says that in his sister's short life, she wrote many books beloved by readers on both sides of the Strait."Sanmao loved traveling and writing; she cherished Chinese culture and left deep footprints on the Chinese mainland. This grand event is a rare opportunity to take her legacy home," Chen Chieh said of his sister, who was born and spent the first three years of her life in Chongqing until the family relocated to Taiwan in 1948.Yu's daughter Yu Pei-san talked about her late father's great love for books. "Ever since I was a child, I would see him carefully wiping his books, again and again, using his clothes. He didn't care much about clothes, but books were especially precious."My father used to say that if we compare Chinese culture to concentric circles, the core would be Chinese culture while the radius would be the Chinese language. Wherever the Chinese language reaches, that's how far the circles extend. As long as the language survives, its spirit and culture will advance together, promoting one another."Taiwan writer Chen Hsiu-Mei, whose pen name is Chen Ruoxi, recalls how she embarked on her literary journey and the profound influence a teacher from the Chinese mainland had on her. She says that she hopes her life story will help the younger generations open their minds and create their own literary connections.According to Huang Wentao, deputy head of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, the literary forum included a series of associated events, among which were discussions about writing novels and poetry, lectures and recitations of classical works.From July 1 to Wednesday, writers and youth representatives from the Chinese mainland and Taiwan visited Nanjing, the provincial capital of Jiangsu province, to go to the museums and experience the city's natural and cultural landscapes.Hu Bangsheng, Party group member of the China Writers Association, one of the organizers of the literary event, says that writers from both sides of the Strait share a profound literary tradition and have been enhancing exchange and mutual understanding of late.He says that in hosting the event, the organizers were seeking to deepen the friendship between literary circles on both sides through the medium of Chinese culture to build an exchange platform and nurture young writers.He adds that over the years, the China Writers Association has organized seminars and exchanged visits to promote literary connections between both sides of the Strait, and that the National Museum of Modern Chinese Literature has manuscripts and other literary documents belonging to 30 Taiwan writers. It has also carried out research and preservation in this regard.A new book Dahanghai Shidai (The Great Age of Navigation), written by Wu Zheneng, was recently published by the Contemporary World Press.Dahanghai Shidai tells the story of a group of courageous warriors who set sail into the western Pacific Ocean in a galleon. Along their journey, they experience and witness cyclones, the powerful and often deadly Kuroshio Current, and island chains, among other phenomena.Wu views his writing as an embodiment of his vision and ambition on ocean exploration. In this novel, he conveys his knowledge and expectations from various perspectives, including astronomy, geography, history, and politics. An important aim of this book is to encourage people, especially future generations, to look at China's era of great navigation with scientific and innovative modern thinking and move toward a new era of great navigation.The inspiration comes from the time he spent with his children learning to sail in the South China Sea."Ocean sailing is a very romantic theme," said the author, recounting his daughter's comments after reading his book. "Sailing is (the moment when) the light blue meets the dark blue, with only the sky and the earth (ocean) left around. The wind blows across the vast expanse of sea, creating a layer of white gauze; waves echo with the breath of wind, combine into a great musical dance. That whiteness is accompanied by the wind, like small notes jumping on sheet music."Wu believes his daughter's feelings reflect the romance seen by sailors, and himself."This novel shows patriotic sentiment. Its pragmatic narrative style is worthy of promotion, and its theme deserves in-depth exploration," said Shen Guofang, former Foreign Ministry spokesman and China's ambassador to the United Nations. "China is a major maritime country. It is crucial to pay attention to safeguarding our maritime rights and interests, and to promote the pioneering spirit among the young generations."Wu holds a Ph.D. from Nankai University, a master's degree from Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, and a bachelor's degree from Beijing Foreign Studies University.Wu has served in the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the China Development Bank China-Africa Fund, Singapore Temasek, and other institutions. He was a postgraduate tutor at the School of Finance of Nankai University.Zhang Shangqing contributed to this story. Digital intelligence poses opportunities and challenges to education, say experts in the sector, Yang Yang reports.As digital technology, especially artificial intelligence, quickly advances, it poses great challenges to the worldwide publishing industry while providing new methods, tools and paths for its development.At the 2024 Beijing International Book Fair last month, domestic and foreign publishers gathered to share their experiences and ideas at the fair's 2024 International Publishing Industry Forum themed "Digital Intelligence Empowers Education Publishing and International Cooperation".Since 2016, the forum, jointly organized by the Publisher Association of China, the International Publishers Association and China Publishing Group, has held eight editions during the Beijing International Book Fair and the London Book Fair, attracting more than 1,000 publishing professionals from more than 40 countries and regions.The theme of this year's forum is highly enlightening for the development of our publishing industry as it stands at a critical crossroads, particularly evident in China, says Huang Zhijian, chairman of China Publishing Group.People's reading and consumption habits, book distribution channels and marketing methods, as well as the industry's competitive landscape and growth drivers, have all undergone significant changes, he says."Digital intelligence technology has become an unavoidable choice," Huang says.The Handbook of The Belt and Road, an encyclopedic account of the Belt and Road Initiative, was launched in multilingual versions on June 20 in Beijing.The book involved 110 scholars as writers to offer 498 entries, as "we strive to comprehensively and systematically reflect the latest progress and latest expressions of the initiative", said Zhao Jianglin, one of the executive editors of the book and a researcher from the Institute of European Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.The idea of publishing the book, by Cai Fang and Peter Nolan, first surfaced in 2017. It has been revised and enriched in its 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024 (to be published soon) Chinese editions. Cai is an economist with the Chinese academy and Nolan is an acclaimed British expert on China and an economist.Zhao said the book elaborates the original intention and principles of the initiative, as well as its history and current situation, basic knowledge and related research.After the launch of the English-language version in Cambridge, Britain, in 2018, contract agreements were signed for it to be published in 17 various languages. So far eight have already been released, including in Polish by Adam Marszalek Publishing and in Romanian by Ideea Europeana Press.As its English-language publisher, Jeremy North, president of Global Book Business of Taylor Francis Publishing Group, spoke of its influence. "The Belt and Road Initiative, since its launch, has sparked great debates and interests among a wide range of people in the English-speaking world," North said.He added that this has been frequently reflected on coverage in newspapers, TV and magazines. "But the most authoritative information comes from the handbook (known as the Routledge Handbooks)," he said, adding the book showcases how two international publishers could work closely to present the work by multiple scholars.North said the success of the handbook is a milestone in the history of cooperation between China and the United Kingdom over the years, and is "an exemplary work of dialogue and cooperation between Chinese and Western scholars, and an exemplary work of disseminating knowledge and promoting people-to-people connection".Zhao Jianying, president of the handbook's Chinese publisher, China Social Sciences Press, said that the book boosts exchanges with the world's think tanks, and deepens mutual understanding among public in various countries.The 2024 Beijing International Publishing Forum, held on June 21 at the China National Convention Center, explored the theme of "Technology Innovation for Publishing". Organized by China National Publications Import & Export (Group) Corporation, the event brought together experts, scholars and professionals from publishing and tech industries, both domestic and international.With over 200 participants from around the world, the forum offered a comprehensive platform to discuss innovation, trends, and technological applications within the publishing landscape.In his keynote speech, Wu Shulin, president of the Publishers Association of China, said that innovation is the essential characteristic of publishing and the fundamental driving force behind its iterative development.As the publishing industry actively embraces new quality productive forces and pursues innovative development, it will inevitably face challenges and tests related to technological transformation and copyright protection, he said.He suggested that publishing companies should prioritize technological innovation and digitalization to improve efficiency and provide seamless access for readers. They should also focus on copyright protection, optimizing industrial structures, enhancing academic standards, exploring international cooperation, and cultivating talent to invigorate the industry's development.Zhang Zehui, director of the Import and Export Administration Bureau of National Press and Publication Administration, emphasized that global collaboration and high-quality production are key to advancing publishing. He urged publishers to develop new models and leverage their resources to drive growth in the digital age.Chang Bo, president of China Publishing Group, introduced several corpora under the group and the first ancient book collation large model, the "Xunzi" Ancient Book Large Language Model. Based on this, he proposed fully utilizing new technologies to drive content innovation, channel expansion, and process reshaping to better cultivate new quality productive forces in the publishing industry.Karine Pansa, president of the International Publishers Association, said that publishers have always been innovating and actively embracing new technologies.However, amid the focus on digitalization and artificial intelligence, it is important not to forget that readers still love physical books. As a result, reforms and innovations in publishing must aim to produce better books to guide and serve readers who enjoy sitting down with a good book, she said.In their keynote speeches, industry leaders including Alexander Broich of Cengage Select, Zhang Jiuzhen from Peking University, Arnout Jacobs of Springer Nature Greater China, Shen Jian of Xinhua Publishing House, Maurits van den Boogert of De Gruyter Brill, and Shao Dan of CNPIEC UNTRO Ltd discussed how new technologies like AI are transforming publishing. They emphasized the need for innovation, digital integration, and high-quality development. Key strategies include cultivating versatile talent and establishing guidelines for ethical AI use to address copyright and other issues, ensuring technology boosts the publishing industry effectively.The 34th Hong Kong Book Fair, organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), will be held from July 17 to 23 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, the HKTDC has announced.This year's book fair will stage more than 600 cultural events onsite and off-site, including acclaimed writers' seminars and book launches to help promote a stronger reading culture in Hong Kong.Sophia Chong, deputy executive director of the HKTDC, said that this year's book fair will be themed on film and television literature, with the tagline "Reading the World: Storytelling from Page to Screen," aimed at encouraging more locals and tourists to discover the joy of reading and appreciate the charm of Hong Kong's literary, film and television works, thus helping shape Hong Kong into an East-meets-West center for international cultural exchange.The book fair will feature eight seminar series, with authors invited to share and exchange ideas on topics including theme of the year and renowned writers.The book fair will run concurrently with the HKTDC Sports and Leisure Expo and HKTDC World of Snacks.

She said the company hopes to "bring informative and distinctive works to children in different countries and introduce China to them."Official data shows that children's books make up the largest segment of China's book retail market, accounting for around 27 percent of the market share.The book fair also featured cooperation between Chinese publishers and overseas institutions on the production and publication of children's books. Ahead of the fair, the 21st Century Publishing Group and the Embassy of Italy in Beijing jointly held a press conference on the release of a new book in the Italian classic children's book series "Geronimo Stilton," titled "Adventure of Marco Polo."

To mark its debut, a celebratory reading event took place at Jinghualou Restaurant in Beijing, offering a glimpse into the culinary traditions that defined the era.Authored by Wang Xifu, hailing from a prestigious lineage of imperial chefs, the book delves deep into the virtues, talents, and skills that shaped Beijing's culinary landscape. Drawing from his family's legacy, Wang's narrative vividly portrays the individuals and customs that once thrived in this vibrant industry.Despite not being a professional chef, Wang's dedication to preserving traditional culinary arts shines through. Drawing from his family's expertise, he resurrected his father's chef training classes in 2000, reviving nearly forgotten recipes and techniques, fostering a new generation of talented chefs who have since become integral to Beijing's culinary tapestry.XI'AN — Jiao Meining, 47, took a particular liking to a picture book titled That Book Woman, based on the true story of female librarians traversing mountains to deliver books to children in the rural United States, which went on to inspire her own life."Even in snowstorms, these librarians would deliver books on time to rural households in the mountains, allowing children in remote areas to read," she says.Following in the footsteps of the librarians in the story, Jiao has provided picture book classes to at least 100,000 children in more than 400 schools over the past nine years, with many located in remote rural areas of Northwest China's Shaanxi province.Born in a rural part of Lintong district of the provincial capital of Xi'an, Jiao developed a passion for reading at a young age. She soon realized that rural children had less access to quality reading resources than their peers in big cities.When she became the owner of a bookstore offering some 14,000 picture books, she began thinking of ways to help. A lecture she attended in 2015 gave her the direction she needed."In late 2015, during a lecture at the Shaanxi Library, I saw Japanese picture book author Tatsuya Miyanishi and listened to his story of persistence in providing picture book classes to children and parents in Japan for more than 20 years," she says.Motivated by his experience, Jiao sprang into action. About a month later, a local primary school invited her to try her hand at an on-campus class. Once it ended, she felt that her confidence was boosted by the children's enthusiastic applause.In 2016, Jiao visited the Muzhai Central Primary School in Lintong to read stories to the pupils there. When she finished, the children were eager for more, but she had already read all the picture books she had brought."When I was about to leave, a child called out to me, 'Teacher Jiao, can you bring 10,000 books next time?' I felt sad, and I thought that no matter what, I must persist in this work."Having worked as a docent at several scenic areas in Lintong, which is now a popular tourist destination, Jiao is able to read picture books aloud with passion."When I tell stories, I try to be an actor and do my best to perform using my facial expressions, voice and body movements.""For a long time, under the illuminating presence of the sun and the moon, the stone seemed to come alive. And one day, with a thunderous crack, it split apart!" Jiao pronounces, mimicking the sound of the stone shattering and the piercing screams of a group of monkeys. She was telling the story of the birth of the Monkey King, a tale from the Chinese classic Journey to the West, to a group of children at another primary school in Lintong.To broaden her listeners' horizons, Jiao reviews various materials and prepares early for each class. When she tells animal stories, for example, she also talks about how entomologists conduct their research."In class, I don't define the children's understanding of the stories as right or wrong. I encourage them to dare to think and speak, even if their thoughts and words might seem absurd," she says. "Maybe something I say or a plot I tell will trigger their curiosity and ignite their thinking."Her storytelling classes have been well-received among students. Some children in the schools she visits have even memorized her license plate number so they can rush to surround her with excitement as soon as she arrives at the school gates.The effects of these classes have gone beyond the classroom. Han Lei, principal of the Renzong Central Primary School, says that many children have become bolder and more confident as a result, and are developing improved lifestyle habits.Under Jiao's influence, more than 10 parents have joined in her work."I hope I can be like the female librarians in That Book Woman, planting the seeds of enthusiasm for reading in rural and mountainous regions, and illuminating the hearts of more children," she says.Doctor offers readers a better understanding of medicine at its most critical point, Yang Yang reports.Bo Shining, a 49-year-old chief physician from the Intensive Care Unit of Peking University Third Hospital, arrived at the interview on a hot summer afternoon after a night shift. With an iced Americano in hand, he answered the questions with a doctor's sobriety and reason.But when he recalled the medical case that inspired him to become a doctor specializing in intensive care, a teardrop slid down from the corner of his right eye.More than two decades ago, Bo chose clinical medicine as his university major because "it's difficult to get into", he says.In his fifth year of university in 1997, Bo, a curious intern at a hospital, came across a very important patient — his 20-year-old younger brother, also a university student, who was critically ill as his kidneys were failing quickly due to unidentified reasons.Without a pathological examination basis, and judging from the symptoms, Bo believed that the cause was rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, a dangerous disease in the kidneys with a mortality rate of 80 to 90 percent within six months without proper treatment. Even if some patients survived, they would have to rely on renal dialysis for the rest of their lives.Considering such a terrible prognosis would happen to such a young man who was otherwise very healthy, and seeing his father, a tough man who served in the army, crying, tears rushed from Bo's eyes.Desperate to save his younger brother, Bo misjudged the cause of the disease. Luckily, a reputed doctor corrected his mistake, saying that it might be epidemic hemorrhagic fever but they needed a test to confirm the diagnosis.Bo took his brother's blood sample to a provincial center for disease control that was 3 kilometers away by bicycle. On the second day, it was raining heavily. When Bo took the test result that confirmed the expert's diagnosis, he rushed back in the pouring rain, forgetting his bike.Soon his brother fully recovered from the disease without any long-term effects."This is the first critical case that I encountered in my career. I realized that illnesses can quickly devastate a family and intensive care medicine can save many people's lives," he says, which is how he decided to become an ICU doctor.In 2001, after graduating from the Peking University Health Science Center, Bo entered the ICU at PKU Third Hospital.As he has strived to keep critically ill people alive and experienced life and death every day for more than two decades, he began questioning how to improve people's ability to cope with diseases."After all, the number of people that doctors can save is limited. If you wait until an illness becomes severe before going to the hospital, even the most skilled doctors will find it difficult. But if people can gain a comprehensive understanding of medicine and grasp basic medical knowledge, perhaps by attending a 'concise medical college' through reading, then we won't be so helpless when faced with diseases," writes Bo in the preface of the book Bo Shining Yixue Tongshi Jiangyi (Medicine in a Nutshell), published in 2019.The book was one of the first of its kind in China, in which Bo summarized his understanding of health, disease, life and the medical profession based on his 18-year work experience.The 30th Beijing International Book Fair kicked off at the China National Convention Center, featuring a sprawling exhibition space of 55,000 square meters and drawing 1,600 exhibitors from 71 countries and regions.

Furthermore, high-level forums like the PubTech Conference on Wednesday will delve into the integration of artificial intelligence in the publishing sector.The BIBF will continue to spotlight picture books, art books in multiple languages, illustrations, and culinary literature, maintaining its status as the world's second-largest book fair of its kind.The Chinese translation of Humphrey Carpenter's J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography, published recently by Horizon Books, comes with an unusual set of five cards showcasing an ingenious transcultural design that will be of interest to many readers, at home and abroad.The cards bear a short self-introduction of Tolkien, English writer and the author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The introduction is curiously written in an ancient Chinese calligraphy style. It almost looks like it was photocopied from ancient Chinese books.Last year, when Dai Guqiu and Mu Dong were working on the Chinese translation of the book, Dai shared with Mu his idea of inserting, in the books, a set of cards, on which they could print a brief introduction of Tolkien in ancient Chinese style."Dai has a hobby of collecting photographs from ancient books," says Mu, the 38-year-old translator of the book. "He said we could use ancient Chinese script to write a short introduction of Tolkien and he would find all the ancient Chinese characters of the script from his collection, so that in the end we can put together an entire passage in a style taken from ancient books."Dai, a Tolkien fan, also revised the translation.On his first trip to East Asia, award-winning author discusses 'truth' during literary appearances, Fang Aiqing reports.Within Johann Sebastian Bach's polyphony — with its repetition, inversion and reversion — novelist Hernan Diaz found inspiration, penning Trust, in a book-within-a-book format, exploring family, wealth and ambition, that won him the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.Since the recent publication of its Chinese version, Diaz, who was born in Argentina, raised in Sweden and currently lives in the United States, embarked on his first journey to China, a novel land for him. It was also his first trip to East Asia.From May 11 to 17, the author was held to a tight schedule of public appearances and book signings in Shanghai, Beijing, and Nanjing, the provincial capital of East China's Jiangsu province, where he met Chinese counterparts, critics and a group of serious readers who are particularly curious about the male writer who cares for, studies and raises women's voices through storytelling.Trust revolves around the mysterious wealthy couple Andrew and Mildred Bevel in New York, who earned an exponential fortune during the Great Depression in the late 1920s and '30s.The story is told in a quartet of narratives rendered in different literary styles, forming integral material for understanding the wealth growth and intimate life of the couple.The first narrative, Bonds: A Novel, is credited to a fictitious Harold Vanner, followed by the second narrative, an unfinished autobiography of the husband as a result of his anger toward Vanner's work, in which Helen Rask, a character based on Mildred Bevel, struggles with mental illness in the last days of her life.SHANGHAI — In the realm of detective fiction, the truth often lies shrouded in enigmas, with both the characters within the pages and the authors who pen these tales of suspense working to unveil them. Shi Chen, a detective novelist born in 1987, has not only penned 15 gripping detective novels but also founded a bookstore dedicated to the genre, called Mystery Books.With its pure white exterior and gray-black cement floor, the minimalist industrial design of Mystery Books mirrors the essence of detective fiction.Within its 60-square-meter space, a meticulously curated collection of hundreds of books awaits readers. The shelves are adorned with works by writers such as Edgar Allan Poe, Agatha Christie, Keigo Higashino and many others. Shi's own acclaimed titles, Liangshan Hunter and The Obsidian Mansion Murder, are also among the tomes.Shi's journey of detective literature began in his second year of middle school when The Complete Sherlock Holmes ignited his passion for detective novels. The classic series by Arthur Conan Doyle sparked Shi's fascination with the meticulous observation and logical deduction that are central to solving seemingly insoluble crimes.During his university years, Shi's first short story was published in a detective fiction magazine. Since then, he has kept writing and gradually gained some fame among detective novel lovers.After graduation, Shi's commitment to his craft remained unshakable. Each day after his regular job, he would spend around two hours writing stories.In 2011, his first full-length novel, Criminal Fragment, a compelling campus crime narrative, debuted. With an initial print run of just a few thousand copies, Shi considered himself "very lucky"."By that time, my experience from a detective fiction enthusiast to a detective novelist inspired many authors who tried to write full-length detective novels," he says.Shi attributes his success not only to luck but also perseverance, which has been instrumental in his creation of 15 intricately woven mysteries characterized by suspense and rigorous logic.He emphasizes that his inspiration stems from close observation of life and massive amounts of reading. "Reading fuels my creativity, making it a crucial part of my writing," he says.Following the outbreak of COVID-19, Shi made a bold decision to quit his job and dedicate himself entirely to writing detective fiction and opening a bookshop.Since its establishment in January 2023, Mystery Books has raised public interest in detective fiction. Most customers are fans of detective novels, and others are casual readers.While the best-sellers in his store often feature detective novels by Japanese authors such as Seicho Matsumoto, Rampo Edogawa and Higashino, Shi is particularly passionate about promoting Chinese detective fiction. He has even set aside a corner of his bookshop for domestic writers."Chinese domestic detective novelists are showcasing increasing sophistication and creativity infused with the unique allure of Chinese culture. However, local authors face challenges due to higher critical standards from domestic readers, limited promotional channels, and the lack of attention from publishers, placing them at a disadvantage in the market," he says.To him, the establishment of Mystery Books is more than a personal hobby, but a testament to his commitment to the future development of Chinese crime fiction."I'll keep writing and keep the bookshop open as long as possible to bring more Chinese detective novelists into the spotlight and foster the love for Chinese domestic detective novels among readers," Shi says.XinhuaEvery weekend, Zhao Jian meticulously arranges his phone and adjusts the room lighting before he begins to passionately read from books in front of the camera, and when emotions run deep, he even recites verses of poetry.This is all part of Zhao's routine as an online storyteller living in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu province. He has nearly 1.4 million followers on Douyin, the Chinese version of Tik-Tok, and his videos have received almost 18 million likes."The joy of my work lies in nurturing a love for reading among more people," Zhao says, adding that he sees his role as a bridge connecting listeners with authors through his narratives."It's sort of like doing trailers, to spark people's interest in buying tickets to watch movies," he adds.From Zhao's perspective, a burgeoning cohort of young people is now drawn to books through short videos. "Through artificial intelligence algorithms, books are recommended to targeted listeners who might have an interest, thereby boosting sales of numerous classic books, including many audiobooks."Data from Douyin's e-commerce platform show that in the first quarter of this year, views of book livestreams surpassed 3.9 billion, generating average daily sales of over 2 million books.Listening gets trendyFeng Xiaohui, a manager at the Beijing OpenBook Co, says that new technologies have fostered a change in the way many Chinese read."We can see that the mode of reading is more and more diversified, with the popularity of e-books and audiobooks increasingly on the rise," Feng says."Nowadays, it's about catering to both the visual and auditory needs of the learners," echoes Zhao Chen, director of digital publishing department at the People's Literature Publishing House, saying that audio elements are increasingly included in the publishing of new books, with many featuring QR codes for audiobook enthusiasts.Thanks to the fast pace of urban life and the proliferation of diverse media platforms, the reading habits of many people are transitioning from reading to listening, turning audiobooks into a social trend. Statistics show that the user base for audiobooks in China reached 420 million in 2022."Amid all the work and family pressures, it's not easy to find a dedicated time and place to read. So, audiobooks are a great choice for me to enrich my fragmented leisure time, allowing me some inner peace just through my phone," says Wang Chun, an IT worker in Suzhou, a city in Jiangsu.Due to the companionable nature and adaptability of audio recordings, people can enjoy audiobooks while driving, studying, exercising, or doing household chores, making fragmented time more meaningful.Liu Fang, a visually impaired teacher from Guiyang, capital of Guizhou province, devotes her spare time to making audiobooks on short video platforms, kindling the hearts of numerous readers, including those who are visually impaired."Sharing beautiful stories brings me great happiness. Through producing audiobooks, I meet the needs of more young people while offering reading services to the visually impaired and elderly," Liu says.Traditional libraries are also undergoing digital transformation. The provincial library of Guizhou has established a facility that houses 550,000 titles and more than 100,000 hours of listening resources spanning classics, philosophy, history and children's literature."It is very popular, especially among the elderly. They put on headphones, select their favorite books, and relish listening in quiet, gaining knowledge while immersed in a different reading ambience," says Luo Jing, a librarian at the facility.According to Zhao Chen, audiobooks adapted from online literature are highly story-driven while also captivating to young people. "But when it comes to audiobooks of classics, it is advised that the original work be kept intact to preserve the beauty of the language."AI amplifies engagementWith the advent of 5G and AI, text-to-speech technology has been widely used in audiobook production. AI-generated audible novels are emerging in Chinese audio-based media and reading applications."TTS technology significantly enhances our efficiency in audiobook content production. Current AI-generated content is almost indistinguishable from human voices," says Lu Heng, head of the AI voice laboratory at Ximalaya, China's online audio-sharing platform, which boasted an average monthly active user base of 303 million last year.With the help of AI, the company has expedited the entire audiobook production process more than 50-fold compared to working manually.Book listeners can now not only acquire information and knowledge but also immerse themselves in emotional genres such as suspense, humor, and sadness, augmenting their reading experiences.At a recent exhibition in Italy, Ximalaya unveiled its latest product tailored for children, which enables parents to record their voices for a vast story library, allowing children to listen to their parents narrate stories at any time, with just five one-minute recordings.Lu says that Ximalaya's voice generation model can swiftly replicate voices with 90 percent similarity within five seconds and generate customized audio within 10 seconds.After gaining copyright, some domestic audiobook platforms replicate the voices of celebrities using AI anchors, enriching the expressiveness and appeal of storylines.Douyin's novel reading platform boasts AI voices in over 40 styles, catering to various age groups. These AI voices can eloquently convey profound human emotions and each voice can be seamlessly switched to provide varied storytelling experiences.Chinese content creators are also harnessing AI technology to produce radio dramas that combine human voices, music and sound effects. For instance, the radio-drama adaptation of the Chinese science fiction novel The Three-Body Problem on Ximalaya has accumulated over 750 million clicks."We believe that AI technology catalyzes the industry's growth by enhancing content production efficiency, reducing production costs, and providing users with better listening experiences," Lu says.According to Liu Xiaochun, an associate professor at the University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, AI's technological prowess has injected vitality into the growth of book sales and the popularization of reading among the masses.She says that AI is lowering the barriers to reading and enabling more obscure books to reach interested readers."Technological advancements in livestreaming, short videos, and podcasts can help precisely match users' listening preferences and create personalized experiences," Liu Xiaochun adds.Zhang Qinghua, a professor at Beijing Normal University, has been impressed with the transformative impact of AI on people's reading habits."The prospects of AI in reading are promising, but there are also concerns. Hopefully, AI can embody the human spirit, inspiring more young people to engage with classic literature," he says.A bookstore in Beijing seeks to engage in deeper discussions about women's issues, Wang Qian reports.Cui Qichao says that when he opened the women-themed bookstore La Otra in Beijing, he started to better understand what women have actually gone through — their struggles and challenges — in the workplace and society. La otra is Spanish phrase meaning "the other"."As a feminist man — still a minority in society — I have faced different voices from both males and females, which, I believe, are similar to most women who have tried to defy society's norms," the 32-year-old bookstore owner says.Some people view his business as something like a gimmick, cashing in on feminism amid the trend in China to strive for gender equality. Some radical feminists, who believe that society prioritizes the male experience, express fury over Cui's male identity.At first, crying was his way to deal with his emotions. Ultimately, he decided to keep the store open, although he didn't know what experiences — painful or joyful — it would bring him.Carrying more than 2,000 titles, most of which are by female authors, the bookstore, which is smaller than 40 square meters, has been established as a learning hub and community for people interested in woman studies. You can even find the out-of-print book series by Li Xiaojiang, who is often credited as the founder of women's studies in contemporary China.At the entrance of the bookstore is a poster of a working woman, and the windows feature the inspirational quote, "Women can do anything." A blackboard by the door reads: "Menstruation products, hot water and pain relievers are offered for free at the bookstore."Inside the store, there is a wall presenting a selection of images of remarkable women who have defied gender expectations and made extraordinary contributions.Book shows how reason and logic can help grasp subject, Yang Yang reports.Advances in social media have enabled users to voice their opinions online and comment on a variety of topics, including political issues. However, as most people have limited knowledge of such issues, social media is often inundated with conspiracy theories, which may lead to hostility, hate speech, or worse.Bao Gangsheng, professor at Fudan University's School of International Relations and Public Affairs, says that one of the reasons is that the public lacks a fundamental understanding of politics."In popular culture, people's notions of politics may not only be inconsistent with facts and logic, but are often aimed at playing to their emotions. Learning political science can help people use reason and logic to break free of the political biases created by popular culture," Bao writes in his latest book, Lectures on Politics.Published recently by knowledge-sharing platform Dedao under New Star Press, Lectures on Politics is based on an audio course Bao gave on the platform. Launched in 2019, the 30-episode course has more than a million hits from 40,000 users, making it one of the most popular courses on the platform.Through the 30 lectures, Bao builds a framework of political science that systematically explains the basic logic of political phenomena through 30 keywords including nation, war, monarchy, bureaucracy, republic, parliament, democracy and party from five different perspectives, such as how power manages society, how society controls power, differences and conflicts in politics, and the political issues closely related to them.In the 249-page book, Bao uses concise language to lead readers through the world of politics focusing on interesting questions in each chapter such as: Why did democracy originate among pirates? Why do wars shape a country? How can monarchies last thousands of years? Why do many African countries have democratic regimes, yet have increasingly moved toward decline? And why do many countries not support the construction of a welfare state?By referencing classic political issues in human civilization, Bao tries to take readers back to the historical moment in question to see how political invention emerged in different countries, to examine the logic in making political decisions at critical moments, and to explore the potential solutions for improving politics in the narrow gap that exists between idealism and reality.Li Yun, professor at the China University of Political Science and Law's School of Political Science and Public Administration, comments on the book by saying that "as Professor Bao Gangsheng has said, politics is the art of balance".Cayol says her over 20 years in Beijing have taught her a lot about time. She points out that Chinese people can be "very rapid" in getting things done and ‘very slow" when they want to enjoy life."It's also a symbol of a very huge civilization. Chinese have a very specific relationship with time — much more flexible, much more, I'd say, friendly with time," she says.This prompted her to publish the book, Shijian Lide Zhongguoren, in French and Chinese. The English title translates from Chinese as "Chinese in Time" and from French as, "Why Do the Chinese Have Time".Watch the full episode of Embracing Cultures, please click:A celebration of civilizationsIn honor of World Book and Copyright Day, Beijing Times Chinese Press orchestrated a special event in Beijing on Thursday, featuring acclaimed writer Chang Xiaohu as he presented his novel Shoushan and engaged with readers, sharing insights into his writing journey.Renowned for infusing his works with the regional essence of his native Beijing, award-winning author Chang has consistently captured the authentic essence of life in his novels. "Being an observer for life can heal one's own heart," Chang remarked, emphasizing his commitment to portraying genuine human experiences through his literary creations.Shoushan, which translates to "stop doing something that one's familiar with", delves into the multigenerational saga of cooks at a Beijing restaurant amid the rapid evolution of the times, chronicling their culinary prowess and unwavering spirits. The novel has garnered attention, with plans for its adaptation into a theatrical production at the esteemed Beijing People's Art Theatre in the near future.During the event, Chang shared his creative process in crafting this compelling narrative, highlighting that for him, writing remains an ongoing journey of self-discovery. He expressed that the act of continual growth through writing is the ultimate reward in his literary pursuit.At the Third National Conference on Reading in Kunming, Yunnan province, which took place from April 23 to 25, 53 outstanding bookstores from across the nation, including renowned establishments such as the Wangfujing Bookstore in Beijing and the Fangsuo Bookstore in Shaanxi province's Xi'an, were lauded with the prestigious title of "Most Beautiful Bookstore of the Year".This diverse selection of bookstores encompasses both revitalized traditional Chinese brands and burgeoning private labels, ranging from expansive book malls to smaller chain bookstores, and from campus bookstores to theme bookshops dedicated to regional aesthetics and traditional culture. This broad spectrum reflects the dynamic transformation and evolution of physical bookstores in recent years, showcasing a rich tapestry of offerings to cater to diverse reading preferences.During the unveiling ceremony, Liu Xiaokai, director of the printing and distribution department of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, emphasized the pivotal role of physical bookstores and bookstore practitioners in supporting the vigorous development of national reading. He underscored the indispensable nature of active participation and the need to leverage digital technologies to enhance the connection between physical bookstores and readers, emphasizing the imperative of meeting people's evolving needs.The "Most Beautiful Bookstore of the Year" release event, an integral component of the National Conference on Reading, has been a recurring highlight since 2022, with a total of 149 bookstores having been honored over three consecutive sessions. This ongoing tradition serves as a testament to the commitment to excellence and continual innovation within the realm of physical bookstores, celebrating their pivotal role in fostering a vibrant reading culture across the nation.During the Third National Conference on Reading, the China Audio-video and Digital Publishing Association unveiled the 2023 China Digital Reading Report, revealing a robust expansion in the nation's digital reading landscape.

Southeast Asia, North America, and Europe emerged as key regions with a high volume of Chinese digital works, underscoring the global appeal of Chinese literary content.As a leading figure in the digital reading landscape, Migu Digital Media has played a pivotal role, boasting 180,000 registered authors, over 600,000 digital books, and more than 1 million physical books, while maintaining over 100 million monthly active users. Migu's influence extended globally, with over 1,000 exceptional works introduced to overseas markets in Europe, America, East Asia, and Southeast Asia, underscoring the company's significant international footprint and its role in promoting Chinese literary content on the global stage.Hundreds of thousands of bookworms tuned in to Xinhua's livestream interview with teacher-turned-influencer Dong Yuhui on the eve of this year's World Book and Copyright Day, which fell on Tuesday.Known for his engaging speeches, encyclopedic knowledge and witty ad-libs, Dong shared his personal story and thoughts on reading."Inside books, we can find the most intense feelings, the most profound wisdom, the loftiest moral sentiments and the highest aspirations of human beings," the teacher says during the show.The quote quickly circulated online and featured in media headlines.The 31-year-old influencer, who was born in rural area of Shaanxi province, is popular on China's video-sharing platform Douyin. He is also a senior partner at New Oriental's e-commerce unit, East Buy.As an enthusiastic book-lover since childhood, Dong has always peppered his livestream sessions with anecdotes and quotes from renowned figures in history, ranging from Confucius to Shakespeare, from ancient Chinese poet Du Fu, to the late Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez."I am reading with Dong right now. So thankful that you have inspired me to read print books once again," one netizen from Guangdong province writes in the interview's comment section on Weibo.Two years ago, Dong was an ordinary livestreamer pitching agricultural products to online consumers on East Buy's Douyin channel, which was grappling with a lukewarm market response and stagnating subscriber numbers.During a show in early June 2022, he cited German philosophers Nietzsche and Hegel.Over 10,000 viewers watched that show, catapulting Dong to unexpected stardom. Within two weeks, the tally of subscribers surpassed 10 million, boosted by Dong's shows. According to a report from East Buy, net profits in the 2023 fiscal year reached 971 million yuan ($136.64 million), with 10 billion yuan in gross merchandise volume."Put down the mobile phone and enjoy the fragrance of books. Over the past two years, my biggest takeaway from Dong Yuhui's livestream channel is to fall in love with books and awaken my love of reading," says a viewer from Sichuan province.In January, New Oriental launched a new Douyin channel for Dong, which currently has over 18 million subscribers. Books and magazines are a major category in the new channel's window display. Thanks to Dong's recommendations in several shows, The Last Quarter of the Moon, by novelist Chi Zijian, has sold nearly 3 million copies through the channel.In the interview on Monday, Dong also weighed in on the question of how books can change a person's life."The life that we refer to here cannot be merely defined by results — what kind of job you get, whether it is decent and well-paid or not, or how much profit you get from reading. That is too narrow a definition. In life, we read to enlighten ourselves."XinhuaAs "World Book Day" approaches, the "Chinese Classics Recitals", a large-scale cultural event that was planned and launched by the CNR.CN, officially commenced in Juungar Banner of Ordos city on April 22.During the event, performances of classic Chinese literature, such as "Sanzijing" (Three Character Classic), the poem "Our Juungar", and the famous poem "Zhixiangshu", allowed the audience to experience the timeless charm of classic Chinese works from different eras.The recitation contest aims to encourage society to recite classic Chinese literature and promote nationwide reading, thus carrying forward the essence of Chinese culture.It is understood that this is the second edition of this competition, and that it is open to participants of all ages. The competition categories include newcomers, primary school students, middle school students, university students, and senior citizens. Around 1 million people are set to participate in this event.During the selection process, veteran broadcasters, renowned hosts, and cultural figures will serve as leading guest readers and professional judges.

It also calculated that expat readers at the libraries hailed from 47 countries and regions.Moreover, the report showed that more than 80 percent of the minor readers in Shanghai spent half an hour or more on reading on a daily basis.A big move regarding children's library service in the city was that Shanghai Children's Library launched an online book borrowing service in January during students' winter vacation.The platform provides a home delivery option that makes book borrowing and reading more convenient for children. Next-day delivery for orders placed before 4 pm is guaranteed.In the digital era in which people's attention is often distracted by fragmented, eye-catching information, Tuesday's annual World Book and Copyright Day is probably one of the few moments that remind people of the irreplaceable importance of reading, in what may now be termed the old-fashioned way.The Wenjin Book Awards, which are bestowed by the National Library of China every year for this special occasion, was organized as a key event ahead of the day — and as a guide for readers. The list of winners of the 19th Wenjin Book Awards was released in the national library in Beijing on Friday. Among China's highest honors in the publishing industry, the awards are mainly given in non-literature genres.Twenty titles in three categories — children's books, pop science, and social sciences — stood out from the nearly 2,500 submissions across the country to gain the top awards, and an extra 41 were honored by making it to the final round.From themes that seem to be far removed from today's reality, like astronomy and archaeology, to subjects that are deeply influencing our everyday life like artificial intelligence and silicon chips, the awardees cover a wide range."In the winners' list, we've seen top-tier experts writing approachable books for the general public, focusing on history, architecture, and traditional culture," Wang Yuguang, a Peking University professor and a jury panel member for the social science genre, commented. "But we also find more entries related to livelihoods, education, and the society we live in."For instance, among the eight winning titles in this genre, there is Looking for Liao Ling. Zhao Feng, an archaeology professor at Zhejiang University and a famous researcher of ancient fabrics, traced the history of silk during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) following a reference in a famous stanza by the poet Bai Juyi.Meanwhile, in The Archaeology in Zodiac Animals: Discovering China From Twelve Animals, Yuan Jing, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, chose a fresh angle to reconstruct how these animal totems gained their status through analysis of bones and relics bearing their images.Individual stories are equally powerful at awakening collective memory, as To Approach the Dearest People indicates.When Song Zhixin sorted through her parents' belongings after they both passed away, she accidentally found letters written by her father to her mother during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-53) and some diaries from the battlefield. She compiled them into the book."I want to create a more immersive experience for today's people to approach that war, thanks to my father's vivid descriptions," Song said.In terms of pop science, panel member Wang Yusheng, a researcher with the China Science and Technology Museum, said that the six winners reflected scientists' personal feelings in pursuing academic achievements."When discipline segmentation gets more and more detailed in modern times, sometimes we realize that we've neglected other fields that we should focus on," said Chen Yong, a geophysicist and an academician at Chinese Academy of Sciences. "That's why we often admire naturalists like Charles Darwin. So how about writing a small book that concerns our shared home, the Earth?"That is the origin story of his book Dynamic Earth, which reminds human beings to retain their awe of nature.Six more winners are in the children's book category. Lai Xuemei, a book critic and a judge of the awards, said Chinese children's books have greatly advanced in recent years, breeding many stories with warmth and concerning various topics like local cultures, environment issues, and humanity.For instance, Cen Xiaoxian, a teacher based in Foshan, Guangdong province, praises the lion dance, a signature form of intangible cultural heritage in her hometown, and wrote the children's novel Lion Girls to cheer for young people chasing their dreams.The Wenjin Book Awards are named after Wenjin Ge, a former Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) royal library in present-day Chengde, Hebei province, which contributed key collections to the national library. The awards were launched in 2004."Nowadays, algorithms and AI largely decide what we see," Wang Lei, a professor at the Communication University of China, said. "If we don't deliberately read, we cannot nurture the capacity to independently think and actively absorb knowledge."Reading is a fascinating adventure from one world to another," he said. "Thanks to the Wenjin awards, we're encouraged to set off on that journey."Editor’s Note:As Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO said, "The power of books must be fully harnessed. We must ensure access to them so that all people find refuge in reading and can thus dream, learn and reflect." April 23 marks World Book and Copyright Day. Here are ten widely praised books which received unanimously high scores on Douban, a major review aggregator in China.The Death of a PrincessThe Death of a Princess is a work of legal history. The author elaborates on the classic case of Princess Lanling of the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534), who was beaten by her husband and suffered a miscarriage leading to her death, exploring important and profound legal and marital ethical issues such as domestic violence and the inferior status of women.The People's Literature Publishing House released a new Harry Potter tie-in book on April 13 in the run-up to World Book and Copyright Day, or World Book Day in short, which falls on Tuesday.Revolving around the curriculum of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it features content from the British Library's exhibition Harry Potter: A History of Magic, and includes valuable Harry Potter-themed collections and sections of author JK Rowling's manuscripts.This year marks the 24th anniversary of the release of the first Chinese editions by the People's Literature Publishing House, which introduced the series to the Chinese market and continues to be its domestic publisher.Over the years, the publishing house has produced a variety of Harry Potter publications for Chinese readers, including paperbacks, collector's editions, Chinese-and-English bilingual editions and illustrated editions, as well as various tie-in books.The British Library exhibition was held in 2017 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the publication of the first book in the series. The original English version of the book was published under the same title. By that time, the series had sold 450 million copies, had been translated into 79 languages and had been made into 8 blockbuster films.It serves as a bridge connecting real world items with the spellbound world, and extends the magic for readers who were not able to visit the exhibition.The oldest items in the British Library's collection are Chinese oracle bones dating back to the Shang Dynasty (c. 16th century-11th century BC). One of them was among the displays, and was listed as the oldest exactly datable object in the exhibition."The Harry Potter stories are rooted in centuries of popular tradition. Predicting the future, for instance, has a long history," Julian Harrison, lead curator of the exhibition, writes in the book.Harrison then proceeds to explain in detail how the ancient people used oracle bones to tell the future, possibly by engraving and heating them until they cracked.The reverse side of the bone that was exhibited records a lunar eclipse seen in Anyang, Henan province, on the night of Dec 27, 1192 BC."These artifacts were known historically as 'dragon bones', emphasizing their magical qualities," Harrison writes.The book explores thousands of years of magical history, under the guidance of experts and by following the Hogwarts curriculum, from the Care of Magical Creatures and Herbology to Defense Against the Dark Arts and Astronomy."I could never have imagined I was about to embark on a remarkable journey, that I was but one of a legion of fellow travelers around the world embarking on the same journey, all of us falling under the spell of this unknown author, JK Rowling, a spell that, 20 years on, only grows more powerful," says Steve Kloves, screenwriter and producer on a number of films in the Harry Potter series.Also joining that journey is Wang Ruiqin. She was the first of the series' Chinese editors, and has participated in the copyright purchase of the series in 1999."It touches me because it is about growing-up, and about courage and wit in the process," Wang says at the Chinese version's launch in Beijing."And I suppose People's Literature was chosen because of its long tradition and achievements in publishing translated work," she adds.Zhai Can, who is part of the younger generation of editors overseeing Harry Potter titles, says that she was chosen because Wang believed that the only requirement was that an editor be a genuine fan of the series, or a Potterhead.The Chinese version of the new book is the work of two such Potterheads, Xiang Xun and Dong Yi, who were the winners of a contest held by the publisher to locate fans to help with the translation. Over the past 24 years, the house has held many live events bringing together Harry Potter fans. The two translators were pursuing higher education respectively in Britain and the United States when they were approached in 2018.Like veteran translator of the series Ma Ainong, who says she's been thrilled by Rowling's humor and has burst into laughter at times when working on the translations, the duo say they enjoy translation very much, and were greatly honored by the experience, which they described as a "dream coming true"."We are Harry Potter fans, and though we split the work in two, we communicated without any hurdles," says Dong Yi, who is a geography major."Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." That well-known quote by Arthur Clarke suits the new publication well, the editors say.Zhang Jinshuo, director of the National Zoological Museum under the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Tsinghua University astronomy professor Cai Zheng, also shared their thoughts with readers at the launch."As the book shows, Rowling's magic is based on the real world, and animals make up a great portion of her imagination," Zhang says. "The traits of certain animals in Harry Potter's world take us by wonder, which is exactly a reflection of our understanding of the real animals."Xinhua and China DailyAt the beginning of 2020, Chen Jianxing experienced an unforgettable month with a hedgehog. When COVID-19 was spreading in Africa, he could not buy a plane ticket home and was stuck in a scarcely visited Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, where he formerly worked, and didn't know where to go.It was the rainy season, and seeking shelter in his tent he found a hedgehog, the nest of which he later found out had been flooded by heavy rain. He made a new nest and fed the animal, and the two quickly became friends.Feeling confused and depressed over the spread of the pandemic, it was a tough time for Chen, whose only company was the hedgehog. Chen felt he was experiencing a similar situation to the film Life of Pi, building a special bond with an animal during a hard time.This is just one of many captivating stories that the man who has spent 15 years observing wild animals in Africa can recount. Many of them appear in his recently published book We Are in Africa, which tells of his encounters with wild animals in Africa and his thoughts about the experiences.Chinese philosophy is often misunderstood in the West because of inaccurate translations that fail to do justice to the cultural context of Chinese philosophical classics, Canadian-born Sinologist and philosopher Roger T. Ames said at the launch of his new book — "A Sourcebook in Classical Confusion Philosophy" — in Beijing on Friday.As Chinese philosophical terms lack exact equivalents in English, previous translators typically applied Western concepts and frameworks when translating Chinese classics, said Ames, a humanities chair professor at Peking University and vice-chairman of the International Confucian Association.For instance, terms like "tian" (天) and "li" (礼) have been translated as "heaven" and "ritual", which carry religious connotations, leading to misconceptions about Chinese philosophy in the West, Ames said.Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding Chinese philosophy on its own terms rather than through the lens of Western philosophy.As a curated compilation of representative texts from nine pre-Qin (before 221 BC) Confucian philosophical works, including the "I Ching", "Great Learning", "Analects", "Mencius", "Doctrine of the Mean", "Classic of Filial Piety", "Five Elements", "Mozi", and "Xunzi", the book presents the original texts alongside English translations in a bilingual format and offers comments on the core concepts and thoughts of each section.Ames said the book aims to correct the misinterpretations about Chinese philosophy in the Western world, restoring the true essence of Chinese philosophical thought, which holds significant importance for the translation of Chinese classics and cross-cultural communication."Chinese philosophy is an integral part of world philosophy," he said, "I want to encourage the world to better understand and appreciate Chinese traditional culture."The book launch, jointly organized by the Beijing Foreign Studies University and the Commercial Press, brought together dozens of scholars from both China and abroad.Beijing Times Chinese Press has recently unveiled a new collection of writer Shen Congwen's works, titled Shen Congwen's Xiangxi World, featuring exquisite photographs captured by photographer Zhuo Ya over the past three decades.Xiangxi refers to the western region of Central China's Hunan province, a mountainous area that served as Shen's birthplace. As one of the most influential modern Chinese writers, Shen's literary contributions encompass Xiangxi-based prose and stories, vividly depicting local conditions and customs.Zhuo's inspiration to visually capture the Xiangxi region emerged in 1981 when she was captivated by Shen's literary works. This led her to embark on a photographic journey spanning over 30 years, aiming to encapsulate the essence of the Xiangxi that Shen vividly portrayed in his books.Carefully curating the most classic and representative excerpts from Shen's writings, Zhuo sought to showcase his elegant writing style and the distinctive allure of the Xiangxi area. She selected approximately 400 pieces from her extensive collection of Xiangxi photographs, integrating them with the chosen texts to create a harmonious blend of images and words, each one complementing and interpreting the other.Zhuo expressed her desire to present the original landscape of Xiangxi, a place that cannot be replicated, to contemporary and future generations. In doing so, she envisions her photos serving as a testament to Shen's literary legacy, preserving the essence of his literary works through the lens of her photography.The China Written Works Copyright Society released its list of the top 10 most popular writers of 2023 along with its annual report on Monday, drawing the attention of publishing industry professionals.The 2023 top 10 most popular writers are Chen Bochui, Yan Wenjing, Jin Jin, Zhu Guangqian, Sun Youjun, Song Yirui, Bing Bo, Guan Hua, Yu Dazhen and Jia Lanpo.

Throughout the year, a total of 22.8 million yuan ($3.15 million) in royalties were collected for copyright holders of written works. Among them, collective management services such as information network dissemination rights, compilation rights, and theatrical performance rights accounted for 72% of the total revenue.The association has consistently strived to apply copyright laws and regulations professionally, safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of its members, and actively allocated royalties to rights holders. In 2023, a total of 9.71 million yuan in royalties were distributed to its members and other copyright holders through 57 distributions.Zhang Hongbo, the executive vice president and secretary-general of the China Written Works Copyright Society, said that the event aims to showcase the significant role of copyright collective management organizations in safeguarding the legitimate rights of authors, encouraging literary creation, promoting the dissemination of works, strengthening copyright protection, and facilitating cultural exchanges between Chinese and foreign civilizations.Recently published under the pen name Heitao, the nonfiction work My Experience Driving a Taxi in Shanghai presents a compelling narrative of various taxi stories from the perspective of an everyday individual, drawing from the author's personal encounters while driving a taxi in Shanghai.The book not only delves into the daily lives and working conditions of taxi drivers but also paints a vivid picture of the urban landscape and historical tapestries of Shanghai. Written in a rich and engaging style, the stories are laced with humor and conciseness, offering a captivating portrayal of the city.This nonfiction work has been likened to the taxi version of Midnight Diner, brimming with human warmth and originality, capable of both captivating and comforting the reader's heart.Heitao, who has explored various occupations, including magazine editing, running a small shop, temporary government work, and taxi driving, described his driving experience filled with surprises — everything seems fascinating, and everyone appears amiable. Despite encountering occasional challenges, he embraces life's imperfections, believing that life's allure lies in navigating the balance between certainty and uncertainty.An archive with a collection of more than 40,000 antique books has been inaugurated in Beijing.The archive is affiliated with People's Education Press -- a renowned publishing house in China. Its collection mainly consists of manuscripts and woodblock-printing books in the traditional thread-bound form, according to a press release from the publishing house earlier this week.The collection includes ancient classics, history books, literature books as well as some rare editions of school textbooks published in the late 19th century and early 20th century.Antique books are important carriers of the Chinese cultural tradition, said Wang Richun, chief editor of the publishing house.The archive will try its best to digitalize its collection and re-print books with academic significance, Wang said.Recently, a symposium was held in Beijing to honor the novel Cao Mu Zhi (Chronicles of Plants) by Teng Zhenfu, jointly hosted by the Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House, the Writers Publishing House, and the bimonthly literature magazine Furong. The event drew more than 20 writers and literary critics.Originally serialized in Furong magazine in 2023, the novel was officially released as a book in February 2024 by Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House and Writers Publishing House. Cao Mu Zhi centers on the transformation of Xuli village, which originated as a Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) postal station. The narrative follows the journey of the protagonist, a village-stationed cadre, and the village head, Shao Zhentian, as they guide the villagers in adapting to local conditions, developing industries, and steering the village towards prosperity and well-being under the Party's rural revitalization strategy.Wu Yiqin, vice-president of the Chinese Writers Association, commended the novel for its skillful intertwining of historical and contemporary narratives, vividly portraying the revitalization of Xuli village.Yan Hui, deputy editor-in-chief of Writers Publishing House, emphasized the author's profound observation and deep affection for nature, resulting in a remarkably detailed depiction of plants and a realistic portrayal of Northeastern folk customs and rural life.Chen Xinwen, president of Hunan Literature and Art Publishing House, lauded the vivid portrayal of the characters, particularly the protagonist and Shao Zhentian, setting new standards for rural-themed literature. The lively and vivid language, especially in dialogues, enhances the work's literary quality, making it a high-quality masterpiece brimming with life and a strong sense of the times.Zhang Li, a professor from the School of Chinese Language and Literature at Beijing Normal University, highlighted the novel's deep immersion in the unique ambiance of Northeast China, not only capturing the region's flora but also offering a vivid portrayal of contemporary people. The incorporation of local slang and plant-character parallels introduces novelty and estrangement to the story, enhancing its appeal and accessibility to rural readers.On April 8, a seminar in Beijing marked the launch and discussion of writer Du Yanglin's latest novel, Transforming. The narrative follows the journey of Ling Yunqing, a determined young man born in rural Sichuan province, as he navigates the challenges of urban life, encapsulating the dreams and aspirations of a generation shaped by the tide of reform and opening up.Rui Hong, editor-in-chief of Zhejiang Publishing United Group, praised the novel and said: "This contemporary literary work offers sincere and practical insights into issues such as rural revitalization, integrated urban-rural development, and common prosperity in the new era."Du, the author, expressed his intentions, saying, "I aim to depict the pursuit of dreams by rural migrants in cities, their struggles, as well as their sense of displacement and alienation within urban environments."Transforming serves as a sequel to Du's earlier book, Awakening, published in 2021, which portrays Ling Yunqing's challenging childhood, struggles as a teenager, and his journey to leave the village in pursuit of broader horizons.Yang Qingxiang, a literature professor at Renmin University of China, emphasized that the protagonist's experiences reflect the interplay between China's reform history in the 1990s and the spiritual world of a generation that lived through that period.Andre Agassi, Maria Sharapova, Jim Courier and a number of other top tennis players all share one thing in common — Gabe Jaramillo, a Colombian American coach with more than 40 years of experience.China's National Tennis Center's Diamond Court in Beijing, which has witnessed many glorious moments provided by stars of the sport, recently hosted the launch of the Chinese version of Jaramillo's book, How to Make Champions, which was published by the CITIC Press Group, on March 24.Jaramillo has coached 11 world champions and 27 Top 10 tennis players. His talent is manifested not only in their achievements, but also in his deep understanding of their psychology and techniques, as well as in his training methods.In his speech, Jaramillo asked, "What makes a champion a champion?" His answer was that a true champion has a relentless spirit, as well as the integrity and courage to face challenges head-on.He also speaks about the importance of balancing technical training with mental preparation. Remaining calm under pressure and finding growth opportunities in failure are essential qualities for every tennis enthusiast.In 2003, Jaramillo was invited by the Japan Tennis Association to select one 12-year-old tennis player to take back to the United States for training. His choice was Kei Nishikori, the least favored of the three candidates presented. According to Jaramillo, Nishikori brought one attribute to court that was the hallmark of a champion. While other players played conservatively under pressure, resorting to safe shots and high returns, Jaramillo says that Nishikori demonstrated bravery and resilience, and showed no fear despite the intensity of the competition, a quality that he viewed as the mark of a true athlete with potential.After arriving in the US, Nishikori wrote "No 1 in the world" on his bathroom mirror. When Jaramillo asked the boy why, Nishikori responded that he'd done so to remind himself every morning while he brushed his teeth that he had made a "big sacrifice" to live alone away from home and family, and that he should do everything to reach his goal that day. "This is how a champion thinks," Jaramillo says.The essence of sports is not just about winning, but about relentless effort and the accumulation of experience, he says, adding that becoming a champion is a continuous process of accumulation and growth, not only about reaching a peak moment."Talent lays the groundwork for success, but appropriate training and timing are even more crucial. Even the most gifted person needs to work hard to awaken that talent," Jaramillo says.Two friendly matches were held as part of the book launch, a first-to-4-points game between four children of age 12 and under, and a first-to-7-points game between two adults.As Jaramillo outlines in his book, understanding and practicing the various conditions needed to achieve goals lies at the core of all sports training, from the microanalysis of movements to the macro strategy of the game.In the post-match discussion, a young player highlighted his focus on refining the details of his swing, such as the angle of the racket and follow-through after hitting the ball. "By repeating and making slight adjustments, I found myself able to apply these techniques more naturally in matches," the boy said. Jaramillo agreed, adding: "Just as building a tower requires careful planning and step-by-step execution, shaping a champion requires strategy and patience. Every training session, every match, is a step toward the ultimate goal."The young tennis enthusiasts at the event came away enriched by the experience. During the final autograph session, they asked Jaramillo to sign their books, backpacks, tennis rackets, and even their dads' phone cases, buzzing with excitement.Yang Jiru, 10 years old, said that she had been exposed to sports like swimming, tennis, soccer, boxing and figure skating since she was 5 and had chosen to focus on tennis. She said that Jaramillo's words were inspiring, and encouraged her to believe in herself, dream big and play with a burning desire to win.Yang Shangxi, 12, who started playing tennis two years ago, said that techniques like drop shots first sparked his interest in the sport, but that initially he was unable to keep up physically, and had often returned home crying in frustration. Luckily, he pushed through the hard times by listening to stories his mother told him about world-famous players.Jaramillo offered a final piece of advice to the hopefuls attending the event. "Make sure to find the one sport that you truly love, and give your utmost effort to it".In honor of World Book Day on April 23, the 3rd National Conference on Reading is scheduled to convene from April 23 to 25 in Kunming, in Southwest China's Yunnan province.Under the theme "Building a Book-Loving Society, Embracing Modern Civilization", the conference aims to assess national reading policies since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012. It also seeks to exchange insights on advancing reading initiatives, as well as to inspire public involvement in reading, fostering a culture that values quality literature to propel modern civilization within society.The event will encompass discussions exploring the interplay between reading and various societal dimensions, including urban development and ecological civilization. Additionally, it will feature engaging activities such as a book corridor and a public book fair, designed to promote the joys of reading.The unveiling of Jiang Ru Lian (literally meaning a river as silk) in Beijing marks a significant milestone in the portrayal of ecological civilization along the Lijiang River. Authored by Ren Linju, the book provides a comprehensive and panoramic depiction of the region's ecological development from historical and cultural perspectives.Ren embarked on an exhaustive journey, starting from the river's source at the Mao'er Mountain and conducting field investigations in over 30 villages and islands along the river. Through in-depth interviews with more than 60 individuals, the book captures the essence of ecological progress in the region, covering aspects such as wildlife protection, forest fire prevention, industrial pollution management, domestic sewage treatment, reservoir protection, and the delicate balance between ecological preservation and economic advancement.Beyond being a historical account of ecological construction along the Lijiang River, the book serves as a spiritual biography of its builders. It delves into the social fabric of the area over the past decade, offering a profound exploration of the emotions and experiences of individuals, presenting a compelling ecological narrative of harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature.Li Jingze, vice-president of the Chinese Writers Association, lauded the book as a triumph in nonfiction and documentary writing, emphasizing its role as a representation of the era and social development.He highlighted the necessity for writers to approach such works with a comprehensive vision, an open mind, a broad knowledge base, and a corresponding writing strategy, noting that Jiang Ru Lian exemplifies an important stride in the development of documentary literature.After several decades of development, Chinese cultural industries, such as online literature and video games, have created products that enrich global culture with creativity, imagination and local elements, appealing to both domestic consumers and those from overseas.China's video game industry, after three decades of development, has evolved into a competitive player in the international market, especially in the section of mobile games, driven by the internet and technological advancements.According to CNG, a research institute on the gaming industry, between 2019 and 2023, the global gaming market grew from $146.2 billion to $184 billion, with a four-year compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 5.92 percent.Notably, the mobile gaming sector had seen significant growth, increasing from $68.7 billion in 2019 to $90.4 billion in 2023, with a four-year CAGR of 7.1 percent.In comparison, overseas revenue from games independently developed in China had risen from $11.6 billion in 2019 to $16.4 billion in 2023, achieving a four-year CAGR of 9.04 percent.This growth is primarily attributed to the advantages of Chinese companies in mobile game development and operations.With the widespread adoption of smartphones and the development of mobile internet technologies, mobile games have become a major part of the global gaming market.Leveraging their leading technology and extensive experience in this area, Chinese gaming companies have successfully launched a series of popular game products in both domestic and overseas markets.For instance, due to the great success of Genshin Impact, Shanghai-based game developer miHoYo jumped into the list of top 100 enterprises of 2020 in the city.In 2023, Genshin Impact became the most lucrative Chinese game in overseas markets. By the end of last year, it had garnered about $5 billion, and players from overseas contributed more than 60 percent of the total, according to data from analytics company Sensor Tower and App Magic.Since its launch in 2020, Genshin Impact has won the best mobile game award in 2021 and the player's voice award in 2022 at the annual The Game Awards — often dubbed as the "Oscars" of the global gaming industry, while being nominated for the best ongoing award four times.Overseas revenueAt the end of 2023, at the TGA annual gala, Black Myth: Wukong, a new game from China, captured the world's attention. Developed by Hangzhou-based Game Science, it was slated for release in August. On social media platforms, many people talked about their surprise at the release date, as the trailers looked "so fake" with "gorgeous visuals, incredible character design, nice music", and they "can't wait".Black Myth symbolized a significant leap forward for China's gaming sector, heralding a new era where advanced technology, innovative gameplay and cultural creativity intersect to redefine gaming experiences and enrich the global game culture, despite the fact that overseas revenues of Chinese game developers have dropped in two consecutive years.In 2023, although the global market was showing signs of recovery, increasing by 6 percent year-on-year, and the global mobile gaming market grew by nearly 2 percent from the previous year, games developed independently in China garnered nearly $16.4 billion, down 5.65 percent year-on-year. The dropping percentage was even larger than that in 2022.Statistics from CNG show that in January, the revenue continued to reduce by 3.24 percent compared with December.One of the reasons for the decline, according to Zhejiang Century Huatong Group, the largest shareholder of Shanda Games, one of the leading game companies in China, is that as other countries and regions pay more attention to the development of the game industry, while increasing support for local industry, they have also tightened regulations on imported products, including entry requirements, privacy protection, and payment compliance.Besides, as the number of players in mature markets approaches saturation, the cost of acquiring users continues to increase, leading the market to concentrate on high-quality products.Despite the continuous reduction, overseas markets are key to many Chinese game developers, as domestic regulations started tightening in 2018. For example, in 2022, a regulation was introduced, largely limiting the time for children to play video games.According to Sensor Tower, 27 Chinese mobile games developers saw their revenue from the overseas market exceed $100 million in 2023. The top 30 Chinese game developers still maintained stable profitability in overseas markets, with total overseas revenue reaching $10.9 billion in 2023, holding steady compared with 2022 and accounting for nearly 18 percent of the total revenue of mobile games in the overseas market.According to the latest financial report, Tencent's international gaming revenue in Q4 last year hit 13.9 billion yuan ($1.93 billion), totaling 53.2 billion yuan for the year and accounting for 30 percent of its gaming income.Key contributors included Pubg Mobile, which saw a 27 percent month-on-month overseas revenue increase in December, according to Sensor Tower. Additionally, Honor of Kings has expanded to 57 countries and regions, ranking top 10 in several markets.Beijing Ultrapower Software, another leading Chinese game company, gained nearly 6 billion yuan in revenue last year, up more than 24 percent. With games such as Age of Z Origins and War and Order, its overseas revenues accounted for about 90 percent of the total of game section.Chinese renowned scholar and author of Juliu He (The Great Flowing River) Chi Pang-yuan died, aged 100, on Thursday in Taoyuan, Taiwan.Reviewing Chi's life, Taiwan writer Pai Hsien-yung said, "She has a righteous spirit. She is a song of righteousness."Born in today's Tieling of Northeast China's Liaoning province on Feb 19, 1924, Chi spent her early years amid the smoke of war, living a displaced life. She experienced the turmoil of the 1920s and survived Japanese bombings during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45). In 1947, graduating from Wuhan University, she went to Taiwan to take up a teaching position with a return ticket, but ended up spending the rest of her life there.In 1968, Chi went to study at Indiana University in the United States. The next year, she became the head of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature at Chung Hsing University in Taiwan. She retired in 1988 as a professor in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature at Taiwan University.A promoter of literature, she edited, translated and published a variety of literary critiques, introducing a vast array of Western literature to Taiwan, and translating representative literary works into English. She also contributed significantly to cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.For readers across the Strait, Chi was most famous for her memoir, Juliu He, that she started writing when she turned 80 and took four years to compile. The book, published in Taiwan in 2009 and in the Chinese mainland in 2010, has also been translated into English and Japanese.Named after the Liaohe River in Liaoning province, which was called the Juliu River during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), this epic narrative spans a century, chronicling the tumultuous times from the Juliu River in the Chinese mainland to Yakou of Taiwan.This book follows two main plotlines. One traces the experiences of a father, Qi Shiying, displaying the resilience and dignity of a generation of Chinese people facing invasion. The other unveils Chi's personal experience, depicting the author's birth and childhood, her wartime evacuation to Chongqing, her education at Nankai Middle School and Wuhan University, and later her pursuit of an academic career in Taiwan.Written in a gentle and restrained style, the book is not just a personal memory, but a historical testimony of 20th-century China, a memoir written to "commemorate a nation with backbone", as she said at a book launch ceremony in 2010.David Der-wei Wang, a literary historian, critic, and the Edward C Henderson Professor of Chinese Literature at Harvard University, described in a comment that the book is "so sorrowful, so joyful, so unique", emitting a "pure" sound, "a clear and emotional voice forged from a thousand years of tears, transcending history". Juliu He, in the end, is the record of a person of letters bearing witness to history, he writes.By 2016, the book had sold 260,000 copies. In the days following Chi's passing, as one of the most searched titles on online shopping platforms including JD and Dangdang, it has become a best-seller once more.Memories of home, the smell of the sea lingering in the town he was born and raised in Zanzibar, and the sea horizon as seen from there, remain with Abdulrazak Gurnah, the 2021 Nobel literature laureate.Having moved to the United Kingdom from Tanzania at 18, he has preserved a sense of nostalgia and keeps refreshing impressions of home as part of his inspiration, while infusing his observations as an outsider in British society and reflections on his displacement into his books.From March 5 to 12, the 76-year-old writer visited Shanghai, as well as Ningbo in East China's Zhejiang province, and Beijing, and shared his life and career experiences with Chinese readers and writers in a variety of activities. It was Gurnah's first trip to China.Notably, as the last public event of this trip, Gurnah was a guest on a nighttime livestream show on short video platform Douyin on March 12, where he interacted with English teacher-turned-influencer Dong Yuhui and netizens.At its peak, there were more than 550,000 viewers watching the show at the same time.After around 90 minutes, nearly 100,000 copies of Gurnah's novels were sold, generating revenue of more than 4 million yuan ($550,000). That figure grew to 110,000 copies later that night.The Tanzanian-born British novelist was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature for his "uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents", according to the Swedish Academy that gives the award.Among the 10 novels Gurnah has written, Paradise, published in 1994, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize that year.Apart from writing, Gurnah was also a professor of English and post-colonial literatures at the University of Kent, until his retirement in 2017, and is now emeritus professor at its School of English.Standing in front of a canvas in an art gallery in the heart of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, 50-year-old artist Dawit Muluneh is fully absorbed in the painting of ancient Chinese characters.Surrounding him are pieces he has painted based on the I Ching, or the Book of Changes, a classic that has existed for more than 2,000 years and which remains a source of Chinese culture."I Ching means truth and is founded on the eight gifts of nature, namely heaven, earth, thunder, wind, water, fire, mountain, and lake. In general, the I Ching explains the wisdom of nature," Muluneh told Xinhua at the Medemer Africa Art and Sculpture Space.His collection of 64 paintings represent the 64 divinatory symbols in the book. They portray the day-today interaction between man and nature, and impart knowledge and feeling to visitors through descriptions in Chinese, English, and Amharic.Although Muluneh does not speak Chinese, he became interested in the book a few years ago after his friend Gossa Oda, who owns the gallery, introduced him to The Complete I Ching, which explains the ancient Chinese classic in English."The paintings express delight, hindrance, relief, encountering, courage, childhood, and union," says Muluneh, who was inspired first and foremost by the characters qian and xian, which respectively translate as "humbleness" and "mutual influence".Over the course of the year it took him to paint, Muluneh turned to the internet to research these characters and drew surprising similarities between ancient Ethiopian and Chinese civilizations, in terms of painting styles, landscapes, and people's attitudes toward nature."Both Ethiopia and China have a long history of working with clay and bamboo, traditional medicines, and musical instruments," he says, stressing that cultivating ancient knowledge will help both countries prosper in the right way.In explaining the book, the artist says it not only speaks about the present and future potential but also gives instructions on what to do and what not to do to achieve good fortune and avoid misfortune, and that its guidance is based on the observation of natural laws by ancient philosophers.Mentioning that Ethiopia and China have greatly contributed to current world civilization, Muluneh says the I Ching helps cultivate well-disciplined citizens and promotes a good way of life.Launched in May 2023, the Medemer Africa Art and Sculpture Space is frequently visited by schoolchildren, artists, and members of the Chinese community in Addis Ababa."Visitors to our gallery space will be introduced to the basic concepts of the I Ching, and its complicated concepts are translated into both English and Amharic," says Oda.He says that Muluneh's paintings are unique for their beauty, variation, and composition, and share aesthetic sensibilities and cultural correlations between Ethiopia and China.The ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius and his disciples are believed to have written an interpretation of the I Ching several hundred years after it first appeared and according to researchers, it would be difficult to understand the ancient classic without the philosopher's annotations and comments."After viewing the I Ching paintings, visitors will be able to learn about Chinese civilization and delve deeper into the book. By reading Confucius' commentaries, they will understand China's cultural and aesthetic influence, such as the virtues of duty and piety, on world civilization," Oda says. "The I Ching can help visitors understand their future potential as well as their present circumstances, and each painting can be interpreted differently. Each is associated with a divinatory symbol, which indicates future potential or tendency."During a seminar in Beijing, experts emphasized that the emergence of new quality productive forces will play a crucial role in driving further socio-economic development in China.The seminar, which also marked the launch of a new book titled New Quality Productive Forces, was organized by the school of economics at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, the Political Economics Research Center Featured with Chinese Characteristics, and China Social Sciences Press. Attendees included experts from various top-level universities and institutes.New quality productive forces refer to advanced productivity freed from traditional economic growth patterns and paths of productive development, under the guidance of innovation. The concept sparked heated discussions during this year's two sessions.Written by Gai Kaicheng and Han Wenlong, both economics professors at SWUFE in Chengdu, Sichuan province, the book provides a comprehensive study of the concept of new quality productive forces, including its significance, history, detailed connotations and application.Li Xuesong, director of the Institute of Quantitative and Technological Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, says China has great potential to develop new quality productive forces.He hopes the country will formulate a series of policies centered around deepening reforms, expanding opening up, and striving for innovation to unleash the enormous potential and transform it into driving force for development.Celebrations are commemorating the 100th birth anniversary of well-known wuxia author Jin Yong, Zhang Kun reports in Shanghai.This year marks the centennial of the birth of Jin Yong, one of the most popular authors in China, who raised wuxia, a martial arts fiction genre, to such an artistic level that readers and academics launched a petition in the 2010s for him to become a Nobel Prize candidate.Sometimes referred to as the "Chinese J.R.R. Tolkien", Jin Yong is the pen name of Louis Cha Leung-yung (1924-2018), PhD. His acclaim hails from 15 wuxia novels and short stories he wrote from 1955 to 1972 that have sold millions of copies worldwide."Whichever corner of the world you are in, you will find Jin Yong's books as long as there are Chinese people around," says Zhang Donghe, head of the publicity department of Jiaxing city, Zhejiang province.At the public forum commemorating his centennial birthday that took place in Jiaxing on March 11, scholars and readers recalled signing, or declining to sign, the petition asking the Swedish Academy to consider Jin Yong for the Nobel Prize in literature.Chen Mo, a researcher of Jin Yong's novels, says he declined to sign it, because it's unfair to view the Nobel Prize as the ultimate recognition of a writer's achievements, and Jin Yong has made such a great impact that his name would remain indelible in China's literary history for centuries to come.Jin Yong was born in 1924 to an esteemed family in Haining, a county-level city under the administration of Jiaxing. The Cha family produced many scholars, high-ranking officials and talented creatives across centuries. Jin Yong spent his childhood and teenage years in Haining, Jiaxing, Quzhou and other parts of Zhejiang before moving to Hong Kong, where he spent most of his life and built his career as a journalist, novelist, publisher and political commentator.After more than two decades of development, Chinese online literature has not only become one of the pillar resources of the pop culture market in China, but it is also an important way for people from different cultures to learn about each other, and communicate in the comment sections.According to a recent report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the overseas market value of Chinese online literature has surpassed 4 billion yuan ($554.59 million). By the end of 2023, about 410,000 overseas writers created around 620,000 original works on the international platforms of Chinese online literature, which attracted 230 million readers from more than 200 countries and regions. Readers from the United States made up the biggest proportion.For years, Chinese online literary works were translated by fans and published on websites like Wuxiaworld, but these translations progressed too slowly, so some eager readers had to use translation tools. In 2017, to provide a solution to the translation of literature, Funstory.ai was founded. To date, the company has helped to translate more than 7,000 online novels with artificial intelligence.At the end of 2019, Webnovel, the international platform of the China Literature Group, one of the leading online literature providers in the country, started posting online novels translated by AI and launched a function that allows readers to revise translations, which can help to upgrade AI.With AI, Chinese online literary works and their adaptations can enter the international market more quickly and at a lower cost.As quoted in the report, Tong Ye, chief executive officer of Funstory.ai, says that AI can make translation 3,600 times more efficient, and cut down cost by 99 percent.At the China Literature Group, translation speed has dramatically increased from more than 10 chapters per day to hundreds of chapters per day, and costs have dropped by 90 percent. AI can translate online novels into languages including English, Spanish, Indonesian, Portuguese, German, French, Japanese and Chinese.Since 2023, Webnovel has been advancing its translation mode — cooperation between humans and the machine. In this mode, the translations of Suming Zhihuan (Circle of Inevitability), which was first released in Chinese in March 2023, have become the second-most-read work from China. The English translation of Spanish online novel The Duke's Masked Wife has also become popular."Currently, the translation quality of online literature is not even, especially when target languages are minority languages," says Wu Yiqin, a member of the National Committee of the 14th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and vice-president of China Writers Association. "Due to a lack of minority language data, AI can't translate very accurately and the quality can't be guaranteed."At this year's two sessions, he submitted a proposal about ways to further promote the healthy development of Chinese online literature industry in the global markets.The solution he proposed is to promote cooperation between academic institutions and companies in the research and development of AI translation technology, with political and financial support from the government.Meanwhile, it is also important to accelerate resource integration and the building of a unified standard to enhance the multilingual capacity of AI to guarantee language style, cultural connotations and localization to improve the general quality, he says.Apart from translations, adaptations of Chinese online novels are also attracting more people overseas.For example, the second season of Joy of Life, adapted from an online novel and one of the most eagerly anticipated TV dramas on Tencent Video this year, will be distributed exclusively by Disney in overseas markets.A video game adapted from the popular online novel Battle Through the Heavens saw quarter-on-quarter user growth of 118 percent in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand in the fourth quarter last year.The lucrative potential of Chinese online literary intellectual property leads to copyright infringement problems overseas.As a result, another big challenge for the international development of the Chinese online literature industry involves the protection of intellectual property.Currently, copyright infringement issues are frequent in overseas markets, causing significant losses to creators and Chinese online content providers overseas, Wu writes in the proposal."Cross-border copyright transactions are difficult to prove, and it's challenging to monitor infringing content. Some foreign publishers are private and not under government control, making it very difficult to protect rights," he says.In addition, some countries have not yet reached a consensus on intellectual property protection, and there are no agreements for mutual recognition and enforcement in judicial jurisdictions, resulting in significant costs and pressure for Chinese companies to protect their rights overseas.Wu suggests that regulatory authorities and industry associations should fully utilize their guiding and coordinating roles to improve cross-border copyright protection mechanisms.Regulatory authorities can promote exchange and cooperation in the cultural industry with other countries through official channels, sign bilateral or multilateral copyright protection agreements, and strengthen international copyright protection for the Chinese online literature industry, he says."Industry associations can also establish a unified information sharing platform to collect and analyze international copyright infringement cases, alert member units to pay attention to prevention, and provide professional copyright protection services when necessary," he says.Acclaimed writer Ma Shitu died, aged 109, on Thursday in Chengdu, Sichuan province.Ma, whose real name is Ma Qianmu, started writing at 18, and published 29 titles. His personal corpora was published in 2018, spanning 18 volumes.He was widely known for his novel Ye Tan Shi Ji (Ten Amazing Stories), which was adapted into the 2010 movie Let the Bullets Fly, directed by Jiang Wen. The movie became an instant hit when it was released, and is still among the highest-ranked films on video-sharing platform Bilibili, where it has been given an average score of 9.9 out of 10 by 140,000 viewers."Ma's time has come. It's actually good when one can live up to almost 110 years old," Jiang said in an interview with Chengdu-based Red Star news on Thursday. "But I still feel reluctant to say goodbye to such a great man who masters both the gun and the pen well."Born in Zhongxian, Sichuan, in 1915, Ma's work impressed many with its strong Sichuan flavor, highlighting the local dialect, styles and folk culture, as well as his record of, and reflection on, the country's revolutionary history and heritage.Besides being a writer, Ma was known as a revolutionary. He had been a member of the Communist Party of China for 86 years, after joining the Party in 1938.Ten Amazing Stories, of which one of the 10 chapters was rendered on celluloid by Jiang, is based on Ma's years as an underground soldier. The process of writing and publishing the book itself testifies to the hardships the writer endured.Ma started writing in 1942, and finally got the book published in 1983. Because his draft had been damaged three times over the course of 40 years, he had to rewrite it four times.Tie Ning, chairperson of China Writers Association, remarked in 2020: "I'm moved by Ma's fearless and optimistic nature, which provides the perfect combination of the firmness of a revolutionary and the vigor of a literary creator."A Lai, also a well-known writer from Sichuan, known for Red Poppies and The Song of King Gesar, told The Paper on Thursday that he has been a fan of Ma's works since the age of 18."His novels deliver Chinese style and aesthetics, and carry on the tradition of ancient writings in recounting folk tales," A Lai said.Another aspect of Ma that impressed A Lai was the energy and diligence he had for his work, mainly in writing and reading, even after he turned 100."He finished and published two books after reaching 100, showing a strong spirit to strive for better," A Lai said.One of his publishers, Huang Lixin with Sichuan People's Publishing House, recalled that Ma was enthusiastic when discussing drafts with editors, and "would hold a magnifier to examine them word for word".The optimism and energy of his hometown marked his writings, too."Sichuan flavor to me ... is the combination of atmosphere, the language, the temperament and the humor of its people, and the customs and landscape of the province," he once wrote in an article.Ma was an accomplished calligrapher, an art form he started practicing at the age of 6. In 2014, he donated 2.3 million yuan ($318,000) from the auction of his calligraphic works to establish a scholarship program at Sichuan University to encourage writing among young people.Ma once shared the secret to his longevity, concluding that it came down to five things: being able to eat well, to sleep soundly, to walk far, to write, and to bear challenges."I don't know why, but I managed 106, and I'm still walking, talking and writing, and publishing a new novel," he said in 2020.A leader in modern China’s architectural design, Ma Guoxin, 82, has created a body of work ranging from monumental buildings like the Chairman Mao Zedong Memorial Hall to imposing sports venues like the National Olympic Sports Center, as well as large-scale transport hubs like Terminal 2 of the Beijing Capital International Airport. All of these projects have played a significant role in national life over the last few decades.Ma Guoxin: My Design Career — Books on Architectural Culture, a recently opened exhibition at the Tianjin University Library, chronicles Ma’s illustrious career in architectural design and shines a spotlight on his achievements as an author and editor of books promoting architecture.Born in Jinan in 1942, Ma studied architecture at Tsinghua University. Upon his graduation in 1965, he joined the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design (BIAD), located on the Nanlishi Road in Beijing’s Xicheng district, where he began building his fruitful career that spanned more than half of a century. In 1997, he was named as an academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), the highest academic title officially recognized by the Chinese government in engineering and technological sciences.The exhibition’s first clue is guided by Memories of Nanlishi Road: My Design Career, a memoir by Ma published in September 2023, according to Jin Weixin, curator of the show and a researcher with the committee on 20th-century architectural heritage affiliated with the Chinese Cultural Relics Society.Following this clue, visitors can learn through pictures, texts, manuscripts and objects about the iconic aspects of Ma’s design career, including his foray into architectural design, his three-year study under Japanese architect and Pritzker Prize winner Kenzo Tange in the 1980s, his recollection of designing his representative works, and his involvement in designing sports venues in Beijing for the city to host the 11th Asian Games in 1990 and two Olympic Games in 2008 and 2022.The Communication University of China hosted an event to launch A Global Community of Shared Future Research Yearbook 2021 in Beijing on Friday.Compiled by the university's Institute for a Community with Shared Future and published by the Central Compilation and Translation Press, the yearbook compiles the latest research highlights on the global community with a shared future concept, presenting analyses from diverse disciplines on the concept's origins, theoretical implications and means of communication.According to Zhang Yanqiu, a vice-dean of the institute and the yearbook's editor-in-chief, the book is based on academic research published in China in 2021, and reviews research findings in disciplines including economics, Marxist theory, management, education and history.Its content comprises the four sections of literature review, introductions to selected books and doctoral dissertations, projects funded by the Ministry of Education and The National Social Science Fund of China, as well as academic events."This yearbook's publication marks our institute's attempt to comprehensively summarize the understandings of the Chinese academia in the context, significance and connotations of the concept," Zhang says."It not only reviews the theoretical interpretations by Chinese scholars from various disciplines on the challenges and ways to building a global community with a shared future, but also highlights the recognition and expectations of the Chinese academic community regarding this concept."Dean of the institute, Li Huailiang, commended efforts made by the editing team and expressed his gratitude toward the publishing house, stressing the concept's significance in the contemporary era.As the institute is about to initiate the next round of editing and compilation work, experts from the university and the publishing house gave their advice on standardizing the theoretical expressions, structures and formats.At the end of the event, Li expressed his hope in collaborating with more professional organizations in the future: "We look forward to making continuous efforts to promote and deepen the understanding of the concept of a global community with a shared future worldwide."A partnership was formed on Wednesday between Huangshan Tourism Development Co Ltd in Anhui province and the China Literature Group, a leading force in online literature. This partnership introduces an innovative "IP + tourism" model, targeting the development of Huangshan's tourism-related intellectual property across diverse platforms, including digital content, merchandise, and gaming enhancements.Huangshan, renowned for its UNESCO-listed Huangshan Mountain, aims through this initiative to blend cultural richness with tourism, enhancing the city's appeal and economic vitality. The project will see the creation of the Huangshan Yuewen Academy and the organization of IP-centric festivals and exhibitions, further merging culture with tourism.This strategic move signals a growing trend in utilizing IP to drive regional growth and attractiveness. Leveraging China Literature Group's IP development expertise and Huangshan's cultural and natural heritage, the aim is to produce unique literary IPs accessible in various formats, from text to animation.This collaboration seeks to amplify Huangshan's cultural and tourism appeal, making it a top global tourist spot. It envisions integrating IPs into all aspects of the tourist experience, crafting immersive, culturally enriched, and interactive tourism models.The new book Mongolian Horse In North Wind, which captures the beauty of Mongolian horses and its grasslands, was launched on Monday in Beijing.Born and raised on the grasslands in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Wang Zhengping, the author of the book, integrated horses and grasslands into his life and developed strong spiritual connections with them.Since 2009, Wang started to photograph Mongolian horses and capture the beauty of grasslands through his lens. "The Mongolian horses in my lens are not just horses; they are my family, friends and even a reflection of myself," he said.Through ten different perspectives, his latest work, Mongolian Horse In North Wind, showcases decade-long perseverance and highlights his deep affection for horses, respect for the grasslands and attachment to the homeland.Women can better fight disease if they know more about their bodies'Cure sometimes. Treat often. Comfort always." This renowned quote in the medical field has been embraced as a standard for practice by countless healthcare professionals worldwide for decades.However, Tan Xianjie, a Chinese doctor with more than 30 years of experience, has added a new phrase: "Educate forever".The gynecologist at the prestigious Peking Union Medical College Hospital usually sees patients and performs surgical procedures during the day. However, in his free time, he dedicates himself to sharing with the public scientific knowledge related to women's health conditions. He explains medical processes in books, offers advice on social media and tells doctor-patient stories on TV programs.Words related to women's health such as "menstruation", "uterus" and "vagina" are frequently spoken by him, which may occasionally cause slight embarrassment in public, but Tan remains unfazed. The gray-haired doctor says that he aspires to provide more women with knowledge about their health and assist them in disease prevention."A doctor, regardless of his or her level of expertise, can only attend to a limited number of patients and perform a limited number of operations. But a popular-science book, an engaging lecture or an informative video can spread health-related information to a much wider audience," Tan says.He first resolved to become a doctor because of his mother. Born into a big rural family in Southwest China's Chongqing municipality, he suffered the tragic loss of his mother when he was 12 years old. He was attending a county boarding school, and visits back home were infrequent.LONDON — As the publishing industry embarks on a new era driven by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, Chinese publishers, alongside their international counterparts, delved into the potential of innovative tools to revolutionize their practices at this year's London Book Fair, held from March 12-14.In a panel talk held in China's exhibition area, professionals discussed the pragmatic application, potential, and inherent constraints of AI technology, which has drawn much attention at the LBF.Publishers worldwide have been using AI-supported tools for editing, market analysis and online book recommendations for years. However, the recent surge in AI development has prompted the industry to contemplate the issue."This marks a shift in the publishing market toward more efficient, personalized and insightful processes and standards," Professor Shen Yang from Tsinghua University's School of Journalism and Communication said during the panel.Despite his absence at the event, Shen delivered his speech through AI-generated videos, saying that collaborative creation between humans and AI could facilitate automatic text-to-multimedia conversion, thereby opening new revenue streams for the industry.Paolo Lombardi, director of technology innovation at the Taylor &Francis Group, a British publisher, says his company has been exploring AI integration with professional translation to improve efficiency. He hopes the collaboration between the company and its Chinese partners would enhance the accessibility of Chinese content for English-speaking readers."One of the most exciting things about AI today is it allows us to bridge across countries and improve communication," he adds.Looking ahead, Lombardi emphasizes the "pivotal role" of human authors in content production, highlighting the "ethical responsibility of how to use this technology".Besides AI taking center stage, the book fair also saw other trending technologies integrate with traditional publishing. Especially noteworthy were explorations by Chinese publishers.One standout example was an immersive reading experience, The Classic of Mountains and Seas: An Illustrated Guide to Chinese Mythical Creatures, where scanning illustrations in the book with a smartphone revealed 3D representations of 40 creatures from ancient Chinese mythology.Wang Xubin, president of the Zhejiang Ancient Books Publishing House, says that advanced printing technology can enhance printing quality and offer readers a clearer view of visual materials such as traditional art.Having seen some experimentation by Chinese professionals, Lombardi expresses his excitement at their "exceptional minds" and dedication to understanding and trying new technologies.At the three-day event, around 50 Chinese publishers displayed more than 3,200 China-themed titles and engaged in some 30 activities focused on international collaboration.Peng Donglin, deputy editor-in-chief of the Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press, says that his agency has been discussing with major international partners, including Oxford University Press and HarperCollins Publishers, the issue of digital content licensing as part of its digitalization strategy.Digital content cooperation can not only fuel business growth but also make it easier to bring Chinese publications to the global market, Peng says."We're delighted to see an increase (in participation) this year from China," says Gareth Rapley, director of the book fair. "Hopefully, this year is a building block to seeing further expansion of the Chinese participation here at LBF."This year's LBF attracted more than 30,000 attendees, professionals, and 1,000 exhibitors from across the world.Jiang Shumei learned her first Chinese character at the age of 60. Now, the 87-year-old grandmother from Northeast China's Heilongjiang province is the proud author of six books."I wasn't educated as a child. I never imagined, even in my wildest dreams, that I would publish a book one day," says the resident of Suihua city. Her books detail the chaos of wartime and the hardship during the famine, and vividly recount anecdotes over the decades.Born in 1937, Jiang left her home in Shandong province at a young age and migrated to Northeast China, where she spent most of her life scraping a living in a brick factory.She learned her first character in 1996, after her husband died in a devastating car accident, when her daughter Zhang Ailing suggested that she learn to read to take her mind off the loneliness and sorrow.Zhang says that unlike other beginners, her mother drew every single character like a picture.The elderly woman had her own way of learning. She composed lyrics for songs, and asked children to write them down, so that she could read each character as she sang the songs again and again. Whenever she came across characters she didn't know on pamphlets, bus stops, or shop signs, she found someone to ask.Once Jiang had learned enough characters, Zhang started giving her books to read. Enjoying the books, Jiang told her daughter that she wanted to write down her own stories to share."It sounds unbelievable, and my brother used to laugh at my daydreams," the grandmother says.She first put pen to paper in 2012, at the age of 75.It was not easy. Sometimes, completing a single sentence could take a day. As a college teacher and a writer herself, Zhang gave her mother a lot of encouragement and help. She told her that while writing, she should imagine herself telling stories to an audience, so that they would be easier to understand and be full of interesting details.Zhang was also her first editor. Every time her mother finished writing something, she would discuss the manuscript with her and check it over before typing it on the computer."Mom's writing is always concise and straight to the point, so I only needed to correct the grammar and any improper words to preserve its originality," Zhang says.Her daughter's support became strong motivation. Jiang usually started writing at 3 or 4 am, and revised the pieces several times until she was satisfied. She also traveled back to her hometown in Shandong to interview other senior citizens.Zhang began publishing her mother's stories on social media platforms in 2013. When they drew the attention of her writer friends, the pair made the bold decision to publish them.The first book, Time of Trouble, Time of Poverty, was published later that year, and proved to be a success. Some critics even hailed it as the "lived history of a nation plagued by war, death and hunger".The book earned Jiang a lot of fans and sympathy. "Don't feel sorry for me," the writer says to her fans. "The hardships mentioned in the book are now in the past. Without all of it, I could never have finished this book."So far, the elderly woman has published six books, totaling more than 600,000 characters in length. In her spare time, she is also learning painting and calligraphy. "I would like to be a writer, a painter and a calligrapher," she says, adding that her dream now is to have her own art exhibition when she is 90.Jiang did the illustrations for a book written by her daughter which was published last June. In the book, My Mom Is Eight and a Half, Zhang writes: "I taught my mom to write, while she taught me the wisdom of life.""It is never too late. The knack is not to be lazy," Jiang says.She lives a healthy life, exercising every day, drinking milk and soy milk, as well as having regular massages. "If I could live as long as 130, would you still say that it is too late for me to start after 60?" she asks, jokingly.This week, the 2024 edition of the London Book Fair, one of the world's largest publishing trade fairs, has attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors from across the world to participate. Around 50 Chinese publishing houses are represented at the fair, showcasing more than 3,200 China-themed books to international publishers. With a total floor space of 454 square meters, China's presence was unified under the slogan "Reading China."Video by Han JingReporter Zheng WanyinThe London Book Fair, one of the world's largest, kicked off on Tuesday with industry insiders calling for greater collaboration between Chinese and international publishers.Speaking to Xinhua after the launch of the "China Perspective" Series, managing director for book publishing at Taylor & Francis Jeremy North said that people need books not only written by Western scholars but also those coming directly from China."Our partnerships with our Chinese publishing partners are a wonderful example of how, whatever else is going on in the world, you can work together and do really creative things," North said. "There's a large benefit because good publishing, good scholarship and good information help a lot of people."This year, around 50 Chinese publishers are showcasing more than 3,200 types of China-themed books at the event. These cover a wide range of areas including politics, culture, academic works, and trending topics such as low-carbon and artificial intelligence (AI). One third of these titles are foreign language editions.Wang Xubin, president of Zhejiang Ancient Books Publishing House, told Xinhua that collaborations between publishers from different countries are crucial. During the event, the company launched a new book entitled "Masterpieces from Dunhuang in the British Museum's Collection."Wang said that international publishing cooperation not only facilitates academic research, but also improves cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world.Scheduled to run until Thursday, this year's book fair is expected to attract over 30,000 publishing professionals and 1,000 companies from around the globe.After about one hour and a half on Tuesday night, the 2021 Nobel literature laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah sold around 100,000 copies of his novels at a Chinese livestream show on the short video platform Douyin, generating a profit of over 4 million yuan ($570,000). The number grew to 110,000 copies later that night.During his talk with English teacher-turned livestreamer Dong Yuhui, the Tanzanian-born British author, 76, shared with Chinese netizens his hometown life and immigrant experience, his writing as an outsider and teaching as a literature professor, as well as how he's been continuously absorbing nourishment for creating from nostalgia, pain and silence.Dong managed to connect Gurnah's life and writing with the numerous Chinese readers living and working far from home — Dong being one of them — who find it difficult to fit in the new environment, mostly in big cities, but also difficult to go back home and stay.The show was the last public event of Gurnah's first China trip that began on March 5, during which he visited Shanghai, Ningbo of Zhejiang province, and Beijing, giving lectures and holding dialogues with Chinese writers including Ge Fei, Sun Ganlu and Nobel laureate Mo Yan.Language is naturally acquired when children are able to use it pleasurably, and language acquisition by children themselves saves both time and labor, said English-language education expert Chen Yaping.Based on observation and study, the professor at the School of English and International Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University and director of its Child Language Research Centre, said Chinese children commonly lack access to authentic English dialogues for learning and using the language.She suggested that children make use of dialogues that meet actual daily needs and read graded materials or picture books that match their cognitive level and interest and which are of practical use.Chen said that reading is a shortcut to learning English in a foreign language environment, as quality reading materials introduce children to authentic dialogue they can replicate in real-life conversations."Children read because they love to read, not because they are told that reading is important for learning English. We should allow them to give up reading a book halfway through and pick up another that they are more interested in," Chen said.She added that relieving anxiety, making children feel safe, and allowing them to experience a sense of accomplishment is vital to learning English.Chen was speaking in Beijing on Wednesday at the launch ceremony of Fantastic English, a series of language learning products codeveloped by iHuman Inc, a Chinese online childhood edutainment provider, and the Oxford University Press.This series for children aged between 6 and 12 includes graded readers, hands-on workbooks, and online lectures, among other materials.The graded reading materials were written by Paul Shipton, an award-winning British children's author, and include 100 of his stories and cover a range of subjects, such as culture, history, nature, and technology."One of the best ways to learn English is to read and listen to lots of English, and these carefully graded readers give plenty of opportunity to do that, greatly benefiting language comprehension and English vocabulary," Shipton said in a video speech.He added that the informational stories will expand readers' knowledge, develop their imaginations, and promote positive values.Golden Childhood, an illustrated book about a Shanghai folk art form, will be published by UK-based Balestier Press. With 21 paintings by Chen Huifang, a folk artist from the city's Jinshan district, the book vividly portrays idyllic scenes of rural life in China.A Shanghai folk tradition that originated in the embroidery and stove paintings of South China, the paintings of the rural residents of Jinshan district are known for their artistic exaggeration and intense color contrasts, which capture the essence of the customs and landscapes of the southern Yangtze River Delta regions.Born in Shanghai in 1970, Chen learned to paint from her father, Chen Fulin, who pioneered Jinshan folk painting.During her 30-year career as a professional artist, Chen Huifang has produced more than 400 paintings, many of which have received awards at national art exhibitions and have been featured in the Chinese media. Her acclaimed piece, Jiangnan Village received the highest award at the Chinese Farmer Painting Excellent Works Exhibition."I'd expect to be invited to publish this book by a foreign publisher. When I showed my works in the United Kingdom, Austria and Estonia before at solo exhibitions and cultural exchange events, my folk paintings already attracted many viewers," she says.It was a casual meeting with author Shen Yang that led to the idea for the book.During the Lunar New Year celebrations in 2021, Shen visited Chen Huifang's studio in Jinshan for the first time. Captivated by the scenes depicted in the paintings, she decided to collaborate with Chen Huifang to convey personal stories through illustrations.On Wednesday, one of the country's top livestream influencers Dong Yuhui, invited two writers and the editor-in-chief of Harvest magazine to his Douyin program, Time With Yuhui.The enthusiasm that writers Yu Hua and Su Tong brought to the livestream was so heated and continuous that Dong extended the one-hour program to 150 minutes.By the end of the session, the literary bimonthly had sold 63,000 annual issues, along with 12,000 issues of its quarterly subsidiary dedicated to novels. The sum of magazines sold exceeded 12.4 million yuan ($1.7 million).The phenomenal nighttime talk show led many to ask the same question: How many people still read, particularly print magazines and books?Harvest was founded in 1957, and has been boosting contemporary Chinese literature since the 1980s. Yu, who is known for his novel To Live, said the magazine is like the Dow Jones index of the country's literary scene.Harvest's editor-in-chief Cheng Yongxin said throughout the hard times facing all printed publications, the magazine has never run any advertisements, because in the words of one of its founders, Ba Jin, "readers come to us for literature, not for ads"."What brought us to this livestream is that things have changed, and we're being challenged," Cheng said. "But I fully believe in the power of literature, and of good writing."Dong remembers that the attention he received as buyers rushed to his livestreaming room can partly be attributed to his past readings of literature. "Literature brings us closer," Dong added.Roughly a month ago, he also had a hit sitting with Shi Zhanjun, editor-in-chief of People's Literature magazine, and writer Liang Xiaosheng. That livestream attracted 8.95 million visits and reaped more than 100 million "Likes".The magazine sold 992,000 issues that night.The success led media critics to see a light in the future of serious writing."Nowadays, it's important that literary creations, instilled in every issue of literary magazines, are not only confined to 'a celebration of the selected enclosure'. They need to step out, and greet mass consumers in the way they like and accept. Dong is their preferred choice and a deserving host," Guangming Daily website wrote.At the London Book Fair, which runs from March 12-14 this year, Lu Min will introduce her novel The Golden River, according to Wang Yuqiang, who works with the book's Chinese-language publisher Yilin Press.Wang said the March 13 event will feature the writer, along with her two translators, Nicky Harman and Jack Hargreaves, as well as British publishers and book critics."We are hoping to find a suitable English publisher through the event," Wang said.Born in 1973 in Jiangsu province, Lu is deemed one of the representatives of Chinese writers born in the 1970s. She has won prizes like the Lu Xun Literature Award, and had her work translated. The Golden River is a realistic story that chronicles an entrepreneur's family stories over the course of 40 years as China undergoes the dramatic social and economic progress that has shaped it since the 1980s.Lu said she prepared decades for the novel, spent seven years researching it, and two more years writing it. Her goal was to "record the legacies of Chinese entrepreneurs".Harman is a leading translator of Chinese literature into English.

With compassion and clarity, Nedra Tawwab offers a much-needed guide to understanding our upbringing — and becoming an agent for change in our own lives," says Lori Gottlieb, a psychotherapist and writer, while commenting on the book.Tawwab shot to fame as the bestselling author of Set Boundaries, Find Peace: A Guide to Reclaiming Yourself. Her book was also translated into Chinese and has a rating of 8.4 points out of 10 on China's popular review site, Douban.A bilingual comic book by Zheng Xinyao was released in Shanghai this month.Zheng is a veteran artist who has had his comics column on the Shanghai-based tabloid Xinmin Evening News for the past 30 years.The new bilingual edition Comic Sense - Snacks for Thought, in both Chinese and English, is a palm book - no more than 10 centimeters long and 8 centimeters wide. Zheng selected 863 comic drawings from his 1,600 published works, hoping readers would enjoy the book "the way they flipped through the pages of picture books in childhood", according to the artist.The book comes with voice clippings recorded by the artist himself, in mandarin and the Shanghai dialect. In the voice recordings, Zheng shares five stories about his life-long passion for comics.According to the publisher, Shanghai Lexicological Publishing House, another new book by Zheng will be published later this year, featuring his drawings of urban architecture in Shanghai and the changing landscapes of the city.Fifteen years ago, on a visit to her parents' home in Texas, Margaret Kincannon found a hat box in which they kept old photographs, including a great many from the military service of her father, James Mills, who used to be a B-25 bomber crew chief."He was then approaching 90 years old, and I realized that time was running short for me to learn more about his wartime experiences," she said."I asked if I could take the photos home with me because I hoped to find clues about the people and places pictured in them."Two months later, her parents' house was flooded after a hurricane struck the United States' Gulf Coast."The photographs would have been destroyed if I had not taken them to my home farther inland,"Kincannon said, adding that she considered it a sign that she should continue her efforts to learn more.Following a note — "Sgt J H Mills, 3 Bomb Sq., 1 Bomb Gr., CACW 14 Air Force 627" — written by her father on the back of one of several small, colored photographs of tourist attractions near Chongqing in southwestern China, Kincannon began searching the internet for information.CACW was the abbreviation for the Chinese-American Composite Wing — popularly known as the Flying Tigers — the only organization in World War II made up of both US and Chinese personnel who worked side-by-side, both on the ground and in the air.When her father returned home in 1945 after his service in the squadron, Kincannon was only 18 months old. "I knew that he was a 'Flying Tiger' since childhood, although I never really understood what that meant until I began my research," she said.In recent years, Chinese-language IPs have seen their influence increasing around the world.

Not far from his birthplace, the meandering Minjiang River runs into the East China Sea. In the course of his 67 years, Yan Fu (1854-1921), or Yen Fuh as he called himself, both witnessed and contributed to the dawn of modernization in his home country, as well as the change in its people's minds from "China as the world" to "China in the world".Yan had a solid educational background in both classical Chinese and modern Western thinking, and from the many books he read, chose and translated a variety of Western authors, including Thomas Henry Huxley, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Montesquieu and Herbert Spencer.He is also believed to have been the first scholar to have systematically introduced classical German philosophy — that of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, to be specific — to Chinese youth.In his monograph, In Search of Wealth and Power: Yen Fu and the West, historian Benjamin Schwartz of the United States describes Yan's effort as one to "find the true secret of Western wealth and power", and in the introduction, US political scientist Louis Hartz presents Yan as "a new foreign observer of Western thought as a whole".Yan lived at a time when the feudal Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) was being shaken by Western powers, and intellectuals were struggling to seek a way out and ensure the country could survive, maintain its independence and prosper.He also emphasized the need to improve the physical strength, moral standards and education levels of individuals, and was once in charge of then avant-garde universities including today's Peking University and Shanghai's Fudan University.Apparently, Yan's endeavors meant something, as he prioritized the science, technology, social and political theories of the West as key references for rescuing his then impoverished and weak homeland.Max Ko-wu Huang, a historian from Taiwan, believes that Yan's introduction to Western thought comprised four interconnected parts — scientific concepts based on logical reasoning, political ideology based on liberal democracy, capitalist economic theory, as well as social doctrine centered on the theory of evolution.However, Yan was also aware of the destructive side of Western civilization and was cautious about the trend toward wholesale Westernization prevailing in the country at the time. To the contrary, the great thinker raised his voice in support of the quintessence of traditional Chinese culture, and insisted that China's survival would ultimately depend on its millennia-long civilization.In October 1921, when he realized he was dying, he said in his will to his family: "You should know, China will not perish. Its existing traditions will be reformed, but should not be dropped completely."In retrospect, Yan's words and deeds had their limitations, but it's still fair to say that he was ahead of his time.Historically, influential figures with different political views and from different parties, like Liang Qichao, Cai Yuanpei, Hu Shi and Mao Zedong, all spoke highly of him and his contributions.During his period of leadership in the city of Fuzhou and later at the provincial level in Fujian, President Xi Jinping placed great importance on the study and promotion of Yan's thinking.In December 1997, Xi commended Yan for his "rigorous scholarship, pioneering reform, pursuit of truth, patriotism and efforts to revitalize the nation". In November 2001, he praised his patriotic sentiments and enlightened thinking, stating that, "to this day, Yan's idea of science and patriotism remains relevant". In 2021, he paid a visit to the thinker's former residence in Sanfang Qixiang, or the Three Lanes and Seven Alleys area of Fuzhou, to mark the 100th anniversary of Yan's death.In 1920, Yan wrote a poem to celebrate his grandson's birth. The last sentence goes, "when our country has got peace and prosperity, don't forget to come to my grave and tell me".The year 221 BC was very important. This was the year when Qinshihuang established a centralized, unified, multiethnic dynasty and became the first emperor in Chinese history.He abolished the earlier hereditary vassal enfeoffment system and set up prefectures and counties across the country, which exerted a profound influence on the political systems of China over the following 2,000 years, says Xia Chuntao, director of the Institute of Modern History at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Ancient China's governance systems developed rapidly afterward, building up centuries of experience. Some scholars have paid particular attention to this field in their work.The results of their studies have been published in Research on Chinese Governance System in Past Dynasties, a book highlighted by CASS as an important research achievement in the interpretation of modern Chinese civilization, at a news conference in Beijing on Jan 18.According to Xia, who is also the chief author of the book, this compilation is the result of a major four-year academic program which started in 2019. Altogether, 12 scholars took part to complete the work of 1.06 million words."This book elaborates on the practice of ancient China's political governance systems. We not only wanted to show how ancient people thought and designed systems, but also how they implemented them, what the results were, and how they made adjustments," says Xia.Moreover, the book aims to help people get some historical experience in this field and provide reference for efforts to modernize the system and capacity for governance today, says Guo Jianhong, deputy director at the scientific research bureau of the CASS.The book has 11 chapters, discussing issues such as "administration and supervision", "central and local governance", "people-oriented governance and people's livelihood", "thought and culture", "rule of rite and rule of law", "border governance" and "religious governance".According to Xia, the book covers governance systems from the Qin (221-206 BC) to Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, which is unusual in previous studies.Based on their studies, the contributing scholars point out the main characteristics of ancient China's governance systems: with centralization as the main system, the ancient Chinese advocated the unity and solidarity of the country, regarded Confucianism as the guiding ideology and stressed adaptation to the times and making innovations to improve the system."We believe that in ancient China, given numerous challenges, such as the vast territory, diverse ethnic groups, and the need to formulate governance theories, it was crucial for the central government to have power and authority," says Xia."Without authority, the central government would not be able to effectively integrate resources. On the contrary, the central government could leverage the advantages of a unified system and collective efforts to accomplish major tasks, effectively promoting socioeconomic development," he adds.According to Xia, the governance practice of ancient China faced particular difficulties. "For example, throughout history, China's population has comprised a large proportion of the global population, about 20 to 30 percent on average. It was very difficult to support so many people with limited cultivated fields."But China has a civilizational history of more than 5,000 years, which means Chinese people have over 5,000 years of governance experience. According to Xia, such abundant governance experience is unparalleled.He also mentions one particular achievement of China's governance practice over such a long span of time. "In ancient China, although there were instances of social unrest due to misgovernance, there were also periods of good governance and social stability. Despite these downs, the general trend has been upward, with the country achieving continuous development and progress," says Xia."With our governance theories and designs, the Chinese people have made numerous inventions in this field, which have contributed to the glories of Chinese civilization and made outstanding contributions to the development of world civilization," he adds.A documentary literary work Zhe Li Feng (literally meaning a wind in Zhejiang province), in which writer Zhang Guoyun records Zhejiang's exploration on the path to collective prosperity, was launched at the 36th Beijing Book Fair.Published by Tianjin-based Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House, part of the book has been run on Chinese Writers journal. Commenting on the book, Ban Feng, president of Tianjin Publishing and Media Group, said: "It has been the dream of Chinese people for hundreds of years to realize collective prosperity … and is even more the key of socialist reform, construction and opening up. Through the development stories in Zhejiang, Zhe Li Feng tries to answer the questions that what kind of collective prosperity China is pursuing and how to realize it."Having witnessed and experienced the reform and development process of the Yangtze River Delta region, Zhang has published several documentary works about the economic development of Zhejiang province.The Green Book of China's Tourism was launched in Beijing on Jan 31.The book was a joint effort among the National Academy of Economic Strategy, the Tourism Research Centre of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and the Social Sciences Academic Press.It features analysis and forecast of the country's tourism development during 2023-24 and focuses on the theme of transformation and innovation in the tourism industry and covers two general reports and 22 specialized reports.China's economic fundamentals have been rebounding, significantly unleashing the potential for the recovery of tourism industry, according to the book.It points out that in the practice of integrating high-quality development of the tourism industry into China's modernization, the key lies in ensuring support for related resources, talent and institutional mechanism.In addition to the general report, the book consists of three thematic sections, inviting experts from different fields to conduct comprehensive analyses from various perspectives.The Frontier Exploration section focuses on the current trends, dynamics of transformation, and innovative trends in China's tourism industry. This section provides both assessments of cutting-edge trends and reflections on local cases.The Cultural and Tourism Integration section highlights the new practices, methods, and experiences of integrating culture and tourism. It specifically addresses topics such as national cultural parks, the integration of intangible cultural heritage and tourism development, cultural and creative development and educational travel.The Technology Empowerment section focuses on the profound impact of new technologies, represented by digital technology, on the tourism industry from various dimensions. It covers topics such as immersive tourism, technology-driven tourism enterprises, applications of virtual reality technology, and the influence of the digital economy on sports tourism and urban tourism public service systems.The green book also provide readers with detailed data and systematic analysis of domestic, inbound and outbound tourism to understand the development of relevant markets.A book series containing rare documents related to Chinese folklore held in collections outside the country was finally introduced to the public after seven years of work by experts.Chinese Folklore Documents Overseas was launched at the National Library of China in Beijing on Jan 20.The series was compiled by the Institute of Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage at Sun Yat-sen University and published by Shaanxi Normal University General Publishing House.The first 18 books primarily focus on presenting original material, explains Wang Xiaobing, chief editor of the series."The processing of the materials can be divided into three main categories: the first involved the direct reprinting of folk artifacts and documents found outside China," Wang says.Examples include images of tilling and weaving, paintings, contractual documents and shadow-puppet play scripts.Researchers have added introductions, explanations and annotations to these documents, Wang says.The second category consists of translations of records and studies of daily life in China made by Western visitors to the country between the 17th and 20th centuries.This includes Western visitors' abstracts and summaries of the content of Chinese literary documents, ranging from travel accounts, fairy tales and folk songs, to information about ethics and folk customs.The third category consists of specialized studies of overseas collections of folk materials. They include many precious images, documents and texts that demonstrate the deep cultural heritage and appeal of Chinese folklore."These documents reflect the daily lives of people during specific historical periods and in specific regions of China, as well as the interests and academic ideas of Western collectors," Wang says, adding that this category serves as a vivid testimony to the cross-border dissemination of modern Chinese culture, and the collision and exchange of Chinese and Western cultures.The Life and Times of Hu Wenzhong at Beijing Foreign Studies University  (Beiwai Suiyue: Hu Wenzhong de Waiyu Rensheng)《北外岁月—胡文仲的外语人生》，李尧 著，新世界出版社，2023年4月第一版，359pp., 58RMB, ISBN 978-7-5104-7695-2 Reviewed by Li Jianjun, Beijing Foreign Studies University"Professor Hu's own English was always beautiful. He was gracious, warm, wise, diplomatic, good-humored and supportive—a true role model and an inspiration to his students." — Nicholas Jose, author and emeritus professor, University of Adelaide. "His [Hu Wenzhong] vast knowledge, his world experience, his wisdom, his generosity and his being genuinely respectful to others have earned him enormous respect." — Jing Han, professor and director of Institute for Australian and Chinese Arts & Culture, Western Sydney University. For some years now, Professor Hu Wenzhong has declined all the celebrations of his work anniversaries, birthdays, and symposiums proposed in his honor. Naturally the publication of his biography The Life and Times of Hu Wenzhong at Beijing Foreign Studies University (Beiwai Suiyue: Hu Wenzhong de Waiyu Rensheng), published by the New World Press in April 2023, was both a surprise and a delight to the people who know him well. It is a long-awaited book, written by Li Yao, a writer and renowned literary translator, and a close friend of Professor Hu for over three decades. There is hardly anyone else who is more qualified to be Professor Hu’s biographer than Li Yao. The biography was primarily based on Prof. Hu's diaries, which he has kept since high school. Letters and interviews of his friends, former colleagues, and students also form an important part. But the book is not simply a chronicle of Prof. Hu's life. Rather it centers on his achievements in foreign language education, Australian studies, and intercultural communication studies.As the Year of the Dragon approaches, a series of picture books targeted at children and titled Gugong Xunlong Qiyuji (Adventures with Dragons in the Palace Museum), has recently been published by a Beijing-based publishing company Xiron.In ancient Chinese legend and tradition, the dragon is a mythical creature and symbol of auspiciousness, and is an important cultural symbol.Li Zhiguan, the author of the series, has drawn nearly 300 illustrations recounting the adventures of a boy named A Gu and his cat Little Black in the Palace Museum, which was home to most of the emperors during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. China's emperors frequently made use of the dragon as an embodiment of their divine mandate.During the launch ceremony at the 36th Beijing Book Fair, Gou Chao from the Beijing History, Geography and Folk Custom Society recounted the legends about the dragon's nine representative sons, which are illustrated in the books through the introduction of cultural relics from the Palace Museum.For example, four 3-meter-long gilt bronze dragons stand on the eaves of the Pavilion of Rain Flower. They look as if they are about to launch themselves into the air but have been caught mid-jump, and are known as the "running dragons". Legend has it that during the reign of Emperor Qianlong (1736-96), the temperature reached 40 C one summer day. The dragons were so thirsty that during the night, they flew down to the bronze vat in Changchun Palace to drink water. To allow the dragons to sleep better, Emperor Qianlong ordered that a stone be put in Changchun Palace to serve as a pillow for them.Other legends featured in the book include those about the Nine-dragon Wall, the 1,142 heads of Chiwen, one of the nine representative sons of the dragon, which can be found all around the Palace Museum in the form of decorative rainspouts, and the six giant pillars in the Hall of Supreme Harmony on which six dragons are curled.The Beijing Book Fair, held from Jan 11 to 13, reported a record high of over 100,000 visits as China's book market continues to thrive.According to the annual report on the book market issued under the guidance of the Publishers Association of China and the Book and Periodicals Distribution Association of China, retail sales of books totaled 91.2 billion yuan (about $12.8 billion) in 2023, up 4.72 percent year-on-year.Regarded as a trendsetter in the publishing industry, the fair featured 400,000 books from 720 exhibitors, drawing publishers, authors, and readers nationwide to the literary feast.Cultural charmIn the almost 400 activities held during the book fair, numerous events spotlighting traditional culture and historical themes captivated readers.Among them was the unveiling of a six-volume book series on Chinese culture, illuminating the cultural system through comprehensive coverage of literature, painting, calligraphy, music, drama, architecture, and aesthetics."Traditional Chinese culture is increasingly attracting the interest of young readers," says Nie Zhenning of the Guangdong Education Publishing House, publisher of the series. Nie expresses the hope that through its publication, more youthful vigor will be infused into traditional culture.With a focus on introducing traditional culture to the youth, the Beijing Xiron Culture Group selected over 100 books tailored to young readers.The line of traditional cultural products will be expanded to kindle even more interest from the younger generation, according to the company's Wei Ling.Publications for kidsA diverse range of children's publications has revitalized the book market and become a feature of the book fair.The annual report on the 2023 book retail market shows that China's book market has resumed growth, and that children's books account for the largest share at 27.21 percent.Bringing a number of outstanding children's books to the fair, Lin Yun, head of the China Peace Publishing House, recognizes the intense competition in the children's publishing sector.Lin says that children's publications should continue to provide proper guidance and contribute to the development of future generations."At the beginning of the new year, the book market has ushered in a good start, about which we are very excited," says Wu Shulin, chairman of the Publishers Association of China.As Chinese population is aging, questions regarding how to live a long and good life — especially in one's late years — have received increasing attention in recent years.Last year, Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity by US longevity expert Peter Attia was published. Based on years of clinical experience and medical research, the book explores a new approach to preventing chronic diseases and extending long-term health, becoming a New York Times bestseller.Recently, a Chinese translation of the book has been released by China Translation & Publishing House at the 36th Beijing Book Fair.Liu Yongchun, chief editor at the publishing house, said in the launch ceremony that the idea of seeking treatment after diseases develop that often prolong life span at the expense of health span (quality of life) has been replaced by a new idea — preventing diseases with a well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending life span while enhancing people's physical, cognitive and emotional well-being.Tian Tongsheng, the founder of a Chinese community that seeks to prolong life span and health span with science and technology, said that pursuing longevity does not simply mean prolonging people's physical life, but extending their health span, so that they can get rid of the plight where although they live a longer life, they suffer from bad health and have to rely on the care of other family members and thus are not able to live a quality, decent life in late years.He regards the book as a good guide to daily practice. For example, during the exercise of running, people can refer to the suggestion in the book to monitor their heart rates, assess their sleep, and know their maximum oxygen uptake to improve cardiovascular fitness.The book series Chinese Folklore Documents Overseas was launched in Beijing on Jan 20.The book was compiled by the Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage Research Center of Sun Yat-sen University and published by Shaanxi Normal University General Publishing House.The first batch of 18 books primarily focus on presenting original materials, said Wang Xiaobing, chief editor of the series.The book series was developed based on the "research on the compilation, study, and database construction of rare Chinese folk cultural documents and cultural relics preserved overseas", which was a major 2016 National Social Science Fund project, said Qu Ruixin, vice-president of the Shaanxi publishing house.At the book launch ceremony, the series was also donated to the National Library of China.The book series will further enrich the resources of folk cultural books in the collection of the National Library of China, said Shen Xiaojuan, head of the library's research institute.The library will enable more scholars and the general public to read and make good use of these rare documents, Shen says.The Beijing Book Fair, held from Jan 11 to 13, reported a record high of over 100,000 visits as China's book market continues to thrive.According to an annual report on the book market issued under the guidance of the Publishers Association of China and the Book and Periodicals Distribution Association of China, China's retail sales of books totaled 91.2 billion yuan (about $12.8 billion) in 2023, up 4.72 percent year on year.Regarded as a trendsetter in the publishing industry, the event featured 400,000 books from 720 exhibitors, drawing publishers, authors, and readers nationwide for the literal feast.Charm of traditional cultureIn the almost 400 diverse activities held during the book fair, numerous events spotlighting traditional culture and historical themes captivated the readers.Among these activities is the unveiling of six-volume book series on Chinese culture, illuminating the cultural system with comprehensive coverage of literature, painting, calligraphy, music, drama, architecture, and aesthetics."Traditional Chinese culture is increasingly attracting the interest of young readers," said Nie Zhenning with the Guangdong Education Publishing House, publisher of the book series.

Since Fidan and his colleagues translated the famous book from classical Chinese in 2014, it has undergone 25 reprints. Previous publications were reliant on translations from English or French.In Turkiye, where the sale of over 100,000 copies of a book is widely considered a remarkable success, The Art of War has sold over 400,000 copies in nine years.Fidan attributes the success of the book in Turkiye to the enduring relevance of China's philosophy of peace, asserting that it remains a valid human ideal in both contemporary and ancient times."The Art of War reflects Chinese wisdom. It says conflict is unnecessary if it is not inevitable. The world is vast enough for everyone, and we can have a peaceful way," says Fidan."The name (of the book) is The Art of War, but the main argument is avoiding war. A successful strategist or general should avoid war when possible," he says."The Chinese classics are precious and a shared heritage of humankind," the Sinologist says, highlighting the significant interest among Turkish readers eager to understand Chinese philosophy and way of thinking.Fidan says he has translated a wide range of Chinese works since The Art of War. The latest is Zhen Guan Zheng Yao (The Essentials of Governance), which was published in December 2023 and points to the growing interest in Chinese culture among Turks.China's economic success in recent decades and its opening up have offered great opportunities to people across the globe, including from Turkiye, to learn the Chinese language and culture, says Fidan."Not only in Turkiye, but there is a large interest in China all over the world, from Europe to the United States," he says, indicating that many more people are learning Chinese to boost their general knowledge.In his view, this is because they think it is an important investment for their future.With the establishment of the China-Turkiye strategic cooperative relationship in 2010, economic and cultural cooperation between the two nations has flourished. The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has also become a medium of extensive multilateral cooperation between the two sides.Fidan's university has responded to the growing interest of Turkish youth in Chinese culture by offering a Chinese language major for the first time this year.The class is "100 percent full", says the Sinologist excitedly. "This shows how much interest there is in Turkiye toward learning Chinese, and discovering China's history and culture."For years, traditional physical bookstores have been actively seeking to change since they are facing difficulties due to the rise of the internet, and especially of online marketing, which has become the main channel through which Chinese people buy books.Jiang Chuanyang, chairman of the Zhejiang Xinhua Bookstore Group, spoke about this issue at the 2024 China Bookstore Conference, which was held in Beijing on Jan 9, to discuss the role of innovation in the development of physical bookstores.Under the theme of "innovation, reshaping the value of bookstores", the annual event was organized by the Books and Periodicals Distribution Association of China, the Anhui Xinhua Distribution Group Holding, and Bookdao, a publishing and book market intelligence information platform.According to Ai Limin, chairman of the Books and Periodicals Distribution Association of China, bookstores have made some progress. For example, the number of bookstores in China has remained relatively steady in recent years, with some cities seeing slight growth. Some innovative bookstores stand out and seem to have bright prospects.Among them is the New City Bookstore, which opened in 2017.Despite the challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it continues to grow, and now has four branches in Southwest China's Sichuan and Guizhou provinces.Li Hui, a founder of the brand, analyzed the shortcomings of traditional bookstores. According to him, their value — like offering readers the chance to choose and buy books — can now be replaced by other channels, which has urged him to consider what bookstores can provide readers.He has found that most of the customers who visit bookstores are women from 25 to 40, who often like reading, socializing, and who enjoy life. As a result, they have become the target customers for his chain.Li's bookstores are built to satisfy their needs, and to allow them to enjoy a slow life. This means that they are no longer just places to buy books, but also cultural spaces.Li pays attention to meeting the five sensory needs, namely visual, olfactory, acoustic, haptic and gustatory. As a result, his bookstores are carefully designed to be beautiful, smell pleasantly of flowers and coffee, with beautiful background music, wooden bookshelves which feel good to touch, and restaurants and cafes providing tasty food and drinks."As a result, our bookstores are not limited to being a place for selling books, but also serve as a cafe, restaurant, bar and theater with performances such as talk shows and cross talk shows (comedy stand-ups)," said Li.Chen Lei, founder of the Hunzhi Bookstore, who is also a cartoonist, agreed with the idea of making his bookstore a cultural space.He and his group of cartoonists have been making cartoons popularizing science and history, which have become well-received. Almost 40 million copies have been printed to date.In 2020, Chen came up with the idea of opening a bookstore to communicate with readers. The store finally opened last year in Shanghai."We want to build an experience center where people can enjoy various forms of entertainment besides reading," said Chen.Elements from his cartoons decorate the bookstore, and even its restaurant features dishes related to the cartoons.As a creator, Chen also organizes interactive activities so that cartoonists in his group can communicate with readers, and teach them how to draw. "Some children have had fun in such activities, since they can see the cartoonists they like, and draw with them. And their parents can drink coffee in the coffee room," said Chen.Youth in particular are exploring the medium, drawn by the entertainment they add to educational topics, Yang Yang reports.In recent years, the domestic market has seen comic books that popularize knowledge — especially about traditional Chinese culture — or that provide emotional support have become popular, largely due to competition that's increasingly fierce in today's fast-paced society. However, comics, which are particularly demanding for both authors and editors in general, still need further development, insiders say.According to the latest report on the domestic book market in 2023 by the publishing industry consulting company Beijing Openbook, comics have become an important medium for presenting different themes.On both the general list of bestsellers and the list of best-selling new books in 2023, comic books that cover subjects such as science, psychology, history, life and traditional culture, targeting both adults and children, performed well.For example, the top best-selling children's book in 2023 is Manhua Xiaoxuesheng Xinli (Psychological Comics for Primary School Students), according to Beijing Openbook.In 2022, Xiaoxuesheng Chaoxi'aide Manhua Kexue (Comic Books About Science Loved by Primary School Students) sold more than 1 million copies.Actually, comics present many topics in a more vivid and interesting way, and aim to teach children a range of things, such as self-defense, developing strength, making friends and studying efficiently; the life of Confucius and the development of his thoughts; Chinese classics like Journey to the West, Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Dream of the Red Chamber; great inventions, politics, philosophy, arts and military strategy in ancient China.Possible indicator of things to come as science fiction award won by nonhumanAll-powerful robots and artificial intelligence have long been the subjects of science fiction. Now such technology means that fact is stranger than fiction. A science fiction story, The Land of Machine Memories, recently received a literary award.What made this tale so compelling was that the title, text, illustrations and even the pen name QuartZen were all the creations of artificial intelligence. Yet among the six judges of the competition, just one realized that what they were reading was the product of a machine.The Land of Machine Memories tells of a relationship between a human and AI. Li Xiao, the protagonist, is an explorer in the meta-verse even as she works as a neural engineer in the real world. In an experiment gone wrong, she loses all of her memories about her family. To recover them, she steps out onto a journey to explore the land of machine memories with her AI friend Neura. Li eventually retrieves her memories, gaining a deeper understanding and experience of the universe.The novel was created using AI by Shen Yang, a professor in the School of Journalism and Communication at the Tsinghua University in Beijing. He says he engaged in 66 rounds of dialogue with an AI program, typing requests and prompts to form a draft text of 43,061 words that eventually produced the prizewinning story of 5,915 words.The story was awarded second prize at the fifth youth popular science and science fiction competition, organized by the Jiangsu Popular Science Writers Association in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. There were nearly 200 entries, and 90 won awards: six special prizes, 14 first prizes, 18 second prizes and 27 third prizes."The aim of the competition is to encourage more people to get involved in creating science fiction novels," says Fu Changyi, director of the Science Fiction Committee of the Jiangsu Popular Science Writers Association. "It's mainly for science fiction beginners nationwide aged 14 to 45. College students are the most important group of participants in this competition."Fu says he was aware of Shen's long-term involvement in artificial intelligence research, so he invited him to take part in the competition. Fu kept the fact that The Land of Machine Memories was generated by AI from the judges. "So it was a bit like an experiment."For him, the outcome came as a surprise. Three out of the six judges voted for The Land of Machine Memories. By competition rules, works recommended by five judges can win a special prize, and works recommended by three judges can win a second prize.One of the judges who was impressed by the AI story was Wang Yanzhong, a science fiction novelist. "At first I didn't realize that it was created by AI. There's no doubt that AI surpasses many humans in terms of density of knowledge. Compared with the works of beginners, it's outstanding."Another judge, Suo Hefu, also a science fiction novelist, was not as enthusiastic about the novel. He thought the literary quality was weak and that the story was disjointed. He half-jokingly remarks, "Despite this, I still gave it a score of 72, whereas some works by humans got only 27 from me."Shen says it took him three hours intermittently to complete the story. Because of a limitation in the length of context that the AI program Shen was using can support, he first generated an outline, enriched the content, determined the idea paragraph by paragraph, and finally put it all together for the final manuscript.From his very first dialogue with AI, he was surprised by its efficiency. "AI could generate a complete story outline in seconds, based on a few keywords I provided."At the end of the story, a discourse about emotion and emptiness created by AI shocked him. The AI was constantly asked to rewrite the ending, and it finally came up with this profound idea: the true source of emotion is, in fact, inner emptiness. There is a point at which Neura says to Li, "emotions are your response to emptiness and your way of trying to fill this bottomless pit. This is also why emotions can never be fully satisfied, because emptiness is eternal".Shen says he thinks that this reflects AI's perception and explanation of human emotions. "I think it's an emergence of AI, which means that AI has knowledge or behaviors that exceed human regulation."Chen Huimin, who received her PhD from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, and is currently an assistant professor at the School of Journalism and Communication, explains further."Emergence is a long-standing concept, generally referring to the phenomenon where complex systems display properties that are not present in any of their individual submodules. When applied to the field of large language models, it means that a model represents a sudden change in capability when its scale reaches a certain level," Chen says."At present, the machine's learning pattern is based on human data and feedback. It can already perform much better than many ordinary people in certain aspects. And the learning mechanism will keep improving in the future."But sometimes AI can be "stupid", Shen says. When he asked the program to rewrite a paragraph in the style of Czech novelist Franz Kafka, the AI misunderstood his request and generated, "she stood there like a character in Kafka's works".Of course the inability to be always accurate is not the preserve of robots, as attested to by the judges in the contest who failed to discern that they were victims of an elaborate "identity theft", a robot pretending to be human.That raises the question: Do you think this article was written by a human being?The answer is: Indeed it was; AI is not ready to take over everything — yet. But the next story you read might not be.Yan Bingjie contributed to this story.A list of the "Top 10 Buzzwords in Chinese Online Literature in 2023", co-released recently by The Paper, a digital newspaper, and the country's largest online literature content provider, China Literature Group, displays trendy ways that young people tackle the uncertainties of life.The list was made based on an analysis of topics, industrial trends, cultural responsibilities of online literature.According to the list, in 2023, terms such as zhongtian (farming), kaoyan (postgraduate entrance examination), wucp (including no romantic stories), zuowangdao (the way of sitting oblivion), zhishang zaixian (meaning the characters behave smartly in stories), feiyi (intangible cultural heritage), short drama, and bazong quanqiuhua (urban romance featuring overbearing CEO boyfriends gaining traction globally), became the trendiest words in online fiction.In 2023, as many young people worked hard trying to pass postgraduate entrance and civil service examinations, the "exam rush" has driven the creation of stories like Chongshengde Wo Zhixiang Zhuanxin Xuexi (After Rebirth, I Just Want to Focus on Study) and Jijian Shengxian, Cong Difu Kaobian Kaishi (Getting Immortal, Starting From Civil Service Examination in the Netherworld).The first novel features leading characters preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination to enter China's top universities — Peking University and Tsinghua University — and the second describes immortals trying to pass the examination to enter the official systems in the underworld.As young people seemed to advocate the phrase "make money not love", the tag wucp ranked among the top three on the women's channel on online literature platform Qidian. Romantic relationships are no longer seen as the standard plot for single female protagonists.In comparison, in men's channel, "sweet love stories" became the tag that has seen the biggest rise in numbers over the past five years.The buzzwords also show that, as they face uncertainties, young people born after 1995 have tried to seek spiritual havens in online literature that can help them reduce pressure, according to the analysis.In 2023, the first drama about farming adapted from a novel on Qidian, Tiangengji (Chronicles of Farming), quickly gained widespread online popularity.In addition to dramas, young people, far away from fields, also became enthusiastic about farming-themed online fictions and reality shows. Through "cyber farming", they tried to get close to nature, rediscover the true essence of life and take a break from the high pressure of urban life.Another buzzword that shows the stress-relieving trend is zuowangdao. Zuowang originally means a spiritual state of sitting oblivion.Zuowangdao became popular due to an eccentric school of immortals featured in a popular online novel, who can improve their power by seeking more pleasure through tricking people. On livestreaming platform Bilibili, videos about zuowangdao have been played more than 60 million times. By this word, young people express their hope to look for more pleasure in life.Buzzwords on the list also show the development trend of Chinese online literature.Buzzwords like zhishang zaixian and feiyi indicate that online literature is continuously improving its quality.On Qidian's reading app, the tag qunxiang ("group portrait": multiple interesting characters) has ranked at the top.Meanwhile, writers tend to design more complicated plots and mental activities for protagonists so that they appear zhishang zaixian (sophisticated enough).In 2023, online literature also continued to carry forward traditional culture. Many intangible cultural heritage projects, such as Peking Opera, wood carving, papermaking techniques, and lion dances are present in online literature. Feiyi has risen to the top tag in the women's channels of China Literature Group's platforms.Besides, terms such as short drama and bazong quanqiuhua show the popularity of online literature both at home and abroad.According to a report by market research and consulting company iiMedia Research, the market size of China's online short dramas is estimated to be 37.39 billion yuan ($5.3 billion) in 2023, representing year-on-year growth of 268 percent. While short dramas are usually adapted from online literary works, its big market potential also promises a growing readership for online literature.At the end of December, a report about the overseas development of Chinese online literature in 2023 launched at the 2nd Shanghai International Online Literature Week shows that China's overseas revenue from online literature exceeds 4 billion yuan.Webnovel, an overseas portal of China Literature Group, has seen about 400,000 writers from more than 100 countries and regions write on the platform. In 2023, Webnovel launched a total of 610,000 original works by overseas writers. Urban romance, especially that featuring badao zongcai (overbearing rich boyfriends), has become one of the most popular genres among overseas readers, according to the report.American historian and biographer Kai Bird was recently in Shanghai to promote the Chinese edition of American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.Over the past six months, the 72-year-old also traveled to Italy and Britain to discuss his 2005 biography of the theoretical physicist, also known as "the father of the atomic bomb".Bird co-authored the book with the late historian Martin J. Sherwin. Sherwin initiated the biography project in 1980 and spent the following 20 years doing research and interviews. He later realized that, without additional help, his undertaking would be "a Sisyphean operation", (unfinished) so he invited Bird to join him in writing the book in 2000.The 700-page book is centered on stories from Oppenheimer's life interwoven with science, World War II, and Cold War politics.The book has won several accolades, including the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for a Biography or Autobiography. Despite these achievements, it was not a bestseller until recently."The Pulitzer is a big thing, and it's very nice to win that prize, as it helped to sell more books. But still it sold modestly," Bird says in an exclusive interview with China Daily."It never got on the The New York Times bestseller list or elsewhere. It stayed in print. I was kind of disappointed that it didn't get a wider readership."While it had also been optioned many times for a movie, every attempt failed until the most recent effort by Christopher Nolan.Following the release of Nolan's film Oppenheimer in July, the book finally found its way into The New York Times bestseller list. In fact, the book is still there today, five months on. The three-hour movie has also become the most successful biopic ever — its box office takings just two months after its release amounted to a whopping $913 million globally.Bird admits he wasn't fully prepared for the movie's success. In fact, he even doubted if Hollywood was capable of making such a film in the first place.Telling the stories of ancient structures is a passionate undertaking for enthusiast, Yang Yang reports.More than a decade ago, ancient pagoda enthusiast Wu Kai was looking for a book that systematically and comprehensively detailed the total number and locations of the pagodas, and provided introductions with good-quality photos."I read a lot of books. But I found that the pagodas they included are limited, with many mistakes and lacking clear logic. I decided to create such a book myself rather than wait for someone to complete the task," he says, adding that, "after all, over the years I have systematically collected and organized plenty of materials".Wu fell in love with ancient pagodas when he was a student studying physics at Tsinghua University. "I didn't know much about them at first. I just found them appealing to look at," he recalls."Ancient Chinese people tended to build large-scale structures, but not tall buildings, and the pagoda was the only tall building they erected that lasts to this day," Wu says. "They are so conspicuous that they became landmark buildings."I love them, possibly because they are among the best carriers of Chinese culture."Originating in India, stupas, dome-shaped structures, were built to enshrine the relics of the founder of Buddhism, Sakyamuni. Nearly 2,000 years ago, stupas were introduced to China along with Buddhism. At that time, Chinese people had already started building multitiered wooden square watchtowers.Creatively combining the stupa form factor and the watchtower design, Chinese architects created something new — multistoried pagodas, which had the metal spire of a stupa, but the body of a multitiered Chinese wooden square tower.A portrait brick from the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220) unearthed in Shifang city of Sichuan province in 1973 reveals the earliest image of a Chinese pavilion-style pagoda — a three-story building.In the following 2,000 years, pagodas have evolved into many more styles, including dense-eave, Tibetan-style inverted bowl, Vajrasana and Dai-ethnic-style pagodas. The shape of a pagoda body has also developed from square to hexagonal, octagonal or round.A total of 41 books and 20 journals of historical studies have been awarded at the ceremony of the Guo Moruo Chinese History Awards, which was held in Beijing on Dec 20.Award winners included books of general history, dynastic history, archaeology, paleography and paleoanthropology. For example, Study on the Form of Ancient Chinese Villages makes a systematic analysis of the birth, form and evolutionary traits of ancient villages in China, providing insights into the relationship between villages and the ruling dynasties, as well as the power structure within the villages themselves.The book was written by Ma Xin, a professor at the Shandong University's School of History and Culture, who mainly studies village society during the Qin (221-206 BC) and Han (206 BC-AD 220) dynasties."In academic research, we must make clear the relationship between the whole and the parts. Without an understanding of the overall development of village society, we cannot thoroughly understand the Qin and Han village societies," says Ma, explaining why she wrote the book.Other award winners include History of Social Life in the Early 20th Century, a book about the many facets of people's lives, like diet, clothes, festival celebrations and entertainment in early 20th-century China, and Organization and Study on Ancient Bronze Vessels in China, a collection covering the development of various types of bronze vessels from Erlitou Culture, which existed from the 18th to 16th century BC to the late period of the Warring States Period (475-221 BC).Three books that popularize history knowledge to the public were honored as well, including Uninterrupted History of Civilization: Archaeological Interpretation of Five Thousand Years of Chinese National Identity, written by Liu Qingzhu, a researcher with the Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.According to Liu, China is the only nation with an uninterrupted civilizational history of 5,000 years. The dynasties established by different people in various times have a shared national identity.That can be shown in layouts of capitals from the Erlitou site in Luoyang, Henan province, widely believed to be the capital of the late period of the Xia Dynasty (c. 21st century-16th century BC), to the Palace Museum in Beijing, China's imperial palace from 1420 to 1911; and in tomb systems from those at Yinxu Ruins in Anyang, Henan, capital of the late Shang Dynasty (c. 16th century-11th century BC) to the ones of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), as he demonstrates in his book.According to Gao Xiang, president of the CASS, the award-winning works are intellectually profound, academically cutting-edge, reflecting the rigorous and practical academic character of historians, each of whom dare to innovate, are willing to take responsibility, and relentlessly pursue the truth.They fully demonstrate the new progress, achievements and atmosphere of Chinese historical studies in the new era, he adds.Named in honor of Guo Moruo (1892-1978), a Chinese historian and writer, the award was initiated in 1998 to promote the development of the nation's history studies. It is regarded as one of the most authoritative prizes in domestic history circles.Renowned author Yu Hua delivered an open writing class titled "Starting from Pamuk's Nights of Plague" at Beijing Normal University on the evening of Dec 14.As one of the most representative contemporary writers in China, Yu has published novels including To Live that has been translated into many different languages such as French, English and Korean. A movie adaptation of the novel by Zhang Yimou has become a Chinese classic.Recently, Paris Review ran an interview with Yu, the first Chinese writer to be featured among the pages of this renowned literary magazine.As a teacher at Beijing Normal University's International Center for Writing, Yu's literature classes have always intrigued readers. Through livestreaming, his class has reached a broader audience of literature lovers beyond the campus.At the beginning of the class, Yu said discussing Nights of Plague was a "difficult task", since he needs to get everyone interested in reading the book, but do so while avoiding spoilers."Pamuk wrote with great patience, and we need patience to read his book. Once you finish the novel, you'll realize it's much more fascinating than I can convey," he said.Nights of Plague, written by Turkish author and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk in 2016, is set against the tumultuous backdrop of the Ottoman Empire in 1901. The story unfolds on the imaginary island of Mingheria in the Levant, located in the eastern Mediterranean between Crete and Cyprus, which was plagued not only by imperial threats but also by a deadly epidemic.The Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II sends his most accomplished quarantine expert to the island to control the outbreak, who is subsequently murdered. The sultan sends a second doctor to the island to combat the plague and uncover the killer of his predecessor.Yu finished reading the 600-page novel in several days in the first half of the year. He said, although the novel tells a story about the early 20th century, it is a tale about the present day.The Chilean Embassy in Beijing hosted a commemorative event on Monday to mark the 78th anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature that was awarded to renowned Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral.Professor Zhao Zhenjiang, a distinguished Spanish language professor at Peking University, graced the occasion and recited two of Mistral's poems. During the event, Mr. Wan Lansu, Charge d'Affaires at the Chilean Embassy in China, presented Professor Zhao with the 2020 China-Chile 50th Anniversary Commemorative Medal in recognition of his efforts in building a platform for the Chinese understanding of Latin American literature, particularly Chilean literature.Professor Zhao, through his Chinese translations, has played a crucial role in fostering cultural exchanges, shedding light on Chilean literature. In the realm of Nobel laureates, both Gabriela Mistral in 1945 and Pablo Neruda in 1971 have hailed from Chile.The commemoration, which has been tailored towards children, is joined by principals, teachers and students from four Chinese public schools with a focus on the Spanish language. The ceremony concluded with a dance performance inspired by Mistral's popular poem, Where Are We Drawing Circles? Children, holding hands in a circle, recited the Chilean author's poetry while dancing.All participating schools received complete sets of Mistral's works, along with books from other Chilean authors. Additionally, the Chilean Embassy donated over 2,000 books to more than 25 educational institutions in China this month, aiming to spread the educational values embodied by the revered Chilean poet.Beijing Foreign Languages Bookstore, which opened in 1958, closed for renovation on Wednesday.The bookshop is situated in bustling Wangfujing Street, and is the country's first enterprise in a cultural realm to operate on a shareholding procedure.The 66-year-old bookstore is a popular site and celebrated scholars like Qian Xuesen and Chen Jingrun were regular customers in the 1960s and '70s. In 1994, annual sales exceeded 100 million yuan ($13.9 million).Xu Hongsheng, the bookstore's president, said that some of its business will be carried on online."We'll organize an online library for readers to lend foreign titles. And we'll show up more on book fairs, cultural markets, as well as setting up flash-mobbing stores," Xu said.The reconstruction after redesign is expected to finish by the end of 2025.An Liang, assistant to the general manager, said the new bookstore will feature international exchanges; and by offering more space for salons, exhibitions and events, it will become a hub for international students and visitors.To cater to the need of learning English as a way of expanding horizons and fostering global perspectives among young readers, Dogwood publishing, under the New Oriental Education and Technology Group, introduced an authorized version of The Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention by Heinemann Publishing into the Chinese market earlier this year.During a discussion about the country's early English-learning program held in Shanghai in late November, the book was introduced and a storytelling contest, in English, was held.The contest was under the theme of "kids connected with the world", echoing a countrywide discussion on the function of learning English after the role the language plays in K-12 examinations through to higher education has been undermined in recent years.Parental interest in having their children learn English, especially as a practically usable tool in future international communications, hasn't reduced too much, the guests to the events said.Liu Gejun, in charge of Dogwood's children's books section, said the Heinemann books targeted "struggling readers" in the English-speaking countries, and thus makes them useful for Chinese English-learners.Edited by senior educators and researchers Irene Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell, the Leveled Literacy Intervention system is comprised of very thin storybooks (with pages ranging from 12 to 30) with cute illustrations or photos designated for the series.It covers 60 percent of fictional stories and 40 percent of nonfiction topics.Wang Jun, from the New Oriental's teachers' development center, said: "Nonfictional reading especially means much for children who eye globally.""To prepare the young readers to connect with the world in their future, Dogwood enriches the LLI book in Chinese market with videos of foreign teachers and develops online applications to interact with the readers," Wang added.Callisto China, a new publishing division dedicated to the Chinese book market, was created in late November by Penguin Random House North Asia and Sourcebooks.This follows the sale of the publishing assets of Callisto Media, a leading nonfiction publisher, in a Sourcebooks-led, Penguin Random House-funded acquisition in May.Founded in 2011, Callisto is known for data-driven publishing that combines big data and technology. It has an expansive list of nonfiction titles that include workbooks, cook books, and titles in health and wellness, relationships and personal growth. They are believed to have global appeal."This collaborative publishing partnership for Callisto China is an unprecedented opportunity for the Callisto publishing program to reach new readers of all ages in China, expanding the brand globally for the first time," said Talia Platz, editorial director of Callisto Publishing and one of the company's first employees.As an international publisher which opened its China office in 2005, Penguin Random House is familiar with the publishing business and trends in the domestic market. It has a local editorial team, who collaborate with authors, agents, and domestic publishing partners to produce high-quality bestsellers."As we forge our partnership, we tap into the vibrant pulse of China's market, where the demand for children's nonfiction and educational books is expanding rapidly," said Azia Cheng Yilin, CEO of Penguin Random House North Asia.Callisto China will publish a selection of Callisto's front and backlist titles in Chinese. It will also offer customized service in disciplines such as STEM, history, biography and reference books, to cater to reading preferences and habits."This collaboration is more than a business interaction. It is dedication to the growth and enlightenment of young minds. Our entry into this market with a robust catalog of children's titles is a response to the increasing emphasis on holistic development — mental, physical, and emotional — in early education," said Cheng."We are equally committed to the adult segment, recognizing the growing interest in self-care and lifelong learning among Chinese adults."Newriting magazine, the first issue of which came out in 2008, was China's first "mook" (magazine book) publishing original literary work.After a pause in 2019, it announced its return on Monday with its upcoming January 2024 issue.Newriting seeks to encourage new novels, poems, literary commentary and interviews. Under its chief editor Zhang Yueran, a representative of the generation of writers born in the 1980s, and also an associate professor at the School of Liberal Arts at Renmin University, it has adopted an international perspective on promoting exchange."Newriting will continue to publish in print, and will sponsor workshops, contests and literary camps," the editorial team said in an official statement.Taking up where it left off, the January issue will be dedicated to a theme, this time the idea of "serious writing".It will include submissions by Shuang Xuetao, Xu Haofeng and Yoshii Shinobu, as well as critics Fan Ye and Huang Yuning, who will explore the blurring of lines between serious literature and popular writing, like fantasy and science fiction.Readers have warmly welcomed the publication's return. News of the upcoming issue has been posted on social media, with some calling it a "fight against the gloomy trend in published magazines". One commentator wrote: "I don't think I was their target reader, but I have been reading Newriting from the very first issue, and always get inspiration from it.""I have all the previous issues on my bookshelf, and am looking forward to the new ones," wrote another reader, who goes by the online moniker of "Persian snail".Established in 1957, Beijing Fine Art Academy boasts a rich and quality collection of works of ink art master Qi Baishi, who was the institution's first and only honorary director. The academy has been committed to the research of classic Chinese painting and especially, Qi's art.Recently the academy released its three new books, published by Guangxi Normal University Press, Study of Qi Baishi (Volume 11), Ten Talks About Poems of Qi Baishi and Study of Chinese Painting and Calligraphy (Volume 3).The books were launched at the academy's annual academic conference on Dec 1-2 at which, attendants reviewed the work of the academy over the past year and discussed the future celebration of the 160th anniversary of Qi's birth next year.Earlier this year, the academy launched a series of events, including touring exhibitions and lectures at home and abroad, as a warmup of the celebrations in 2024. New year will be marked with a rich program with a focus on the influence of Qi especially worldwide, and how to utilize Qi's art as a major channel to spread widely the charm of Chinese ink tradition.To honor his achievements and boost rural development, a new museum dedicated to Mo Yan opened to visitors in Gaomi, Shandong province, on Tuesday.Mo Yan, who was born in Gaomi in 1955, won the Nobel laureate of literature in 2012, and is known for writing rooted in his home and the land."Most of the stories I tell are true and have happened in Gaomi," the author said at the opening ceremony for the Mo Yan Literature and Art Museum, adding that he hopes the museum will become a place for international literary exchange and a spiritual home for Gaomi residents."What I should do was simplicity itself, write my own stories in my own way. My way was that of the marketplace storyteller, with which I was so familiar, the way my grandfather and my grandmother and other village old-timers told stories," Mo Yan said during his acceptance speech for his Nobel award.The museum contains versions of his books in different languages, as well as manuscripts, and award medals and certificates. It will also host literary events and tours for students.Mo Yan said that many famous writers were born in Shandong and he hopes that the museum will contribute to drawing them together.Writer Feng Jicai attended the opening ceremony. "A big tree of literature has grown, and it is the earth where it grows that nurtures it. The museum is the earth for us to find out roots to interpret Mo Yan and learn more about him," he said. "It also shows how people love and respect him."As one of the world's key English-language academic publishers, Springer Nature has promoted Chinese academic achievements globally for years.In late November, it handed out awards to 10 publications by Chinese researchers or teams that include Chinese scholars, through its China New Development Awards.The winning publications show the increased focus of international publishing on subjects like the environment and Artificial Intelligence, and the contributions of both toward facilitating the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, as Leana Li Yan, Springer Nature's regional director of books, puts it.Among the 10, three are in the field of environmental sciences and focus respectively on carbon neutrality, indoor air quality and the circular economy, while an additional winner from the economics field discusses the disciplinary framework of climate change economics."Scientific research provides the impetus for us to address global challenges and finally meet the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals," says Wu Shulin, chairman of the Publishers Association of China."As a developing country, China also faces great challenges, as the target date is 2030, and it would like to share its new findings and approaches in sustainable development. The award contributes to sharing, connecting and raising awareness to promote global efforts," Wu adds.Stefan von Holtzbrinck, chairman of the Springer Nature Group, says the award seeks to raise the visibility of Chinese research, and its connection to the world.Tsinghua University professor Zhang Yinping and his co-authors won an award for their Handbook of Indoor Air Quality. "This book is attributable to 136 experts and scholars in this field from 19 countries including China, the United States, Britain, and France, which demonstrates that international research collaboration plays a significant role in addressing the challenges of sustainable development confronted by society," Zhang says, adding that the handbook has been downloaded by users from 140 countries and has over 100 citations.China New Development awards have been given out to 50 English-language Chinese academic titles since the award was founded in 2019. Titles are assessed by a panel made up of Springer Nature's in-house editors and executives leading its SDG program, on the basis of both the scientific merit and the social impact of their research.This year's winners were all published in 2022."Over the past five years, 50 award-winning books have demonstrated how Chinese scholars have contributed to research relevant to SDGs," says Niels Peter Thomas, president of Springer Nature Greater China and Managing Director of Books."Putting them together, then promoting them to researchers around the world, testifies to the meaningful way Springer Nature adds value to Chinese research communities," he continues. "And it can also help to connect Chinese research to the rest of the world."The 10 winning titles of the 2023 China New Development Awards:(in alphabetical order)AI Literacy in K-16 ClassroomsBy Davy Tsz Kit Ng and othersArtificial IntelligenceBy Fang Lu and othersChina and the West: A Pragmatic Confucian's ViewBy Yao YangChina's City Cluster Development in the Race to Carbon NeutralityBy Ali Cheshmehzangi and othersClimate Change Economics: Perspectives from ChinaBy Pan JiahuaEncyclopedia of Ionic Liquids By Zhang SuojiangFrom Zero Waste to Material Closed Loop: The Way Towards a Circular EconomyBy Yang JianmingHandbook of Indoor Air QualityBy Zhang Yinping and othersRadiology of Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases — Volume 2 By Li Hongjun and othersThe Evolution of China's Anti-Poverty Strategies By William N. BrownMore than 120 guests from home and aboard gathered at a seminar titled “Inner Child’s World, The World’s Child” on Monday in Wuyi county of Jinhua city, East China’s Zhejiang province, discussing the future development of Chinese children’s literature and opportunities for international exchange and cooperation.The “2024 Chinese Fairy Tales Going Global” campaign was also launched during the event with many cooperation agreements in various fields signed.Wuyi is known as the birthplace of Chinese fairy tales as it is home to many renowned Children’s book writers such as Tang Tang.Together with Heihe, an award-winning children’s book author hailing from Northeast China’s Heilongjiang province, Tang shared at the seminar that she has been trying to create a fairy tale world full of warmth and energy. Heihe said that he attempted to reconstruct the wilderness culture of North China through fiction, showing children the possibilities of peaceful coexistence between man and nature.Several experts expressed hope that the seminar could help spread the works of Chinese new-generation writers more widely overseas.Through a perspective of painting creation, Roger Miro, a Brazilian painter and winner of the 2014 Hans Christian Andersen Award for Illustration, spoke of the poetic relationship between images and texts in fairy tales. As the highest form of fantasy, fairy tales present images and texts imbued with poetry and philosophy.Li Lifang, a children’s book critic and dean of the college of arts and letters at Lanzhou University, highlighted how Chinese children’s literature has garnered global attention in the last decade for its distinctive aesthetics.Vonne Cunha Canonica, Brazilian author and former executive secretary of the Brazilian ministry of culture, compared children’s book creation, publication and promotion between China and Brazil. The writer hoped for more exchanges and cooperation between the two countries.Critic Chen Xiang saw Tang Tang’s works as coming closest to the heart of fairy tales, with a Chinese soul that can resonate universally.French cartoonist Olivier Richard and Sri Lankan scholar Sugath Rathnayake expressed love for the traditional elements in Tang Tang and Heihe’s works, believing that natural beauty and heritage can touch readers of different cultural backgrounds.BRATISLAVA — The illustrators of Chinese children's books remain among the most internationally awarded artists thanks to their consistent use of unique and traditional styles of artistic expression, according to Zuzana Jarosova, general commissioner of the Biennial of Illustrations Bratislava."There is always the masterful craftsmanship, painting or drawing talent that the jury appreciates about Chinese illustrations, as they maintain high quality and are masterpieces of art," says Jarosova.Chinese illustrator Chen Xunru received the Golden Apple award for her artwork in the book Bull King Festival at the ongoing 29th edition of the BIB in Slovakia, which started on Oct 4 and runs until Dec 3.Chen is the seventh Chinese illustrator to have received such an award. This year, the international BIB jury judged 2,072 illustrations by 275 illustrators from 36 countries and regions.Jarosova says the jurors are always looking for artists who are authentic and original while keeping their deep connection to culture, traditions and the mastery of old techniques.Jarosova has been overseeing the competition for the past 16 years. The first Chinese illustrator to win a Golden Apple was Cai Gao in 1993, she recalls.Illustrations in children's books play a key role in their mental development, as a good illustrator can elevate the story and build additional floors of the architecture of imagination, thus kick-starting the small readers' fantasy, Jarosova notes.Art for children is also one of the best ways to build bridges of cooperation and understanding between various cultures of the world, she says.The BIB, established more than half a century ago, is one of the most prestigious competitions for children's book illustrations, and it is supported by UNESCO and the International Board on Books for Young People.An international tour exhibition of picture books from China was held as an accompanying event at this year's BIB from Sept 28 to Oct 14.The exhibition was well received and was the first time people had the opportunity to see interesting illustrators from China to such a great extent, Jarosova says.This edition of the BIB also welcomed a Chinese delegation, including illustrators formerly awarded by the BIB, authors and publishers, and was a wonderful experience for them and for us, she adds."We agreed upon organizing many events together, and I will do everything I can for cooperation to continue and improve further," Jarosova says.XinhuaAt the tender age of 83, Yang Benfen has recently published her fourth book, Douzi Zhima Cha (Bean Sesame Tea), a work of nonfiction about the destiny of people she has met in life, including her neighbor, classmate, colleague and family members.Yang, who has been a farmer, an accountant, and a worker at an automobile transportation company, managed to make a living and support her family for much of her life, without having the time to realize her dream of reading books and getting more education.But when she retired two decades ago, she decided to write stories about her mother as a way to cope with the grief of losing her. She uploaded what she wrote online, and her stories attracted widespread attention. At 80, she saw the publication of her popular first book Qiu Yuan, which has a rating of 9 points out of 10 on the review site Douban.Following its success, she published Fu Mu (Floating Wood), Wo Ben Fen Fang (I Was Fragrant) and the latest Douzi Zhima Cha, all works of nonfiction about the lives and deaths of ordinary people she has met in the course of her life.The books have won her a dozen literary prizes, and almost 1 million copies of the first three books have been printed.According to Yang, bean sesame tea is a traditional drink in her hometown in Central China's Hunan province and is always offered to guests. The new book is like a cup of bean sesame tea she wants to offer readers, she says."A netizen once told me that no one wants to hear stories of ordinary people, and only celebrities or people of high social status can leave their stories behind. But I don't agree," she said at the launch of the book in Miluo, Hunan, in September."What I am interested in are just stories of ordinary people, who seem to be nameless. They have struggled in the torrents of life, come into this world and left in a silent way. These people include my mother, father, siblings, neighbors, and myself," she says.The new book is divided into two parts. The first contains stories of three women — an elderly woman who likes picking up garbage, a worker who wanted to run away from domestic violence but didn't make it, and a farmer who lost her husband at a young age."These women are so easily ignored in society that novelists may not pay attention to them. But I want to describe them since they represent the true life of ordinary Chinese women. … They are vibrant and resilient, shaped by countless hardships. They are far from perfect, but such imperfection touches people," says Yang.The second part is about the deaths of Yang's mother and older brother.She vividly recalls the last 26 days of her mother's life and how she and her bother helped their mother support their impoverished family when they were young."Their deaths mean a part of myself leaves as well. Death not only takes away life, but when your beloved ones pass away, they take away a part of you, too. When I'm writing, I feel I am overextending myself trying to retain those I love, and dispel the desperate feelings (of loss)," says Yang.After a failed surgery on her knee several years ago, Yang has been tortured by frequent pain. Only for a few days in a month, when the pain eases, is she able to seize the time to write something. Since the painkillers she takes have a side effect on her eyesight, they also make it difficult for her to write.But she still insists on writing, and now she is writing about pain. "Pain comes with growing old. It is horrible and lengthy. It makes you feel helpless, but you have to bear it," says Yang."Putting away the feelings of pain and growing old is a way of resisting. I know human beings are destined to fail in such resistance, but by trying so, they display their value and willpower."wangru1@chinadaily.com.cn      During the Global 50 CEO Talk at the 75th Frankfurt Book Fair late last month, Hou Xiaonan, CEO of the China Literature Group, was invited to join Rudiger Wischenbart, an observer of global publishing industry, and representatives from five media organizations specializing in books and publishing, to discuss business modes, the intellectual property ecosystem and the international development in online literature. More than 300 people attended the talk.Since it was launched in 2007, the Global 50 CEO Talk has hosted guest speakers from leading global publishing organizations like Penguin Random House, Netflix and Wattpad Webtoon.More than 4,200 exhibitors from 94 countries and regions attended this year's fair. The China Literature Group was the only online literature company from China to attend.Launched by China Literature in 2017, Webnovel has published the translations of 3,200 online Chinese novels and 560,000 stories written by 380,000 overseas writers, attracting more than 200 million readers from 200 countries and regions."What's special about online literature is its openness, inclusivity and collaborative creation. Today, writers from more than 100 countries and regions are writing on Webnovel," Hou said, adding that the group expects to publish books just as influential as the Harry Potter series and the Lord of Rings trilogy.In recent years, online literature has begun attracting more readers. According to a development report on online literature in China in 2022 released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, users of China's online literature platforms overseas rose to 901 million in 2022. In the same year, 16 online novels were added to the Chinese collection at the British Library."Online literature creates communication between Eastern and Western cultures, and is becoming a calling card of Chinese culture," Hou said, adding that "since 2022, China Literature has launched more than 300 animation, TV series, and film adaptations of online literature on overseas platforms".JKSManga from Britain is one of those overseas online writers. Inspired by online novel, Douluo Dalu, or Soul Land, he started writing on Webnovel in 2019. He has now become one of the most well-known writers on the platform. His novel My Vampire System has been visited more than 73 million times and adapted into audio books and manga.Online literature allows readers and writers to interact, which means you are not only reading a digital book, but participating in a social activity, he said.At the book fair, Webnovel launched a new logo, marking a new stage in development for the platform.The 2023 Blancpain-Imaginist Literary Prize has been awarded to 29-year-old author Yang Zhihan, for her collection of short stories Yituan Jianbing (literally, "a block of solid ice"), after beating four other short-listed writers.The award, cofounded by the Swiss luxury watchmaker and the Chinese publisher in 2018, aims to discover young Chinese writers. The winner receives 300,000 yuan ($41,160) and a Blancpain timepiece.The prize targets writers under the age of 45 and is open to all fictional genres, said Jack Liao, vice-president of Blancpain China, at the award ceremony in Beijing last month.Consisting of nine short stories and novellas, Yituan Jianbing recounts the sometime hard life stories of people in Northeast China, including one about a dropout girl hiding in a temple, a wild animal trainer who sends his tiger to a zoo after it kills another trainer during a performance, and a jobless young woman who is kicked out of the WeChat group of her classmates in primary and middle schools after she tries to sell products to them.Ma Boyong, one of the five judges this year, read comments from the jury about the winning entry at the award ceremony: "Yituan Jianbing is like snow falling on the edge of a knife, or licking an icy door. She 'freezes' her hometown with a cold, sharp brush, then takes a step back and lightly licks it with her tongue. The warm flesh sticks to the cold surface, and every move is shocking and deeply painful."Born in 1994, Yang said that she started writing when she was asked to keep a diary as a primary school student."I didn't know what to write, so my solution was to write a martial arts serial. One day it was about what happened to two people, and the next day I would add a new character. Later, our teacher said we didn't need to keep the diary, but I didn't stop writing. At first I wrote stories to finish the homework, but then it became fun, because my friends read my stories and they all asked me to add a new character for them," she said at the award ceremony.Talking about her book, she said: "Some of the stories in the collection are very unpleasant, but others are rather warm. I have included them in one book to represent my understanding of life. Just like the ice block on the cover of the book, which depicts a fire inside it, life has many moments when joy and sorrow exist at the same time.The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences released two books on the Belt and Road Initiative in Beijing on Wednesday to mark its 10th anniversary this year.The essay collection Belt and Road Initiative: Past, Present and Future, covers areas including politics, international relations, economy, technology, history and archaeology.It was written by Chinese and European scholars, who shared their own experience and observations of the development of China-Europe relations and the construction of the BRI.Kostas Gouliamos, former rector of the European University Cyprus and an ordinary member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts, who was one of the anthology's two editors-in-chief, pointed out in the conclusion that the civilizations of China and Europe have much in common.They have not only supported each other on important international issues, but have also deepened dialogue through mutual initiatives, which are indispensable for social and cultural progress, he wrote.The 2023 English-language edition of the Handbook of the Belt and Road, explains the background, concept and content of the BRI in the form of keyword entries to make it more accessible to readers.First published in 2018, the handbook has been published in English, Romanian, Polish, Korean and Hebrew, and will be translated into 11 more languages, according to Zhao Jianying, head of the China Social Sciences Press, the publisher of both books.Pandas overcome trauma inflicted by earthquakes in Sichuan province. Nomads swap sheep for emu to preserve vanishing grasslands in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. Impossible farms rise from the desert like mirages in Qinghai province. These are just a few of the often-surprising stories I've personally encountered while discovering how China is innovating to advance environmental and ecological protection and restoration.That is, while traveling through every province in the country, exploring its deserts, forests, grasslands and tundra over the past 17 years as a China Daily journalist.This is a primary theme in my book, Closer to Heaven: A Global Nomad's Journey Through China's Poverty Alleviation, published in English, Chinese and Italian.While it is ultimately about poverty alleviation, large sections are dedicated to how China has prudently navigated the relationship between economic prosperity and environmental protection in ways that are complementary rather than contradictory.I visit a project in Inner Mongolia's Alxa League where nomads raise emu rather than herd sheep — since these large birds generate more income while causing less environmental damage than their four-legged counterparts — and plant suosuo (a drought and salt-resistant tree) and congrong (a kind of herb planted in the roots of suosuo trees) to reverse desertification while growing traditional herbal medicines.I visit IT businesses in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, to discover how authorities reconfigured the area's industrial composition to restore Taihu Lake after the chemical plants that sprang up in the early years of reform and opening-up left 1 million people without usable water. And I sleep in remote stations with conservation officers tasked with protecting Tibetan antelope. And much, much more.In addition to experiencing these stories in the country's wildest corners, I've seen policies adopted at their source. That is, while attending events such as the annual meetings of the legislature and top political advisory body, and the Party Congresses in the Great Hall of the People.And last year, I hosted a one-on-one video discussion with China's Minister of Ecology and Environment and COP 15 president Huang Runqiu, just before the second phase of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in Montreal. The theme of biodiversity inspired me to reminisce about the dozens of rare species I've encountered in China, from elephants in the jungle to wolves on the tundra.This year, I was particularly honored that my mission to uncover China's unexpected shades of green from the field was recognized when I became the first foreigner to be named as a Special Observer of China's celebrations to mark the World Environment Day since the commemoration was established in 1985. I believe the presentation of this national award to a foreigner indicates not only China's growing inclusiveness, but also its recognition that even the most local environmental problems and progress are ultimately global.Pollution doesn't need a passport to cross borders. In fact, it doesn't heed any formal immigration procedures whatsoever.I remember, years ago, when Beijing's smog blotted out the city's skies. Authorities in the capital and nation have cleared up this problem and have also planted the Great Green Wall to block the sandstorms that once assailed the city from Inner Mongolia.Yet this spring, Beijing was nonetheless again sandblasted by gales from the Gobi that clogged the skies with sallow dust — this time originating from outside the country.This serves as yet another reminder of the importance of international — ideally, global — cooperation to protect the natural systems upon which every member of our — and every other — species depend.I've been particularly awestruck by the headway I've witnessed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where I started a poverty-alleviation initiative in 2011 that initially focused on installing solar panels in schools without electricity. This work regularly brings me to the no man's land that is nomad's land on the "planet's third pole", aka, the "roof of the world".Given the scarcity of electricity in my early years there — since punishing natural conditions severed the highlands from the fossil-fuel power grid — I never fathomed that, years later, the region would set new global records as a literal powerhouse for clean energy.Qinghai ran entirely on renewables for 360 hours in June 2019, beating records it had set in 2017 and 2018. The western province even produced a surplus of power that it shared with central and eastern regions, including megacities like Shanghai.And in 2018 alone, it increased its grass coverage by over 25 percent after herding restrictions had constrained livelihoods on prairies with virtually no resources other than the grass that feeds yaks and sheep that, in turn, feed nomads.Indeed, I look forward to seeing firsthand how China will continue to color its environmental and ecological legacies, as it turns gray skies blue, transforms yellow sands into green grass and makes murky waters clear.      At a recent book event about The Legend of Elena Ferrante at the embassy of Italy in Beijing, two Chinese scholars joined author Annamaria Guadagni in talking about the identity of the mysterious Italian writer.The event was part of the XXIII Settimana Della Lingua Italiana Nel Mondo (the 23rd World Italian Language Week) in China.Ferrante's books, including the Neapolitan Novels, have been translated into more than 40 languages and have sold more than 10 million copies across the world, since they were published in 2011. The final season of an HBO adaptation of the novels is to be due out this year. Since being introduced to China in 2017, they have become one of the most talked about series of novels in the country. On review site Douban alone, about 350,000 people have left ratings.However, for the last 30 years, the writer's identity has remained unknown. In her book, Guadagni tries to unveil Ferrante's identity and a Chinese translation of the book has now come out.Guadagni says that she decided to write the book after a reporter disclosed the writer's identity in what she considered an improper way in 2016."The reporter identified Ferrante as an actual person, based on information provided by her publishers, but I believe that she is a fictional narrator, a voice. Of course, there is a real person behind the books, but I feel that he or she is different to Ferrante, who is a fictional voice that has been shaped over the last 30 years.At the 75th Frankfurt Book Fair last month, the Encyclopedia of China Publishing House and the Springer Nature Group made a collaborative achievement announcement and signed a new agreement.The compilation of the Encyclopedia of China involved years of efforts by tens of thousands of experts and scholars from a range of disciplines across the country. It has since become a comprehensive project, transitioning from a purely domestic publication to aligning with international standards in print and digital formats, and from a Chinese-only version to exploring foreign-language editions.Among these developments, the Chinese Encyclopedia (Third Edition) — Mining and Metallurgical Engineering is the first English-language collaboration with Springer Nature.It provides a comprehensive overview of both fundamental knowledge and the latest research in the fields of mining and metallurgical science and technology and was edited by Xu Kuangdi, former president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. The book involved around 800 experts in its compilation and review.After six years, the English edition has been officially released on the Springer Link platform and has already been downloaded and used by readers from countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. The publication of the English print edition is also progressing steadily.During the event, the two parties also held a signing ceremony for collaboration on the English edition of Chinese Encyclopedia (Third Edition) — Psychology, marking a new phase in the international development of Chinese encyclopedias.Jiang Lijun, deputy chief editor of ECPH, said that she believes that encyclopedias and reference works are the foundation of discourse and narrative, facilitating communication, cultural preservation, academic progress, and cross-cultural exchange. The Encyclopedia of China is a repository of knowledge and a window for sharing China's knowledge with the world.Niels Peter Thomas, managing director of books and president of Greater China at Springer Nature, said that the launch of the mining and metallurgy book is evidence of the effective collaboration between the parties. The English edition of the Chinese Encyclopedia (Third Edition) — Psychology marks their first foray into the field of social sciences, he said, adding that he hopes future collaborations will expand into other research areas, including science, technology, humanities, and economics.Shanghai Book Mall, arguably the largest bookstore in the city, celebrated its reopening on Saturday, after a refurbishment project that kept it closed for two years.The seven-story building is home to half a million books, according to Niu Yefang, president of the Shanghai Xinhua Media Co., the parent company of the bookstore."My parents used to bring me to the book mall and let me pick the books that I wanted when I was a kid, so I decided to bring my own daughter and hope she can find the same joy of reading like I did," one customer said, as she browsed through the picture books section on the fourth floor with her 5-year-old daughter on the first day of business at the newly refurbished bookstore.Shanghai Book Mall, located on downtown's Fuzhou Road, is not just a brick-and-mortar bookstore, but is closely connected to the memories of local residents, and of great significance to the cultural life of the city, Niu told the media during a preview a day before the reopening.Fuzhou Road was one of the four main roads in downtown Shanghai leading to the Huangpu River when the city firstly opened up as an international harbor some 180 years ago. From the 1840s onward, it was dotted with bookstores and publishing houses. It is known as the "street of culture".One of the top 10 cultural landmark projects in Shanghai, the Book Mall opened at No 456 Fuzhou Road on Dec 30, 1998. The building covered a ground area of 3,713 square meters and, while the bookstore occupied the seven bottom stories, the floors above were occupied by the offices of the Shanghai Century Publishing Group Co.By 2021, the publishing house had moved to a new publishers' park in the suburban Qibao town in Minhang district, where it was provided with larger offices and new facilities. That same year, on Oct 19, the whole building was shuttered for refurbishment."It has been two long years, and the people of Shanghai have looked forward to the return of their favorite bookstore," Niu says. A bookstore is different from any other business, he says. "You might come across a book, or simply a paragraph in a book, that changes your life forever. I don't believe any other business is capable of having such a great impact."Inspired by the metaphor for books as "the lighthouse for one's life", Yu Ting, chief architect of the makeover project designed the new facade to look like the pages of a book, which will light up brightly in the evening.He also made sure to retain people's memories of the original building. A relief on the original facade had a Chinese proverb that read, "diligence is the path up the mountain of knowledge" in several different languages. That wall was partly preserved and erected in the ground floor lobby. A column in the original building was also preserved on the second floor."I hope visitors who come across it as they stroll through the bookshelves will be happily surprised," Niu says.The book retail business has gone through drastic changes since the opening of Shanghai Book Mall in 1998. At that time, it was known as one of the largest centers for the publication, distribution and retail of books not only in China, but also in the whole of the Far East.The book mall covered a business area of more than 10,000 sq m, is said to have housed so many titles that the number was equivalent to that of the total number of books published in China over a two-year period."You could find a lot of books that are not available in other bookstores," Niu recalls. The large mall, unprecedented in China at the time, equipped with the latest computerized search system changed the widely accepted national perception of bookstores, which were usually street-side shops of about 100 sq m. "Quite a few other cities followed suit and built their own large-scale bookstores with similar structures and business models as Shanghai Book Mall."Now that the internet has fundamentally changed people's reading habits and book-buying behavior, brick-and-mortar bookstores are in urgent need of making changes.Niu believes an important mission of the bookstore is to initiate new connections between books and readers, through interpersonal communications and in-person events.As part of the refurbishment, the architect had part of the ceilings on the third and fifth floor removed to open up two vertical halls that can host chamber concerts, mini-theater performances and other events. The high open halls also invite natural light into the mall.The Writer's Study on the second floor was designed to bring writers closer to readers. Every three months a new writer will be featured in this section, where their creations are showcased alongside a selection of books that either have given them inspiration, or they have enjoyed reading and want to share with others. Reading events and book launches will also be held there.On the seventh floor, a new Shanghai Illustration Art Center has opened with the inaugural exhibition named Hello, Shanghai, featuring work by Norwegian illustrators Mari Kanstad Johnsen, Bjorn Rune Lie, and Kristin Roskifte, who participated in a 17-day artists' residency program organized by Magikon Publishing from Norway and Shanghai International Children's Book Fair in 2019.During their stay, the three artists immersed themselves, as keen observers, into Shanghai, uncovering its distinctive allure and documenting their experiences.Being exhibited are paintings showing their perception of Shanghai as a global metropolis, as well as a hub of diverse cultures in an ever-evolving world.The 10th edition of the China Shanghai International Children's Book Fair will take place at the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition & Conference Center from Nov 17-19.The fair will be open to public on Nov 18 and 19.One of the biggest book fairs in the Asia Pacific, the event will showcase 30,000 books for children aged from 0 to 16.This year's fair will span 25,000 square meters and feature 478 exhibitors from 25 countries and regions. About 200 reading events, lectures, workshops will be held during the fair period.About 45,000 people are expected to visit the fair, which will for the first time have a special section dedicated to international collaboration and copyright trading between professional visitors.The 40th International Istanbul Book Fair kicked off on Saturday in Turkiye, featuring a Chinese book fair as one of its integral components.The Chinese book fair is held by China Education Publishing Import & Export Cooperation. The Chinese publishing delegation is comprised of 32 representatives from 14 publishing units based in Beijing, Shanghai, Henan and Sichuan provinces, and other regions. They have brought along 1,283 varieties and 1,442 high-quality books for the exhibition.On Saturday, the Chinese publishing delegation hosted a Sino-Turkish Copyright Exchange Symposium. During the event, both sides presented their publications, fostering a deeper mutual understanding between Chinese and Turkish publishing houses and facilitating copyright transactions within the Sino-Turkish publishing sector.On Monday, a Sino-Turkish Publishing Cooperation Forum took place, where guests from both nations engaged in a wide-ranging dialogue concerning the collaborative publication of Sino-Turkish literary works.Chinese writers Liu Zhenyun and Liang Hong met readers at a book promotion event in London on Oct 18, following the recent publication of English versions of their works One Day, Three Autumns and The Sacred Clan.China Daily interviewed the writers and an editor of One Day, Three Autumns in London to learn their thoughts on the books and tales from their journey around the UK.Video by Han Jing and He Xiating.The event "Writing China – Roundtable with Five Renowned Chinese Authors" was held at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Britain, on Oct 22nd.Li Liyan, minister counselor for cultural affairs at China's embassy in London, Tian Peng, first-level inspector of Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Alan Cummings, head of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at the School of Oriental and African Studies (University of London), representatives of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles including authors such as Li Er, Xu Zechen, Qiao Ye, Zhou Xiaofeng and Zhou Min, British Sinologist Jack Hargreaves, as well as local readers attended the event.Li Liyan said that both China and the UK boast rich literary traditions, profound histories, and vibrant cultures. Literature plays an essential role in deepening cultural exchanges and fostering mutual understanding between the two nations. He hoped that more outstanding literary works by Chinese authors would be shared abroad, allowing foreign readers to gain a better understanding and insight into China.An old books market is opened by the Zhapu Road Bridge over the Suzhou Creek from Oct 24 to 29."Vintage books, signed books and rare books that are no longer in print are our specialties," said Jin Minsheng, vice president of Shanghai Books Co Ltd, a leading trader of used books in Shanghai of over 70 years history.At lunch hour on Tuesday, the first day of the market event, enthusiastic readers crowded under the sales tent, waiting in line to make payment."The outdoor book sellers by the Seine has long been a unique tourism attraction in Paris of France, and we hope to introduce a similar experience to the city of Shanghai," Jin said.Shanghai was the birth place of China's publishing and print industries in the 20th century, and an important center for the trading of vintage and rare books. "We hope this outdoor market event could bring people closer to the cultural heritage of the city, as they browse old books in the pleasant autumn sunlight," Jin said.This is the second market event the company held by the Suzhou Creek this year. More than 9,000 copies of books were sold at the first event, despite of rainy weather.Two symposiums on Chinese literature translation during a group of Beijing authors' visit to Cambridge was held at the Cambridge University Library and the Needham Research Institute Library, Britain, on Oct 21.First-level inspector of Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles Tian Peng, general manager of China National Publications Import and Export (Group) Corp Lin Liying, representatives of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles including authors such as Li Er, Xu Zechen, Qiao Ye, Zhou Xiaofeng, Zhou Min, gathered with local renowned experts and scholars such as sinologists David McMullen and Charles Aylmer, head of Chinese Department of Cambridge University Library He Yan, director of the Needham Research Institute Mei Jianjun, and librarian of the East Asian History of Science Library at the Needham Research Institute John Moffett, to discuss the exchange and dissemination of Chinese literature.According to Lin Liying, the corporation has had a strategic partnership with the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles for four years. The two have successfully created several cultural brands such as "Beijing Author Day," promoting Beijing literature internationally. The corporation has had decades of friendly trade cooperation with Cambridge University Library.The event "Reading China: International Exchanges on Beijing Literature" was held at the NIO Innovation Center in Berlin, Germany, on Oct 20.First-level inspector of Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles Tian Peng, representatives of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles including authors such as Li Er, Xu Zechen, Qiao Ye, Zhou Xiaofeng, Zhou Min, Chinese director of the Confucius Institute at the Free University of Berlin Pan Lu, professor from the Free University of Berlin Andreas Guder, German translators Daniel Fastner and Anike Müller, as well as local readers attended the event.The Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Beijing Lao She Literature Academy presented Collected Works of Lao She and works of Beijing literature to the library of the Free University of Berlin.At the recent 81st World Science Fiction Convention in Chengdu, Liu Cixin, author of The Three-Body Problem trilogy, said in a speech that science fiction has always been human's imagination and exploration of the future. It is the first time that Worldcon was held in China."It's an important event for Chinese science fiction, showing that our sci-fi has gained the world's attention," he says."Sci-fi allows us to break the limits of reality and see the world from a completely new angle."For example, the stunning galaxy might be seen as a piece of artwork created by an unknown force, he said at the Another Planet Science Fiction Convention held in Shanghai in late September.In 1818, English writer Mary Shelly created the world's first sci-fi novel Frankenstein, inspired by the discovery of bioelectricity at the end of the 18th century and related experiments later. Since its birth, science fiction has offered a great space for people to reflect on the relationship between humanity and the progress of science and technology.In 2023, artificial intelligence has made groundbreaking progress in fields such as image generation, video synthesis, and semantic recognition. The "other" that has always been discussed in science fiction has for the first time really impacted human society.Never before has it been like today when, confronted with such breakthroughs, people have to question: Will I be replaced by AI at work? How soon will that day arrive?At the APSFC in Shanghai, some 50 top Chinese quantum physicists, astronomers, musicians, writers, computer scientists, cancer specialists, aerospace engineers, professors of Chinese literature and journalism, and editors from publishing houses gathered to discuss interesting questions at different forums attended by hundreds of sci-fi fans."All people who care about the relationship between humanity and technology and its changes are sci-fi fans for me. In the past several years, we have paid more attention to technology, but now when all people's attention is cast toward technology, we want to invite you to look more at people to rediscover humanity," says Ji Shaoting, head of Future Affairs Administration, a company that deals with sci-fi publication, consulting and filmmaking."Creativity always seems to be the last frontier where humans can confidently face up to machines, but now will this unique capability that we are proud of also be replaced? My only answer is to create, not repeat works gained through big-data analysis, perfunctorily or following the trend, but genuine creative works," Ji says.In 2023, although AI has yet to begin creating works, the quality and quantity of those made by people have declined because they choose to safely repeat existing models rather than innovating, Ji says, but meanwhile, such adventures as The Wandering Earth II and Barbie have gained rewarding revenues.When asked whether humans will eventually be replaced by machines, even in the areas of art, Liu says that it is a natural technological and historical trend, but people need to see this future with a peaceful mind: what if, having inherited human's creativity, AI will create art that is superior to ours."From a sci-fi angle, AI might create a stronger civilization, which can expand in the universe and create more glorious technological achievements," Liu says."If there is one thing that cannot be replaced by machines, it will be our enjoyment of life. We used to think artistic creation would be the last thing to be replaced by AI, but now it is the first. Now we find that the work we think is low-skilled might be difficult to replace because of the underdeveloped hardware," he says.When asked about his latest work, Liu says that he is proud to say that he belongs to the last generation of writers who write themselves."In the future people will always question how much of the work you actually write or whether you really write at all," Liu says.Sci-fi writer He Xi says that, although AI can replace people in many aspects, we cannot allow it to make important decisions that involve significant sacrifice, like in self-driving systems or determining whether a person is guilty or not.Although AI cannot replace us in science fiction writing at the moment, sci-fi writer Wang Jinkang says that, in the future, we must learn to live with a more powerful uncontrollable intelligence.Sci-fi writer Tang Fei disagrees. "Human's creation comes from a natural impulse, a most profound instinct of writers, and the urgency to survive, which can never be replaced by AI because it doesn't have the impulse and it doesn't die," she says."What AI can do in the future has already been done by human copycats, by the way," she adds."We don't need to worry that machines will snap up our work in the future, but how we can better serve the machine, because in the future most people's work will be providing services to machines," she says.Jiang Yuhui, professor of philosophy from East China Normal University, considers the question in another way."The development of AI will result in unemployment on a large scale, which will not only be a philosophical or technological issue, but also a social, ethical and political issue. We should care more about those who are to be replaced," he says.Liu Cixin, author of The Three-Body Problem trilogy, recently said at the 81st World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, in Chengdu, Sichuan province, that the golden age for China's sci-fi is yet to arrive, but it will come along with the advancement of time. China Daily interviewed the Hugo-award winner before the Worldcon, at the Another Planet Science Fiction Convention in Shanghai in late September. Here is what Liu says about the development of Chinese sci-fi and his writing since 2015, when he won the top award for a sci-fi novel.Over the past eight years, what has been the development status and trends of Chinese sci-fi literature since you won the Hugo Award?The most significant change is that sci-fi literature in China is no longer a marginal existence. It has gained attention from the general public and the media. It has come into the spotlight from a niche presence, which is its most significant change.However, science fiction still needs further development. For example, the reader base, the quantity of influential authors and works are all lacking. So, it still has a significant potential for growth.How will Chinese sci-fi develop further?Sci-fi is driven by the broader societal context. Our society must maintain rapid development and technological progress. Rapid progress of society and technology will create an environment filled with a sense of the future, making the future highly appealing. Fundamentally, the development of sci-fi depends on that of the era.Today, many technologies are advancing rapidly. Is this era making it more difficult or easier for sci-fi writers to create?More difficult. Sci-fi is built upon a sense of wonder and estrangement from science. Now, science and technology have gradually penetrated our lives and are changing our reality. As a result, sci-fi has lost some of its original sense of wonder, making it a significant challenge for writers. Of course, sci-fi writers are trying to attract readers not by relying on the wonder of science, but by exploring different literary techniques and tapping into the potential to reflect reality. However, to be honest, the results of these efforts have not been too ideal.Have you recently read any works, sci-fi or regular literature, that excited you?To be honest, no.What are your thoughts on the World Science Fiction Convention held in China?It's an important event for Chinese science fiction. Its presence in China means that Chinese sci-fi has gained global attention. This event can promote the communication between Chinese and global sci-fi authors and readers.It also allows many foreign authors, critics, and common sci-fi fans who may know little about China to experience the environment in which Chinese sci-fi has developed and gain a deeper understanding of it.In our previous interview, you mentioned that you run 10,000 meters a day and swim several times a week. You also mentioned that your goal was to personally visit space when space travel becomes more affordable. Are you still adhering to this routine?I am still maintaining my exercise routine, but the prospects of space travel have become more complex.In the past, if you were an ordinary person going into space, you would have had some fun. But now, if I were to be one of the first people to go into space, it would become news. I don't want to be in the spotlight. Recent projects like Virgin's spaceflight program claim to take people into space, but you only get about 40 seconds to feel weightless, and it costs $200,000. Yeah, I still have the chance to go, but no, I don't want to become news.I continue to exercise regularly, but it has mostly become a habit. Just as it's not easy to maintain an exercise routine, it's equally challenging to stop. Chinese writers, Liu Zhenyun and Liang Hong, met readers in London's Chinatown on Wednesday, following the recent publication of English versions of their works One day, Three autumns and The Sacred Clan in the UK.Liu's book One day, Three Autumns was first published in Chinese in 2021, and its English version was published by ACA Publishing Ltd this year. ACA focuses on translated versions of Chinese literature.The book tells the life of people in Yanjin, Henan province, which is Liu's real-life hometown.People in the county are terrorized by a forsaken spirit called Hua Erniang, who has been waiting for her husband for 3,000 years. She will run into people's dreams and demand a joke. If she was amused by the joke, she will give them a persimmon; if not, they will be crushed by her jilted heart which has calcified into a mountain. The book is found as humorous as Liu's other works.Humor has been a distinctive feature of Liu's language and works, which are sometimes seen as hard to translate and be understood by readers in other cultures."Readers always say that they can see humor in my novels, but this kind of humor is actually the humor that grows out of the relationships between characters, rather than the humor in language. They should be easily translated and be understood by readers from different cultures and countries," said Liu, who is one of China's most well-known writers.He has penned highly acclaimed works, including Someone to Talk To, Remembering 1942, and I Did Not Kill My Husband, and won Mao Dun Literature Prize in 2011 for his book Someone to Talk To. In 2018, he was awarded the Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters by France's Ministry of Culture.David Lammie, senior editor of Sinoist Books under ACA, agreed, saying that "situational humor, the characters and the difficult situations they get into, for example, black humor -- these translate quite easily. What doesn't translate easily is play on words, puns, little jokes in dialogue. That's more difficult because having to explain a joke means the joke is no longer funny.""Within tragedy is comedy, within comedy is sorrow," said Liu. "The humor, in essence, can be understood by different countries easily and quickly."Liu's works have been translated into more than 20 languages including English, French and German."Without translations of these books, I might feel like a tourist in a foreign country. But with translated versions, readers feel familiar to you because of the characters in the books, you become closer to each other because of the common friends in the books," Liu said."Literature is also the fastest and cheapest way for readers to get familiar with a country, its past, present and future," he continued. "They can get the details about how Chinese people think, laugh and cry, and even the dust in their wrinkle."Liu also shared an encounter with a foreign reader. "I met a lady in Amsterdam, Netherlands. She said that the image she got from some Western media was that Chinese people had blank faces and were empty-headed. But after reading my book I Did Not Kill My Husband, she found out that the Chinese could be so humorous and even respectful."CHENGDU -- Chinese sci-fi writers and artists had a rewarding night at this year's Hugo Awards.Hai Ya took away the Best Novelette award for "The Space-Time Painter" while well-known computer graphics artist Zhao Enzhe won the Best Professional Artist award."I'm pleasantly surprised and very lucky, it's like my dream come into reality," said Hai Ya, who started writing science fiction when he was a university student.Zhao has been engaged in the gaming industry for over 20 years and has developed a strong interest in sci-fi-themed creation. He is a longtime cover artist for Science Fiction World magazine, which has a bigger circulation than any other sci-fi publication in the world.The results were announced at a formal ceremony at the 81st World Science Fiction Convention currently underway in Chengdu, the capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province."Of course, I'm very happy to have such an opportunity and a platform to show myself, but I think it is the step-by-step promotion of the predecessors of Chinese science fiction that gives me such an opportunity. In the future, I will work harder to promote the progress of science fiction art in China," Zhao said in an interview after the ceremony.In addition to the laureates, many categories under this year's Hugo Awards also saw the names of Chinese authors.Four works by Chinese writers shortlisted for the Best Short Stories; "Chinese Science Fiction, An Oral History, Volume 1" was shortlisted for the Hugo Awards for Best Related Work while Yao Haijun, the interviewee of "Chinese Science Fiction, An Oral History, Volume 1" and Yang Feng, the editor-in-chief of the book, were also shortlisted for the Hugo Awards for Best Editor (Long Form).The Hugo Awards, first presented in 1953 and presented annually since 1955, are science fiction's prestigious awards. The Hugo Awards are voted on by members of the World Science Fiction Convention, which is also responsible for administering them.This year, a total of 1,847 valid nominating ballots were received and counted from members of the 2022 and 2023 World Science Fiction Conventions for the 2023 Hugo Awards.The World Science Fiction Convention has taken place annually since 1939 (except during WWII from 1942 to 1945). It is the first time for the world's largest and longest-running sci-fi gathering to come to China.The 12th Huzhou Writing Brush Culture Festival announced its opening in Huzhou, Zhejiang on Friday, showcasing the unique cultural charm of the medium.The writing brush produced in Huzhou, along with Huimo (rice paper), and the Duan inkstone, are collectively known as the "Four Treasures of the Study". The Huzhou brush originated from Shanlian town in Nanxun district of Huzhou city. The production process involves over 120 steps, earning praise such as "the brush tip craftsmanship is unparalleled, and the writing brush made of brownish rabbit hair is as precious as gold".At the national-level intangible cultural heritage productive protection base, Shanlian Huzhou Writing Brush Factory, brush artisan Wang Xiaohua has deeply felt the changes over the years, saying: "Building upon the protection and inheritance of traditional craftsmanship, they have trained a group of young people through mentorship, opened various research courses, and introduced brush-making techniques into local primary and secondary school classrooms."According to the latest data provided by the Huzhou Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology, currently, Huzhou writing brushes hold approximately 30% of the national market share, with a market share of about 60% in the high-end writing brush market.In recent years, Huzhou has been vigorously promoting integrated development in areas such as "Brush + Digital", "Brush + Cultural Tourism" and "Brush + Cultural Innovation". The city has enacted the Regulations on the Protection and Development of Huzhou Writing Brushes, established high-standard brush-themed towns, brush workshops, and other public service platforms, and formulated local brush standards.Walking through the streets of Huzhou, one will often come across quaint brush shops. Established in 1741 in Wang Yi Pin Zhai brush shop on Aishan street, Wuxing district, the shop offers over 500 styles of Huzhou writing brushes, showcasing a wide variety of products. Shop owner Xu Jianfeng introduced that in recent years, traditional Huzhou brush brands have been trying to innovate, entering the view of young people through brand collaborations and cross-border partnerships, and even exporting to multiple countries such as Japan, Singapore and Malaysia.When 19-year-old Li Shujin was a child, she often played near a pagoda close to her home, although she could never enter as it was closed. Anyi Pagoda earned its name due to its location in Anyi subdistrict of Yuncheng, Shanxi province.This year, she had the chance to reconnect with her old "friend" and discovered its official name is Taiping Xingguo Temple Pagoda, which dates back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279).Li entered the pagoda for the first time, not as a child, but as a census taker responsible for documenting various details about this cultural heritage site."When I stared at the exquisite statues and carvings in the pagoda, I was overwhelmed with an eagerness to protect them well in the future," says Li.That was one of her experiences during the summer vacation when she was engaged with the fourth national census of cultural relics in China. She was a member of the census team visiting heritage sites in her hometown in Yanhu district of Yuncheng and recording their details.This was no accident. Li's opportunity was arranged by Shanxi University, along with 200 of her schoolmates. They were enrolled in the major of cultural relics, designed to cultivate students as grassroots heritage custodians for their local communities.Once a pivotal inland transport hub along the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, the capital is now making great strides in protecting, inheriting and utilizing the cultural significance and historical legacy associated with the Grand Canal.Wang Youquan, director of the archaeology division at the Beijing Cultural Heritage Bureau, stated that the essence of protecting the Grand Canal's heritage is led by core world heritage sites, with an emphasis on overall and regional protection and utilization."The construction of the Grand Canal cultural belt and the national cultural park provide a solid foundation for the authenticity and integrity protection of world cultural heritage," he said.Statistics show that since 2020, the Beijing Cultural Relics Bureau has organized 669 archaeological exploration projects along the Grand Canal in seven districts of the capital. These cover an area of approximately 47.54 million square meters. Three hundred and eleven excavation projects have been conducted, with an excavation area of about 32.1 million sq m.Beijing has conducted important archaeological surveys and excavations in key sections of the Grand Canal, focusing on waterways, hydraulic relics and ancillary facilities.For instance, in 2023, Beijing excavated southeastern relics within the ancient city site of Luxian county, covering an area of 1,500 sq m; and the foundation of Danbo Ningjing, a historical site in Beijing's Yuanmingyuan Park, revealed an architectural structure that was associated with farming, which is important for studying rice cultivation, planting, and farming techniques during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).Preservation of historical landmarks, such as the Central Axis and Forbidden City, now recognized as crucial to the growth of Beijing's tourismThe recent inclusion of the Beijing Central Axis into the UNESCO World Heritage List has ignited a new wave of enthusiasm for cultural heritage citywide, creating a conducive environment for the preservation, protection and promotion of heritage sites."Such world cultural heritage is China's cultural landmark and spiritual hallmark, providing a valuable resource for building China into a strong cultural nation, promoting mutual learning among and exchanges of civilizations, and demonstrating confidence in Chinese culture," said Song Haojie, deputy head of the Beijing Cultural Heritage Bureau.They stand as important pillars for promoting the overall protection of Beijing's old city areas, and the construction and protection of the city's three major cultural belts, revolving around the Grand Canal, the Great Wall, and the Western Hills and Yongding River, he added.Currently, Beijing ranks top among cities worldwide by number of World Heritage Sites. With the latest addition of the Central Axis, the city is now home to eight World Heritage Sites, which are distributed across districts such as Dongcheng, Xicheng, Haidian, Tongzhou, Yanqing, Changping and Fangshan.As the jewel in the crown of Beijing's treasure trove of cultural and tourism resources, the eight World Heritage Sites include the city's iconic sites.Among them is the Forbidden City, which was included in the World Heritage List in 1987. One of the world's largest and best-preserved wooden structures, it served as the imperial palace for 24 emperors during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties and is acclaimed as one of the world's top five palaces.The Great Wall, a wide-reaching ancient defense project, and the Peking Man Site at Zhoukoudian were also inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1987.The lesser-known Zhoukoudian Peking Man Site is located in Zhoukoudian town of Fangshan district, southwest of Beijing. It is one of the richest, most systematic and valuable human sites from the early Paleolithic era in the world. Discoveries there in the 1920s became an archaeological sensation that shocked the world.The Summer Palace and the Temple of Heaven are among the must-visit sites in a typical tourist itinerary in Beijing. Both were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1998.The Ming Tombs, a grand complex of mausoleums for 13 of the Ming Dynasty emperors, and the Grand Canal, the world's oldest canal, which starts from Beijing in the north and passes through 27 cities in eight provinces and municipalities in its 2,700-kilometer span, joined the ranks of World Heritage Sites in 2003 and 2014 respectively.With a wealth of cultural heritage, Beijing has developed mature practices and rules for the protection, management, and development of these classic cultural assets.Behind the success is the unfailing support of the city's policymakers for the preservation and administration of cultural heritage, Song said.The city government and the Beijing Committee of the Communist Party of China highly value cultural heritage and have rolled out a series of policies and regulations, providing a guarantee for the protection and management of the world heritage sites, he said.Song also emphasized a holistic approach that Beijing takes in heritage preservation. "These World Heritage Sites are not isolated," he said.In 2022, the bureau cooperated with various institutions to found the Beijing Alliance of World Heritage Conservation, which is committed to strengthening the overall capacity, creating the cultural brand of "World Heritage in Beijing", and building a community of shared heritage protection responsibilities.As an international hub, Beijing is rich in international exchange resources. By engaging in cultural exchanges and cooperation with international organizations and other countries, Beijing can contribute solutions and expand the influence of its World Cultural Heritage Sites, Song said.Riding the wave of renewed public interest, the Beijing Cultural Heritage Bureau continues to delve into the city's world heritage, and take action to increase the preservation awareness of the public and promote the heritage sites' integration into residents' daily lives, according to Song.The efforts include popularizing the world heritage sites at campuses and in residential communities, promoting the integration of heritage into tourism and encouraging more nongovernmental organizations and individuals to take part in preservation and inheritance of the heritage, he added.Next year, the bureau plans to give full play to the 40th anniversary celebration of China's accession into the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage in 1985 in a bid to attract wider participation of the public.The world cultural heritage's systematic and overall preservation provides a fundamental guarantee for the inheritance and continuation of Beijing culture, as it serves as an important carrier of local and traditional Chinese culture, Song said. "It is also an inherent driving force for enhancing the cultural identity of the people and injecting rich cultural connotations into the overall renewal of Beijing."The interaction between the holistic preservation of cultural heritage and urban renewal is of significance to promoting the overall sustainable development of Beijing."The Chinese Archaeological Museum celebrated its first anniversary of opening to the public with a series of activities in Beijing on Saturday.According to statistics from the museum, during the past year, it has devoted itself to popularizing archaeological progress in China by organizing more than 30 lectures to the public and over 3,200 professionals explaining its artifacts during exhibitions. Moreover, it has received more than 400,000 visits.A new themed exhibition, Million Years of Human History, kicked off on the same day at the museum, showcasing relics of Nihewan sites group in Yangyuan county, Hebei province, and Xuetangliangzi Site in Shiyan, Hubei province, as two keys to understand the earliest periods of humans' cultural and historical development.Nihewan sites group has yielded discoveries of more than 300 sites dating back about 1.76 million years to 10,000 years in North China. Three complete human skull fossils have been unearthed from Xuetangliangzi Site from about 1 million years ago, which prove a million years of human history in China.A seminar on archaeology and tracing the origins of the Chinese civilization was also held, bringing together scholars to share the latest progress in the field.In the past, historical accounts of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, a Communist-led guerrilla force during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45), were mainly recorded in archives and documents, prompting researchers to seek more tangible evidence.The excavation of the first anti-Japanese guerrilla base established by the Communist Party of China in the northeastern region — Hongshilazi — has provided archaeological discoveries to enhance the study of the history.Located 20 kilometers west of Panshi city in Northeast China's Jilin province, the Hongshilazi Site, spanning about 32 square kilometers, served as a crucial base to resist Japanese aggression, and today provides remnants, such as barracks, outposts, defensive fortifications and military training grounds."The study of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army used to face the challenge of being 'historically untraceable'," says Meng Qingxu, leader of the Hongshilazi Site's excavation team. "In recent years, the archaeological work at the site has provided detailed materials to prove the 14-year history of the guerrilla force's resistance."For 14 years, soldiers of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army waged an arduous struggle against the Japanese militarist aggressors.The Sept 18 Incident in 1931, when the Japanese invaders triggered an explosion on a section of a railway owned by a Japanese company near Shenyang, Liaoning province, and falsely accused Chinese troops of sabotage, marked the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. The Japanese invaders occupied Northeast China in the following months and the "Manchukuo" puppet regime was established.The Hongshilazi Site is widely considered the largest and among the most significant complexes commemorating Chinese people's strong resistance against the Japanese invaders in Northeast China, as it was one of the earliest anti-Japanese aggression bases under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The resistance preceded the nationwide full-scale war that ultimately culminated in victory for China.At the Hongshilazi guerrilla base, excavation teams from the Jilin Provincial Institute of Archaeology have found more than 3,300 war remnants that have shed new light on the battlefields. Designated as the eighth batch of national key cultural relic protection units by the State Council in 2019, the site was shortlisted for the country's top 10 archaeological discoveries for 2023.The discoveries at the Hongshilazi Site have been showcased in various museums within and outside Jilin, attracting more than 700,000 visitors so far."Closely intertwining with the history of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, the items selected have unveiled a vivid story at the Hongshilazi Site," says Li Qiuhong, director of the Panshi Museum, also known as the Panshi Memorial Hall for the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.The importance of such an exhibition is that it not only protects revolutionary relics, but also delves into the essence behind them, Liu adds.To better protect, manage and utilize the discoveries at the sites and illuminate the war and its legacy, a meeting highlighting the cultural relics related to the period in Northeast China was held in Panshi early this month.Officials from central and local government departments and experts from cultural relics institutes discussed how to enhance heritage protection and utilization to improve remembrance and education.By the end of last year, a total of 608 sites related to the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, 24 commemorative venues and about 100,000 items of cultural relics had been documented and registered nationwide, according to statistics from the National Cultural Heritage Administration.At his speech addressing the meeting, Li Qun, director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, called for concerted efforts to deepen the exploration of the value of these relics, and coordinate the planning and orderly progress of archaeological surveys and excavations of the sites.To mark the 80th anniversary of the Chinese people's victory in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the end of World War II, which will fall in 2025, the National Cultural Heritage Administration, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Finance issued a three-year plan last year to conduct a thorough census of the relics and artifacts during the period."Spreading the 5,000-year Chinese civilization", a new media joint promotion activity, organized by Shenyang's culture, tourism, radio and television bureau, kicked off recently.The activity aims to encourage people to record their visits to museums, especially the ongoing one about Hongshan and Liangzhu cultures at the Shenyang Museum in Liaoning province.Starting in June, the exhibition, named The Light of Civilization: Hongshan, Liangzhu, and Chinese Civilization, offers cultural relics from Hongshan Culture, a key Neolithic culture that existed between 6,500 and 5,000 years ago in northern China and Liangzhu Culture, another important Neolithic culture from 5,300 to 4,300 years ago in the Yangtze River Delta, both of which played important roles in the origins and formation of Chinese civilization.The activity encourages various forms of cultural creativity and innovative works, primarily in the form of short videos or images and texts, to be published on six major new media platforms, including Douyin, Kuaishou, Xiaohongshu, Bilibili, Sina Weibo, and WeChat channel about the exhibition. Multiple awards will be selected then based on the creativity, quality, views, and interaction of the works.According to officials from Shenyang's culture, tourism, radio and television bureau, by deeply exploring and showcasing the essence and contemporary value of the exhibition, it vividly demonstrates the splendid achievements and unique charm of China's 5,000 years of civilization, stimulates the cultural innovation and creativity of the whole society, and thus promotes spread of culture and inheritance of civilization.Among the skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, 13 ancient Buddhist pagodas still stand in various corners of Shanghai, quietly testifying to its long history and rich cultural heritage.A Towering Treasure House: Relics of the Yuanying Pagoda in Shanghai, an ongoing exhibition at Shanghai Museum East, features a large collection of artifacts unearthed from Yuanying Pagoda in the suburban Songjiang district, the tallest and one of the most important.Yuanying Pagoda, also known as Xilin Pagoda and Chong'en Pagoda, is a seven-level octagon tower built in 1388 made of wood and bricks that stands 47 meters tall.Thirty years ago, the pagoda went through a major architectural restoration and archaeological exploration when more than 1,000 artifacts were unearthed from the treasure vase at its top and its heavenly palace one level below and underground palace.These objects date from the 6th century to the late 1800s. The amount and diversity of the findings drew much attention to China's archaeological scene at the time.The artifacts "reflected the historical position and unique charm of Jiangnan (south of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River) culture in terms of craftsmanship, philosophical insights and humanistic features, providing invaluable evidence of urban development, cultural vibrancy and the refined lifestyles of ancient Shanghai," according to Chen Jie, deputy director of Shanghai Museum.Shanghai Museum selected more than 300 pieces to create the exhibition, divided into three sections. The first section recounts the restoration and archaeological exploration in the 1990s, with a lighting installation on the wall illustrating the structure of the pagoda. The inscription on a stone stele documents the history of the pagoda, from its construction to its relocation in 1444. It was after its relocation that the underground palace was opened, with Buddhist statues in gold and silver and Buddhist relics placed in and re-sealed until the 1990s.Forum highlights remarkable progress in conserving cave temples, report Wang Ru in Dunhuang, Gansu province, and Ma Jingna in Lanzhou.In mysterious caves or on steep cliffs, people can view marvelous Buddhist statues appearing to serenely survey all life, while delicate murals often portray Buddhist sutras. Together, they form cave temples — a special cultural landscape embodying the reverence of ancient people for divine blessings.China boasts many dazzling cave temples, including the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, Gansu province; Dazu Rock Carvings in Chongqing; the Longmen Grottoes in Henan province; and the Yungang Grottoes in Shanxi province — all UNESCO World Heritage Sites.Through more than seven decades of efforts, the major risks of China's important cave temples have been eradicated, says Guan Qiang, deputy director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration at the 2024 International Forum on Cave Temple Conservation."We have achieved remarkable progress in exploring the protection and restoration of cave temples, consolidation of supporting mountains, management of the surrounding environment, digital preservation and monitoring. … Our ability to protect cave temples has significantly improved," he adds.The 16th Sun Tzu Cultural Tourism Festival and the 2024 Yellow River Estuary (Guangrao) Sun Tzu Cultural Forum were recently held in Guangrao county, Dongying in East China's Shandong province, the birthplace of the Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu.Experts, international scholars, representatives from institutions related to Sun Tzu studies, and enthusiasts gathered at these two cultural events to explore the contemporary relevance of Sun Tzu's cultural heritage.As the hometown of Sun Tzu, Dongying is committed to playing an active role in preserving and promoting his cultural legacy. Through continuing research and interpretation on Sun Tzu, including scholarly discussions and related projects, over 30 academic works have been published, such as New Theories on Sun Tzu and The Global Spread and Application of The Art of War.Currently, Sun Tzu's influence is markedly visible across a range of settings in Dongying. His quotes, portraits and biographical elements are prominently featured in museums, libraries and theaters, as well as throughout urban areas.This extensive presence underscores the deep integration of Sun Tzu's cultural heritage into the daily lives of Dongying residents, reflecting its profound and pervasive impact on the community.According to the local education bureau, Dongying is advancing the incorporation of Sun Tzu culture into the city's educational system by establishing enriching academic environments and integrating cultural elements into the curriculum.Additionally, the city is implementing a comprehensive aesthetic education initiative, developing art courses, and partnering with the Sun Tzu Cultural Park for educational field trips."Through these efforts, Dongying aims to continuously refine its educational programs, thereby strengthening the 'Hometown of Sun Tzu' educational branding," said a bureau member.To preserve and perpetuate Sun Tzu culture effectively, Dongying is integrating cultural promotion with tourism development.In Dongying's Guangrao county, the Sun Tzu Cultural Park is enhancing its offerings by upgrading leisure, shopping and immersive experiences. This strategic approach seamlessly connects tourist attractions, cultural highlights and commercial areas, and turns Sun Tzu's historical and cultural resources into a vibrant driver of cultural tourism.Sun Tzu, a distinguished military theorist and strategist from the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC), is best known for his seminal work, The Art of War. As an iconic historical and military figure, his strategies have had a profound influence on both Western and Eastern philosophies and military practices.Looking ahead, Dongying aims to deepen Sun Tzu's cultural preservation while positioning itself as a global bridge, enhance its role in international dialogues on culture, and foster a broader appreciation of Sun Tzu's legacy.Glassware, invented in Mesopotamia and with a history spanning at least 4,000 years, remained a luxury accessible to the few until the invention of glass-blowing.Following the conquest of the Northern Liang Kingdom by Emperor Taiwu of the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534) in 439, the Oasis Silk Road was reopened having previously been obstructed by warfare. This reopening fostered cultural exchange between the East and West, bringing prosperity to the Northern Wei capital Pingcheng, present-day Datong in North China's Shanxi province.During this period, glassware and glassmaking techniques were also introduced to Pingcheng.The ancient document indicates that merchants from the Greater Yuezhi brought these glassmaking techniques to Pingcheng. Local production of glassware became feasible with the integration of quartz mineral in Pingcheng and Central Asian glassmaking crafts.The blue glassware pieces unearthed in Datong mark a departure from earlier local glassware, featuring a soda lime composition and vessel forms similar to those in Pingcheng during the Northern Wei Dynasty. This suggests that they were produced locally in Pingcheng, combining local raw materials with foreign techniques. Some of these blue glassware pieces also show evidence of the glassblowing technique introduced to China by Central Asian artisans.By merging Central Asian craftsmanship with local resources and unique vessel forms, these distinctive Northern Wei glassware pieces from Pingcheng highlight the cultural interactions facilitated by the Silk Road.Check out the video to discover the blue glassware from Pingcheng that has lasted for thousands of years.At the Cultural Heritage Conservation Forum, themed "Shared Heritage, Shared Future", held in Malaysia on Sept 5, Deputy Director of Hong Kong Palace Museum, Daisy Wang Yiyou, said it's important to let the general public know more about cultural heritage protection so that we can all work together.The Baba Nyonya, or Peranakan Chinese, have preserved distinct culinary traditions from both Malaysia and China, serving as key witnesses to cultural integration, Ronald Gan, president of Persatuan Peranakan Baba Nyonya Malaysia, said at the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Malaysia on Thursday.During the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Malaysia, Michael Yeoh, the president of the KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific, said that cultural heritage preservation is a significant challenge amid rapid global growth and development. He stressed the need for China and ASEAN to strengthen cultural cooperation and exchanges.At the Cultural Heritage Conservation Forum, themed "Shared Heritage, Shared Future", held in Malaysia on Sept 5, Su Junjie, director of Yunnan Provincial Research Base of Intangible Cultural Heritage, pointed out breaking the boundaries of heritage categories may bring possibilities for shared world heritage.Following the successful inscription of Beijing's Central Axis onto the UNESCO World Heritage List, international students from Beijing International Studies University embarked on a cultural study tour to explore this historic area. What features are on Beijing's Central Axis anyway? Let's join the students as they explore Beijing's rich cultural heritage and architectural brilliance!Chin Yew Sin, president of the Oriental Culture Research Centre, urged Asian countries to cooperate in protecting Asia's rich culture and heritage. He said, unlike the Western society advocating individualism, Asian countries have commonalities in collectivism, which serves as the basis for cooperation in protecting cultural heritage.At the Cultural Heritage Conservation Forum, themed "Shared Heritage, Shared Future", held in Malaysia on Sept 5, Ivan Anthony Hernares, chairperson of the Southeast Asian Cultural Heritage Alliance and commissioner of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, said Southeast Asia lacks transboundary world heritage sites, highlighting the potential for shared maritime heritage nominations among its coastal nations.The development of civilization should not only focus on infrastructure, economy, and technology but also enhance people's understanding and respect for different cultures, Mahfuz Anam, chairman of Asia News Network, editor-in-chief and publisher of Bangladesh’s The Daily Star, said on Thursday at the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Malaysia.At the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Malaysia, Christina Yeo Ken-yin, the undersecretary of the International Relations Division (Culture) at the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture, emphasized the importance of each individual taking on the role of guardians of Asian civilizations.Restoration funds give new lease of life to historical structures, Zheng Caixiong reports in Guangzhou.The restoration of a historical arch has brought many benefits, not least putting a spring back in the step of Liu Jiang.With no small amount of pride and with obvious delight, the staff member of the Nanlang subdistrict cultural service center in Zhongshan city, Guangdong province, these days happily introduces the historical arch to visitors.The arch, built during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), has both its wall base and frame constructed of red sandstone.Due to the erosion of time, the green brick wall surface became moldy and blackened, the red sandstone wall surface weathered and damaged, while the clay sculpture on the top had also seen better days. It wasn't just cosmetic, there were definite safety hazards.Due to lack of maintenance funds and experience, stainless steel protective fences were erected to prevent visitors and pedestrians from going too close or touching the arch.Things changed in 2023 when the city government took the lead in Guangdong province in implementing the full coverage of the annual maintenance system for immovable cultural relics. In total, the city in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area budgeted 5.46 million yuan ($767,130) to repair its immovable cultural relics last year.Meanwhile, it introduced a trial management method for the annual maintenance subsidy funds and established an annual maintenance subsidy fund for daily maintenance and repair of the immovable relics.Last year, Nanlang subdistrict successfully applied for 41,000 yuan from the city's annual maintenance subsidy fund and in March, successfully repaired the arch following the principle of "repairing the old as it is".The stainless steel protective fences of the arch were removed, the wall cleaned and filled, and the tile surface and clay sculptures also grouted and restored, Liu says.The restoration of the arch is not an isolated endeavor. At a time when the world is facing a host of challenges, ranging from climate change to violent conflicts, it is important to remember that humanity has a shared past and should continue to work for a shared future, a United Nations official said.Shahbaz Khan, director of the UNESCO Regional Office for East Asia, said the inscription of World Heritage sites serves as a reminder of this shared responsibility, because it demonstrates the commitment of member states to jointly preserve such sites."Heritage is our legacy from the past — what we live with today and what we pass on to future generations," Khan told China Daily in an exclusive interview.UNESCO has been seeking to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage sites that are considered to be of outstanding value to humanity.During the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee in New Delhi, India, in July, the Beijing Central Axis and two natural heritage sites in China were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, making the country only second to Italy in terms of the number of such sites.Khan, who has visited quite a few World Heritage sites, including many in Beijing, said he considers these "as open-air museums and libraries that contribute to the transmission of knowledge, skills and values across generations".In a congratulatory letter sent to the 44th session of the World Heritage Committee in Fuzhou, Fu­jian province, in 2021, President Xi Jinping said that protecting, inheriting and making good use of the world's cultural and natural treasures "is our shared responsibility, and is of vital importance to the continuity of human civilization and the sustainable development of the world".Khan said he fully agreed with Xi's views. He cited the Beijing Central Axis, which can be traced to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), as a great example of how urban planning transformed to keep up with the times."From the Himalayas to the Badain Jaran Desert, China's heritage sites are vital for protecting endangered species and maintaining ecological balance," Khan said. He noted that China has integrated the protection and utilization of World Heritage sites into its national development strategies, recognizing it as a cornerstone of cultural and ecological civilization.As China is a major global player, its leadership and example in heritage conservation can inspire and influence other countries, particularly in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative, where cultural exchanges and heritage protection are important components, he said.Khan said the Global Civilization Initiative, put forward by Xi, is a valuable contribution to the global dialogue on cultural diversity and international cooperation."It underscores the importance of mutual respect and understanding in an increasingly interconnected world, and supports UNESCO's ongoing efforts to build a more inclusive and peaceful global community," he said.Calling conflicts "unfortunate", the UN official advocated using dialogue, mutual understanding and respect for all civilizations to resolve such issues."We should learn lessons from the mistakes that have been made; learn from the innovations that have been made; and respect the good ideas contributed by everyone," he said.Khan, who is a big fan of the Chinese classic Journey to the West, said the novel is an example of intercultural fusion of ideas and shows what is best about humanity during difficult times.As a fictionalized account of the pilgrimage of the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang and his three companions, including Sun Wukong, also known as the Monkey King, the novel enjoys wide acclaim."There is a quest inside us for knowledge. We have to overcome many difficulties in our life, and we have to be persistent. We need to continue to learn, and we need to also bring our learning to others in a positive and polite way, as Xuanzang did," Khan said. "I would say there is a Xuanzang in each one of us, irrespective of religion or faith."He said it is no surprise that the Chinese-made video game Black Myth: Wukong, which is inspired by the novel, has taken the world by storm. "I'm sure there are many more to be made."At the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation themed "Shared Heritage, Shared Future", held in Malaysia on Sept 5, Chang Shan, counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Malaysia, said that China is committed to cultural heritage protection, and invited more Asian countries to come together to strengthen people-to-people ties and advance Asian civilization.Qu Yingpu, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily, told the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Malaysia on Thursday: "We should help establish a new Asian model for the development of cultural heritage and international cooperation." The event was jointly organized by China Daily and newspaper alliance Asia News Network. The emphasis on cultural heritage is very timely and can bring closer partnership among Southeast Asian countries. People in the region know each other's cultures, but what is important is how to preserve cultural heritage for future generations through cooperation. China has a lot of advanced technologies, for example, animation technologies, to make some of its cultural heritage more interesting. If China could share some of these techniques and technologies with Southeast Asian countries so that we can make our cultural heritage more interesting, then younger people could absorb it more easily.Asian culture experts called for regional cooperation to protect cultural heritage and uncover the contemporary values of ancient civilizations at a panel discussion on "Transnational Cooperation for the Conservation of Shared Cultural Landscapes in Asia", highlighting shared cultural connections across the region.The discussions were held on the sidelines of the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Selangor, Malaysia, on Thursday.Speaking about the rich connotations of cultural heritage and its multifaceted value, Chin Yew Sin, president of the Oriental Culture Research Centre, said that "comprehending our cultural heritage can give us a sense of personal identity", while economically, a rich cultural heritage can drive development, such as through the promotion of cultural tourism.Given the benefits and seeing cultural heritage as a shared asset of Asian nations, he said countries should work together to promote conservation. He suggested regular meetings to share experience, and called on more advanced countries to support less developed nations in the region with financial and technical aid.Malaysia is committed to further engaging in comprehensive exchange and cooperation with other Asian countries on cultural heritage conservation, a high-ranking Malaysian cultural official said on Thursday.As the world is in the middle of rapid change and development, it is necessary to promote Asian civilizations and contribute to the vitality of Asian countries, said Christina Yeo Ken Yin, undersecretary of the International Relations Division in Culture at Malaysia's Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture.Speaking at the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation, Yeo said countries in the region have to work together to promote the exchange and mutual learning of Asian cultural heritage, not only as a reflection of memory and identity of the past, but also as an important way to redeem modern Asian societal values."We must play the important role of protecting Asian cultural heritage," said Yeo, adding that regional countries should be the guardians, promoters and proponents of Asian civilizations.China hopes to team up with more Asian countries in preserving shared cultural heritage and advancing Asian civilization, Chang Shan, a senior Chinese diplomat, told a cultural forum in Selangor, Malaysia, on Thursday.Chang, counselor of the Chinese embassy in Malaysia, also highlighted the accomplishments jointly achieved by China and Malaysia in protecting cultural property, which have strengthened people-to-people exchanges and friendships between the two nations.During the forum, Chang spoke about China's dedication to international cultural heritage protection and the country's efforts to integrate domestic preservation efforts with global collaboration.China's endeavors under the UNESCO 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, as well as its roles in the Alliance for Cultural Heritage in Asia, stand as testimony to its commitment, Chang said.Mahfuz Anam, chairman of the Asia News Network, said that understanding the heritage of different cultures will help build firmer bridges of communication that can stand strong in a world faced with rising misunderstanding and turbulence.The veteran journalist made his remarks at the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Selangor, Malaysia, on Thursday.In his keynote speech, Anam said he cannot read or write Chinese, but Chinese music "resonates in his heart", and he believes such nonverbal echoes will happen to Chinese people who hear music from Bangladesh — Anam's home country.However, the enormous impact embodied in intangible cultural elements, which he thinks eclipse the sound of language, have been forgotten by people who only have eyes for economic growth."We are much too enamored with the buildings we make, the bridges we construct, the enormous edifices we make," he said.Today, there is more conflict and destructive competition. People live in a world of misunderstanding and an environment of uncertainty, he added.In the face of the potential damage that accelerated urban development and climate change may inflict on cultural heritage, establishing partnerships to protect these assets is essential to fostering a sustainable future.The remarks were made by Michael Yeoh, president of Malaysia-based think tank KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific. In his welcoming speech at Thursday's Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation, Yeoh said that the rapid pace of development and industrialization poses risks to cultural sites, making their protection a pressing challenge today.A case study by UNESCO, for instance, shows that Venice had been sinking at a rate of about 10 centimeters per century due to natural subsidence. In the last century, the city experienced additional decline of 10 cm to 13 cm as nearby industries pumped groundwater from deep aquifers. "This process ended in the 1970s, but irreversible damage has already been done," the study reads.The Baba Nyonya community in Malaysia is a vivid example of cultural exchange, with the Wangchuan ceremony a shared intangible cultural heritage of Malaysia and China, said Ronald Gan, president of Persatuan Peranakan Baba Nyonya Malaysia.Speaking at the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation on Thursday, Gan shared the stories of the Baba Nyonya.In the 15th century, many Chinese immigrants married Malaysians. Their male descendants were called Baba, and their female descendants Nyonya.Gan has been organizing Wangchuan ceremonies in Melaka, where there is a large population of Baba Nyonya. The ceremony, which originated in South China's Fujian province, is a traditional cultural practice jointly nominated by China and Malaysia for UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list.Noting that the Baba Nyonya keep the traditional practices they inherited from Chinese culture, Gan said many of them have integrated with Malaysian elements, resulting in a unique culture.Editor's note: On Thursday, China Daily and newspaper alliance Asia News Network held the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Selangor, Malaysia. Co-organized by think tank KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific, nearly 200 government officials, senior executives, cultural leaders, researchers and media representatives from across Asia attended the forum, which was themed "Shared Heritage, Shared Future", to discuss ways to jointly preserve cultural heritage and drive sustainable development in the region. Here are highlights of the forum.Sitting in a conservation forum in Northwest China's Gansu province, Afghan archaeologist Azizuddin Wafa was intensely focused, taking notes with one hand and capturing photos of each slide with the other as a Chinese scholar delivered a presentation on desalination techniques.The ongoing forum took place in late August in Dunhuang — home to the Mogao Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage Site — bringing together hundreds of experts and scholars from 16 countries to exchange knowledge on cave temple conservation.Wafa's participation is part of a broader training program in China for Afghan archaeology and cultural preservation professionals."We've gained a lot of experience. China's use of science and technology in preserving cultural relics has been particularly helpful," he says, adding that over the years, China has made continuous efforts to support Afghan talent development.Since 2022, around 70 Afghan government officials and scholars have attended three training sessions organized by China's Ministry of Commerce and hosted by the Central Academy of Culture and Tourism Administration.The latest training session Wafa attended began in Beijing on Aug 14 and includes 23 participants. For 16 days, they studied Chinese law and regulations on cultural preservation, archaeological science and digital techniques. The program also includes visits to cultural landmarks such as the Temple of Heaven, the Great Wall, the Mogao Caves and institutions like the National Museum of China."China and Afghanistan both lie along the ancient Silk Road and share deep historical ties with a long tradition of cultural exchanges," says Miao Bin, deputy director of the international exchange department at the Central Academy of Culture and Tourism Administration.In 2018, a team from the Dunhuang Academy became one of the first Chinese academic groups to conduct research in Afghanistan. An exhibition featuring treasures from the National Museum of Afghanistan has also toured Chinese cities, including Dunhuang and Beijing, garnering widespread acclaim.Mayel Aqa Karimy, director of the ancient coin gallery at the National Museum of Afghanistan, has been involved in cultural relic preservation for nearly two decades. This is his second time attending a training program in China."Afghanistan and China share many similarities in culture and art. The conservation techniques I've learned here can be applied at sites in Afghanistan," Karimy says.During his previous training, Karimy visited Beijing, Xi'an in Shaanxi province and Dunhuang, and was impressed by the sustainable preservation efforts in Chinese cities. This time, he is focusing on China's digital technology, hoping to use these advanced techniques in his country to better protect its cultural heritage.Karimy also highlights China's ongoing assistance in preserving Afghanistan's historical sites and its commitment to training Afghan professionals.Su Bomin, dean of the Dunhuang Academy and a keynote speaker at the forum, also participated in last year's training program. Su emphasizes that China is willing to share its experience in cave temple preservation with the world.According to Miao, China's overseas training programs are fostering deeper cooperation with Afghanistan in cultural preservation.After the Dunhuang forum, the Afghan participants returned to Beijing for further academic discussions. Chinese archaeologists are also scheduled to travel to Afghanistan to conduct joint research at the ancient Buddhist heritage site Mes Aynak, 40 kilometers southeast of Kabul.This year, China has expanded similar training programs to other countries, including Cambodia and Iran, to enhance professional resource exchanges.Papermaking technology was introduced to Central Asia in the 8th century and arrived in Europe around the 12th century. "It changed the historical process of Europe because papermaking technology made knowledge dissemination possible at reduced costs and broke the monopoly of knowledge by nobles and clerks," says professor Xi Huidong.Gilbank points out that movable type printing was also a revolutionary invention, "The conjunction of those two things was what really moved us into the early modern world," he says.In a grand hall at Beijing's Chinese Traditional Culture Museum, a captivating scene unfolds as 93-year-old artist Chang Shana and 89-year-old choreographer Gao Jinrong walk into the room holding hands.Their bond has been forged by their shared vision of breathing life into Dunhuang's ancient murals through dance, ensuring that their beauty and significance continues to captivate and inspire.Home of the Mogao Grottoes — a UNESCO World Heritage Site that was created between the 4th to the 14th centuries — Dunhuang is renowned for its Buddhist murals and statues, masterpieces that not only vividly illustrate the spread of Buddhism across China, but are also enduring symbols of Chinese civilization.As Chang and Gao pored over images of the frescoes, their conversation flowed effortlessly, blending reverence for the past with excitement for their creative endeavor.Their meeting was part of an ongoing exhibition on tour at the Chinese Traditional Culture Museum, Everlasting Beauty of Dunhuang. The 400-odd exhibits include Chang's reproductions of the murals, and are a showcase of the lifetime achievements of Chang.During the meeting, young dancers from the Beijing Dance Academy and the Art Vocational College at the Lanzhou University of Arts and Science in Gansu province, performed pieces choreo- graphed by Gao based on the murals, transforming their timeless beauty into a live dance experience.Professor Xi Huidong points out that besides food, language also traveled along the ancient Silk Road routes. He takes the Shaanxi dialect " kelimacha" as an example.Everybody has heard of the Silk Road，but not that many people know what the Silk Road really is. Xi Huidong, deputy dean of the Institute of Silk Road Studies of Northwest University, uses a color-coded system to illustrate the four main routes of the Silk Road.Watch it again: Embracing Cultures, 'Cultural legacy of the Silk Road'A salon explores the legacies of the ancient trade routes that connected China with the West to discern what they mean for our world today and tomorrow, Erik Nilsson reports in Xi'an.Italian archaeologist Marcella Festa surprised fellow participants of a recent salon about the Silk Road when asked to name the one artifact that she believes best epitomizes the trade route.Her answer? Camels."It reminds us that the Silk Road is not made of objects. It's made of living beings," says the associate professor at the School of Cultural Heritage of Northwest University in Xi'an, Shaanxi province.Indeed, these creatures have, perhaps as much as silk itself, become synonymous with the intercontinental transport network that flourished for millennia. They literally served as the vehicles for trade and exchange that shaped the routes and, ultimately, the world beyond."The Silk Road would not be possible without humans meeting each other, without animals carrying things. So, it's a good reminder for us to not just look at the objects, which are very beautiful and very significant in terms of history and artistic value, but also people — how people lived, why did they meet, how they met — because these are the aspects that actually built the Silk Road."Festa joined two other academics from Northwest University: School of Foreign Languages associate professor Briton Robin Gilbank and Xi Huidong, deputy dean of the Institute of Silk Road Studies, as well as two moderators from China Daily.The formation and development of early text in major ancient civilizations was highlighted at an academic forum that kicked off on the Suzhou Campus of Renmin University of China in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, on Wednesday.Themed on "From Practices to Things: First Books in the Ancient World", the forum was part of RUC's China-Europe Civilization Forum mechanism, a high-level academic dialogue platform in collaboration with partner universities abroad.The two-day event hosted participants from Princeton University, the University of Chicago and Columbia University in the United States, the University of Oxford and Durham University in the United Kingdom and Germany's Free University of Berlin, along with Chinese scholars from Fudan University, Nanjing University, Renmin University of China and Jingzhou Museum of Hubei province, among others.The experts traced the origins of books from multiple ancient civilizations, such as Greece, Rome, Egypt, Sumeria and China, regarding the social and cultural atmosphere, knowledge practices, participants, materials and mediums that facilitated the formation of diverse textual cultures.Sinologist Martin Kern, a professor at Princeton University and co-director of RUC's International Center for the Study of Ancient Text Cultures, pointed out in his report that the book culture of China dates back to the fifth century BC and emerged with social practices such as philosophical debate, poetry performances, historical anecdotes, royal speeches and political remonstrances.These shorter texts were later compiled into larger anthologies of anonymous individual texts, giving rise to the country's earliest book culture which prioritized compilation and annotation over authorship, interpretation and commentary over the written text itself.John Baines, professor emeritus of Egyptology at the University of Oxford, discussed how the initial writing system of ancient Egypt, as a method of display, marking and notation, evolved into continuous language and texts.Glenn Most, a professor of Greek philology at Italy's Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, pointed out that ancient Greeks identified works of natural philosophy by Pherecydes and Anaximander as the earliest Greek books rather than poetic epics of Homer and Hesiod.Weather is not the only factor as experts work together to protect relics, Fang Aiqing and Ma Jingna report.Moss, fungi and lichen may seem inconspicuous but they can damage cultural relics, or, conversely, protect them from erosion. This dual functionality provides a broad selection of research topics and attracts multidisciplinary scholars to continuously explore and innovate effective measures for conservation.Domestic and foreign academic efforts in this field over the past decade, based on cases conducted under different climates and of different types of cultural relics, were reviewed at the second International Symposium on Biodeterioration and Protection of Cultural Heritage, held at the Dunhuang Academy in Northwest China's Gansu province in June.Unlike museum collections, kept in a dry and sterile environment, large outdoor artifacts are subject to weathering and undesirable effects from organisms, or biodeterioration, says Gu Ji-Dong, professor at the Guangdong Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Shantou, Guangdong province.He cites the Giant Buddha of Leshan in Southwest China's Sichuan province, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as an example. The 71-meter-tall Buddha statue has long been plagued by mosses, lichens, mold and weeds growing on it. Parts of the Buddha's face, at times, have taken on a black hue as seen in media coverage, despite continuous monitoring and protection.An internationally acclaimed microbiologist, Gu used to work for Harvard University in the United States and the University of Hong Kong, and now also serves as editor-in-chief of the academic journal, International Biodeterioration and Biodegradation.Gu explains that in China and many other countries, most cultural relics conservators have an educational background in chemistry or materials science. Upon seeing dark spots on murals, for example, they naturally tend to analyze the chemical substances and reactions, before they realize it's actually the microbes that are causing the color change and damage."Preservation measures for large outdoor artifacts ultimately aim to prolong their survival in the natural environment."As microbiologists, we want to identify the microbes that are responsible for specific types of damage and how they cause such damage chemically, and by employing intervention measures we can minimize the activities of these microbes as much as possible or prevent their outbreak and attack, so that protection can be achieved by slowing down the damage to allow future generations to appreciate our cultural heritage," he adds.Unlike some exhibitions that may require endless footslogging, this curated collection of Chinese wooden furniture — in actual fact just a few dozen pieces — invited viewers to linger.Visitors could not only admire the craftsmanship but also get hands-on experience by assembling sunmao (mortise-and-tenon) joints and encounter the distinct aromas of various types of wood.For over three months, the exhibition Elegance of Woodcraft: Timeless Beauty, which concluded on Sunday, had drawn more than 1 million visitors to the Summer Palace Museum and its Deheyuan, or Garden of Virtue and Harmony, in Beijing.The exhibits traced the development of classical Chinese wooden furniture, its cultural significance, and the fusion of the East and the West in the designs dating to the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. On display were 83 premium pieces and sets of furniture.In recent years, smaller, more refined exhibitions of traditional Chinese wooden furniture have become popular.Artisans and cultural relic restorers, collaborating with curators, have used modern exhibition techniques to showcase the intricate craftsmanship, artistry and profound cultural legacy inherent in Chinese wooden furniture, breathing new life into this intangible cultural heritage.The Summer Palace exhibition was held to celebrate the 110th anniversary of the palace's public opening. It focused on Ming and Qing furniture relics from classical gardens, encompassing a wide range of traditional furniture styles and types.Yang Fuhua, curator and conservator at the cultural relics protection department of the Summer Palace, explains that this exhibition offers an immersive experience by displaying most of the artifacts without protective cases, allowing visitors to see them up close. Making seats that suit today's needs while honoring tradition, Li Yingxue reports.Editor's note: Traditional arts and crafts are supreme examples of Chinese cultural heritage. China Daily is publishing this series to show how master artisans are using dedication and innovation to inject new life into heritage. In this installment, we unveil the timeless beauty of Chinese wooden furniture.The smooth, timeworn contours of a wooden chair seem to whisper tales from another era. Along its armrests, the elegant curves embody centuries of mastery, each line an echo of the artisans who crafted it.The smooth, timeworn contours of a wooden chair seem to whisper tales from another era. Along its armrests, the elegant curves embody centuries of mastery, each line an echo of the artisans who crafted it.But on closer examination, this seemingly ancient chair has secrets to tell.Column: Hands of TimeExcavations reveal settlements close to rivers and evidence of hunting, reports Zhao Ruixue in Linyi, Shandong province.It had been raining heavily for more than 10 days in Hekui, a village in Linyi city's Yishui county in Shandong province. The continuous downpour that July in 2020 caused levels at the Bashan Reservoir, about 300 meters to the east of the village, to exceed the safety limit, forcing it to release water.The cascade eroded the riverbanks, carrying mud and sediment downstream into the Yihe River. However difficult it might have been to imagine at the time, this event changed the fate of the village and the surrounding areas for the best, as the force of the water washed away the soil to reveal significant archaeological remains."Someone found animal fossils likely been washed out by the water," says Li Gang, a researcher at the Shandong Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, as he recounted the call he received from the dean. "He said, 'You should go and take a look. There might be artifacts from the Paleolithic period'."Upon arriving at the village, Li was greeted by a trove of fossils covered in riverbank mud, with one particularly memorable find being a segment of an elephant molar.However, it was the presence of quartz items in the strata that caught his attention. After examining a few of the pieces, Li, who has dedicated 15 years of his life to Paleolithic archaeology, felt a surge of joy — this vast alluvial plain and sloping hill before him was a rare and well-preserved Paleolithic site.As he stood there, he tried to picture the scene 100,000 years ago, in what would have been lush grasslands. This was a time when humans wielded stone tools. In the distance, he could almost hear the trumpeting of extinct prehistoric straight-tusked elephants, and the neighing of wild horses.The appeal of museums has not just been confined to history as many institutions offer tantalizing glimpses into the past for recent visitors, particularly during the summer break when students are keen to explore artifacts up close.Museums have become must-visit destinations, with tickets often difficult to obtain.Take, for instance, the Shaanxi History Museum in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, where daily ticket reservations exceed 600,000 clicks, yet only 12,000 fortunate visitors manage to secure entry.However, the recently launched app, Shanhai Museum (literally "mountain and sea"), serves as a digital portal to thousands of artifacts from prestigious museums, providing an alternative for those unable to obtain tickets.The app is available on both Android and iOS devices. Overseas users can search for "ShanHai Museum" directly in the app store to download it. With the app, users can zoom in on 3D images of exhibits to observe details, access information about the artifacts and even use artificial intelligence to create paintings, virtual art pieces and other derivative works at their fingertips.Currently, its digital artifact repository includes exhibits from institutions, such as the Shaanxi History Museum, Hunan Museum, Gansu Provincial Museum, Gansu Jiandu Museum and the Hunan Museum of Geology.The app's launch ceremony took place in Changsha, Hunan province, on Monday, after which a forum was held themed on the application of digitalized tools in the promotion and protection of cultural heritage.At the event, a livestream linkup showed the platform's digital artifact acquisition team capturing images and creating 3D models of a bronze dragon head in Shanghai. The digital version was then transmitted onto a big screen at the event site in Changsha. This entire process was completed in just 13 minutes and 14 seconds."In such a short time, they collected a precise set of data. I'm impressed," says Hou Ningbin, curator of the Shaanxi History Museum.With nearly four decades of work experience in the field of cultural heritage protection, he recalls that as early as the 1990s, the Shaanxi History Museum began applying digital technology in the protection of cultural relics.Back then, electronic tags were attached to the cultural relics and radio frequency technology was used to record the positioning and tracking of the outbound cultural relics."In the early 2000s, when we were collecting 3D data from some cultural relics, we faced two main challenges: high costs and low efficiency," he says."The financial outlay was high but it would take several weeks to collect data for a single artifact. However, the technical team behind the Shanhai Museum app has already solved these two issues."The technical team developed an algorithm that cuts the time needed to create a digital version of each artifact by 90 percent compared to traditional methods.Even when the digitalized artifact is enlarged six to eight times, every detail remains clear, according to Fang Fei, chief manager of the Hunan Mango Digital Art Intelligence Technology company, which developed the app."In the future, we plan to carry out 3D modeling and data cataloging of hundreds of thousands of cultural relics in museums nationwide," he notes. "And we have collaborated with universities, archaeological institutes and digital libraries to acquire historical documents, inscriptions, archaeological logs and research papers related to cultural relics."Based on the huge database, the app offers users a knowledge graph that links a certain cultural relic to historical figures and related stories. A knowledge graph represents a network of real-world entities — objects, events, situations or concepts — and illustrates the relationships.Zhang Boshuo, 19, a Beijing university student and avid museum visitor, notes that at exhibitions, one would follow a specific logic or narrative to experience the displayed relics.The knowledge graph offers a more expansive way of linking relevant information, enabling the thorough comprehension of the narratives woven around the artifacts, he adds.Peng Minghan, curator of the Nanchang Relic Museum for Haihun Principality of Han Dynasty, notes that in recent decades, cultural institutions have digitalized relics but many of them operate independently."That requires users to visit multiple sites searching for information. The Shanhai Museum app's emergence promises integrated resources from various institutions for easier access," he adds.Meanwhile, the international version of the app is now accessible in six languages, including English, French, Spanish and Japanese.Hou says that this development underscores the app's commitment to promoting Chinese culture on a global scale."Translating the historical context and essence of the artifacts into other languages with high precision within a global framework poses a great challenge. This is something that the Shanhai Museum platform must address in the future," Hou says.Discussing cross-cultural communication on cultural relics, Jay Xu, the director of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco in the United States, highlights the importance of understanding the needs, perspectives and familiarity with Chinese culture among audiences in a specific region."Storytelling must closely resonate with the interests of the local populace. We can guide them into the unfamiliar and magical world of Chinese culture through concepts and contexts they are familiar with," says Xu, who was invited as a guest to the event.Established in 1966, the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco boasts the largest and most diverse collection of Asian art outside of Asia. With more than 15,000 art treasures from countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia, the museum has long served as a gateway for visitors to explore and understand the past, present and future of Asian cultures.The Shanhai Museum platform has created an online community for cultural enthusiasts to interact and has gathered scholars, artists and content creators to consistently produce high-quality educational content on cultural heritage.The third edition of the Hong Kong Palace Museum's flagship youth-learning initiative, the Bi-city Youth Cultural Leadership Programme, reached its final stop on Thursday at the Palace Museum in Beijing, marking the conclusion of a two-month journey of cultural exchange from Hong Kong to Chengdu in Sichuan province and Beijing.Participating students from both Beijing and Hong Kong engaged in insightful discussions about the promotion of Chinese culture and the development of creative industries with Wang Xudong, director of the Palace Museum, Lou Wei, executive deputy director of the Palace Museum, Louis Ng, museum director of the HKPM, Vinci Chan, assistant director of the Office of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Beijing, and Han Zhi, director of retail at Swire Properties.The program is supported by the Palace Museum and the Office of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Beijing, with Swire Properties as lead sponsor. The initiative was designed by program partner Ednovators, a Hong Kong-based charitable platform.In addition to the dynamic session, the Beijing program also included a full-day visit to the Palace Museum. Highlights included a tour of a digital gallery, where students learned how the museum leverages digital solutions to display culture creatively, and a visit to the department of conservation science to explore the use of technology in artifact conservation.A key event on Thursday was the session between students and the museum director, who shared his extensive knowledge during a talk themed "All that is the Forbidden City, and the Forbidden City for All". Students then shared their findings and experiences during the two-month study tour under the theme of "The Future of Cultural Ecosystems". In-depth exchanges between students and special guests in attendance followed."We have been deeply encouraged by how well the program has been received by students in Beijing and Hong Kong, as well as by industry professionals and experts, over the past three editions of the Bi-city Youth Cultural Leadership Programme," Ng said."The program not only advances our goal of fostering cultural interaction and promoting Chinese cultural heritage, it also reinforces Hong Kong's position as an international hub for cultural talent and future industry leaders," he added."We hope to empower the next generation to create vibrant and sustainable places where arts and culture can thrive as a part of everyday life," said Tim Blackburn, chief executive of Swire Properties.For this third edition, which began in Hong Kong in July, participants took part in immersive workshops, master classes and internships at arts and cultural institutions and private businesses in Hong Kong, and had the opportunity to broaden their horizons and develop into cultural entrepreneurs.In mid-August, they visited the recently opened New Sanxingdui Museum and Taikoo Li Chengdu, and learned about integrating art, culture and historical elements in place-making. They also attended a forum on "Tradition and Future: Modernization and Localization of Cultural Legacy", and had an opportunity to speak with experts in the fields of cultural heritage, design and architecture on topics such as cultural inheritance, innovation and urban rejuvenation.Since its inception in November 2022, the program has allowed nearly 130 university students from Beijing and Hong Kong to immerse themselves in a series of exciting cultural exchanges and learning activities. Applications for the fourth edition of the program will be accepted in early 2025, with more details to be announced on the HKPM's website in due course.North China's culturally-rich province of Shanxi has significantly increased investment in cultural relic preservation and diversified funding channels in recent years, according to the provincial finance department.In 2024, the province allocated 408 million yuan ($57.28 million) at the provincial level for cultural relic protection, an increase of 84 million yuan from 2021, with an average annual growth rate of 8 percent.Additionally, the province has secured 525 million yuan in national funds for cultural relic protection this year, up by 197 million yuan from 2023, representing a 60 percent increase.As a leading repository of heritage resources in China, Shanxi is home to 53,875 immovable cultural relics, and boasts 531 key historical and cultural sites under national-level protection, the highest number among provincial-level regions.However, the province faces challenges in protecting numerous low-grade cultural relics, with substantial conservation work and inadequate management personnel. Since 2023, Shanxi has also used general bond funds to bolster cultural relic protection in financially strained cities and counties.The province has pioneered a special fund, the Shanxi Cultural Relic Protection Fund, to mobilize and attract social capital, which has emerged into a new model for heritage preservation, the department said.Shanxi has also encouraged public participation in relic protection through initiatives. By the end of 2023, the province had attracted nearly 520 million yuan in social funds for relic protection.Half a century after the first excavation of Mawangdui Han Tombs, amended version of old manuscripts, preserved on silk, is published, Wang Xin reports in Shanghai.The Mawangdui Han Tombs in Changsha, Hunan province, which have been recognized as one of the greatest archaeological findings of the 20th century, have offered not only massive pieces of artifacts but also presented a mini "library" of the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220).This year marks the 50th anniversary of the excavation of the Mawangdui Han Tombs. On Sunday, after four years of efforts in making revisions and additions, an amended version of the Mawangdui Bamboo Slips and Silk Manuscripts was published, which is compiled by Hunan Museum and the Center for Research on Chinese Excavated Classics and Paleography at Fudan University in Shanghai, to celebrate the special occasion.Cultural relics recognized as the national treasure of China from Dunhuang of Gansu province will be featured at the upcoming exhibition at China Art Museum, Shanghai.The Great Art of Dunhuang, taking place at the China Art Museum, Shanghai, also known as the Shanghai Art Museum, from Sept 20 to Dec 20, features some of the most representative and rare artworks from the collection of the Dunhuang Academy. While a number of the objects are so important that they are forbidden to travel abroad, some artworks will be making their debut showcase in Shanghai.Dunhuang is an ancient city located in an oasis in the Gobi desert in northwestern China's Gansu province. An important trade town along the ancient Silk Road, Dunhuang is home to the renowned Mogao Caves, a treasure trove of Buddhist art and culture.The new exhibition in Shanghai will feature wide diversity of artworks from Dunhuang, including replica of some representative caves with frescoes, as well as Buddha statues and paintings.The exhibition will be jointly hosted by the Dunhuang Academy and China Art Museum, Shanghai, under the guidance of the municipal administration of culture and tourism. It will be an event for the 35th Shanghai Tourism Festival.The 2024 International Forum on Cave Temple Conservation, organized by the National Cultural Heritage Administration, kicked off on Monday in Dunhuang, Gansu province.Under the theme of "promoting Silk Road cultural exchanges, building the dream of the Belt and Road Initiative", several hundred experts from 16 countries and regions have gathered to discuss the study, protection and management of cave temples.Cave temples refer to grottoes and sculptures carved into cliffs or mountains, as well as the remains of temple sites, and cliffside statues. They possess significant cultural, historical and artistic value.Dunhuang is known for the Mogao Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage Site with hundreds of Buddhist caves dating from the 4th to the 14th centuries that are known for their exquisite murals and statues.According to Guan Qiang, deputy director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, China's cave temples, as represented by Mogao, not only vividly demonstrate the spread of Buddhism in China, but are also testimony to Chinese civilization.After more than 70 years of effort, the main risks to the country's most important cave temples have been largely eliminated. That means the exploration and practice of protecting and repairing cave temples, reinforcing their structure, and improving environmental management, as well as digital preservation and monitoring, have been very effective in China, Guan says.Professor Shahbaz Khan, director of the UNESCO Regional Office for East Asia, said the protection of cave temples faces increasing challenge from climate change and environmental degradation across the world. As a result, international cooperation has an important role to play in the field.Over the course of two days, scholars will exchange ideas on the subject of cave temples.Aquaint, traditional courtyard off the beaten track has become a hit among visitors since Zhang Peng took the helm six years ago.Nestled on a tree-covered hillside on the northern shore of Xihai Wetland Park in Beijing's Xicheng district, the Guo Shoujing Memorial Hall has served as a museum for more than 30 years, recounting the stories of Guo Shoujing, a Chinese astronomer, hydraulic engineer and politician of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).Since the summer season started a month ago, Zhang has been busy receiving "study tour" participants from across the country."We've extended our service by two hours to 7 pm and night activities like reading sessions, watercolor painting and embroidery have been held," says Zhang.The events are all related to the history and culture along the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal which Guo contributed to in its design.The site is not large — about 800 square meters — with the exhibition hall covering roughly a quarter of the space, but it offers a wealth of information on the historical figure.Zhang and his team offer visitors vivid and detailed guidance once they enter."Guo left two major legacies in astronomy and water conservancy," Zhang says."It is said that throughout his life, Guo developed more than 20 different types of astronomical instruments," Zhang adds.There are life-size models of the armillary sphere and a simplified one at the museum.Guo came up with the abridged one for better observation."The ball bearings used in the simplified armillary sphere were invented more than 200 years before they appeared in the West," Zhang says.It was because of these advanced instruments that more accurate fundamental data was obtained, leading to the creation of the Shoushi (Season-Granting) Calendar, which has widely been deemed the most precise calendar of its time in the world."It's astonishing to think that over 700 years ago, with limited technology, Guo measured the length of a solar year with an error of only 0.003 days compared to today's precise measurements — equivalent to just 26 seconds," Zhang says.As for water conservancy, Guo proposed to build an artificial canal in Shandong on the existing Grand Canal to allow cargo ships to bypass Luoyang of Henan province and sail straight to Beijing."Although Guo never visited the construction site in Shandong, the overall plan was based on his preliminary surveys. Therefore, whenever I share this story with friends, I always emphasize that Guo was the planner of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal," Zhang says.Construction began in 1292 and was completed in 1293, allowing cargo ships to arrive at the port of Jishuitan, where the Guo Shoujing Memorial Hall was thus established.In the old days, children in Jingdezhen, East China's Jiangxi province, had their own novel way to keep themselves warm during the chilly winters. They took a warm brick from a firing kiln and put it in their schoolbags.They don't need warm bricks in cold seasons of the year now, but kiln bricks are still used for building houses in Jingdezhen, known as the "home of porcelain" in China and even across the world. Brick kilns have to be demolished every two or three years to ensure they maintain a certain heat output, according to local ceramists.The Jingdezhen Imperial Kiln Museum, designed by the Beijing-based Studio Zhu-Pei, incorporates both newly fired and recycled bricks amassed from the dismantled furnaces. Located in the center of the city's historical area, the museum is adjacent to the imperial kiln ruins surrounded by many ancient kiln complexes.Recycled kiln bricks still provoke warm memories among the local residents."The ancient kilns in Jingdezhen have never stopped firing for more than 1,000 years. And the whole craftsmanship for hand-making porcelain has been maintained, which makes the city what it is today," says Wang Tongmao, deputy secretary-general of the city government.Along with the old lanes and houses, the ancient kilns are the links the city has with its past.In recent years, Shibing county in Qiandongnan Miao and Dong autonomous prefecture, Southwest China's Guizhou province, has promoted the development of the Miao embroidery industry chain, integrating research, production, sales and tourism by cultivating artisans and building brands.The investments have injected vitality into the ancient traditional craftsmanship and paved new paths for its inheritance.An ethnic embroidery industry park in Shibing collected precious Miao embroidery works and invited renowned artists to preserve the art form through exhibitions and experiential activities.Several Miao embroidery companies within the park have introduced advanced digital design systems and automated production equipment to enhance production efficiency and product quality.A digital cloud production platform was built for embroidery products, allowing companies to meet market demands better and provide personalized customer services.Shibing has registered 42 ethnic handicraft enterprises, and in recent years, the sales revenue of handicraft industries led by Miao embroidery has reached 70 million yuan ($9.7 million) annually.Aiming to transform traditional craftsmanship into innovative craftsmanship and promote the inheritance of Miao embroidery techniques, Shibing invited returning designers from Italy, France, the United States and other countries to form specialized design teams.Shibing has also taken steps to protect the intellectual property rights of Miao embroidery. The county's enterprises possess over 80 national patents for Miao embroidery products, bringing tangible economic benefits to the region.Do you still remember the hit dance show The Banquet in the Tang Dynasty Palace, which was inspired by Tang tri-colored figurines from the Henan Museum.The Tang tri-colored glazed pottery, featuring colorful and gorgeous glazes and lifelike figures, reflects the peerless elegance of the Tang Dynasty (618-907).Follow Gao Shuiwang, representative inheritor of the firing techniques of the Tang tri-colored glazed pottery, to learn how the pottery is made.The video was provided by the All-Media Marketing Planning Center of the Henan TV stationOn China Daily's "Spotlight" program, singer-songwriter Liu Lian experienced the Sui and Tang dynasties dances "Ruizhegu" and "hu teng dance" with the Huaxia Ancient Music Orchestra at the Henan Museum. After the experience, Liu Lian remarked that even a thousand years ago, singing and dancing were not easy.  Long-term work by Northwest University's archaeologists in Central Asia helps trace stories of the ancient Silk Road, Wang Ru and Wang Kaihao report in Xi'an.More than 2,000 years ago, on a mission of peace and to bolster exchanges, an envoy from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) named Zhang Qian (164-114 BC) entered the heart of the Eurasian continent.Embarking from the capital Chang'an — modern-day Xi'an in Shaanxi province — on his arduous and pioneering journey in 138 BC at the request of the then emperor, Zhang was in search of the Greater Yuezhi, a nomadic group that migrated from China to Central Asia during the Han Dynasty. His aim was to persuade the Greater Yuezhi to establish an alliance.He finally reached the destination, and thanks to his diplomatic trek across Central Asia, the long, historic saga of the Silk Road began.Centuries have passed since then, and sand and time have hidden much history. But for the past 15 years, Wang Jianxin, an archaeology professor at Northwest University in Xi'an, has been working on sites that may have played a part in long forgotten stories.More than 2,000 years ago, on a mission of peace and to bolster exchanges, an envoy from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) named Zhang Qian (164-114 BC) entered the heart of the Eurasian continent.Embarking from the capital Chang’an--modern-day Xi’an in Shaanxi province--on his arduous and pioneering journey in 138 BC at the request of the then emperor, Zhang was in search of the Greater Yuezhi, a nomadic group that migrated from China to Central Asia during the Han Dynasty. His aim was to persuade the Greater Yuezhi to establish an alliance.He finally reached the destination, and thanks to his diplomatic trek across Central Asia, the long, historic saga of the Silk Road began.Centuries have passed since then, and sand and time have hidden much history. But for the past 15 years, Wang Jianxin, an archaeology professor at Northwest University in Xi’an, has been working on sites that may have played a part in long forgotten stories. Working with Central Asian counterparts, he and his team have gradually put together some of the jigsaw pieces scattered along the Silk Road, producing a new perspective on studies of its routes, and revealing cultural exchanges from past to present.Central Asia was a core section on the ancient Silk Road. Since it is located in the middle of the Eurasian continent, it serves as an intermediary between Eastern and Western civilizations, and many different ethnic groups and cultures converge on the region.Following in Zhang’s footprints, Wang and his team started by looking for the Greater Yuezhi, to clarify its history.In Jilin Qipao Hall of Jilin city, Jilin province, the employees are tasked with selecting materials, fastening buttons, crafting inlays, cutting fabrics, and sewing inlays and trims. They are artists, designers, and keepers of cultural tradition.Jilin city is one of the birthplaces of the ethnic minority Manchu people. The Manchu cheongsam, a type of qipao, integrates multiple intangible cultural heritage techniques.Zhu Wenjun, a municipal-level inheritor of traditional Manchu embroidery, founded the hall in 2005.Nearly 20 years later, the hall has over 50 employees and an annual output value of 16 million yuan ($2.23 million). More than thirty percent of orders come from abroad."In recent years, with the popularity of Chinese-style clothing, Manchu cheongsams have also attracted young consumers," said Zhu. "Some young people will make specific requests to showcase their individuality."To adapt to new changes, the designers at the cheongsam hall have started incorporating modern elements and fashion design."In some situations where cheongsams may not be suitable, we have developed cheongsam-related products such as bags and outerwear with buttons and trims," she said.The Mawangdui Han Tombs in Hunan province have produced 26,937 artifacts after decades of excavation efforts, according to China Central Television, citing the Hunan Museum.The tombs were initially excavated between 1972 and 1974, and they represent one of China's most significant archaeological discoveries of the 20th century.The unearthed artifacts include Lady Xin Zhui's corpse, lacquerware, textiles, and bamboo and silk manuscripts.The lacquerware unearthed from Mawangdui totals 1,017 pieces, 869 of which are intact. The textiles unearthed (mainly silk and hemp) total 24,490 pieces, including 212 intact pieces. The bamboo and silk manuscripts total 1,430 items, including silk books and paintings, wooden tablets, and bamboo slips.Yu Yanjiao, director and researcher at the Hunan Museum's Mawangdui Han Tombs and Collection Research Exhibition Center, said the quantity of unearthed artifacts from the tombs could be described as massive, with a wide variety of categories and a broad interdisciplinary scope. She added that organizing and researching them is a gigantic systematic project.Duan Xiaoming, the head of the museum, said most of the artifacts have been studied thoroughly, which has laid the foundation for their usage.He added that the museum will establish a research database for Mawangdui to promote digital collection efforts of the artifacts.TAIYUAN — A new museum is set to open at the 4,300-year-old Taosi relics site in North China. Over 300 items will be on display, shedding light on the life and culture of the area's ancient inhabitants.Located in Linfen city, Shanxi province, the Taosi site is most likely the ruins of the capital city during the rule of Yao and Shun, two emperors who lived more than 4,100 years ago. The Yaodu district in Linfen is home to Yao's temple and mausoleum.While it covers an area of 2.8 million square meters, only about 30,000 square meters of the site has been excavated since 1978.The Taosi culture emerged in the middle reaches of the Yellow River following the rise of the Liangzhu Culture in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Both sites provide significant evidence for the study of the early states and origins of China's over 5,000 years of civilization.Archaeological findings indicate that the Taosi culture reached the early stages of both state and civilized society."The discovery of walled city ruins and important buildings at Taosi represents a significant breakthrough," says Wang Wei, chief expert in charge of the project tracing the origins of Chinese civilization. Before this project began, large tombs had frequently been found, but city sites and important buildings were rarer, limiting social studies of the period, Wang says.The Taosi city ruin is known for its functional zoning, with clearly delineated areas for palaces, handicraft workshops, storage, tombs, and sacrificial rituals, resulting in a comprehensive layout of a capital city."The main building is located centrally in the north, demonstrating the architectural concept of a hidden central axis," says Gao Jiangtao, a research fellow at the Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.The central axis concept was crucial to ancient Chinese urban planning. The UNESCO-listed Beijing Central Axis, initially established in the 13th century, runs for 7.8 kilometers from north to south through the old city of Beijing. It is the world's longest urban axis, and is dotted with distinctive elements of Chinese civilization.At Taosi, archaeologists uncovered characters on items like flat kettles that predate oracle bone inscriptions, a form of ancient script found on tortoise shells and animal bones."This discovery indicates that a small minority in Taosi used characters during that era," Wang says.The Taosi site presents early evidence of an astronomical calendar in ancient China, with all 24 traditional Chinese solar terms in evidence at its observatory."The observatory underscores how the ancient Chinese employed advanced methods to guide agricultural development that embodied their understanding of the universe and reflected ancient pragmatism and innovation," says Gao.Taosi society was distinguished by its cultural integration and innovation. Experts note that objects like painted pottery are embellished with designs resembling those of other regions, suggesting the absorption of external cultural elements."Numerous archaeological findings establish Taosi as a political, economic, military, and religious center over 4,000 years ago, and a prime example of a state capital," Gao says.XinhuaWith colorful lanterns in various shapes of creatures, from both the ocean and land, illuminating the square of the National Natural History Museum of China in Beijing as night fell on Aug 1, the monthlong program, Night at the Museum, was launched."Through the lantern-making tradition from Zigong, Sichuan province, we try to use the artistic form to present a wonderful world about natural evolution, which is a highlight of this year's event," Wang Shiwen, deputy Party secretary of the museum, said at the opening ceremony.From 6 pm to 9 pm this month, the museum team will organize a series of activities, including lectures, movies, a sleepover event and Stegosaurus Warriors — Special Exhibition on Jurassic Dinosaurs From Zigong.At the exhibition organized by the natural museum and the Zigong Dinosaur Museum in Sichuan, about 60 examples of precious fossils are on display, including the sauropod bony tail hammer — the first of its type discovered in the world. Also on display is the Sichuan Giganotosaurus skin fossil — the first stegosaur skin fossil discovered. Both are in the collection at the Zigong Dinosaur Museum, evaluated as "the best dinosaur museum in the world" by the US National Geographic. The exhibition will run until Sept 11."For the whole of August, visitors will have the opportunity to enjoy diversified cultural life at the natural museum," Wang says. It is estimated that the event will attract more than 50,000 visitors this month.Besides various activities, according to Wang, the Night at the Museum evenings can create opportunities for researchers to interact face-to-face with the public without interrupting their busy daytime schedule.Lectures will be livestreamed online.At the halls and galleries of the museum, researchers will become guides, helping visitors capture and appreciate the majesty of nature. In the recently renovated hall, named Animals: The Friends of Humankind, Gao Yuan, a top guide, has prepared giant panda feces, cub models and hand bone models so that visitors get to know the giant pandas better.As a star event of the Night at the Museum program, a nightly adventure from 6:30 pm to 8 am the following morning every Friday and Saturday this month is being offered to children between the ages of 6 and 12 accompanied by their families. The ticket for the event costs 1,098 yuan ($154) for a child and an adult.Themed on Africa, the cradle of humanity and a paradise for wildlife, the sleepover includes a concert with children dressed in costumes experiencing the charm of that continent's music and culture and exploring the large-scale seasonal migrations of grazing herbivores in the savannas.Besides the natural museum, many museums across the country have offered after-hour activities and events this summer after the National Cultural Heritage Administration issued a notice on improving museum services early last month.The hashtag "night at museum" has gone viral on micro-blogging platform Sina Weibo with about 20.62 million views. In Shanghai, there are 45 museums extending their visit hours and hosting various activities, including special exhibitions, engaging events and creative workshops."Extending museum hours increases the flexibility of visiting times, providing visitors with more time slots to choose from. This allows them to more fully appreciate the exhibits. Some museums also offer various evening activities during extended hours, providing visitors with a richer visiting experience," says Xiong Haifeng, professor from the School of Cultural Industries Management under the Communication University of China in Beijing.China opened 268 new museums across the country in the past year, creating a total of 6,833 registered museums nationwide, according to the National Cultural Heritage Administration.  Restoration and protection of ancient structures shows a community determined to succeed, report Wang Qian and Zhu Xingxin in Jincheng, Shanxi province.Located in Jincheng in Shanxi province, the Qinglian (Green Lotus) Temple is known for its painted sculptures from the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties. Following its reopening in June — it was damaged by heavy rain in 2021 — the wooden temple has regained its former glory, and is attracting many tourists.Bai Xuebing, deputy director of the Shanxi Cultural Relics Bureau, says that longer rainy seasons and more frequent flash flooding caused by climate change are the main factors threatening ancient buildings in the province.To Bai's delight, the temple has been restored to its original splendor thanks to a renovation project sponsored by the China Foundation for Cultural Heritage Conservation and the Beijing Bytedance Foundation. Ten million yuan ($1.40 million) was spent on the restoration of four of its ancient structures over a three-year time frame.Bai believes this is a good example of how social organizations can get involved in ancient restoration projects.Master craftsman fires up his kiln and passion to produce quality product, Yang Feiyue reports.The dulcet background guzheng (traditional Chinese zither) music permeating the Prince Kung's Palace Museum somehow accentuates the coarse yet stentorian voice of Zhao Qing'an in mid-July.The man in his 50s nimbly runs around a makeshift stage where bricks, iron and wooden tools, and a kiln model are on display in a hall of the museum in Beijing.He speaks fast and uses skits to demonstrate the production process of Linqing bricks, also known as tribute bricks, from Linqing, Liaocheng city of East China's Shandong province.The brick had been favored by ancient royal courts since the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and thus serves as an important part of many historical buildings in the capital city.Having been engaged in producing the tribute bricks for nearly two decades, Zhao is at home with the brick craft that was named a national intangible culture heritage in 2008.He has been invited to an ongoing exhibition at the Prince Kung's Palace Museum that showcases the craftsmanship of those special bricks and will last through to Sunday.When explaining the firing process, Zhao picks up an iron fork and a rod before a mock kiln."This iron fork is used to take out the slag from the kiln, and the rod is used to stir and mix the bricks during firing," he explains to a roomful of visitors to the exhibition.Both these tools are indispensable throughout the brick firing, he adds.Then, he hops over to a pile of brick models and beats them with two sets of wooden boards."They are made to match and roughly flatten the surface of unfired brick before manual fine-tuning kicks in," Zhao says.The production of tribute bricks in Linqing began in the early Ming Dynasty and ended in the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), spanning more than 500 years.According to the chronicle of Linqing, the royal court of Ming set up a branch office there to supervise the firing of tribute bricks, which were then transported to the country's capital via the Grand Canal for the construction of historical buildings like the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, as well as various city gate towers and Confucian temples.The latest archaeological discoveries in Shaoxing in Zhejiang province appear to confirm records of the existence of a legendary state millennia ago.Complex large-scale foundations from the Yue State, which existed during the Warring States Period (475-221 BC), have been discovered for the first time in Shaoxing ancient city, which is known to have been the site of an important Yue capital, scholars explained at a recent news conference at the National Cultural Heritage Administration in Beijing.The Jizhong Site in Shaoxing was discovered during a construction project at the Shaoxing Jishan High School last year. It has yielded results over the past five months since archaeological efforts started in February. The area under excavation covers nearly 3,000 square meters.Li Longbin, director of the Shaoxing Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, says that the remains of wooden foundations from the Warring States Period and the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) are densely distributed across the site. The later Han complex was built on the site of an earlier structure covering an area of 2,385 square meters.Based on records, archaeologists believe that the Warring States Period relics are from the Yue, a state that ruled part of today's Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces and Shanghai.A large number of tiles have been found from both periods, which imply the existence of important buildings. "From the Warring States Period to the Han Dynasty, only important buildings had tiles. The large number and types of tiles unearthed clearly indicate that the site was originally home to important buildings," says Li.Moreover, archaeologists have found that the original complexes were built on high platforms, indicating they were government offices since at the time only government buildings were elevated.The complexes from both periods show evidence of buried wooden foundations and buildings on platforms. "This shows an innovative way of building that probably combines the use of traditional Yue state stilt houses and Central Plains-style buildings," says Li."I believe this is a way of construction invented by the Yue prevented their buildings from settling. …Then when the Han rulers built there, they inherited the Yue methods," he adds.Qin Dashu, an archaeology professor at Peking University, says that the earliest foundations are well-preserved, and display characteristics very different to contemporaneous structures in northern China, and thus play an important role in the history of the country's architecture.Museum dedicated to ethnic clothing presents an image of countrywide grace and elegance.For tourists exploring the enchanting landscapes of Beijing's architectural wonders such as the Forbidden City, they are captivated by the vision of young women adorned in the intricate Manchu attire once donned by royal ladies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Their presence evokes a vibrant reinterpretation of traditional Chinese art, defying the oppressive heat with grace.These dresses are part of the imperial fashion called qizhuang (costumes of the bannermen) of the Manchu ethnic group. They are but one part of the traditional garments worn by China's 56 ethnic groups.For people who are interested in all the colorful costumes, a must-see venue is the Ethnic Costume Museum that draws their attention to the lesser-known, yet equally captivating garments of the country's other ethnic groups.Nestled in the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology is the museum, a treasure trove of cultural heritage. It was officially set up in 2000 as China's premier institution for clothing culture. It has amassed more than 10,000 items, including clothing, jewelry, fabrics, batik and embroidery from various ethnic groups, and displays nearly a thousand photographs from the 1920s and '30s that document the traditional dresses of ethnic groups, such as the Yi, Tibetan, and Qiang people.The quest to collect these ethnic costumes was daunting. While Han attire is widely available, the clothing of the 55 other ethnic groups, some residing in remote or distant areas all across the country, posed a challenge in terms of its collection and preservation.  The introduction of digital scanning and AI promises to revolutionize the study of ancient oracle bones, Yang Feiyue reports.Clearly magnified oracle bone carvings are proving to be a big draw for the hundreds of thousands of visitors to the newly built Yinxu Museum in Anyang, Henan province.Many have been amazed to see the intricate details of the strokes on the 16 oracle bones on display at the museum, which opened in February.In front of Zhengyangmen Gate, which rises at the southern end of Tian'anmen Square in the heart of Beijing, tourists hustling and bustling on Qianmen Street keep instilling vitality to this gateway dating back over 600 years.With the gate tower in the north and the archery tower in the south, Zhengyangmen, a key marker on the Beijing Central Axis, is the largest among all the gates of the inner and outer cities of Beijing during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.The busy scene resonates with the previous era's prosperity, but the gate was subjected to the evolving times.Though the site witnessed the traditional way of urban management and played a crucial role in military defense and ceremonies during the imperial period, the Zhengyangmen area experienced major changes after the monarchy ended.The old fortified barbican was replaced by an urban road in the early 20th century. Zhengyang Bridge in front of the gate used to be an imperial road across the moat surrounding the inner city but had also disappeared from above ground. People thought the largest single bridge along the Beijing Central Axis no longer existed in the last century's urban development, but recent archaeological research tells another story.To identify its status quo as a reference for the studies of the Beijing Central Axis, archaeologists have excavated the Zhengyang Bridge site in two phases on Qianmen Street since 2021. To their joy, the bridge is still there, intact and well-sealed beneath the busy traffic of today.A bridge made of bricks and stones, as well as a goose wing-shaped revetment, was discovered."We could only refer to ancient documents and paintings to imagine what Zhengyang Bridge was like," says Zhang Lifang, an associate researcher at the Beijing Archaeological Research Institute who leads the excavation. "Archaeology now provides us a clear lineage of its evolution."The bridge was first constructed with wood and reinforced with stones and bricks in 1439, according to records in a Ming Dynasty file. In the early 20th century, the arch bridge was widened and flattened to facilitate traffic. Later, the moat was filled."We found cement under its arches, which shows vestiges of renovation in the early 20th century," Zhang says.During its discovery, the bridge was still safeguarded by a 3-meter-long stone statue of a mythical water-harnessing beast. The lion-headed, tiger-bodied beast is covered with scales and decorated with auspicious clouds on some parts.Zhang says this remarkable statue echoes the bridge's exceptional status.This archaeological research was an important preparation process in the successful seeking of UNESCO World Heritage Site status for the Beijing Central Axis. An ensemble of landmarks representing the backbone of Beijing was envisioned centuries ago and still plays vital role in modern life, Cheng Yuezhu reports.Those taking a trip to central Beijing are often recommended to ascend Jingshan Hill and be treated to a rare bird's-eye view of the capital's old city. Its summit offers a panorama of the Forbidden City, with its palaces in vermilion and imperial yellow laid out in all its sublimity.When turning around and facing north, the equilibrium of symmetry rooted in traditional Chinese aesthetics and beliefs is more readily apparent — the Hall of Imperial Longevity resting downhill, beyond it the Di'anmen Inner and Outer streets splitting the view in half, further extending to the Bell and Drum Towers.Such structural balance can be found throughout Beijing's old city, from the Yongdingmen Gate in the south, running through the Tian'anmen Square Complex and the Forbidden City, up to the Bell and Drum Towers in the north, stretching a total of 7.8 kilometers.This is the Beijing Central Axis, celebrated as "the backbone of Beijing".It denotes an ensemble of building complexes and archaeological sites that governs the overall layout of the capital, encompassing imperial palaces and gardens, imperial sacrificial buildings, ancient city management facilities, national ceremonial and public buildings, and central axis roads remains.Prominent Chinese architect and architectural historian Liang Sicheng (1901-1972) once wrote: "Beijing's unique and magnificent order is created by this Central Axis.... There is no other building complex in the world that has such an imposing layout, or that deals with space on such a scale."On Saturday, at the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee in New Delhi, India, "Beijing Central Axis: A Building Ensemble Exhibiting the Ideal Order of the Chinese Capital" was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.Covering an area of 589 hectares and a buffer zone of 4,542 hectares, the entry, with 15 components, marks China's 59th World Heritage Site and Beijing's eighth.The latest episode of the fourth season of the TV show, National Treasure, which aired recently, featured celebrities such as actresses Xu Fan and Ma Sichun, as well as actor Li Hongyi, visiting Jilin Provincial Museum to narrate the stories behind the artifacts in its collection.Produced by China Media Group, the fourth season has showcased 27 national treasures from cultural institutions like the Palace Museum, Tianjin Museum, Anhui Museum, Fujian Museum, and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in Hong Kong to its viewers.It provides viewers with insights into the stories behind the artifacts, offering a multidimensional view of the wisdom and power rooted in Chinese civilization and showcasing how the outstanding traditional Chinese culture is being passed down in the modern era.Additionally, it explores how these artifacts serve as emotional bridges connecting people from different cultures.This season highlights foreign individuals from countries such as France, Spain and Turkiye who have chosen to reside in Jingdezhen, the porcelain capital of China in Jiangxi province, to learn the ancient art of porcelain making.For example, Jaume Ribalta, who has been involved in ceramic art in Spain for years, discovered that many porcelain-making techniques originated in Jingdezhen. Since 2019, he has been coming to Jingdezhen every summer to learn the craft and later decided to move there, opening his own workshop."Jingdezhen is a paradise for all ceramic enthusiasts," he said.The show aims to showcase the inclusive nature of Chinese civilization and has established a cultural bridge connecting domestic and international audiences.It has also sparked a trend of people visiting museums during the summer. Following the broadcast of an episode focusing on the Chongqing China Three Gorges Museum, the facility experienced a surge in visitors, with reservations fully booked the day after the episode aired. The museum remains in high demand, with extended opening hours since July 20 to accommodate eager visitors.In recent years, China has made significant progress in the conservation and utilization of cultural relics and the protection and inheritance of cultural heritage. Museums, through the preservation, research and display of ancient artifacts, have become memorials of civilization for future generations.With the gate tower in the north and the archery tower in the south, Zhengyangmen, a key marker on the Beijing Central Axis, is the largest among all the gates of the inner and outer cities of Beijing during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.Though the site witnessed the traditional way of urban management and played a crucial role in military defense and ceremonies during the imperial period, the area experienced major changes after the monarchy ended.To identify its status quo as a reference for the studies of the Beijing Central Axis, archaeologists have excavated the Zhengyang Bridge site in two phases since 2021. To their joy, the bridge is still there, intact and well-sealed beneath the busy traffic of today.At the announcement of the Beijing Central Axis being inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List on Saturday, celebrations were hosted at the Beijing Central Axis Protection Foundation and the China Millennium Monument in Beijing.Attendees first gathered at the Beijing Central Axis Protection Foundation's headquarters and watched a livestream broadcast of the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee in New Delhi, India.The moment of the inscription was observed with a group singing the classic song Singing of Our Motherland and a commemorative envelope.At the China Millennium Monument, where a seal carving exhibition focusing on the Beijing Central Axis is being held, teenagers from Beijing's music troupes performed in string quartets and group songs and dances.Mei Song, secretary-general of the foundation, awarded the young participants certificates to commend their efforts in promoting the Central Axis.The celebrations were co-hosted by the foundation and Beijing Gehua Culture Development Group and organized by Beijing Gehua Cultural Center.One day in the early 1920s, Luo Yinggong (1872-1924), one of China's most talented playwright-cum-Peking Opera impresarios of the time, bought an unpainted folding fan from a powerful collector-official with 40 gold ingots.The main ribs of the fan are carved out of a special type of bamboo whose round, dark-colored patterns, resulting from microorganism infection, were reputed to have been formed as the sad tears of two bereaved ladies fell on the plant.They were grieving the death of their husband, the legendary Emperor Shun whom some Chinese historians believe lived between 2200 and 2300 BC.Equipped with the fan, Luo then knocked on the door of the much-revered painter Qi Baishi (1864-1957), whose brilliantly painted pair of butterflies would later appear on one side of the fan, along with his calligraphic transcription of a butterfly-themed poem by another of his equally renowned contemporaries.There was now only one thing left to do: to record the event on the other side of the fan, which Luo did himself, noting that the fan "was meant as a birthday gift for Mr Mei" (Mei Lanfang, a master performer of Peking Opera).Having written in the same inscription that "a thing (of beauty) will certainly be passed down across generations", Luo probably wouldn't be surprised when the fan was put up for bid nearly 90 years later during an auction held in Beijing in November 2011, where it fetched 3.22 million yuan ($444,100).Yang Danxia, an expert on ancient Chinese painting from Beijing's Palace Museum, was at the auction preview."If anything, the story offers glimpses into a rather exclusive circle populated by Beijing's cultural elite at the time," she says.One gathering place for its members was Lai Jin Yu Xuan Tea House, located today inside the former imperial altar-turned Zhongshan Park in central Beijing. The name of the tea house is a reference to a piece of writing by eighth-century poet Du Fu, on friendship."It was no coincidence that the tea house was where the daily activity of dou shanzi (fan contest) took place," says Yang.According to her, a person entered his fan into this contest the moment he stepped into the tea house, the arrival announced by the crisp snap of a fan opening at a flick of the owner's wrist."Think about a Rolls-Royce coming to a halt in front of a luxury hotel, with its powerful engine letting out a deep roar. What that car did for its owner, a fan could do," she says.A folding fan, apart from fanning gentle waves of cool air, could also be a veritable work of art, a statement accessory testifying to the standing of its carrier, especially in cultural circles."That's what set the folding fan apart from other types of fans that had appeared in Chinese history. For example, the circular-shaped tuanshan, or palace fan, was used almost exclusively by women," says Yang.According to Yang, despite their modern usage, both the folding fan and the palace fan probably originated as items of etiquette.Held up to face level, they served as small screens between a fan holder and another person who was most likely in a much-higher position, so that the former wouldn't be looking up directly into the latter's eyes during a meeting between the two.  Master artisans dedicated to a craft established deep in the national psyche, Zhao Xu reports.Editor's note: Traditional arts and crafts are supreme samples of Chinese cultural heritage. China Daily is publishing this series to show how master artisans are using dedication and innovation to inject new life into heritage. In this installment, we delve into the cultural roots of folding fans.Nearly three decades have passed, but 57-year-old Xu Jiadong still remembers the day when he first went into a bamboo forest with his father to "handpick the ones that he would later use to make the ribs of folding fans".It was in early January in Anji county of eastern China's Zhejiang province, where a special type of bamboo known as yu zhu, or "jade bamboo", grows in abundance.Chinese folding fan, a symbol of grace and a piece of art in its own right, has established itself deep in the national psyche. It’s not just something to drive away the summer heat, but a portable piece of art almost every detail of which is dictated by the sensibilities of Chinese literati group.Work on the Jiankou section of the Great Wall takes a new approach to restoring its former beauty.The Great Wall of China, which runs for more than 21,000 kilometers along the country's northern frontier, stands as a testament to human ingenuity. Each summer, it draws thousands of international visitors to Beijing that are eager to scale the wall and marvel at its grandeur.Yet, popular and well-maintained sections like Badaling and Mutianyu represent but a small portion of the structure. Rugged terrain and isolation have left other stretches dubbed "wild walls "in disrepair. This particularly applies to the Jiankou Great Wall, which despite climbing bans, still lures the intrepid.The Great Wall protection project launched in September 2016 by the China Foundation for Cultural Heritage Conservation and the Tencent Foundation aims to prevent further damage and preserve the Jiankou section for future generations. It is supported by the Beijing Municipal Cultural Heritage Bureau and Huairou district's cultural and tourism bureau.  The essence and luster of nature are transformed into stylish, practical garments that are deeply symbolic to the Dong ethnic group of Guizhou province, Lin Qi reports.Ethnic costumes in China combine rich colors and patterns with style, and their distinctive beauty and grace dazzle people entering a village inhabited by the Dong ethnic group. If they do, they may be fortunate enough to see women making monochromatic dark blue fabric with a metallic sheen that they themselves wear.It is known as liangbu (bright cloth), a special textile that takes a dozen steps to make, and which is a glittering example of handmade Dong cloth.A centuries-old example of Chinese urban planning and architecture has received global recognition.The 46th session of the World Heritage Committee in New Delhi, India, announced on Saturday that the Beijing Central Axis — "A Building Ensemble Exhibiting the Ideal Order of the Chinese Capital" — has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, becoming China's 59th World Heritage Site.The Central Axis in Beijing is an ensemble of palaces, public buildings and gardens that governs the overall layout of the old city area of the Chinese capital.Stretching 7.8 kilometers north to south through the heart of Beijing, the newly inscribed World Heritage Site comprises 15 components. At the northern end of the axis are the Bell Tower and Drum Tower. It then runs south through Wanning Bridge, Jingshan Hill, the Forbidden City, the Upright Gate, the Tian'anmen Gate, the Outer Jinshui Bridges, the Tian'anmen Square Complex, the Zhengyangmen Gate, the Southern Section Road Archaeological Sites, before terminating at the Yongdingmen Gate at the southern end, the Imperial Ancestral Temple, the Altar of Land and Grain. The Temple of Heaven, and the Altar of the God of Agriculture are located on the east and west sides of the Axis.The complex comprises imperial palaces and gardens, imperial sacrificial buildings, ancient city management facilities, national ceremonial and public buildings and remains of the original central axis roads."It is an important symbol that embodies prominent characteristics of Chinese civilization, highlighting Beijing's exceptional status among the famous ancient capitals of the world," Li Qun, director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, said in an interview with China Global Television Network on Saturday in New Delhi."It has had a profound impact on the history of urban planning and construction worldwide and serves as a Chinese case for the preservation and sustainable protection of ancient capitals," Li added.Construction of the Central Axis began in the 13th century and was completed in the 16th century. It has undergone constant refinement over the past centuries and continues to influence Beijing's urban development to this day.The World Heritage Committee acknowledged that the Central Axis in Beijing meets the World Heritage List selectioncriteria No 3 and No 4: It bears unique or exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization that is living or has disappeared, and is an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape that illustrates significant stage or stages in human history.Ernesto Ottone, UNESCO's assistant director-general for culture, speaking at a celebratory event in New Delhi later on Saturday, said that Beijing's intricate urban planning draws inspiration from Confucian philosophy with a history spanning thousands of years and which flourishes even today. The preservation and design of urban heritage are not only about protecting the past but also about constructing a better future, he added.According to the National Cultural Heritage Administration, the Central Axis in Beijing provides exceptional material testimony to the philosophy of "neutrality and harmony" prized in Chinese tradition. It is an outstanding example representing the mature stage of the urban central axis of Chinese capitals, and also the best-preserved capital central axis in China."(The Beijing Central Axis) is the product of some of the best urban planning in history," said Christa Reicher, a professor at RWTH Aachen University in Germany and a UNESCO chair for cultural heritage and urbanism, in an interview with Xinhua. "It is regarded as the 'spine of the city's culture' and a magnet for tourists from all over the world."Lyu Zhou, director of the National Heritage Center at Tsinghua University, said that this paradigm of city planning can be traced back to Kaogongji (Book of Diverse Crafts), a section of the Confucian classic Rites of Zhou that was compiled more than 2,000 years ago. The milestone work outlines the rituals and order in the planning of a capital city.The Forbidden City and the markets at the Bell Tower and Drum Tower area correspond to the book's account of "court in the front, market in the back". The tome speaks of "an ancestral temple on the left, an altar of land and grain on the right", which is reproduced in the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Altar of Land and Grain, located symmetrically on the east and west sides of the Central Axis."It is a carrier of traditional Chinese concepts and beliefs, constructing a symbol for national order and witnessing the formation of the Chinese cultural tradition of inclusion and diversity," Lyu said.Between 2020 and 2023, an action plan for comprehensive protection of the axis was put into practice. Various efforts including renovation of historical buildings, related archaeological research, improvement of the environment, and activities to encourage wide participation of the public in this process followed."Through this process, the historical pattern and historical charm of the Central Axis in Beijing are gradually being restored and vividly reproduced, with continuous improvement in the living environment and urban landscape along the axis," said Chu Jianhao, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Office for Conservation and Management of Beijing Central Axis."The inscription marks a new starting point. China will adhere to the World Heritage Convention, and continue making efforts to protect and restore heritage buildings, mitigate the impact of natural disasters, encourage public participation, strategically guide tourism development, and improve the capabilities of property interpretation and presentation," Li from the National Cultural Heritage Administration vowed at the session in New Delhi on Saturday."China will continue to coordinate the management and protection of World Heritage Sites, strengthen exchange and cooperation with international organizations and other signatory countries … and contribute to promoting cultural exchange and mutual learning and building a community with a shared future for mankind," he added.Various activities to celebrate the inscription of the Central Axis on the UNESCO World Heritage List were held across Beijing over the weekend.Beijing Central Axis runs north-south through the heart of the old city of Beijing, totaling 7.8 kilometers in length. It was initially constructed in the 13th century and shaped in the 16th century. With continuous refinement over seven centuries, Beijing Central Axis is an ensemble of building complexes and archeological sites that governs the overall layout of the old city.At the northern end of the Axis are the Bell and Drum Towers; it then runs south through the Wanning Bridge and the Jingshan Hill, the Forbidden City, the Upright Gate, the Tian'anmen Gate, the Outer Jinshui Bridges, the Tian'anmen Square Complex, the Zhengyangmen Gate, the Southern Section Road Archeological Sites, to the Yongdingmen Gate at the southern terminus of the Axis. The Imperial Ancestral Temple, the Altar of Land and Grain, the Temple of Heaven, and the Altar of the God of Agriculture are located on the east and west sides of the Axis.Along the Axis there are imperial palaces and gardens, imperial sacrificial buildings, ancient urban management facilities, national ceremonial and public buildings, and roads. It has formed a magnificent urban architectural complex, witnessing the ideal order of capital cities that has influenced the buildings of traditional Chinese cities for more than two thousands years.The Yungang Grottoes in Datong, Shanxi province, are a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site. Existing for nearly 1,600 years, the caves are deemed "history engraved on stones" by Hang Kan, director of the Yungang Research Institute, formerly known as the Yungang Grottoes Research Institute."We must protect, study, present and pass the history down to future generations," Hang is quoted as telling Shanxi Daily. Hang says the team is enlarging the range of protection and delving into the details by applying more scientific methods and advanced technology.Advances in DNA technology increasingly enable the writing and rewriting of the past, Fang Aiqing and Xu Xiaomin report.Wen Shaoqing's work is about breaking boundaries and exploring where his imagination leads him. Journalists have been chasing the molecular biologist-turned-archaeologist since September when his team at Fudan University's Institute for Archaeological Science uncovered the touching stories hidden in the remains of unidentified martyrs of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45) and the subsequent War of Liberation (1946-49).The team's efforts involving forensic DNA techniques continue to this day in the hope that relatives of these obscure heroes will finally be able to find long-lost family members.Wen, who is an associate professor at the institute, has also been involved in research such as analyzing the dietary habits of an ancient emperor and his queen and the causes of their deaths, as well as the interaction and integration of ancient ethnic groups in what is now northern China.As his team's more interesting findings become known to the public, especially those involving the analysis of ancient DNA, the potential of archaeological science to solve long-standing historical mysteries becomes more widely recognized in China.Individual grains may be small in size, but the story of salt reflects a grand picture of economics, politics, and national governance in China.The famous debate held in the imperial court of the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24) in 81 BC, Discourses on Salt and Iron, kept high officials and scholars arguing for months over economic policies, beginning with whether to maintain monopolies on producers of salt and iron.Throughout Chinese history, a variety of key positions and facilities were set up around the country, particularly along the Grand Canal, to strictly supervise and manage production, transportation and sale of this crucial ingredient, which is closely tied to the lifeblood of the economy.Archaeological work in Yancheng, Jiangsu province, is gradually yielding evidence of the long epic of salt. Yancheng itself means "city of salt "in Chinese, and the roots of the city's name lie beneath the ground.According to Chen Gang, a researcher with the Jiangsu Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, which oversaw the recent excavations in Yancheng, a series of key findings concerning the ancient salt industry have been made in this coastal city between the Yellow Sea and the Grand Canal.The ancient Chinese had a poetic term to describe the coastal salt industry, referring to it as "boiling the ocean".As Chen said during a recent news conference at the National Cultural Heritage Administration in Beijing, archaeological findings at the Shajingtou site, which is located on a sandy ridge near the coast, include well-organized Western Han Dynasty roads, a dense network of water wells, large-scale drainage facilities, as well as the ruins of houses and other significant remains."Excavations have yielded a large number of roof tiles, bricks, and everyday pottery," Chen says. "Additionally, more than 10 Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) architectural ruins and tombs have been discovered around the site."It is believed that the area was the site of the county seat of Yandu, which is mentioned in the Book of Han, a history book of the Western Han compiled by Ban Gu in the 2nd century, as well as in other key historical documents. The architectural remains found at Shajingtou may have been official buildings belonging to the Yandu county government, which is listed in historical documents as a crucial salt-producing hub. Chen says that the new findings offer physical evidence of the significance of salt in Western Han Dynasty society.Structure provides new insight into a once thriving and pivotal society, Mao Weihua in Urumqi and Chen Meiling report.A newly opened museum at an ancient tomb site in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region allows visitors to observe a key ancient city state on the Silk Road from up close.Visitors thus learn about social structures, religious beliefs, artistic styles and daily life of the state, known in ancient documents as Qiuci, or as Kucha.The Qiuci Wei and Jin Ancient Tomb Site Museum, built underground in the downtown area of Kuqa city in Aksu prefecture, officially opened to the public on July 15. By building the museum on the actual site itself, fragile remains can be better preserved from damage, according to the museum.Qiuci was a city-state oasis on the southern edge of the Tarim Basin that dates back to the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24). Due to its environmental and geographical advantages, it occupied a special position in cultural exchange in today's Xinjiang region, and even across the Eurasian continent. It had close political and economic exchanges with dynasties in the Central China Plains region, which governed the oasis from the Western Han period.The second Annual Conference on the Preservation of China's Intangible Cultural Heritage kicked off in Yaohu Town, Yixing, Jiangsu province, on Saturday.The three-day event featured forums gathering experts to discuss better preservation methods, salons for different generations of heritage inheritors and a market showcasing hundreds of relevant projects from across the country.At the event's opening ceremony, a book on the current state of intangible cultural heritage dissemination was released. Based on internet dissemination data from various regions, categories, levels of inheritors and heritage activities, the book summarizes the efforts on preserving and transmitting intangible cultural heritage last year and suggestions for further improving heritage promotion efforts.Meanwhile, Anda Union, an ensemble from Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, showcased humai, a throat-singing technique, and played the horse-head fiddle, which opened the ceremony's intangible cultural heritage performances. Following this, arts such as Kunqu Opera and acrobatics were performed, providing the audience with a visual and auditory feast.During the event, walking through the streets and lanes of the Yaohu scenic area, visitors experienced an immersive feast of intangible cultural heritage, featuring hundreds of national and provincial representative projects from across the country, including various culinary arts, traditional operas, dances and handicrafts.The Grand Canal of China spans 3,200km and has a history of more than 2,500 years, making it the biggest, longest and most enduring canal in the world. It can be described as a treasure of Chinese civilization and an epic passed down on the vast land of China, continuing to play an important role to this day. 2025 marks the tenth anniversary of China's successful bid to inscribe the Grand Canal as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Over the past decade, new progress has been made in the preservation, inheritance and utilization of the Grand Canal. The eight provinces bordering the Grand Canal have built a splendid cultural belt, a green and ecological belt, and a colorful tourist belt along the canal, boasting countless breathtaking sights that witness the canal's history, current status and future. This ancient relic has renewed its charm after undergoing restoration and protection; the "new arrivals" in museums and the "talking" historical and cultural relics play a crucial role in preserving the culture of the Grand Canal. Let's delve into and draw inspiration from the long history, blend it with modern fashion, and create picture scrolls with our creativity.What sparks will ignite when precious cultural relics and heritage inherited through a millennium collide with a canal chic?To celebrate the tenth anniversary of China's successful bid to inscribe the Grand Canal as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, China Daily Website launches Canal Chic: Reviving China's Heritage to call for creative visual works worldwide.

Though their names may be similar, the finished results are vastly different.A far cry from the vibrantly contrasted coloring of Qinghua porcelain, Qingbai porcelain has a more reserved quality."It is blue as the sky, bright as jade, thin as paper, and resonant like a chime," says Wang Shangbin, who for decades, has been committed to restoring the Qingbai porcelain, which dates back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279)."In appearance, it is characterized by its translucent glaze, which glows white with a hint of green here, and green with a hint of white there, giving it a jade-like quality," he says.The porcelain is also known for its hidden relief patterns, which become visible from both inside and out, when held up to the light, he adds.Historical records show that during the Song Dynasty, Qingbai porcelain was widely produced in most parts of southern China. As one of the first varieties of porcelain, it laid a technical foundation for the development of others, including Qinghua, as well as red underglaze, red and green overglaze, and famille rose (fencai or yangcai in Chinese, a kind of porcelain painted mostly in shades of pink).The artisan, who is in his early 60s, leads a tranquil life that mainly revolves around Qingbai porcelain. He drives to his workshop in Jingdezhen after breakfast to begin making porcelain with a group of like-minded masters of the craft.They have reproduced many Song Dynasty-style porcelain items, some of which have been collected by domestic museums and purchased by collectors from abroad.Born and raised in Jingdezhen, Wang has been immersed in ceramics and its culture and history for most of his life.During the 1980s, he followed cultural heritage and museology expert Gong Mingxun in studying ancient porcelain, and at first, focused on studying and appreciating porcelain from the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.That was until 1989, when two Qingbai porcelain cups at an antique market in Shanghai caught his eye. They were being sold by a fellow Jiangxi native, and were a revelation to Wang, who wasn't aware of the existence of Qingbai at that point.More than 200 years ago, an opera troupe from what is now Anhui province journeyed to Beijing, the capital city, to commemorate Emperor Qianlong's birthday during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). This historical event led to the birth of Peking Opera.Based on the attire of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties, the costumes of Peking Opera underwent a transformation spanning over 200 years. Enriched by the diverse cultural influences from different regions across the country, these costumes evolved into a sophisticated set of elaborate, detailed and majestic dress codes.Costumes are crucial to the artistic beauty of Peking Opera, supporting character portrayals and enhancing the performance's expressiveness.Upon a performer's entrance onto the stage, seasoned spectators can quickly discern the character portrayed based on the attire and makeup. When several performers appear, it is also easy to tell the strata they belong to in the social hierarchy, especially in the stories set in ancient China, in Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, for example."Traditionally, Peking Opera repertoire includes 3,000 stories set in Tang and 800 set in Song, as well as numerous in eras such as the Warring States Period (475-221 BC), Ming and Qing. The presentation of so many stories relies solely on costumes packed in the limited costume trunks owned by a troupe," said author Liu Fei at the recent book launch ceremony of Huafu Nichang (Gorgeous Attire and Iridescent Clothing: On Peking Opera Costumes) in Beijing.The International Symposium on Cultural Heritage Conservation by Digitization 2024 was held in Beijing.Themed "Re-shape: Digital Heritage Driven by Technological Innovation", the seventh symposium, from Tuesday to Friday, focused on new technology and models and featured sessions on themes, such as historical towns, artificial intelligence, digitization for grottoes, archaeological sites and an international communication platform for the archaeological site of Sanxingdui.Over 300 representatives of more than 200 universities, institutions and enterprises from 20 countries and regions attended the symposium which was jointly organized by Tsinghua University, Beijing's Haidian district government, and CIPA HD.CIPA HD was founded in 1968 as the Comite International de la Photogrammetrie Architecturale (International Committee of Architectural Photogrammetry). Its aims are to promote architectural photogrammetry, to contribute to its technical development, and to ensure contacts between photogrammetrists and those who commission or use photogrammetric surveys of buildings in architecture. It hopes to conserve and document cultural heritage in all possible forms and its original name was changed to CIPA Heritage Documentation.The symposium aimed to promote high-quality development in cultural heritage conservation through technological innovation, international cooperation and cultural exchanges.

One such city is Huai'an in Jiangsu province, once an important station, the fortunes of which waxed and waned with those of the waterway. Archaeological efforts between 2021 and 2023 at three sites in Huai'an — Qingchengmen, Xinlu and Banzhazhen — along the Grand Canal from south to north, shed light on ancient city life during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, scholars told a National Cultural Heritage Administration news conference in Beijing on Friday.The first site, Qingchengmen, or the Qingcheng Gate, was the western gate of Jiucheng, a city located in present-day Huai'an. Historical literature shows that construction of the original gate began during the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420). During subsequent dynasties, it underwent several rounds of reconstruction, says Zhao Libo, deputy director of the Huai'an Institute of Cultural Relics Preservation and Archaeology.Archaeologists have discovered the gate, city walls, wengcheng (a type of defensive enclosure outside a city gate) and a drainage system, as well as more than 80 artifacts, including inscribed bricks and stone building units in the 3,000-square-meter excavation area."Studies show the existing gate and wengcheng were built during the Ming Dynasty," Zhao says, adding that archaeologists have gained some understanding of the structure, development and history of the gate from the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907-960) to the Qing Dynasty, as well as of how it was constructed.Dong Xinlin, a researcher at the Institute of Archaeology with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, says that since the gate existed for such a long time, it has the potential to contribute important information to the study of the evolution of ancient city gates.For its part, the second site at Xinlu presents a vivid picture of a well-preserved street with a clear layout. It is located in ancient Hexia town, which is known to have been a salt distribution center during the Ming Dynasty, before being destroyed by flooding at the end of the period.A 4-meter-wide road that extends for 75 meters is a highlight discovered at the site. It was used over a long period of time, probably for transporting goods, and underwent multiple repairs, Zhao says.Foundations, probably of shops and residences, line both sides of the road. Archaeologists have excavated one complex not far from the road, and have discovered that it had a shop on the street, as well as rooms to the rear and a courtyard, probably for the residential use of shopkeepers.The site has yielded many pieces of ceramic, mostly blue and white porcelain, and 370 everyday articles can be reassembled.Lin Liugen, an archaeology professor at Zhejiang University, says he was impressed by what he saw. "When people visit the site, they will see that the road is still visible, so are the thresholds of each household. These elements will help them imagine the lively ambiance of the street," Lin says.Zhao says that archaeologists believe the road was related to the salt trade in Hexia town during the Ming Dynasty.The third site, Banzhazhen, or Banzha town, was named after a banzha, a water lock to regulate canal levels, and was built during the Ming Dynasty. Records show a tax office was established in the town to collect tariffs. Nearly half of the town's residents were engaged with tax-related work during the Ming and Qing dynasties.However, the town was destroyed by a flood during the reign of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty.Archaeologists have found 61 complex foundations, 18 roads, two wooden bridges and one tomb. The largest complex foundation is believed to belong to a Buddhist temple, as the tomb of a monk was found within.In the southwest of the excavation area is a complex foundation believed to belong to a restaurant, since a cooking stove was found along with bowls, plates and cups."With the support of waterway facilities and local government institutions, and the advantage of combining canal transportation, salt transportation and tax inspection, these sites primarily thrived on commerce and in the service industries, and formed a town cluster along the Grand Canal in Huai'an," Zhao says. "Their existence was connected to the canal, reflecting the transformations of waterways ...and the evolving dynamics of relationships between humans and the environment during the Ming and Qing dynasties."wangru1@chinadaily.com.cnRecently unearthed ruins of a buried Northern Song city reveal a fascinating saga, Wang Kaihao reports.Probably one of the most famous Chinese landscape paintings, Along the River During the Qingming Festival is synonymous with the prosperous past of Kaifeng.As portrayed in the milestone Northern Song (960-1127) scroll by Zhang Zeduan, who served at the imperial court, this city in present-day Henan province was then at its zenith.A booming economy, vibrant culture, and ultimate political status, thanks to its role as the national capital, characterized this metropolis of more than 1 million. However, wars, the sands of time, and frequent inundation by the Yellow River, condemned that flourishing era to history.Archaeologists have been working to uncover the long-buried stories of Kaifeng, which was also known as Dongjing ("the eastern capital") during the Northern Song period, and the recent study of the surroundings of the ruins of a city gate yielded crucial clues.As attested to in many historical documents, Jinglong Gate, which translates as "the gate to worship the dragon", was originally set in Kaifeng's inner city wall.According to the Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendor), a nostalgic memoir written by Meng Yuanlao around the time when the Northern Song period ended, the square-shaped inner city had a perimeter of about 10 kilometers, and Jinglong Gate was the middle of three gates set in the inner north wall.Beginning last year, researchers from the Henan Provincial Institute of Cultural Heritage and Archaeology and the Kaifeng Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology focused on excavating the ruins, unearthing the city gate, whose front facade spans 60 meters, in the process.This figure is equal to the dimensions of the Meridian Gate, or the southern entry to Beijing's Forbidden City, which visitors can see today."Jinglong Gate is the largest and highest-level city gate from the Northern Song period we've excavated so far," Wang Sanying, deputy director of the Kaifeng institute and leader of the project, told a National Cultural Heritage Administration news conference held to publicize the new findings in Beijing on Friday.The exhibition On Top of the Pyramid: The Civilization of Ancient Egypt will open to the public at the Shanghai Museum on Friday, marking a significant milestone in cultural exchange between China and Egypt.This showcase, which runs for the next 13 months, is the first exhibition of ancient Egyptian art curated by Chinese scholars and researchers.Hailed as the largest exhibition of ancient Egyptian artifacts ever held outside their native country, the exhibition represents a pioneering collaboration between an official Chinese museum and the Egyptian government, said Chu Xiaobo, director of the Shanghai Museum, at the opening ceremony on Wednesday."This is the largest exhibition that ever traveled from Egypt to come here to China. We value our relationship with China, especially with the Shanghai Museum," said Mohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities.The exhibition encompasses 492 sets of more than 780 selected artifacts from different periods of ancient Egyptian civilization, sourced from seven renowned Egyptian museums and including the latest archaeological discoveries. Remarkably, over 95 percent of these artifacts will be making their debut in Asia."The most meaningful aspect of this exhibition is that our team curated the theme and artifacts based on research by our Chinese scholars into ancient Egyptian civilization, and we selected all 788 objects featured ourselves," said Li Feng, deputy director of the Shanghai Museum.To provide a fitting showcase for this special exhibition, the Shanghai Museum has renovated and repurposed three exhibition halls to create a total exhibition space of 3,000 square meters. Through the display area, visitors will embark on a journey through three independent narratives: The Land of the Pharaohs, The Secrets of Saqqara, and The Age of Tutankhamun.Zhong Xiaomin, an official from the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Culture and Tourism, said the exhibition illustrates the continuous expansion of cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and Egypt, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership and the China-Egypt Partnership Year."We believe that this pioneering exhibition about ancient Egyptian civilization will vividly enact a dialogue across time between two ancient civilizations and will serve as an exemplary instance of exchanges and mutual learning among world civilizations," said Zhong.Li Junfeng contributed to this story.An exhibition showcasing the craftsmanship of tribute bricks from Linqing, Liaocheng city of East China's Shandong province, opened at Prince Kung's Palace Museum in Beijing on Tuesday. The exhibition will run until Aug 11.The exhibition presents tribute bricks from the museum's collection and connects their historical origins from Linqing with those used in the construction of Prince Gong's Mansion in Beijing.The exhibition offers a panoramic display of official architectural construction techniques, including the eight major crafts — tiling, woodwork, earthwork, stonework, timberwork, painting, decorative painting and pasting.These techniques encompass exquisite skills and are cultural treasures passed down through oral instruction and rich practical experience by ancient craftsmen.Tiling, which involves bricklaying and tile-hanging techniques, is showcased in Prince Gong's Mansion through magnificent green glazed tiles, exquisite brick carvings and perfectly aligned walls and pavements.Linqing bricks are present in multiple historical sites in the capital city, including the Palace Museum, Temple of Heaven, various city gate towers, Confucian temples, and the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) imperial tombs.The audience can follow the history of the Grand Canal through which the tribute bricks were delivered, better understand the role of the bricks in Prince Gong's palace, and immerse themselves in the process of brick making at the museum.Zhang Shuangmin might look a bit haphazard as she drips pigment onto a square container of water. The pigments immediately disperse into small circles once they touch the surface of the transparent liquid, and without wasting any time, Zhang swirls them with an awl in seemingly casual movements.As minutes pass, the random arrangement of pigments begins to take shape and eventually evolves into stunning floral patterns.A bigger surprise comes when she gently places a white porcelain plate into the water and lifts it in slow motion. The pattern then magically transfers onto the plate.This procedure never fails to elicit a gasp of amazement from her audience.This type of printing art is known as tangliucai (Tang flowing colors), and Zhang, 53, has practiced the craft for more than three decades."It requires calculation and precision every step of the way," says Zhang, who was born and raised in Xi'an, Shaanxi province."I need to have a design in mind before execution. If I want a pattern to appear in warm colors, I need to plan ahead and use cool colors for the background."I also have to consider beforehand if I will place it on a folding or round fan, a porcelain plate, silk, leather, or any other medium, which will determine the composition of the pattern and ultimately the success of the work."Years of practice has seen Zhang develop a strong leaning toward bringing out Tang Dynasty (618-907) elements when practicing the craft of tangliucai, which was named an intangible cultural heritage in Xi'an in 2020."I want it to match the historical thickness of the art, which boasts a long history," Zhang says.Zhang was first attracted to a rough version of the craft from her grandmother, who would steep various fabrics into dyes, resulting in intriguing patterns.This childhood predisposition to the dyeing art prompted her to pursue design and environmental art at a local art institute in the 1990s, when she got to know her grandmother's daily life production might be associated with the ancient water-printing technique.In Youyang Zazu (The Miscellaneous Morsels From Youyang), a compilation of diverse social and folk narratives by Tang Dynasty writer Duan Chengshi, an ancient technique of coloring paper on water was detailed.Experts regard this collection as the earliest documentation of the historical roots of the practice.Then, in the compilation titled Four Treasures of a Scholar's Study by Song Dynasty (960-1279) scholar Su Yijian, a kind of decorative paper called liushajian, meaning flowing-sand notepaper, was mentioned of being made in what is now Sichuan province.According to this collection, the process of notepaper production involved pulling a sheet of paper through a fermented flour paste combined with an array of colors, resulting in spontaneous and asymmetrical patterns.Furthermore, the compilation described an alternative method using a paste derived from a regional plant blended with croton oil and diluted with water.Ginger extract was subsequently employed to scatter the hues. Then a hairbrush was used to create designs resembling human figures, clouds or flying birds.These intricate designs were then transferred onto a paper surface, showcasing the artistry and skill of the creators."It was so fascinating, yet a great pity," Zhang says about the fact that the art form failed to prosper and was almost on the brink of extinction in the country.As she delved further into her research, she discovered that this art form had transcended borders and acquired unique local characteristics, such as in Turkiye, where the marbling art known as Ebru was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO in 2014.She made a point to pursue the art through scraps of information from historical documents."Many people said it had died. It is not true since we can still find the water-printing technique continuously being applied in marbling Xuan paper," Zhang says.Handmade Xuan paper, or rice paper, was originally produced during the Tang Dynasty in Jingxian county in today's Anhui province, and calligraphy and painting artists have put a premium on it ever since.With an art background, Zhang managed to piece together bits of information and restore the craft through consultations from experts and her own expertise. "Imagine the anticipation as you approach an exhibit dedicated to ancient civilizations. It's a moment akin to hearing the opening chords of a favorite melody," says singer-songwriter Liu Lian, when asked about her recent visit to Henan Museum in Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan province."It's just like the songs of your favorite singer that you've listened to hundreds of times. The artifacts, once distant images in textbooks, are now right in front of you in tangible form," she adds. "Each visit to a museum unfolds like a song, with artifacts resonating like familiar tunes, stirring memories and emotions."The 34-year-old, who rose to fame as one of the members of the pop duo, Mr Miss, graduated from the School of Archaeology and Museology, Peking University, in 2012.Despite her career in music, Liu says that she has always enjoyed visiting museums around the world and is enchanted by artifacts from thousands of years ago.While at the Henan Museum, she saw the Jiahu bone flute. Unearthed from Jiahu Site in Wuyang county, Henan, it is one of the most spectacular objects in the museum's collection, and attracts lots of visitors.The introduction that guides from the museum gave her about the bone flute was intriguing. They said that about 8,700 years ago, a red-crowned crane died and one of the bones from its wing was turned into a flute by drilling holes in it to make music.When Liu was invited to a live performance of the Huaxia Ancient Music Orchestra, the museum's resident ensemble, which is known for reviving ancient musical traditions and which performs using 10 replicas of ancient musical instruments from the museum, she was able to hear a duplicate of the Jiahu flute in action."Like many other artifacts in the museum, these silent objects speak volumes about the lives lived centuries ago. Thanks to the orchestra and the people who replicated ancient musical instruments, we are able to enjoy the sound of instruments from thousands of years ago, which is a magical experience," she says."Much like a masterful conductor interpreting Mozart or Beethoven, historians and curators meticulously present these artifacts to resonate with visitors, turning the museum visit into an immersive experience, and reconnecting us with icons of history in a profoundly personal manner," she adds. "I couldn't help wondering who originally played those instruments, and when, where, and who they played for."Besides the Jiahu flute, Liu also enjoyed performances on other ancient replicas, such as a drum and a panpipe. Even more exciting for her was the opportunity to play a set of replica bianzhong (bronze chime bells) from the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC).Standing in front of the bianzhong, which were hanging from a wooden frame, Liu struck them with a wooden mallet. Under the guidance of Huo Kun, head of the orchestra, she quickly learned how to play simple notes, with each bell producing two different tones depending on where they are struck.She was also told that the bianzhong, which were used as polyphonic instruments, were an important part of Chinese ritual and court music going back to ancient times. To make their performances more attractive to young people, the orchestra has adapted popular songs, including from Harry Potter soundtracks. This prompted Liu to play some of her songs on the instrument."It was so inspiring. Seeing these artifacts up close in the museum, admiring their craftsmanship, and pondering the lives of those who made and used them offered me a deeper understanding of history's multifaceted tapestry. Now, I want to record the sound of them to use in my own work," Liu says. "It will be a beautiful combination, and will allow more people to enjoy sounds that are ancient, and yet still charming."She also says that the visit to Henan Museum reminded her of university, when her teacher would take the class on field trips to experience excavations firsthand and make records of archaeological sites.The 10th Nishan Forum on World Civilizations, held on July 10-11 in Qufu, Shandong province, brought together nearly 400 international guests from 63 countries, aiming to draw wisdom from traditional culture to better address global challenges and advance human civilization.The two-day event sparked in-depth discussions on various topics, including civilizational exchanges and mutual learning amid global challenges, and the preservation and development of traditional civilization in the modernization process.Check out some of the insights from the event.What if a 9,000-year bone flute could be used in the performance of contemporary music, like the themes of the Harry Potter movies, or online games like League of Legends? By using replicas of cultural relics, such as a bone flute and bianzhong (chime bells), the Huaxia Ancient Music Orchestra of the Henan Museum has already made it happen, and become one of the institution's major attractions.To check out China Daily's online exclusive interview with the orchestra and singer-songwriter Liu Lian, and to hear the sound of the past, today, just click the video. In 1998, a Javanese fisherman who planned to collect sea cucumbers in the waters off Belitung Island, Indonesia, accidentally came across some ceramic items, thus leading to the uncovering of a shipwreck sunken for more than 1,200 years.This dramatic discovery was just the beginning of a tale of lost treasures reclaimed. The shipwreck was found to contain more than 56,000 Changsha ware, providing a glimpse into the ancient global trade between the Arab world and China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907), a period of China's imperial era renowned for its flourishing culture.It was the continuous warfare during mid-to-late Tang Dynasty in the northern area of the empire that first led craftsmen to migrate southward to the verdant Changsha region, bringing with them the latest ceramic production techniques. Fired in the Tongguan Kilns on the outskirts of the commercial hub of Changsha, the Changsha ware industry thrived for over 200 years through the 8th and 9th centuries. Connected with major sea ports through a network of waterways, the Kilns has enabled the exports of its products to East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia and North Africa. The heavy and fragile ceramics, unsuitable for large-scale long-distance land transportation, found a new way for exports, propelling the emergence of the maritime ceramics road.Watch the video to catch a glimpse into a historically prosperous period of maritime trade.Four decades ago, Beijing Daily, the Beijing Evening News, the former Badaling Great Wall special zone administrative office, among other organizations, launched a campaign, under the slogan of "Love China, Restore the Great Wall".The campaign sparked widespread efforts to preserve the Great Wall, including an outpouring of donations made by individuals and organizations from around the world. Cities along the Great Wall, such as Qinhuangdao in Hebei province, Tianjin, and Jiayuguan in Gansu province, also launched fundraising events.On Friday, the project's 40th anniversary, an exhibition opened at the Capital Museum in Beijing that will run through to Aug 31.It presents the trajectory of the campaign and the achievements made in the preservation of the Great Wall.The exhibition displays around 150 artifacts, photographs and textual materials, including work briefs, registers of donations and sponsorships, as well as newspaper clippings, which piece together the project's journey across geographical and temporal boundaries.Su Wenyang, former director of the editorial department at the Beijing Evening News, was the initiator of the project.Working as a reporter, he saw the dilapidated state of the Great Wall, and proposed the campaign to call for public involvement in its protection and restoration, which tapped into a well of goodwill.Upon hearing about the project, Xi Zhongxun, then member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and Deng Xiaoping, then director of the Central Advisory Commission of the CPC, wrote the campaign's slogan in calligraphy, which was published in the Beijing Evening News.The campaign called for the public to make donations according to their means, and organizations and individuals making larger contributions were commemorated by having their names inscribed on monuments near the Great Wall.According to the organizers, more than 10 million people from around China participated in the campaign, and institutions from 26 countries and regions, including Pakistan, Greece and the United States, made donations.Until this day, monuments honoring these contributions and marking the friendly relations between China and other countries can still be found at Great Wall scenic areas."The Great Wall was built by numerous generations of people. Our generation has merely done a bit of restoration and preservation work. Over the past 40 years, through the efforts of countless individuals in various fields, the ancient and once dilapidated Great Wall has been given a new lease on life," Su said at the exhibition's opening ceremony."It has transformed from an ancient defense structure into a symbol of the spirit and culture of the Chinese nation, as well as a must-visit destination for both domestic and international tourists."The sponsorships and widespread attention raised by the campaign accelerated the restoration process of the Great Wall, key sections of which, such as Badaling, Mutianyu and Simatai, were subsequently restored and opened to the public.The exhibition also showcases the advanced technological methods adopted in recent years as part of the wall's reservation efforts, via exhibits including 3D-printed models and multimedia displays.An interactive section is set up at the end of the exhibition, where visitors can leave comments and sign their names for the campaign, collect themed seal stamps, or scan QR codes to share their own stories with the Great Wall or go on virtual tours to the sites."This exhibition not only reflects on the past 40 years of the Great Wall preservation efforts, but also looks forward to the future. Today, the protection, inheritance and utilization of the Great Wall have entered a new era," says Han Zhanming, director of the Capital Museum.In 2019, a general plan was officially released for the protection of the Great Wall, establishing a long-term mechanism for its preservation, and in 2021, a plan was launched to construct the Great Wall National Cultural Park.The Capital Museum is now supporting the renovation and upgrading of the China Great Wall Museum, and the Tencent Foundation, a coorganizer of the exhibition, is working with cultural heritage preservation institutions on the adoption of digital methods for preservation and documentation."Forty years mark a milestone and a new starting point. This is an opportunity to further unite the efforts of all sectors of society, and elevate the cause of Great Wall preservation to new heights," Han says.With dynamic music and catchy lyrics, singers battle each other on stage, in performances that echo modern-day rap. Except that this is something much older and with very different roots.In South China's Hainan province, Danzhou Diaosheng, or Danzhou Rhyming Sounds, is a traditional song-and-dance form that originates in the city of Danzhou. Nicknamed "slow rap" by locals because of its slower rhythm, this national intangible cultural heritage dates back over 2,000 years to the ancient Western Han Dynasty (202 BC-25 AD), but still enjoys popularity today."The music makes you happy because the melodies are cheerful. When you're feeling sulky, singing it can help dispel the negative mood," said Tang Baoshan, a local inheritor of Danzhou Diaosheng, explaining why it is popular."Sometimes people sing the same songs for hours," he added.Locals hold competitions and stage performances, often with no limit placed on the number of participants, from a dozen to tens of thousands of people. "The scenes are quite spectacular, and everyone wants to win their rap battle," said Tang.Tang, 75, started learning the folk songs when he was a child. He soon demonstrated a talent for the form.Later he found a job at a local quarry, where he used to sing while working. Encouraged by his colleagues, Tang began composing songs in 1976, at least 13 of which won local prizes. Three years later, he won the Danzhou Diaosheng competition and rose to fame.However, as time passed, he saw fewer young people willing to learn the art. "I used to earn a living by singing the Danzhou Diaosheng," Tang recalled. "For the younger people, however, the income was too low to attract them."In 2006, Danzhou Diaosheng was included in the first national intangible cultural heritage list. In order to rescue the art, Tang joined with local experts to compile a book of the songs they found by knocking on doors in local communities. More than 1,000 songs were recorded.Also, the city of Danzhou has incorporated the art form into the curriculum of primary schools, hosted art and cultural events featuring Danzhou Diaosheng, and promoted it in tourist attractions.Social media has also helped popularize the ancient art. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tang composed a rap song calling on people to protect themselves, and it went viral online.Thanks to these various efforts, about 85 percent of the residents of Danzhou are familiar with and love Danzhou Diaosheng. Each of the 16 townships is home to at least three troupes, with the city boasting more than 140 troupes of 20 or more members."Danzhou Diaosheng has developed very well, and every village has a big Diaosheng team," Tang said, adding that on the occasion of festivals, worships or marriages, people stage large-scale Diaosheng performances, with men and women standing on both sides and singing against each other.Tang himself directs around 100 Danzhou Diaosheng operas each year, with no less than 250 performances staged, attracting an audience of tens of millions. He has also trained more than 100 rappers, actors and actresses, bringing the art to each and every village.Nowadays, Danzhou Diaosheng has become a pastime for local people. Tang noted that in the future, he will compose not only in the local dialect, but also in Mandarin and English, thereby allowing more people to enjoy it."Danzhou Diaosheng has thousands of years of history, and it is an inseparable part of our Danzhou culture and will never be erased, because people pass it down from generation to generation," Tang said. "We will make it better, and pass it on well."HARBIN — At the Jin Shangjing History Museum in Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang province, a gleaming, thumb-sized silver coin attracts curious visitors. The coin, shaped like a double-bladed axe, has a remarkable history.Minted by the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234) government, it was the first official currency to be made of silver in Chinese history, said Hu Zhiyuan, director of the guidance department of the museum.The engraved traditional Chinese characters on the silver indicated its information, with Cheng'an referring to the name of the era (1196-1200), and baohuo meaning currency, Hu said.The institutions in charge of forging money and its central government management agency were also inscribed on the coin.Hu said its unique appearance and Chinese inscriptions reflected the influence of traditional Chinese culture during the Jin Dynasty, showcasing the integration of ethnic cultures during its century-long reign.The Jin Dynasty, founded by the Jurchen people, ruled over northern and northeastern China, coexisting with the Song, Liao, Yuan and Western Xia regimes that controlled parts of the country during the period.Hu explained that the Jurchens initially made a living by fishing and hunting and would barter within their tribes. However, they later began using bronze coins from the Liao (916-1125) and Song (960-1279) dynasties ruled by the Khitan and Han people, respectively, as trade between their three groups grew.In 1125, after the Jin regime overthrew the Liao rulers and advanced southward into Song territory, a significant influx of currency and craftsmen from the southern part of China reached the Jin's heartland, which had a profound impact on its own monetary system, according to Hu, adding that the shape and the layout of the Chinese inscriptions of some coins from the Song and the Jin dynasties are similar — further evidence of ethnic integration.Hu said that during the century-long interactions between the Song and Jin dynasties, peace prevailed for over 60 years, with the trade of fur, ginseng, tea and textiles flourishing through designated border markets. Peculiar silver coins and ingots of the Jin Dynasty were used and then carried across China."Through such ingots discovered in what is now Lintong district of Xi'an, Shaanxi province, researchers can see close economic and trade exchanges between the Jurchen and other ethnic groups in different regions of China," Hu said.As the abundance of ice and snow in the winter has drawn more and more tourists to Harbin, an increasing number of visitors are flocking to the museum, delving into the lesser-known stories of the Jurchen and other northern Chinese ethnic groups through its artifacts.Mu Changqing, deputy director of the museum's cultural relics preservation department, said the museum welcomed nearly 180,000 visitors from January to June this year, with a peak of 15,023 visitors in a single day.The museum plans to provide multimedia displays, replicate historical scenes and organize educational lectures so visitors can better learn about the history of the Jin Dynasty and the cultures of different ethnic groups.Among 86-year-old Guo Dashun's most vivid memories, which span decades of archaeological exploration, the one that shines brightest, despite first being glimpsed more than 40 years ago, happened at the Niuheliang Site in Chaoyang, Liaoning province."That was a moment etched in time, as the clay head of a goddess that we had just unearthed lay before us, gazing skyward with a smile that seemed to invite conversation," says Guo, an honorary director of Liaoning Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, and a leading scholar of Hongshan Culture studies."Her eyes, adorned with jade, gleamed with a mesmerizing intensity, and drew everyone closer. It was our first glimpse of the face of our ancestors from 5 millennia ago."The sculpture is a life-size terracotta representation of a woman with distinctive facial traits: high cheekbones, shallow eye sockets, a low nose bridge, thin lips and eyes inset with sparkling, jade circular pieces. It was discovered at the Niuheliang Site, which has been identified as a late-stage primitive settlement of the Hongshan Culture. The culture, pivotal in Neolithic Chinese history, once flourished across modern-day Liaoning, Hebei province, and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region.Presently, a replica of this captivating face is on display at the Shenyang Museum in the provincial capital, Shenyang. Alongside it are 265 artifacts, which take visitors on a journey into the beauty and enduring legacy of early Chinese civilization.The exhibition, The Light of Civilization: Hongshan, Liangzhu, and Chinese Civilization, opened last month, elevates the Hongshan and Liangzhu cultures to equal importance, examining them within the grand narrative of the origins of Chinese civilization, according to Wang Chuang, the exhibition curator, and member of the Shenyang cultural heritage center.Scorching weather and its location far from downtown Beijing are not proving to be obstacles to people's enthusiasm for admiring the brilliance of ancient cultures.Over the last two weekends, visitors have had to stand in long lines for hours on end to enter the Capital Museum East Branch to see artifacts from remarkable Bronze Age civilizations that flourished over 3,000 years in present-day Sichuan province.The widely anticipated exhibition, Unveiling Sanxingdui and Jinsha of Ancient Shu Civilization, which opened on June 27 and which will run through to Oct 10, has placed 265 artifacts on display and shows the efforts over the last century to decode a distant past.The Sanxingdui site in Guanghan was discovered in the 1920s, but what really amazed the world was the milestone 1986 discovery of two pits, presumably used for sacrificial ceremonies. Exotic-looking bronze masks, statues and gold artifacts ushered people into a world full of romance and imagination. The Jinsha site, discovered in 2001 in the provincial capital of Chengdu, is famed for its exquisite bronze, jade, stone relics and numerous ivory tusks.Thanks to the two sites, ancient Shu civilization was able to emerge from mythology and literature to yield its treasures and character."Through tireless exploration and the generational efforts of archaeologists, the image of ancient Shu civilization, represented by the Sanxingdui and Jinsha cultures, is becoming increasingly clear," says Gao Hongqing, curator of the exhibition.Nevertheless, the open-ended explanations on the artifacts on display demonstrate that the ongoing exploration of ancient Shu civilization still has a way to go.As the bronze masks, human figures with protruding eyes, bronze wheel, and gold scepter on display show, the groundbreaking 1986 discovery at Sanxingdui leaves many issues unanswered. A new round of excavations between 2020 and 2022, which revealed six more "sacrificial pits", raised even more questions.Tang Fei, deputy director of the Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute, says that about 60 of the exhibits in the ongoing display come from this new round of excavation, which led to the unearthing of more than 17,000 artifacts, including 4,800 that were mostly intact.HONG KONG — What does a love letter entail? For Mak Wing-man, curator of the Xubaizhai Collection, it is not confined to the romantic feelings between a couple but also filial piety and an affinity among family members, as well as respect and affection between teachers and students.With love letters as the theme, an exhibition featuring ancient Chinese paintings and calligraphy works at the Hong Kong Museum of Art has drawn a group of rare visitors — people aged 35 or under account for more than 60 percent of the exhibition-goers."While the Xubaizhai Collection is well-renowned, young people seldom came to visit. And even if they came, they would only take a quick look and leave," Mak says.Gaining unexpected popularity since its opening in March last year, the exhibition has been extended to more than a year. What has rekindled the interest of the young in traditional art is the genuine expression of people's feelings encapsulated in the paintings and calligraphy, whether it's romance, family ties, friendship or patriotism."Love has always been a source of inspiration for artists," Mak says. "The landscape paintings may seem very peaceful at first glance, but they contain many emotions, and the emotion is what we want the audience to feel," she adds.There are more than 60 exhibits on display, telling stories of bittersweet moments between couples, the sadness of artists when bidding farewell to friends, as well as the grief and anguish of poets for the loss of their country.For instance, the theme poster of the exhibition features Farewell by a Winter Stream by Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) painter Chen Chongguang, which depicts a scene of good friends as they take their leave of each other at a pier. The description of the painting reads:"The water is calm and wide, with withered old trees and crooked branches lining the opposite bank. The cold and desolate river setting amplifies the reluctance at having to say one's goodbyes and the feeling of wanting to cling on tight to what we treasure in life.""We tried to focus on telling the sentiments in the artworks and their connection with us so that you don't have to be an expert to understand them," Mak says.For the past 10 years as a curator, Mak has been trying to figure out a way to get young people interested in Chinese cultural relics. She once converted a truck into a mobile art gallery, bringing calligraphy and paintings to the doorstep of primary and secondary schools and communities.For the exhibition, the museum, in a breakthrough method of displaying traditional Chinese ink art, has created a site-specific video projection installation Freezing Water: Between Here and There to bring audiences into the emotional worlds of the artists now and then.The exhibits were selected among the more than 600 artworks in the Xubaizhai Collection, which comprises Chinese painting and calligraphy works dating from the fifth to 20th centuries, with particular strengths in the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties.Xubaizhai's founder, Low Chuck-tiew (1911-93), was a renowned art connoisseur who devoted his life to the collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy."From day to day, I find immense pleasure in poring over books, artworks and artifacts, after losing track of time and depriving myself of sleep until early morning," Low once said at the opening of the Xubaizhai Gallery of Chinese Painting and Calligraphy.To pay tribute to Low, who donated his lifetime collection to the Hong Kong Museum of Art, Mak has prepared for every visitor of the exhibition a little surprise — a love letter carefully packed in an envelope.In the letter, Low expresses his joy in collecting the artworks and giving them back to society."In order to avoid the calamities that befell previous collectors resulting in the dispersal of their treasures, I have decided to donate my collection to the public rather than keeping it for my private enjoyment, so that everyone can share the same joy I have experienced throughout my life's work," it reads.The letter, together with all the love letters in the exhibition, tell a compelling truth: sentiments are everlasting and love is eternal.Romance means different things to different people. Recently, China Daily reporter Yin Weihao discovered one interpretation at Shichahai in downtown Beijing.As the historic terminus of the Grand Canal, Shichahai has long been celebrated by poets and literati. During his visit, Yin met a group of young people dressed in exquisite hanfu, who shared their reasons for embracing these traditional costumes as a new trend in China chic.Click the video to explore a feast of Chinese romance in this historic setting.Shen Guoxing is the sixth generation of Shanghai jewelry company Lao Feng Xiang to carry on its gold- and silver-processing craft, and has spent more than half his life revitalizing the special skill.Revitalizing one of the country's intangible cultural heritages means not only handing down skills from generation to generation, but also letting more people have the opportunity to experience and enjoy the technique, said the 56-year-old master craftsman.To carry out the special skills, Shen founded a work studio in July 1996 with 12 artisans. The studio can produce one or two works of the finest quality every year.The gold- and silver-processing craftsmanship of Lao Feng Xiang, a time-honored brand with a history dating back 176 years, is one of China's intangible cultural heritages.From pits and broken artifacts, heritage professionals are attempting to piece together the life of people living about 7,000 years ago in what is now Shenyang in Liaoning province.Covering an area of 178,000 square meters, the Xinle Site is a Neolithic settlement dating back over 7,000 years. More than 3,000 artifacts and 40 house foundations have been found at the site during the course of six archaeological digs.The Xinle Site Museum, founded in the mid-1980s, will be upgraded into an archaeological ruins park to continue to demonstrate the significance of the site, according to Zeng Yang, director of the museum."About 7,000 years ago, the Xinle people lived on a platform situated to the north of the ancient Hunhe River," Zeng says. "They engaged in various activities, such as digging holes, building thatched cottages, crafting stone tools and creating pottery vessels, and devoted themselves to the development of the area and to creating splendid Xinle Culture with their wisdom and labor."According to Zeng, most of China's archaeological site museums focus on sites within a time span of 5,000 years and often have intact artifacts, complete moats and well-preserved city layouts. Few are as old as Xinle, which contains a plethora of mysteries waiting to be solved.The site has also turned up its own wonders, among them a carbonized wooden pole with a bird's head carving and exquisite double-faced carvings on the body from 7 millennia ago."This is one of the earliest carved wooden artifacts ever found in China," Zeng says. "Wooden artifacts are hard to preserve, and it has survived because it was carbonized in a fire. It's really amazing that ancient people were able to make the same exquisite carvings on both sides of the sculpture without the use of modern tools."Unfortunately, the artifact broke into three parts when it was unearthed, but it remains a precious object, and has been inferred to be the scepter of a tribal leader.Ancient site reveals secrets of the past that help build evidence of a thriving society, Wang Ru reports in Fuxin, Liaoning province.Picturing life nearly 8,000 years ago in what is now Northeast China requires a leap of imagination, but there is also hard evidence for how people lived at the time. Findings show they inhabited semi-underground dwellings, the largest of which occupied an area of 157 square meters, and which often had a fire pit in the center. Some even had two — one perhaps for cooking and another for keeping kindling materials. They also collected fruit, hunted, raised animals, and made stone tools, jade artifacts and pottery vessels.Knowledge of their lifestyle, rudimentary as it may be, is based on research at the Chahai Site in Fuxin, Liaoning province. The settlement has yielded discoveries of not only building foundations, tombs, ash pits and moats, but also a large number of stone tools, pottery vessels and jade artifacts.After spending several million years in the Paleolithic Age, humans entered the Neolithic Age around 10,000 years ago, a time that coincided with the Holocene Megathermal, a period characterized by relatively warm and humid climate conditions that were advantageous for survival and progress. This was when the Chahai people lived, says Li Jingyan, director of the Chahai Site Museum.From an archaeological perspective, its key discoveries include an animal figure made out of stacked stones that is widely believed to be the totem of a dragon.                                   China DailyAlthough archaeological work on the site ended in 1994, and there are no plans for further excavation, heritage professionals are attempting to build a more comprehensive understanding of Chahai Culture by excavating nearby sites, and by stepping up efforts to protect the site and bring it back to life.Discovered during the second national census of cultural relics in 1982, the site, of 12,500 sq m, was excavated between 1986 and 1994."The Chahai Site is a Neolithic human settlement in the West Liaohe River Basin with rich cultural remains. These include settlements, house foundations, tombs, and even evidence of totem worship," Li says.One highlight of the discoveries was the stacked stone totem, probably of a dragon, which has subsequently been backfilled to create a replica. "This is probably the earliest dragon totem from the Neolithic period ever discovered in China," Li says. "It was made by stacking local reddish-brown stones in the middle of the site, and is about 19.7 meters long and 1.8 to 2 meters wide. It seems to lift its head, open its mouth and bend its body, as if it would rise up into the sky."Francois-Henri Pinault, visited the National Museum of China in Beijing for "memory reviving" on Friday.There, the chairman and chief executive officer of the French luxury group, Kering, saw the rat and rabbit bronze heads, two of the 12 zodiac animal sculptures once looted from Beijing's Old Summer Palace.On the same day in 2013, Francois-Henri Pinault accompanied his father, Francois Pinault, founder of Kering, to attend a ceremony at the National Museum of China, where the Pinault family's donation of the two heads were officially unveiled and added to the museum's collection.Since then, the two bronze items have been on display at The Road to Rejuvenation, a long-term thematic exhibition at the National Museum of China."As my father said to me once, the best way to protect and to preserve art, is to make it visible for the public. If you keep it for you, no one sees it," Francois-Henri Pinault tells China Daily.For this trip, he was not only to see the two sculptures, but also to attend the premiere of a documentary, The Long Journey Home.In 1018, a princess of China's Liao Dynasty (916-1125) died at the tender age of 18 and was laid to rest beside her husband, almost 20 years her senior, who died the previous year, barely two years into their marriage.There they lay undisturbed for nearly a millennium in a corner of the modern-day Inner Mongolia autonomous region in North China. When their resting place was finally discovered by archaeologists in 1986, the couple, both among the highest nobility of Liao's ruling class, proved their capacity to dazzle, with everything that glittered, including two gold masks covering their faces.Today, one of the masks, worn by the princess, is on view at the Suzhou Museum in Suzhou city, East China's Jiangsu province, in an exhibition titled La Bella in the Northern Land that runs until Sunday."These were no average beauties, but princesses and royal consorts whose elevated status meant much more than a luxurious lifestyle," says Xu Xincheng, the exhibition's curator."The princess and her consort were dressed and equipped to mount their steeds and ride off across the steppes of their fiefdom," writes Linda Cooke Johnson, a professor of history at Michigan State University in the United States, in her book on gender and identity of women from Liao and Jin, two Chinese dynasties founded by nomadic people. Here, Johnson discusses the final resting place for a princess — known as the Princess of the State of Chen — of China's Liao Dynasty (916-1125) and how she was interred with her husband by her side and with almost everything needed for a pastoral life.These included gilt silver boots worn by the couple that resembled"modern Western riding boots" to quote Johnson, as well as various horse gear — gilt copper chest traps, bridles and stirrups for example. There's even a copper burning mirror for starting a fire and a jade arm shield on which a hunting eagle could alight every time it returned to its master.Such a life is within the imagination of those who visit Suzhou Museum where an exhibition focusing on the life of the Khitan women of the Liao Dynasty is on view."The Liao people lived on horseback. Even empresses and royal concubines were accomplished archers and riders who followed their husbands in military campaigns as well as leisure hunting trips," says the exhibition's curator Xu Xincheng, quoting Liaoshi, or The Annals of Liao, compiled during the mid-14th century.According to an epitaph of a certain Concubine Xiao from Liao that has survived to date, the lady always"withheld her shot until she was certain of hitting her prey".That depiction could have served as an apt metaphor for Shulyu Ping, wife of Liao's founder Yelyu Abaoji. Playing an indispensable role in her husband's highly controversial ascendance to power, she almost never failed to deliver fatal blows to her foes, on and off the battleground.Her remarkable military skills and political maneuvering were passed on to the future imperial wives of Liao, most notably her own great-granddaughter Xiao Chuo, who was in turn the paternal grandmother of the Princess of the State of Chen. Wife to the fifth emperor of Liao, Xiao Chuo acted as the powerful regent for her teenage emperor son upon the death of her husband and effectively presided over the Liao court for 27 years until her own passing in 1009.In a significant display of international cooperation on cultural heritage preservation, the Chinese embassy in Buenos Aires received 14 repatriated artifacts from Argentina on Thursday.Both China and Argentina are state parties of UNESCO's 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. In 2018, the countries also signed an intergovernmental agreement on prevention of such cases and promotion of repatriation of related cultural relics.The successful return of the artifacts is the first collaborative effort since the signing of the agreement.At the repatriation ceremony in the embassy, Wang Wei, Chinese ambassador to Argentina, emphasized that the return of these artifacts marked the latest fruit in the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Argentina."This collaborative effort not only underscored Argentina's deep respect for the emotional and cultural rights of the Chinese people, but also demonstrated the firm commitment of both nations to protect human cultural heritage, combat artifact smuggling, and uphold international agreements," he said.It also accumulated valuable experience to strengthen bilateral cooperation in various fields, Wang added.The 14 artifacts, which left China illegally, include seven bronze bells dating to the late Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BC), plus three pottery figurines, two pottery figurine heads, a bronze frog and a bronze helmet that span from the Han Dynasty (206 BC to AD 220) to the time of the Northern and Southern dynasties, roughly the 5th to 6th centuries.They were seized in 2017 in coordination with the cultural heritage protection division of the Argentine Federal Police within a joint Interpol operation code-named Athena, in accordance with the Red List of Chinese Cultural Objects at Risk that was co-released by the International Council of Museums and China.The National Cultural Heritage Administration of China began seeking their return in 2019 via the Chinese embassy in Buenos Aires. On Dec 12, an Argentine court mandated the return of the 14 pieces to the embassy.Marcelo Chiappero, director-general of international police cooperation of the Argentine Federal Police, added that experts from the Buenos Aires-based National Museum of Oriental Art confirmed the authenticity of the pieces.The National Cultural Heritage Administration revealed that it would arrange their long journey home at a suitable time.China has signed bilateral agreements with 27 countries to fight against the theft, clandestine excavation, illicit export and import of cultural property.Xinhua contributed to this story.It is a memory that will forever be etched in my mind. To the accompaniment of pulsating music amid a sea of color and movement, the global audience looked on in awe as China greeted the world at the 2008 Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing with the welcoming and touching Confucian proverb, "Friends have come from afar, how happy we are".I sat at home in the United Kingdom marveling at this spectacle, transfixed by this blend of flawless choreography and cutting-edge technology that was clearly steeped in ancient Chinese history and tradition.Yet, like so many foreigners, I was ashamedly rather ignorant of just how revered the philosopher Confucius was in China, and how his teachings have, and still continue to play such an important role in Chinese history, culture and society. His teachings stand the test of time and remain the cornerstone of a proud, respectful, sincere and innovative nation.I could never have imagined that nearly 16 years later, thanks to China Daily and the hospitality and kindness of the Cyberspace Administration of Shandong, I would be part of a group of international media invited to visit Qufu, the hometown of Confucius (551-479 BC).Located in Jining in Shandong province, Qufu is naturally proud of its heritage and expertly keeps the spirit of Confucius alive thanks to an array of historical and modern sites, including the Confucius Museum. Here we learned about the man, his life and teachings, as well as about Chinese civilization through a fascinating variety of exhibits and musical instruments.One thing is evident though, having tried my hand at the zhong (bells), the qing (a stone chime) and the guqin (Chinese zither), sadly I don't think I will be invited to join the talented group of artists who wowed us with traditional music upon our arrival at the museum.And to emphasize my lack of musical ability, I am just relieved the public did not have to witness my feeble attempts at performing the yiwu, a dance used in sacrificial rites in ancient China ahead of the incredible memorial ceremony at the Confucius Temple.The legacy of Confucius in this part of Shandong is woven into the fabric of people's lives. We delved into the rich cultural history by learning ancient practices that are kept alive through skills such as calligraphy, as demonstrated by Kong Xiangsheng, a renowned calligrapher and descendant of Confucius.The Kong Family Mansion, where the descendants of Confucius lived and where historical artifacts are preserved, was the setting to learn to make shadow puppets and Kongfu pastry, and do some stone-rubbing, while the Lu Brocade Museum gave us the chance to try embroidery, weaving and make knot buttons and thread-bound books, as well as learn costume etiquette during our whistle-stop tour.Our last port of call was Rongcheng, a picturesque fishing village situated in Weihai on the easternmost tip of Shandong, which is enjoying a boom in tourism.Thanks to its mix of golden beaches, delicious seafood and cultural heritage of seaweed-roofed buildings, such as the Yuying Elementary School and the Sanggou Bay Marine Ranch in Linjialiu village, a delightful homestay, this captivating region makes for a wonderful visit.Having only moved to China about three months ago, I've not had much of chance to experience life outside Beijing, but Confucius once said, "Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart", and that is exactly what I plan to do whenever I get the chance to see more of this wonderful historic, friendly, majestic and vibrant country.Contact the writer at nick@chinadaily.com.cn   What did a noblewoman dating back more than 2,100 years look like? This enigmatic question was answered in dramatic fashion when Hunan Museum in Changsha, Hunan province, unveiled a 3D digital image of the human female remains recently, the longest-preserved "wet "human body ever found in China.Xin Zhui, also called Lady Dai, was unearthed from a tomb at the Mawangdui site in 1972 in Changsha. The other two tombs discovered next to hers belonged to her husband Li Cang, the Marquis of Dai, and their son. More than 3,000 artifacts were also uncovered, making it one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 20th century in China.When the noblewoman was discovered, her body was found to be intact and in a remarkable state of preservation.Her skin remained moist, her subcutaneous soft tissue had retained its elasticity and some joints were still movable. Even her eyelashes were in place and the lines on her fingers and toes were discernible, leading to the estimation that she was about 50 years old when she died, says Duan Xiaoming, director of Hunan Museum.Xin Zhui's face was swollen, deformed and decayed at the time of excavation, making it impossible to know her appearance when she was alive. The 3D digital version of Xin Zhui was based primarily on X-ray scans of her skull.The museum released a full-body version of Xin Zhui in a seated position at 35 years old and a head image of her at 50 years old.The digital project started last October. To protect Xin Zhui's body, experts did not directly handle it. Instead, they relied on close, multi-angled observations and measurements of the cadaver, practical experience, database sample comparisons, pathological examinations at the time of excavation and research on early Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) makeup to infer her appearance, demeanor and other physical characteristics.Additionally, they paid special attention to the image of the hunched Xin Zhui depicted in a T-shaped silk painting, which corresponded with lumbar disease symptoms found during the pathological examination of the body. The expert team completed the preliminary facial reconstruction in January of this year. Details of her hairstyle, headwear and clothing are yet to be refined.Yuan Zhongbiao, a facial reconstruction expert involved in the digital version of Xin Zhui, says in terms of facial appearance, Xin Zhui was relatively ordinary and not the "noble beauty" expected by the public."Due to the diversity of facial features, there are similar types but no exact matches. We restored her appearance as accurately as possible," Yuan says. Standing under a giant LED dome, visitors to Hunan Museum in Changsha, Central China's Hunan province, immerse themselves in a journey of the immortals dominated by mythical creatures imagined by people from about 2,100 years ago.In the underground world, two colossal whales swim in dark waters while a towering giant hoists the entire earthly plane. Above, in the human realm, mourners gather for solemn burial rites, praying for the departed to transcend into celestial beings. Meanwhile, in heaven, mythical guardians stand vigilant, illuminating the path forward.In 2009, China and the United States signed a key intergovernmental agreement on combating the theft and illegal trade of cultural relics. The document has been extended every five years since.In the past decade, the US has returned over 440 cultural relics to China thanks to close cooperation between the two countries in related fields. Here is a list of important cultural repatriations in the past year or so.Two panels of stone funeral beds (between the 4th and 7th centuries)The two panels with decorative patterns in reliefs were painted in different colors and adorned with gold foil. They were transferred back to China from New York in May 2023.The relics were seized by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and US Homeland Security Investigations as part of a criminal case. The National Cultural Heritage Administration cooperated with the US to launch the repatriation process in April last year and soon reached an agreement.The panels are of high historical, scientific and artistic value. They are considered to be originally from North China and installed on the front side of a stone bed. They demonstrate exchange among various civilizations along the ancient Silk Road. Its decorative patterns show a mixture of traditional Han Chinese elements and those of Zoroastrianism, a monotheistic religion from ancient Persia, like the exotic altar with flames. The panels were exhibited in the Palace Museum in Beijing last year.Feng Xingshu Gui from the Western Zhou Dynasty (c. 11th century-771 BC)The 2,800-year-old bronzeware was sent from San Francisco to Beijing in January.The vessel, known as gui, is 18 centimeters tall and 21 cm in diameter and weighs about 6 kilograms and is composed of a large bowl that has double handles in the design of a coil-nose animal face, resting on three feet shaped like those of an animal.An inscription cast in the interior of the vessel reveals its identity — it was "crafted by (nobleman) Xingshu of the Feng (vassal) state, dedicated to his wife". It was excavated from a cellar in Fufeng county, Shaanxi province, in 1978 and was later housed in a local museum but was stolen in 1984 by burglars.Decades later, Raymond King, an entrepreneur based in Portland, Oregon, found the relic in a New York apartment when he helped his mother clear out her belongings. When he referred it to Sotheby's auction house, he was told it was stolen from China.Since the theft 40 years ago, China had never given up looking for it, and Interpol listed it as stolen art in 2017. The London-based Art Loss Register then put the item in its database. Consequently, when Sotheby's researcher contacted the register about the vessel, the register informed the Chinese embassy in London and was later connected with the National Cultural Heritage Administration in Beijing, which later initiated its repatriation from the US.38 relics, mainly Tibetan Buddhist items from the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynastiesThe artifacts were returned to China from New York in April.In March, the National Cultural Heritage Administration was informed that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office had seized 38 cultural relics while solving a smuggling case. These relics were believed to have come from China.Among the returned relics are Buddha statues, ritual tools and religious ornaments. They are made of various materials such as bronze, clay, ivory and wood, and are crafted using techniques such as carving, sculpting and painting.Experts believe the objects demonstrate diverse subjects, varied craftsmanship, rich content and exquisite production techniques, and are thus of significant historical, cultural and scientific value.A Qing Dynasty official robeA crimson silk robe was recently donated by US citizen Paul Hollister to the National Cultural Heritage Administration. On June 19, the administration allocated the robe to Shandong University Museum in Qingdao, Shandong province, to commemorate the enduring friendship between the Chinese and American people.The robe once belonged to Hollister's great-grandfather, US missionary Watson McMillan Hayes (1857-1944), who was instrumental in the establishment of what is now Shandong University in 1901, where he served as a teacher.Hayes dedicated his life to education in China, enduring hardships during World War II when he was captured by Japanese forces and interned in a concentration camp in what is now Weifang, Shandong, in 1942. Despite being offered the opportunity to leave the camp and return home by the International Committee of the Red Cross, Hayes chose to give that chance to younger individuals. He passed away in the camp in 1944, expressing his unwavering commitment to the education cause in China and his willingness to be laid to rest in a foreign land.The robe is typical attire worn by ordinary officials during festive occasions in the late Qing Dynasty. Adorned with intricate embroidery featuring an array of decorative motifs, such as auspicious clouds, cranes, bats and longevity characters, the robe is a testament to the rich cultural heritage of the era.For eight decades, scholars follow the journey of the relics through the US, Wang Ru reports in Qingdao, Shandong.In 1942, a long-sealed tomb from the Warring States Period (475-221 BC) in the Zidanku (literally "bullet storehouse") area on the outskirts of Changsha, Hunan province, was plundered by grave robbers who stole the earliest silk manuscripts ever found in China.Eight decades later, they are still the only known silk manuscripts of the Chu state from the Warring States Period excavated in China.Not long after they were unearthed, they were collected by Cai Jixiang (1898-1979), a local dealer in antiques and amateur historian who studied them. In 1946, John Hadley Cox (1913-2005), an American teacher at Yali High School in Changsha, is said to have cheated Cai and illicitly took the silk manuscripts to the United States.The artifacts then passed through many hands in the US and were finally housed in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art. At the same time, Cai attempted to retrieve them but never succeeded.China-Egypt Joint Investigation, Research and Digitalization Project on Ancient Egyptian Antiquities, a package of cooperation projects mainly about digital scanning, photographing, sorting and research of more than 1,000 mummified wooden coffins excavated in Saqqara, Egypt, has been going on since late May, Shanghai International Studies University said on Monday.All the wooden coffins were excavated by the archaeological team of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt at the Bubasteion Site in Northern Saqqara, which is adjacent to Cairo, capital of Egypt, after 2018. The project was jointly undertaken by the Shanghai university and the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt, and jointly carried out by the university's World Art history Institute (WAI), the Saqqara Archeological Team and relevant teams from Egypt. It was led by Xue Jiang, an assistant researcher from WAI.The team said their final research results will be jointly released to the world in Chinese, Arabic and English.It is the first time that China has carried out such a large-scale basic cultural project outside the country, according to WAI. And the effort will provide experience and demonstration for the implementation of follow-up projects, such as the upcoming Database on Ancient Greek/Gandharan Images, Literature, and Archaeological Artifacts, which is affiliated to the World Civilizations Research Database.When visiting the Shanghai university in May, M. Ismail Khaled, general secretary Supreme Council of Antiquities expressed his full support for the progress of the project. He said he believed the project is an innovation in the mechanism of mutual learning and exchange between China and Egypt as ancient civilizations.Zhu Qingsheng, initiator of the project, said that in the era of digital technology, it is necessary to allow such cultural relics obtain a more comprehensive and in-depth analysis through technical means and become a part of the field of public knowledge."This marked an important beginning for China and Egypt to continue their cultural traditions, conduct dialogue among civilizations on an equal footing, and carry out international cultural cooperation in a new form," said Zhu, who is also director of the Shanghai university's WAI and a professor of history at Peking University in Beijing."It is a new initiative of academic strategy and pattern for a Chinese university to enter an Egyptian archaeological site for the first time with new image theory, database concept and micro-trace scanning to collect and sort out original materials," he said.The 3,200-kilometer Grand Canal dates back nearly 2,500 years. It passes through eight provinces and municipalities. In 2014, 27 sections of the canal, totaling 1,011 km, and 58 relevant heritage sites gained UNESCO World Heritage status. Fact 1: Supervising shipmentsAn "encryption system" was developed during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) to prevent corruption and ensure the quality of grain sent to Beijing from the south. Each "signature" on a folding fan represented an agency in charge of inspecting the cargo arriving in the capital. Signatures were also placed on the bags of grain, like seals. Supervisory officials could look at the fans to know which agency should be punished if any problems were discovered.Fact 2: Managing movementThere were complicated systems and rigid regulations of shipments' time and distance. A cargo fleet usually contained 30 ships, and each fleet had its own flag. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the central government owned over 16,000 ships for transportation along the canal.Fact 3: Cultural connotationsMore than 400 items found along the Grand Canal have been inscribed on the list of national-level intangible cultural heritage, including folk arts, handicrafts and local beliefs. Tianjin's Yangliuqing Lunar New Year woodcut paintings are a representative example. Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) artisans created this renowned art form using fine paper and dyes shipped from the south.Fact 4: Securing sustenanceThe Huiluo Barns' ruins near Luoyang, Henan province, which is listed among the World Heritage sites, offers a glimpse of how grain from southeastern China that was transported along the Grand Canal was stored and managed by the central government during the Sui Dynasty (581-618). The silo complex was like a small city -- about 1 kilometer from east to west and 355 meters from south to north -- whose size equaled roughly 50 soccer fields.Fact 5: Funding a nationThe Grand Canal was closely interlinked with ancient China's tax system, as grain paid as tax was transported to the capital via the waterway. A portion of officials' salaries was paid in grain.Fact 6: Building infrastructure to store waterTo ensure continuous water supplies, many ancient infrastructure projects were built to direct water from nearby rivers into the canal. For example, in Beijing, where no natural river was available, spring water from the city's western outskirt was redirected to downtown, and 24 sluices were built during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) to reserve water for the canal. These dams still function today. During the Ming Dynasty, Song Li and Bai Ying built 38 sluices around Nanwang, a town in Shandong province, which is the highest point along the canal, to enable ships to "climb over" the ridge.Shanghai Museum East will reopen on June 26, following an extensive renovation that promises a fresh and enriching experience for visitors, announced the museum during a press briefing on June 24, showcasing significant enhancements to its permanent exhibition halls and the introduction of new themed galleries and interactive spaces.The revamped museum now offers access to 80 percent of its total space for public viewing, with a boosted daily visitor capacity of up to 20,000 individuals. Among the highlights are four permanent exhibition halls dedicated to ceramics, numismatics, jade, and seals, each offering a deep dive into the rich cultural heritage of ancient China.The Ceramics Gallery, located on the third floor of the museum, spans an impressive 1800 square meters and features 558 carefully selected artifacts, with half of them being unveiled to the public for the first time. Divided into seven sections, this exhibition traces the evolution of ancient Chinese ceramics and allows visitors to interact with select artifacts under specified conditions, offering a unique hands-on experience.The Numismatics Gallery boasts an expanded collection of over 6,000 coins, making it the hall with the largest number of cultural relics on display at Shanghai Museum East. New sections dedicated to the currency of the Republic of China and revolutionary base currency during the War Against Japanese Invasion (1931 to 1945) have been added, enriching the narrative of China's historical monetary systems.The Jade Gallery showcases nearly 350 jade pieces spanning from the Neolithic Age to the Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1911), introducing new categories such as turquoise, agate, and jadeite to enhance visitors' understanding of ancient jade materials.

China Daily is running this series to show how master artisans are using dedication and innovation to inject new life into heritage. In this installment, we find out the enduring allure of a Mongolian musical instrument.Haunting melodies of morin khuur give voice to cultural heritage of Inner Mongolia, Chen Nan and Yuan Hui report.In the vast and wind-swept steppes of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, where nomadic traditions entwine with the pulse of nature, there exists a profound connection between the people and their music. The connection is embodied by the haunting melodies of the morin khuur, a traditional two-stringed instrument often referred to as the horse-headed fiddle.The morin khuur occupies a revered position as a key instrument in traditional Mongolian music. Its beautiful tones are often used to accompany khoomei, or throat singing, a vocal style characterized by harmonic overtones, which further enhances the depth and emotional resonance of ethnic Mongolian music.Beyond its musical prowess, the morin khuur is also used during ceremonial contexts, such as weddings, festivals and rituals, where it connects participants with their cultural heritage and their ancestors.Despite modernization and urbanization, the morin khuur remains a cherished part of daily life for many families of Mongolian ethnicity. The instrument is also integrated into the educational system, where it is taught in schools as part of the efforts to preserve cultural heritage and promote traditional music education, passing down both musical techniques and cultural values from one generation to the next.Morin khuur was inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008 (originally proclaimed in 2003).Its cultural significance has gained international attention. In May, when International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach visited Shanghai, he received a morin khuur as a gift. This exchange underscored the instrument's role as a cultural ambassador.Nestled in the southwestern expanse of Ordos city in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region lies the Uxin Banner — a vast territory spanning approximately 11,600 square kilometers with a modest population of 160,000 people.Despite its remote setting, this region has garnered widespread acclaim, owing to a remarkable cultural phenomenon — the Uxin Banner Morin Khuur Symphony Orchestra of China. This ensemble stands as the nation's pioneering and sole professional symphony orchestra predominantly featuring the traditional musical emblem of the Mongolian ethnic group — the morin khuur, or horse-headed fiddle.Comprising over 40 musicians adeptly wielding the morin khuur across its three distinct parts — high, middle and bass — the symphony orchestra boasts a repertoire exceeding 100 musical compositions, captivating audiences both domestically and abroad."When we showcase our craft beyond Inner Mongolia, particularly in locales where the symphony orchestra and morin khuur are novel experiences, audiences often describe the encounter as nothing short of jaw-dropping," reveals Jin Hai, 49, the director of the Uxin Banner Morin Khuur Symphony Orchestra of China, which was established in 2013.He continues: "The innovative fusion of the morin khuur with Western brass, woodwind and percussion instruments enthralls audiences, inviting them to delve deeper into the ancient instrument and the rich culture of the Mongolian ethnic group."Jin initially honed his skills with the morin khuur during middle school before pursuing further studies in music education and morin khuur performances at Inner Mongolia Normal University. He still remembers the orchestra's humble beginnings. Initiated by local authorities, the ensemble initially comprised nearly 30 morin khuur virtuosos.Driven by a mission to transcend conventional perceptions and breathe new life into this cherished instrument, the symphony orchestra emerged with support from Chagan, a distinguished conductor, composer and the orchestra's current artistic director."For individuals of the Mongolian ethnic group such as myself, the morin khuur embodies our people's essence. It's a mystical instrument steeped in history, deserving of wider recognition. Despite its mere two strings, it possesses an astounding range of tones," says Chagan.The creative initiative "Canal Chic: Reviving China's Heritage" was launched at the China Grand Canal Museum in Yangzhou, East China's Jiangsu province on Saturday, calling for entries of creative visual works from around the world. 2024 marks the 10th anniversary of China's successful bid to inscribe the Grand Canal as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This project aims to explore the cultural heritage and spiritual essence of the Grand Canal, revitalizing more cultural relics and heritage.Artists, designers, art lovers and cultural institutions globally, including museums, art galleries and universities, are all welcomed to participate. Through online submissions and offline on-site "source exploration" activities, participants are encouraged to use their artistic skills to interpret cultural relics, creating visual works such as scrolls, posters, animated illustrations and micro-videos.The works should utilize cultural relics associated with the Grand Canal as creative materials, sourced from museums and cultural heritage sites in the eight provincial areas along the Grand Canal: Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The initiative is supported by the network communication bureau of the Cyberspace Administration of China, hosted by China Daily Website and sponsored by China Internet Development Foundation.Learn more here.In the vast and wind-swept steppes of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, where nomadic traditions entwine with the pulse of nature, there exists a profound connection between the people and their music.

People's life was thus rich and colorful, their hearts were broadened and opened up, and their thoughts were therefore tolerant and profound," he added.Matteo Compareti, a professor at the Capital Normal University in Beijing, discussed cultural exchanges along the road by citing the example of murals of Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, Gansu province, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. He said some murals show gods that originated from the Mesopotamia and transported to China by the Sogdians through the Silk Road."In the Middle Ages, the Sogdians were one of the most active groups on the Silk Road. They formed caravans and became the primary facilitators of trade between various countries and ambassadors of cultural exchange," said Liu Guoxiang, deputy director of the Chinese Academy of History.Wei Jun, an archaeology researcher at the Fudan University in Shanghai, introduced the development of ancient Maritime Silk Road and the latest archaeological development related to it since 2020 in China.Lesa la Grange, manager of Policy and Skills Development Unit of South African Heritage Resources Agency, said South Africa is stepping up efforts in underwater archaeology as well. She said South African and Chinese scholars are cooperating to carry out archaeological work on a ship that carried looted treasure from China's Yuanmingyuan, the Old Summer Palace in Beijing, to the United Kingdom originally, but sank into the sea area of South Africa unexpectedly in the 1860s."We are expecting fruitful results of this project, which may lay a foundation for the mutual learning of South Africa and China in studies of historical heritage and facilitate future cooperation," she said.Taking the theme of mutual learning among civilizations, the 2024 China International Confucius Cultural Festival will open in Qufu in Shandong province, on Sept 27.Five main programs, including a grand ceremony celebrating Confucianism, and the tracing of Confucius temples and academies around the world, as well as 100 cultural and tourist performances, exhibitions and folk experiences revolving around Confucius will be held.Around 370 guests from China and abroad have been invited to participate in the festival, which seeks to boost the influence of Chinese culture.On Tuesday, the China Central Television Mid-Autumn Festival Gala successfully celebrated the holiday, captivating audiences worldwide.The number of viewers of the show was unveiled on Thursday, showing that as of 10 am on Wednesday, the gala achieved a total cross-media viewership of 1.14 billion.The television broadcast garnered 135 million live viewers, achieving a market share of 17.63 percent, reflecting a continued upward trend from the previous year.

They are exploring the beautiful landscapes, experiencing local culture and customs, visiting ancient villages inhabited by ethnic groups, and enjoying local cuisine during the five-day trip.After visiting the 600-year-old Yunshantun village in Anshun, William Adlington, general manager of a media company in the UK, said he was impressed by the village's ancient houses and buildings, which are in the style of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.Adlington showed great interest in the wood carvings and craftsmanship used in the ancient houses."The thing I always want to do is to see more rural villages in China, and this village is a good example of the countryside, with amazing and beautiful buildings. A very original and authentic village," he said.Adlington has visited China many times, but he mostly has gone to big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.Nestled in a mountainous region, Guizhou has constructed numerous impressive bridges to enhance its transportation network. The province is home to nearly half of the world's top 100 highest bridges, with several ranking among the top 10 globally.One such marvel is the Baling River Bridge, which stands 370 meters above the river and is approximately 2,237 meters long.

Farming culture is an important component of that," Tang Ke, director of the rural social affairs promotion department at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said at the launch ceremony for the map in Fengdu on Aug 15."The prosperity and development of rural culture cannot be achieved without the exploration and use of traditional farming culture."China was one of the first regions in the world to begin agricultural production. The profound impact of its development shaped lifestyles, values and social structure, becoming an important component of Chinese civilization.The 10th Chinese Museums and Relevant Products and Technologies Exposition will be held in Hohhot in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region from Aug 23 to 26, focusing on the high-quality development of museums.At a news conference held in Hohhot on Friday, the expo committee announced that a total of 552 museums and enterprises will participate in the event. The expo will feature five sections, including the achievements of China's museums, the accomplishments of cultural and museum-related companies, and the development of museum digitalization.The expo's co-organizer, the Chinese Museum Association, will host the "Accessible Museums Academic Seminar" with UNESCO together, which marks UNESCO's first systematic project focused on accessible museums. Representatives from institutions both in and outside China will be invited to discuss pathways for the development of accessible museums.In addition to the seminar, eight other academic sessions will be hosted. Prominent Chinese museums such as the Palace Museum and Nanjing Museum, along with cultural institutions from overseas, will participate in these sessions to discuss topics such as digitalization, public education, and immersive exhibitions.The expo is open to the public and aims to attract visitors with more than 40 cultural activities in four days. These activities include engaging lectures by museum directors, interactive experiences that allow visitors to appreciate the beauty of cultural relics, and displays of beautiful cultural products.Since it was established in 2004, the expo has held nine sessions. It is one of the most influential events in China's museum and cultural heritage sector and one of the three major museum industry exhibitions globally.The 12th China Acrobatic Exhibition is set to take place from Aug 23 to Sept 5 in Shenyang, capital of Northeast China's Liaoning province, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (MCT) on Wednesday.This year's event will feature 36 acrobatic shows, eight acrobatic dramas and 10 magic shows.

The museum reported that the daily peak number of visitors in July exceeded 33,000.In Shanghai, museum enthusiasts are finding it nearly impossible to get tickets for the Shanghai Museum's exhibition on ancient Egypt. According to the museum's booking system, all tickets for August have sold out.The popularity of museums reflects a significant rise in people's passion for culture. It came as a result of President Xi Jinping's consistent promotion of traditional Chinese culture and his call for museums to bring cultural relics to life, as well as his emphasis on mutual learning between civilizations.A resolution adopted last month by the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China highlighted the prosperous development of Chinese culture. It also promoted the inheritance of fine traditional Chinese culture and called for refining the supply of cultural services and products."We will promote cultural prosperity, enrich the intellectual and cultural lives of our people, and enhance China's cultural soft power and the appeal of Chinese culture," it added.Xi has emphasized on many occasions that China's fine traditional culture is the "root and soul" of the Chinese nation, and he has called, during visits to museums and cultural sites across the nation in the past few years, for a better utilization of cultural relics and for making them "alive".Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, Xi has visited more than 100 historical and cultural sites and issued many instructions concerning cultural relics and archaeology. The sites of his visits have included the Mogao Grottoes in Gansu province, the Yungang Grottoes in Shanxi province, the Yinxu Museum in Henan province and the Chinese Archaeological Museum in Beijing.Liu Shuguang, head of the Chinese Museums Association, said the support from the nation's top leader has injected vitality and momentum into the development of museums."Museums are making efforts to offer attractive and interesting services to answer our leader's call. Their appealing services have thus won crowds of visitors," said Liu.A decade ago, Liu could not have imagined the surge in museum popularity. Back then, the majority of visitors were elderly, but now, young people and parents with children make up the bulk of the crowd.To bring relics to life is to attract more people to museums. Many institutions have transitioned from their role as only collectors and protectors of artworks and antiques to also becoming cultural service providers, added Liu.From concerts and digital immersive experiences to children's plays, museums and cultural institutions are conceiving innovative ways to entertain as well as educate the public.Henan Museum in Zhengzhou, the capital of Central China's Henan province, hosts concerts for museum visitors that feature musicians playing ancient pieces of music with traditional instruments that are replicas of antiques collected by the museum — some of which were used more than 2,000 years ago. The clothing styles of the musicians are in line with the dynasties during which their specific instruments were originally played.Ma Xiaolin, director of Henan Museum, said the idea for the concerts came about from the antique musical instruments in the museum's collection. He said that to display them in an exhibition is not as interesting as playing them and bringing them to life.During Spring Festival in February, the museum welcomed about 100,000 visitors, and concert tickets were hard to obtain.The Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, Gansu province, home to some of China's finest Buddhist art, set up a virtual reality center in September last year to offer an immersive experience. Wearing headsets, visitors can explore a digital cave — a replica of a cave seldom opened to the public for preservation purposes — and admire murals up close in high definition, and they can immerse themselves in the stories depicted in the artwork.When Xi visited the Mogao Grottoes in 2019, he stressed that "the protection of world cultural heritage should be placed above tourism as our top priority".Lei Zhengguang, a member of the promotional team at the Dunhuang Academy, said the virtual reality center is a good way to serve the dual purpose of preservation and enhancing visitors' experience.As the peak season hits its stride, the daily visitor cap has been expanded to 18,000, but demand remains insatiable. "For those who can't get in, the digital immersive experience is a captivating alternative," said Lei.The Liaoning Provincial Museum in Shenyang, the capital of Northeast China's Liaoning province, attracts children and teenagers by staging innovative shows to help them better understand what they are taught at school. Last year, it hosted shows that narrated the stories of renowned ancient poets, drawing from the institution's extensive collection of artifacts from the poets' eras.The museum has also started a new project to get young visitors more involved. Children are invited to act out roles, recite poems and experience what daily life was like for the poets.Dong Baohou, the institution's deputy director, said: "It's a great time for museums. People are more interested in culture than ever. To meet this demand, we need to work hard and come up with innovative ways to improve our services."In a letter replying to experts at the National Museum of China in 2022, President Xi urged the museum workers to make contributions to the development of China's museums and to the building of China into a country with a strong socialist culture. He emphasized the importance of exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations, and called for better preserving, passing on and showcasing the fine accomplishments of Chinese civilization.Cultural exchanges were also emphasized in Xi's report to the 20th National Congress of the CPC in 2022. "We will deepen exchanges and mutual learning with other civilizations and better present Chinese culture to the world," he said.In the past two years, museums have taken steps to boost cultural exchanges between different civilizations.In mid-April, Beijing's Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City, and the Palace of Versailles in France held a show in Beijing featuring exchanges between China and France in the 17th and 18th centuries. The widely anticipated exhibition featured around 200 cultural artifacts and drew many visitors.Also in April, an exhibition showcasing the art and culture of two mysterious states in Central China's Hubei province 2,000 years ago was presented to a US audience at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, the biggest archaeological show from China since 2020.Jeremy Zhang, lead curator of the Asian Art Museum show, that he could feel the strong support from the Chinese government for cultural exchanges. Thanks to that support, Zhang's museum will have further chances in the future to work more deeply with key Chinese museums, including the Palace Museum.On July 17, the Shanghai Museum opened its largest-ever themed exhibition featuring 788 artifacts from various periods of Egypt's history, which it said is Asia's largest showcase of ancient Egyptian civilization.dengzhangyu@chinadaily.com.cn Last Saturday night, the Shanghai Museum hosted its first "cat's night" event. 250 beautifully-dressed cats gathered at the exhibition, On Top of the Pyramid: The Civilization of Ancient Egypt, under the guidance of their owners, embarking on a wonderful journey.

To address the common challenges facing humanity, it is essential to harness the power of cultural dialogue to eliminate discrimination and prejudice, enhance understanding and trust, promote people-to-people connectivity, and strengthen unity and cooperation."The profound and enlightening thoughts of Confucius and Aristotle, as outstanding representatives of ancient Eastern and Western civilizations, transcend the course of history," Qiu said.Hailing the event as a cross-temporal dialogue of civilizations and an academic feast of cultural exchanges, Qiu said his university is willing to play an active role in promoting educational exchanges and contributing to the creation of a better future for humanity.Sachs noted the NATO-led military alliance is exacerbating global geopolitical tensions and escalating the risk of hegemony."But in my view, most of the world wants to find a way for peace, peaceful co-existence, and especially sustainable development that can bring us to safety on the planet with sustainable development entailing economic prosperity, social justice, and environmental sustainability," he said.Sachs argued that ancient Eastern and Western philosophical thoughts, especially the concept of "harmony in diversity" embodied in Confucianism, hold significant relevance in addressing present-day challenges. He also called for collaborative efforts to develop a shared understanding of what content in the ancient Eastern and Western philosophies should be taught to students in the 21st century.Meng emphasized that Mencius, as the inheritor and advocate of Confucian philosophy, put forward the concepts of "community" and "benevolent governance." He illustrated that Mencius exhorted feudal rulers to look beyond the narrow horizon of their palaces to cultivate a common bond with their ministers, clerks, and the masses and extend their ren, or benevolence, to the governed to preserve their wealth and power.Meng saw a strong similarity between Mencius' teachings and Aristotle's theories of "justice" and "virtue", both still holding great relevance to contemporary governments and political leaders.The Sino-French youth choir concert "Song and Smile" was recently held at the China Cultural Center in Paris.

On this day, she disconnects from the digital world and focuses on real-life experiences.In the morning, she prepares breakfast for herself while listening to music. In the afternoon, she strolls through the park with friends and in the evening, they enjoy a meal together without touching their phones, engaged in deep conversation. Upon returning home, she spends the evening reading. Throughout this day, she only connects to the internet twice: once for navigation and once to coordinate with friends."Occasionally disconnecting from the network is like feeding the brain a day of vegetarian food," Chen said.Unplug Day is part of her plan to combat information overload from excessive phone use and to rebuild her focus. In addition to this, she has started substituting short videos with longer ones and prioritizes reading in-depth news articles or books.Chen started the plan as she often felt "disrupted" by technology, citing moments of distraction like pop-up notifications, ring tones and persistent alerts leading her to check for new messages, and feelings of information overload."If my Apple Watch has the WeChat notification feature enabled, I feel like it's akin to electronic shackles because the moment I see someone's message, I feel compelled to reply immediately," she said."When friends gather and everyone is glued to their phones, it makes me uncomfortable," Chen said, adding that immersing herself in social media prevented her from completing planned tasks, leading to psychological burdens and a diminished focus.Wu Mengxian, 20, has set a clearer path for her future career after winning a gold medal at the Statelevel skills contest.In May, China held its second national rural vitalization skills competition in Guiyang, Guizhou province. It featured 11 events focused on useful and practical skills, including bricklaying, farm machinery maintenance and e-commerce, with more than 700 competitors from across the country vying for victory.Each event had separate group competitions for experienced workers and students. Wu won gold in the elderly nursing event in the students competition.Wu, who is in her second year studying nursing at Shanghai Nanhu Vocational and Technical College, attributed her success at the competition to her studies and said they would pave her career as a nursing assistant for the seniors."I was hesitant about choosing nursing as my college major at first because I was not sure I would be patient and cautious enough to take care of the patients. But my parents convinced me that the major could win me a stable job in a hospital after graduation," she said.The competition, however, removed any doubt about her future profession."The human touch and heartwarming moments with the elderly are really attractive to me. As far as I know, the elderly nursing sector faces a manpower shortage, and I think it may be an opportunity for us young people to find success."Wu said she learned about the skills competition during her first year at the college. She decided to participate, and her outstanding performances at trial competitions won her an opportunity to take part in the State-level contest."I joined Shanghai's city-level trial selection in March and was in intensive training for a week before the national final competition started," she explained. "The training mainly focused on managing time, becoming proficient in certain operations and boosting communication skills with the elderly," she said.Young Chinese people have shown an increasing willingness to learn skills that will help the country vitalize its rural economy — particularly through e-commerce."I wish to sell sweet apples from my hometown, Yunnan province, to more people in China and around the world through e-commerce. I believe e-commerce can help improve the socioeconomic development situation in my hometown," said 21-year-old Suo Chengyu, an e-commerce major who won a gold medal at a State-level skills competition in May.Raised in Zhaotong, Yunnan, Suo is in her third year at Yunnan Technician College in Kunming, capital of the province."Many times, I've seen villagers who were worried about the sales of their produce, which were of very good quality," she said. "The rural areas need more e-commerce talent with skills in market planning, data analysis and advertisement."Suo said she wants to contribute to the development of e-commerce in rural areas and become a teacher after graduation."I want to encourage or inspire more youths, especially those from rural areas, to use their strengths or skills to revive their villages," she said.The 2024 Shanghai Gift Design Competition began on Friday by inviting all sectors of society to share innovative gift designs representing Shanghai.Hosted by Shanghai's culture and tourism administration and sponsored by Shanghai Laofengxiang Co Ltd, the competition is divided into two categories: design and product.Well-known commercial brands and domestic universities will participate in the competition as well as relevant associations and cutting-edge design studios.Huang Hua, director of the Shanghai Tourism Trade Association's tourism products branch, said the competition brings not only a design event to the city, but an in-depth dialogue about urban development, brand growth, and cultural inheritance.Last year, a total of 139 products obtained the 2023 Shanghai Gift brand certification, including items in the food, cultural and creative, skincare and cosmetics, and daily necessities categories.The gifts that win the 2024 awards will be unveiled at the Shanghai Tourism Festival scheduled for September.In a prestigious selection event held in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, 36 groundbreaking models of intangible cultural heritage have been meticulously chosen from a pool of 153 contenders nationwide.

Today's race allows us to see the high-level dragon boat teams and gain experience," Cahayag said.Cagayan de Oro is a port city in the Philippines. The integration of Chinese and Philippine cultures has influenced and shaped the unique Chinese community there, and dragon boat racing has become increasingly popular among locals.Although it is a niche sport, dragon boat racing has developed rapidly in the area, and there are several dragon boat teams in Cagayan de Oro City, according to Cahayag.Suhod Hakim, coach of Brgy Carmen Dragon, was once a player and coach of the Philippines national dragon boat team."My family is in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. I came to Cagayan de Oro City to coach because these children really love the sport of dragon boating. They have to get up at 4:30 every morning and train for more than two hours before going to school," Hakim said."There are elements of Chinese culture in many Philippine cities. Chinese restaurants and the Spring Festival are becoming more and more influential in the Philippines," Hakim added."I have been to Nanning twice to participate in dragon boat races. I have also been to Guangdong, Shanghai, Zhejiang and other places. Such competitions will not only help everyone improve their competitive level through exchanges, but also enable the people of the two countries to increase interaction and enhance people to people exchange," Hakim noted.The Chinese community in Kenya on Thursday celebrated the upcoming dragon boat festival at the Confucius Institute based at the University of Nairobi, Kenya's oldest university, to help grow Sino-Kenyan ties.The event is commemorated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month according to the Chinese lunar calendar, which falls on June 10 this year, and features the preparation and eating of Zongzi, which is a form of rice dumpling wrapped in plant leaves, as well as watching of dragon boat racing.Zhang Zhizhong, minister counselor and deputy chief of Mission of the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, said that the festival is one of the major traditional festivals from the Asian nation that can help strengthen the bonds between Kenya and China."The dragon boat festival can be used to symbolize the strengthening of the bond between Kenya and China," Zhang said.Qin Minxue, a representative of the Chinese community in Kenya, said that the celebration of the dragon boat festival helps overseas Chinese to remain in touch with their culture.

The day is called Duan Wu Festival, or Dragon Boat Festival, celebrated everywhere in China. This festival dates back to about 2,000 years ago with a number of legends explaining its origin. The best-known story centers on a great patriotic poet named Qu Yuan.Qu Yuan and Dragon Boat FestivalIn the Warring States Period (475-221BC), the State of Qin in the west was bent on annexing the other states, including the state of Chu, home of Qu Yuan. Holding the second highest office in the state, Qu Yuan urged that the Chu State should resist Qin and ally with the State of Qi to the east. This was opposed by Zhangyi, a minister of the State of Qin who was trying to disrupt any anti-Qin alliances. He seized upon an incident with a jealous court official in Chu to get rid of Qu Yuan.Qu Yuan had refused to let Jin Shang, the chief minister in the State of Chu, have a look at a draft of a decree he had been asked to draw up. In anger Jin spread the rumor that Qu Yuan was leaking state secrets. He said that Qu Yuan had boasted that without his aid no decree could be drafted. This made the King of Chu feel that Qu Yuan was belittling him.When the story reached the ears of Zhang Yi in Qin, he secretly sent a large amount of gold, silver and jewels to Chu to bribe Jin Shang and the king's favorite concubine to form an anti-Qu Yuan clique. The result was that the King of Chu finally banished Qu Yuan from the capital in 313 BC.The next year, as relations between Qin and Chu worsened, Qu Yuan was called back and named to a high office, but the clique continued its machinations against him.In 299 BC after several unsuccessful forays against Chu, Qin invited the King of Chu over, ostensibly for talks. Qu Yuan feared this was a trap and urged his king not to go. The latter would not listen and even accused Qu Yuan for interfering.On the way, the King of Chu was seized by Qin troops. He died in captivity three years later. Chu came under the rule of the king's eldest son, later known as King Qing Xiang. Under him the state administration deteriorated.Qu Yuan hoped to institute reforms and in poems satirized the corruption, selfishness and disregard for the people on the part of dubious characters who had achieved trusted positions. Neither this nor Qu Yuan's resolve to resist Qin set well with King Qing Xiang, who was in fact married to a daughter of the King of Qin, In 296 BC, Qu Yuan, then in his mid 50s, was banished for the second time. Grieving for the condition of his homeland, for years he wandered about south of the Yangtze River.During this period he poured out his feelings of grief and concern for his homeland in the allegorical Li Sao, a long autobiographical poem in which he tells of his political ideal and the corruption and mismanagement of the court.In 280 BC Qin launched an overall invasion of Chu, and captured the Chu capital in 278 BC. The news reached Qu Yuan while he was near the Miluo River in today's northeastern Hunan Province. In frustration at being unable to do anything to save his state, he clasped a big stone to his breast and leaped into the river to end his life.Qu Yuan's sufferings had gained the sympathy of the people of Chu. In memory of him, every year on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, the day he drowned himself, dragon boat races, which are said to represent the search for his body, are held, and the Chinese people eat Zong Zi, little packets of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo leaves, which was originally thrown into the river to keep the fishes from eating the body of Qu Yuan. In addition, it is said that when hearing the news of Qu Yuan's suicide, some doctors poured realgar wine into the Miluo River to anaesthetize the fishes, hence preventing them from eating Qu Yuan's body.Michelin recently unveiled the 2024 edition of the prestigious Michelin Guide Guangzhou at the Shangri-La Hotel in Guangzhou, Guangdong province.

He worried that even though the application of AI in filmmaking can increase efficiency and reduce costs, AI generated content, which largely appeals to popular aesthetics, would lack individuality, and render special aesthetics rarer.The entrepreneur also predicted that in the age of AI, competition will become fiercer as AI-powered productivity increases, which will make audience find it harder to choose what content to consume. "In this sense, content with unique intellectual property value will become more valuable," Wang said.April 20 marked the 15th United Nations Chinese Language Day. In celebration of this occasion, a group of international students from Shenyang University of Chemical Technology gathered for a special extracurricular activity to explore the Chinese character for "dragon" — "loong".The special lesson took place at a cultural studio in the Laobeishi area of Shenyang, Northeast China's Liaoning province. During the session, Zhang Zhenzhong, an instructor at the studio and a member of the China Calligraphers Association, demonstrated more than 10 forms of the "loong" character, spanning from jiaguwen, the oracle bone inscriptions — China's earliest documented font — to kaishu, the standard calligraphic script commonly used today.According to Zhang, the character "loong" was selected for this event because this year is the Year of the Dragon, and "loong" is a Chinese national totem. In fact, Chinese people often refer to themselves as descendants of the "loong".For Phitchapa Prakopjinda, a student from Thailand, the visit to Laobeishi and the studio helped bring to life the Chinese culture that she had previously learned only from textbooks. She pointed out that the special lesson on the character "loong" provided fresh insights into the language."I came to realize that the language has undergone a very intricate and exquisite transformation, which I think demonstrates Chinese aesthetics and the inclusive nature of Chinese culture," she said.Mishell Dorjderem, a Mongolian student, also elaborated on the inclusiveness of Chinese culture, but from a different angle. She was surprised to learn that the mythical creature, the "loong", is a fusion of various animals."Mr Zhang taught us that the 'loong' depicted in Chinese legends has the eyes of rabbits, the antlers of deer, and the body of snakes, among other features," she said. "This must be what he means by saying that Chinese is an inclusive language."Dorjderem also had the opportunity to witness sugar paintings, a traditional Chinese craft where artisans use syrup to create images. She then received a sugar painting featuring the "loong" character. "It was so beautiful that I couldn't bear to eat it," she said.For Russian student Anna Onuchina, she was only familiar with the simplified Chinese writing of the character "loong" before Zhang displayed the multiple forms of the character."I learned in the session that most Chinese characters are hieroglyphs, meaning that they were invented based on how the objects look. I found the 'loong' character in the oracle bone inscriptions full of dynamism — one of them looks like it has a tail shaped like fire, and another has a much larger head," she said.Zhang emphasized the importance of learning about Chinese characters in mastering the language. "If you truly want to understand the language, you must comprehend the history behind the characters' transformation. They carry over 3,000 years of cultural heritage and transcend time," he said.The students also tried writing the character "loong" with a brush, getting a firsthand experience of the beauty of Chinese calligraphy.Zhang was impressed by the strong interest and active participation shown by the international students from SYUCT. "I was deeply moved by their enthusiasm and amazed by their proficiency in Chinese. The entire session was conducted in Chinese, and they followed along without difficulty," he said.However, he also stressed that mastering the Chinese language is no simple task, and the students still have a long way to go.Zhang, who worked as a college professor for years before retiring, views education as a process of "seeding"."This session merely provided the students with a glimpse into the richness and charm of the Chinese language," he explained. "It's like planting a seed in their hearts. We don't know when or how it will bloom, but hopefully, one day, their interest and understanding of the language will contribute to the preservation of Chinese culture and facilitate cross-cultural communication."In a first for its 14-year history, the Beijing International Film Festival introduced a "Film and Fashion" section, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between the cinema and fashion industries, as confirmed by the event organizers.This section kicked off with a sun-protective clothing fashion show by Bosideng, a prominent Chinese manufacturer of down jackets and outerwear, set against the stunning backdrop of Yanqi Lake shortly before the festival's opening ceremony on April 18.The show garnered attention from a constellation of stars and esteemed filmmakers, including Oscar-winning Australian sound designer David White, actor Guo Xiaodong, singer Shang Wenjie, and Austrian director Jessica Hausner.The ongoing Huazhao Festival, or flower festival, at Yuyuan Garden in Shanghai is offering visitors immersive experience of traditional Chinese culture.Celebrated for over 2,000 years, the festival is held in the second month of the lunar calendar to commemorate the birthday of the flower goddess.

Mencius believed in the inherent goodness of human beings and advocated for moral, benevolent governance.Mencius' thoughts not only enriched Confucianism but also wielded a profound influence on Chinese philosophy and China's economic and social development. They are also providing philosophical guidance for the building of a shared future for mankind, remarked the institute director.Van Rompuy said in his speech that, because of globalization and modernization, different civilizations are more alike than they were in ancient times. The first full-time president of the European Council noted what Confucius said in The Analects — "Within the four seas we are all brothers," echos words in the European Anthem, a melody featuring German poet Friedrich von Schiller's Ode to Joy from 1785."Humanity in Europe paid a high price for the perverse idea of superiority through the deaths of millions throughout history and we drew lessons from all these. The European Union was a peace project built on this tragic failure," he said, adding that "in the second half of the 20th century, the forces of political and cultural convergence in Europe overtook those of divergence and the EU is the expression of the movement of convergence."The former European political leader also emphasized that to seek harmony, the keyword of Chinese civilization, every civilization and every nation must be humble and respect each other's cultures and political systems.The 2024 edition of the Competition for the Transmission and Promotion of the Beijing Central Axis was launched at the Capital Museum in Beijing on Sunday.Aimed at promoting the Central Axis, the core structure of Beijing that runs 7.8 kilometers from south to north, the annual competition has been hosted since 2021, attracting a total of more than 400,000 contestants from home and abroad.This year's competition features six tracks, including three recurring ones focusing on old town revitalization, creative expression via the art forms of video, painting and design, and cultural ambassadors who have contributed to the protection and promotion of the Central Axis.The 39th Shanghai Spring International Music Festival, the oldest music festival in China, will take place from Friday to April 14.This festival, together with the annual China Shanghai International Arts Festival in November, is an important platform for communication between artistic institutions from home and abroad, as witnessed through the decades of development in the music and dance scenes of Shanghai, according to Xia Yujing, Party secretary of the Shanghai Federation of Art and Literary Circles, the organizer of the festival.This year, the festival will feature 66 productions, 57 of which are concerts, with the other ones being dance shows.The opening concert, taking place at Shanghai Symphony Hall on Friday, is a gala event that will showcase outstanding Chinese compositions in celebration of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.More than 100 pieces of orchestra will bring together around 300 musicians from several notable Shanghai institutions, including instrumentalists from the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra, and singers from the Shanghai Opera House, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and the children's chorus of CWI Children's Palace.

"We suggest that countries should establish broader mechanisms for exchange and cooperation in the culture field, and deepen the breadth and depth of cultural exchanges.""Meanwhile, modern technology should be adopted to promote innovation and development in cultural exchange methods," he said. "We should open up more avenues for mutual learning and exchange among young people, promote deeper cultural dialogues among the world's youth who will bring continuous vitality and vigor to the progress of human civilization."In recent years, China has been making active efforts in international youth exchanges, with more and more universities and institutions inviting foreign youth, including young people from the United States, to study in China or tour to the country to experience the local culture.Chinese Ambassador to the US Xie Feng, speaking at the Vision China forum at the Asia Society in New York earlier in the month, said that more than 10,000 American youths have visited China since President Xi Jinping extended an invitation during the summit with US President Joe Biden last November to 50,000 American youth to visit China for exchanges and study programs over five years."We will build more bridges of dialogue and communication between our peoples to sustain the tradition of friendship," Xie said, welcoming more young Americans to come and make friends with Chinese people, experience Chinese culture and understand China from multiple dimensions.Addressing the parallel forum, Kang Zhen, vice-president of Beijing Normal University, said that universities, as an important base for talent cultivation and scientific research, have a natural role of becoming the platform for cultural exchange and mutual learning."In the future, Beijing Normal University will further promote cross-cultural international talent training programs, deepen high-level international dissemination of Chinese culture, and win more international consensus and promote exchanges and mutual learning of human civilizations," Kang said.Oumar Demba Ba, former chief diplomatic adviser to the President of Senegal, believes that China has demonstrated its farsighted vision for the future development of the world, which reflects a responsible attitude toward building peaceful international relations based on considerations of the interests of all countries.He highly praised the cooperation achievements in the cultural field between China and Senegal and called on all countries to work together, adapt to the changes of the times, build a more open and dynamic multilateralism, and construct a more fair, inclusive and equal international order.More than 150 government officials, experts, scholars, celebrities and youth representatives from 21 countries and regions attended this parallel forum.YORBA LINDA, the United States — A calligraphy and painting exhibition featuring works by autistic youth, along with a charity luncheon, was held on Tuesday at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California.Described by attendees as "a dialogue exploring art therapy and medical therapy for autistic children", the event attracted a diverse group of participants, including autistic children and families from China and the United States, professors from the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy, as well as local educational institutions, artists and entrepreneurs.Jointly sponsored by the Pan American Health Society, the China Volunteer Service Foundation and the Autistic Youth Art Education Foundation, the event showcased dozens of remarkable paintings created by individuals with autism. These works were collected through the China Volunteer Service Foundation's Light Plan, a public welfare initiative focused on "lighting up hope and finding light".The Light Plan Initiative was designed to help autistic children realize their rights to equal education, individual value and a happy life, and help their families, says Shi Bing, the plan's initiator.Autism, or autism spectrum disorder, is a neurological disorder affecting one's social interaction, communication, routine and more.

Small kids in vivid lion dancing costumes giggled as they listened to their teachers' instructions. Their excitement was infectious.

Their focus was evident as they readied for the performance. The air was electric with anticipation, a harmonious blend of people from different ages and countries.It was the afternoon of Sept 17, two days before the opening gala of 2024 Beijing Culture Forum, running from Sept 19 to 21. More than 800 domestic and international guests from more than 70 countries have joined the event.An event focusing on cultural exchange, discussions and the promotion of global cultural understanding, the 2024 Beijing Culture Forum provides a platform for showcasing cultural achievements and discussing future trends in global culture.The opening gala showcased a diversity of art forms, such as music, dance, martial arts, traditional Chinese operas and acrobatics which were not merely a celebration of Chinese heritage but also a testament to the power of cultural exchange, according to Wang Yin, the chief scriptwriter for the performances, responsible for the entire narrative structure, dialogue and direction of the shows."We have 12 shows in the gala. Artists from around the world shared their unique perspectives, enriching the event with a variety of styles and traditions. The audience, spellbound, was transported through a journey of heritage and artistry, witnessing a harmonious confluence of art forms and cultures," said Wang.Among the artistes performed during the opening gala was the 83-year-old percussionist Li Zhengui, who, along with his students, performed a show featuring dancers of Minzu University of China. Since 1993, Li, a professor of the Central Conservatory of Music, gathered his students to form the percussion ensemble. It was the first time that Li's ensemble performed together with dancers.According to Li, 14 people performed in the percussion ensemble during the gala, highlighting Chinese big drum or China Dagu, a traditional Chinese musical instrument which produces a powerful and resonant sound characterized by its deep, booming tones."When struck, the drum creates a rich, thunderous noise with a pronounced low pitch. Its sound is often vibrant and commanding," Li described. "We tried to use our music to symbolize our country's profound history and culture."Jiang Tiehong, the head of the dance school of Minzu University of China, led his students dance to the beats of the drums. Each step and spin were synchronized with the rhythm of the drums that beat with a powerful, resonant force. The big drum's deep tones reverberated through the stage, adding a heartbeat to the spectacle."We did rehearsals with the percussion ensemble for months. Though dancing and percussion performance are two different art forms, we worked together to present a harmonious combination," said Jiang, who has gained a large fan base with short videos of dancing with his students on social media platforms since this May.Chinese musical instruments were highlighted during the gala. One of the shows, titled Phoenix Singing and Ascending to the Sky, featured pipa (four-stringed Chinese lute) player Fang Jinlong, pianist Sun Jiayi and rhythmic gymnasts from the Competitive Sport School Affiliated to the Beijing Sport University.According to Fang, the music work staged during the gala was a rendition of the music piece with the same title used by Chinese rhythmic gymnasts when they competed during the recent Paris Olympic Games. Their routines were set to the music that incorporated traditional Chinese melodies and instruments, blending traditional Chinese musical with modern rhythmic gymnastics performances.The gala event also came alive with the graceful movements of three kung fu masters: 82-year-old Leung Kum-tong, 46-year-old Dong Chonghua and 48-year-old Liang Ziquan, commanding attention with a display of strength and beauty.The three kung fu masters, inheritors of Wing Chun, a southern Chinese form of kung fu that originated during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), performed together with dancers of Shenzhen Opera & Dance Theatre, during the gala. They showcased an excerpt of the dance drama, titled Wing Chun, which was premiered in 2022 and toured home and abroad."We had been working with these dancers to prepare the dance drama, which allowed Wing Chun to be seen by more people," said Liang Ziquan, who coached the dancers a few years ago when they started training for the dance drama. "These dancers worked hard to master the skill of Wing Chun and interpret them accurately within a short period of time — merely three years."According to Leung, a student of Ip Chun, eldest son of the Wing Chun master Ip Man, it values simplicity, using minimal movement to achieve maximum impact. Techniques are designed to be straightforward and practical. It teaches practitioners to control the centerline of their body and opponent's body, aiming to attack and defend along this central axis.Dong also participated in training the dancers. Inspired by his idol Bruce Lee, who was a student of Ip Man, Dong learned to practice Wing Chun as a teenager.Museums are evolving from simply collecting and protecting cultural relics to improving people's well-being and becoming an important force in promoting social development, said museum experts at a parallel forum of the Beijing Culture Forum on Friday.Themed "Cultural Heritage: Systematic Conservation and Creative Inheritance," the discussion gathered museums directors, experts of cultural heritage and scholars from home and abroad to discuss topics and problems facing the museum sector.An Laishun, president of Asia-Pacific Regional Alliance of International Council of Museums, said that the most important part of museum studies always focus on its collections. However, people's interest in museums and cultural heritages has been growing across the globe.With the growth of museums and the development of historical sites, these cultural institutions have now become a main way for people to learn about the past, help build shared memories, strengthen social bonds and create a sense of belonging for both groups and individuals. They also place new demands on the roles and functions of museums, said An.China has been the fastest-growing country in the world in terms of the number of museums over the past 20 years. Whether it's the number of newly registered and recorded museums each year in the past decade or the number of exhibitions held annually by museums nationwide in the past five years, China ranks among the top in the world, he added.According to Li Qun, director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, as of last year, there were 6,833 registered museums in China. From January to July this year, museums across the country received 780 million visitors.Louis Ng Chi-wa, director of the Hong Kong Palace Museum, said that big changes have taken place in China's museum sector in the past three decades and young people are showing great passion in museums and the traditional culture behind."When it comes to museums, we used to focus a lot on the protection and study of their collections. Now, museums are closely tied to people's entertainment, and we need to consider their new role: improving people's well-being and contributing to the development of society as a whole," he said.Last year, the Hong Kong Palace Museum received about 1.4 million visitors, with ticket prices set at 70 HK $ ($9) per person. The director found this surprising, as the city's population is less than eight million.At the forum, many directors of museums in and outside of China shared their experience on how to provide good service to visitors by either using technologies such as AI, virtual reality and big data, or creating innovative public programs.Two important cultural programs also announced its launching at the forum. The headquarters of the Alliance for Cultural Heritage in Asia, an organization initiated by China and joined by over 20 Asian countries, was officially settled down in Beijing. And the new branch of the National Water Museum of China is established at Bali, Indonesia.Bringing a festive atmosphere to Beijing, nearly 230,000 people visited the ongoing "The Temple of Earth and Me" book fair at the Ditan Park during the three-day Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.

Helping them keep in shape is 26-year-old Brazilian Ana Paula Zanolete, a black belt coach in Brazilian jujitsu, or BJJ.Moving to Shanghai this January, Zanolete is teaching a BJJ night course in the city's Jing'an District Culture Center, which is one of the 1,072 night art courses that the city is offering to the public in the fall semester. She is also one of the first foreign teachers to give such culture lessons at night schools.Shanghai's night courses have been trendy among those in the 18 to 55 age bracket who usually have day jobs. The public night school program initiated by the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Culture and Tourism has been in operation for almost 10 years, aiming at extending culture and arts education to a wider range of learners.Participants take 12 lessons given by professional tutors for about 500 yuan ($70), far below the market price. The fall semester enrolled nearly 25,000 students and have begun at 400 teaching locations across the city since this month.Co-teaching with another BJJ veteran coach from Turkmenistan, Zanolete's course is one of the most popular offerings this semester. All 25 spots in the class were sold out within six seconds when its online registration opened in August."Shanghai is a big and beautiful city with a cosmopolitan culture, and it has a big community of BJJ and martial arts. I love BJJ and training people and teaching new students. For me, it is a great opportunity and really interesting thing to do," says Zanolete.Apart from the night course, Zanolete also serves as a BJJ coach at a training institution in the city.A promotional conference for Jingdezhen, known as the "capital of porcelain" in China, was held in London on Tuesday to attract more tourists and porcelain lovers to visit the city in Jiangxi province.Hu Xuemei, secretary of the Jingdezhen Municipal Party Committee, gave an opening speech to an audience of around 150 people, including porcelain experts, collectors, travel writers, and artists from across the United Kingdom."Jingdezhen porcelain has been a quintessential cultural medium for China to connect to the world and for the world to understand China", said Hu, adding that through the ancient Maritime Silk Road, Jingdezhen porcelain pieces have become popular in Europe."Last year, we initiated the international tourism alliance of Silk Road cities and I sincerely invite you all to attend the 2024 China Jingdezhen International Ceramic Expo in October," Hu added.The ceramic culture of Jingdezhen has been passed down for more than 1000 years, and the Imperial Kiln Sites of Jingdezhen, which served China's imperial courts during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties were included in tentative list of World Heritage sites by the United Nations' cultural agency UNESCO in 2017.Since the 17th century, Jingdezhen porcelain has been highly prized by British collectors. The porcelain trade also influenced the British ceramics industry, inspiring the emergence of local designs and factories.Li Liyan, minister counselor for cultural affairs at the Chinese Embassy in the UK, said cultural exchange is a vital part of the China-UK relationship, and events such as this one will deepen mutual understanding and strengthen the friendship between our two nations."I hope more British friends will go to appreciate Jingdezhen and visit China in person. I believe everyone can find his own Jingdezhen," said Li.H-J Colston Inge, co-director of Engage with China and joint CEO of Chopsticks Club, who has been dedicated to building China literacy in Britain for 30 years, told the audience about her recent family visit to Jingdezhen.She also brought a tea cup, a tea scoop, and a tea saucer from her home town of Worcester to demonstrate the interconnectedness of people and culture between China and the UK."China has got us literally in the gut, that's what I think when I drink a cup of tea… I think we could do so much through education, travel, and art that can really find our cultures together," she said.Frances Wood, a renowned Sinologist and former head of the Chinese Collection at the British Library, recalled her first visit to Jingdezhen in the early 1980s."We all know Jingdezhen through porcelain. We've touched it, we've used it, and we admire it. But I would recommend it enormously as a place to visit. … The history in Jingdezhen was really tangible. The streets were as if built on porcelain," she said."And I think, one of China's greatest gifts to the world – ceramics. We can forget about gunpowder for the moment. Porcelain is an enormously great gift and we're all very grateful."The event also included a small exhibition of some 60 pieces of Jingdezhen porcelain, a live ceramic painting display by two craftsmen, and a music performance featuring instruments made of porcelain. The event also served as a product launch for three companies from Jingdezhen.Memoranda of understanding for further cooperation were signed at the event between Jingdezhen Municipal Bureau of Culture, Radio, Television and Tourism and MIC Connect Ltd, as well as between Jingdezhen Zijing International Travel Agency and Chopsticks Club.2024 Beijing Culture Forum will be held from Sept 19 to 21 in the capital. The forum takes "Inheritance, Creativity, and Mutual Learning" as its permanent theme.

It also displays a digital restoration of Cave 285 of the Mogao Grottoes. These efforts allow the audience to become immersed in the historical and cultural essence of the Dunhuang Caves.Additionally, performers from the Gansu Performing Arts Group captivated the audience at the opening with traditional Dunhuang music and dancing, offering a rich audiovisual experience.The exhibition aims to enhance cultural exchanges between China and New Zealand while promoting people-to-people exchanges by displaying the unique charm of art from the Dunhuang Caves.According to the organizers, Dunhuang culture is an indispensable part of the world's cultural diversity. Civilizations are richer and more colorful with exchanges and mutual learning. They hope this exhibition can contribute to promoting the links between the two countries, fostering healthy and stable development in bilateral relations."This exhibition is significant because it brings a rare opportunity for New Zealanders like myself to engage with one of the most important cultural and religious sites in the world and fosters people-to-people exchanges," says New Zealand parliament member Jenny Salesa.Involved with the development of arts and crafts for the last 70 years, the Beijing Gongmei Group displayed an array of classic and contemporary designs at the China International Fair for Trade in Services between Sept 12-16.Many of the pieces, including cloisonne vases symbolizing harmony and coexistence, and enamel ornaments decorated with Silk Road elements, drew attention.The group's exhibition made creative use of technology to present 3D visual recreations of traditional gifts.Additionally, cloisonne artists were invited to demonstrate their craft, permitting visitors to appreciate the beauty of traditional craftsmanship and cultural heritage.The company's Yuxun program also presented innovations of intangible cultural heritage items like Yi embroidery and Zhuang brocade, that work blend with modern life.Cultural creative items, ranging from Central Axis-themed enamel paintings to notebooks and refrigerator magnets with Summer Palace elements, enjoyed brisk sales.Wang Jingjing, deputy general manager of Gongmei, says that each piece on display represented a contemporary expression of traditional culture and added that Gongmei will continue to explore ways to preserve the essence of tradition while integrating modern aesthetics and technology.At the same time, she says the group will use new technology and manufacturing processes to enhance quality, ensuring that traditional handicrafts retain their warmth and emotional value while better aligning with the needs of modern consumers.Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival that fell on Sept 17 this year, an exhibition featuring the talented winners of the 2024 Chinese Bridge Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition summer camp took place at Tang Paradise in Xi'an, Shaanxi province.Participants from 18 countries showcased their calligraphy and painting works, joining Chinese tourists in the festive celebrations.Under the scorching sun, we pulled out the last datura stramonium plant from the roadside, adding it to a growing pile that had formed a small hill. The intense heat seeped through our thick work gloves, and some of us suffered injuries from the plant's sharp spines. Yet, the hard work felt rewarding as we contributed in our small way to restoring the local ecosystem.This task was part of Tsinghua University's overseas social practice program in Kenya, held from July 28 to Aug 10.During the two-week program, we stayed at the Soysambu Conservancy, a nonprofit wildlife conservation organization, where we immersed ourselves in global volunteer work aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, aimed at protecting the conservancy's unique environment.A key focus of our efforts was combating the spread of datura stramonium, an invasive toxic plant that has made areas of the conservancy uninhabitable for native wildlife and plants.We also conducted observational studies on the conservancy's wildlife, gaining valuable insights into Kenya's wildlife conservation efforts.Helen, a local volunteer, guided us throughout our experience. As an expert on giraffes, she has the remarkable ability to distinguish each of the approximately 180 giraffes by the patterns on their skin, which appear identical to our untrained eyes."They are unique, much like human fingerprints," Helen explained.Despite coming from different backgrounds, the volunteers all shared a deep passion for wildlife. As members of Generation Z, we recognize the urgency of achieving sustainable development, and protecting the environment is a crucial step toward that goal.I vividly remember a Japanese volunteer named Sakura, whose face lit up with joy whenever she talked about her love for zebras and giraffes.Paula, a volunteer from the United States, told me she had adopted a vegan lifestyle to contribute to environmental protection."But I believe all 17 Sustainable Development Goals are equally important," she said."You all have the potential to become conservation ambassadors," said Tonny, a local volunteer, during a lecture on endangered giraffes. "We must all be part of one big family that understands the importance of conservation."On our second day at Soysambu, we participated in a small youth forum, engaging in discussions with volunteers from around the world. This experience helped us break down stereotypes about Africa and truly feel like part of the big family Tonny had spoken about."We initially thought Africa would be extremely hot, but upon arriving in Kenya, we were surprised by the cool climate," said Qian Tian, also a member of our THU team, to Hendrik, another local volunteer.There are considerable cultural differences between China and Kenya, noted Tang Jianjun, counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, during our visit to the embassy.He emphasized that despite these differences, Kenya remains a steadfast friend of China and a model for the shared future community between China and Africa — and indeed, for all of humanity.Though our volunteer work is small in scale, I believe our efforts are both symbolic and meaningful.China-Kenya cooperation in wildlife conservation was highlighted by Vincent Obanda, principal research scientist at Kenya's Wildlife Research and Training Institute, who pointed out how initiatives like the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) — held this year from Sept 4 to 6 in Beijing — enable collaboration on critical environmental issues.As millennials who have grown alongside the development of the FOCAC, we bear the responsibility of deepening the China-Africa friendship and promoting mutual development.As students from THU and global citizens of the 21st century, we are committed to advancing the Global Development Initiative through our actions, using our energy and passion to contribute to global progress.Written by Mu Ruiying, 19, a sophomore at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University, double majoring in the basic science of mathematics and physics, and engineering physics.The 2024 "Discover China Cultural Tour” of Anhui for Diplomats in China took place from Sept 6 to 10in Anhui province.

"The rhythm was amazing."The 2024 Chinese Film Week opened in Canberra, capital city of Australia, on Wednesday.Eight Chinese films, including "Successor," "Full River Red," "Endless Journey," and "Chang An," will be screened in seven Australian cities.The Chinese Film Week, co-organized by the China Film Administration and the Chinese embassy in Australia, is supported by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the National Museum of Australia.Organizers said the eight films to be screened during the event showcase the booming development of China's film industry.It is believed that the film week will further promote the knowledge and understanding of Chinese culture among Australians, establish a channel of communication for Chinese and Australian film practitioners and companies, and enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries, the organizers said.Global Civilization Dialogues "Rendezvous with the Orchid," a cultural exchange event based on the platform of Orchid Awards, was held in Sydney on Thursday.The event was guided by the State Council Information Office of China, hosted by the China International Communications Group, and organized by the Orchid Awards Secretariat and the China Center for International Communication Development.Dozens of representatives of both countries' government institutions, people from literary and art circles, experts and scholars from universities and think tanks, leaders of relevant associations and organizations, and media representatives attended the event.

It also digitally restored Cave 285 of the Mogao Grottoes. These efforts allowed the audience to immerse themselves in the historical and cultural essence of the Dunhuang Grottoes.Additionally, performers from the Gansu Performing Arts Group captivated the audience with traditional Dunhuang music and dance, offering a rich audio-visual experience.One of the exhibits that start the exhibition The Glory of the Aegean Sea at the Nanjing Museum is a tiny stone amulet with a surface area of no more than 9 square centimeters and a thickness of around 0.6 cm. Its oval contour, together with a few incised lines across its surface, reminds a viewer of a curled-up human figure or a fetus in the womb.And that offers an apt metaphor for ancient Greek civilization, which the exhibition is hoping to shed light on through more than 270 pieces of exhibits from 14 museums and cultural organizations in Greece. The creativity and splendor spawned by that civilization means it has been viewed by many as lying at the origin of Western civilization, having exerted foundational influence on the latter in areas ranging from philosophy and science to art and literature.It's a starting point that people in the West look back on from time to time: the Renaissance that ended the millennium-long Dark Ages was emphatically declared a revival of interest in the ideas, art and literature of ancient Greek — and by extension Roman — civilization.For those familiar with Chinese history, that gigantic, society-wide effort, which involved among many other things the study of ancient Greek texts, might bring to mind one man: Confucius (551-479 BC). Living in the lively and chaotic time of China's Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC), the philosopher, long enshrined by Chinese history, advocated for his contemporaries to look back to the early Western Zhou Dynasty (c. 11th century-771 BC) as a model for moral governance and social harmony."It was still far too early for the two civilizations to intersect, let alone interact, but that doesn't mean parallels couldn't be found," says Guan Lin, curator of the Nanjing Museum exhibition, which is being held at the same time of another exhibition at the Shanghai Museum focusing on ancient Egyptian civilization and another one, at the Suzhou Museum, which is introducing its audience to the equally resplendent but lesser-known culture of ancient Assyria.Nanjing Museum highlights power of Athenian art, Zhao Xu reports.A man, probably in his early 20s, with short curly hair and a mantle draped over his left shoulder is accompanied by a dog. He is facing a bearded, much more mature-looking man donning a longer mantle baring his chest.Shown in profile on a marble stele dating to around 400 BC, the two are in the middle of a handshake, with both holding out their right hands."This was no handshake in the common sense of the word, but one that allowed a father to say a proper goodbye to his beloved son, who passed at his prime," says Guan Lin, curator of an ongoing exhibition, The Glory of the Aegean Sea, dedicated to ancient Greek civilization at the Nanjing Museum."In ancient Greek funerary art, the handshake is a gesture of final farewell, with the departed extending his or her right hand," she says."This marble relief is a grave stele found in Athens near a seaside church."A viewer, who looks closely enough, will find a small box dangling from the father's wrist.COLOMBO — Voices reading Chinese are often heard on the serene hilly campus of Sabaragamuwa University nestled in the southern foothills of Sri Lanka's central mountains.Stationed here are three teachers from China, teaching at a Confucius Classroom established in 2019 by China's Huanggang Normal University and Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka.Life here comes with many inconveniences. Mosquitoes swarm the teachers' dormitories which often have scary visitors like snakes and rats. Water, electricity, and internet cuts lasting seven or eight days during the rainy season are common. Fresh vegetables and daily essentials can only be bought at the farmers' market that is held once a week, and the nearest supermarket requires nearly an hour's drive on mountain roads.Despite all these, Zhu Song, the director of this classroom, who has persevered here for over three years, remains optimistic. "I have survived the most difficult challenges. I feel quite content with life now," she says.The other two women, Zhang Huan and Xia Zihan, share a positive and optimistic understanding of their profession as overseas Chinese teachers. "Rather than defining ourselves through sacrifice and dedication, we prefer to inspire children with positivity, friendliness, and vitality, igniting their enthusiasm for learning Chinese and their love for China."The artistic performance Hospitable Shandong, Eternal Friendship on the Silk Road was staged Sunday at the National Theatre in Belgrade.Co-organized by the department of culture and tourism in East China's Shandong province, the Chinese Cultural Center in Belgrade and the National Theatre in Belgrade, the event captivated a diverse audience, including Serbian Culture Minister Nikola Selakovic, government officials, representatives from the Chinese embassy in Serbia, and a high-level delegation from Shandong province.The evening began with the musical performance Hospitable Shandong, presented by the Shandong Opera, Dance, and Drama Theatre. The program offered a unique blend of traditional Chinese and Serbian performances featuring recitations, music, dance and acrobatics.Ancient Rhythm and Glory opened with a collaboration between Chinese performers and Serbian children in a presentation of Confucius Said, highlighting the philosopher's enduring wisdom linking ancient philosophy to modern values.A striking performance of Rhythm of Drums captivated the audience with a fusion of Chinese percussion and dynamic physical energy.The martial arts piece offered a compelling integration of strength and elegance, symbolizing the balance between external and internal harmony in Chinese civilization.A traditional Chinese pipa (four-stringed lute) solo, Dragon Boat, evoked the festive spirit of the Dragon Boat Festival.The acrobatic performance Happy Kitchen, performed by the Liaocheng Acrobatic Troupe, where everyday kitchen items were creatively transformed into an energetic, humorous performance, celebrated the joy of daily life in China.The stage performance of Together Toward the Future emphasized the spirit of collaboration.The grand finale, Serbian Thread — Dances from Central Serbia, brought Chinese and Serbian dancers together, symbolizing cultural unity that transcends borders. It also underscored the deepening ties between China and Serbia, emphasizing the importance of cultural exchange in fostering international friendships.Marvelous Realism, the first and largest exhibition of African photography in Asia, opened on Aug 30 at Fotografiska in Shanghai.Co-presented by Fotografiska and the KT Wong Foundation, the exhibition, curated by Ghanaian-British writer Ekow Eshun, brings together 16 established and emerging artists using photography and film as a means to envisage contemporary African cultural identity as a state of ongoing possibility.According to Lady Linda Wong Davies, founder and chairman of the KT Wong Foundation, after having a home for 30 years in South Africa, she has seen the remarkable development and progress that Africa has achieved with the help of China. However, there is still very little understanding of China's culture in Africa and vice versa.The philanthropist and art patron of Chinese descent who has been committed to fostering bridges between China and the wider world through her foundation then decided to initiate and create an exhibition of African photography, which she deemed as "the easiest and fastest way" to show the Chinese audience what contemporary Africa, beyond animals and starving children, really is.Marvelous Realism runs through Dec 1.If you want to go:10:30 am-11 pm, Tuesday to Sunday, Fotografiska, No. 127 Guangfu Road, Jing'an district, ShanghaiChildren from the Soong Ching Ling Peace Angel Art Troupe recently had the opportunity to perform for distinguished guests from Africa at the Great Hall of the People during the welcome banquet of the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.Preparing for this performance gave the troupe members valuable insights into African cultures."I could feel the eagerness of every member to seize this opportunity. The teachers introduced us to African songs and instruments, opening a window to understanding African cultures," said Liu Shenhe, a member of the troupe.Zhang Haoyang is a member of the art troupe's percussion group.He enjoys the art of performing percussion and over the years, his teachers have introduced him to various percussion instruments while teaching him about the musical expressions of different countries.His curiosity about African traditional culture was piqued while learning to play the djembe, a drum from West Africa.The crisp beats and passionate performance style of playing the instrument helped him experience the warmth and exuberance of the African people.A production fusing modern dance and ancient Chinese martial arts has been praised as a landmark that will inspire people for years to come as it ended a run of performances in London on Sept 7.Wing Chun, presented by the Shenzhen Opera and Dance Theater at the Sadler's Wells dance venue, tells the story of martial arts master Yip Man.The Seeing Dance website called it "a stunning evening … everything about Wing Chun exceeds expectations", while Everything Theatre described it as "a breathtaking show that will leave you with a feeling of awe and a newfound respect for martial arts and dance".In an end-of-run academic seminar, guests from the worlds of dance and theater production shared thoughts about the show and its impact.Christopher Bannerman, a visiting professor at the London Contemporary Dance School and founding director of the Cross-Art project at Beijing Dance Academy, said blending dance with what he called "the body culture of martial arts, handed down through thousands of years of Chinese history … has unlocked something — by cleverly channeling that energy, a new movement language has emerged"."I believe for the next 10 years, young choreographers in China will be inspired by this (show) and we will see a great flowering of Chinese creativity," he said.Glynis Hall, founder of Glynis Henderson Productions who has put on award-winning shows in the West End and on Broadway and who is deeply involved with Chinese productions, said she was delighted to see a show with such global appeal."In the past, I've seen so many Chinese artists who wanted us to take their work abroad but it was hard, because what they did was difficult to export, but what we have seen here is a million miles away from that," she said. "This is obviously the beginning of a very different future for Chinese work internationally. I congratulate you on crossing that bridge."Wang Yun, counselor of China's Embassy in the United Kingdom, praised the work of the show's creative team and said that one audience member, Josephine Chanter, deputy director of London's Design Museum, had commented how the performers "flew around the stage like birds" and said the performance had "opened a window to allow the audience to get into the spirit of wing chun and recognize Chinese culture".Wing Chun was first performed in China less than two years ago and made its overseas debut in Singapore 12 months ago. The show celebrated its 200th performance during the London run and will have a short run in Paris in October, with the producers keen to take it elsewhere.Hall said the fusion of dance and martial arts gave the show an obvious global audience appeal, and she hoped it could be the start of something bigger."Artists working together from different art forms is the chemistry that fires something brilliant, when they make each other better, and I think collaborations between China and the outside world are a larger form of that," she said. "The more we can find artists who want to connect and make work together, the more rich the world will be."The number of travelers from Malaysia surged by 548.4 percent year-on-year during the first seven months of this year, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism reported.Lin Ruiguo, who runs one of Malaysia's biggest outbound trip wholesalers, Golden Destinations, said his company is sending nearly 200 travel groups to China in September and October.The Beijing tourism authority took six travel operators to the Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents fair between Sept 6 and 8 to continue boosting bilateral tourism.At the Beijing exhibition booth, a variety of interactive intangible cultural heritage activities were available, attracting many visitors. They were able to experience applying Peking Opera makeup and kite making, and also taste Chinese food.Beijing operators listened to the needs of their Malaysian counterparts, with the aim of improving the quality of international services, enhancing the international language environment, conducting standardized training for the hotel and service industries, and providing convenient payment services for inbound tourists.During the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing, the intangible cultural heritage exhibition area was a highlight. Iraqi journalist Hamid Mahdi Faraj had the opportunity to experience for himself the art of Beijing kite making and even crafted a ring. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, hosted a banquet on Wednesday to welcome international guests who are in Beijing for the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).A group of children sang and danced to "Waka Waka," the official theme song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, played cheerful African drums, and extended a warm welcome to the distinguished international guests who came from afar.African students in China discuss their continent's cultural richness and the potential for deepening China-Africa cooperation in Youth Power.Many African friends living in China are often asked a curious question by locals: Is Africa hotter than China's sweltering sanfu period, known as the "dog days of summer"?This question was one of the topics explored in the latest episode of China Daily's Youth Power, which aired on Aug 30, featuring seven young people from six African nations.Jenipher Asiimwe, a 35-year-old Ugandan student at the Communication University of China, shared that Uganda's climate differs from China's. While China experiences four distinct seasons, Uganda typically has a dry season and a rainy season."The temperature during the dry season can range from 28 C to 31 C, whereas during the rainy season, it drops to around 24 C," she explained.The diverse climates and geographical features across Africa have given rise to distinctive natural landscapes, including the famous wildebeest migration.Calvin Nyagudi, a Kenyan student pursuing his doctorate at Beijing Jiaotong University, described the breathtaking scene of wildebeests crossing rivers. "Some of them are attacked by crocodiles, while others manage to reach the other side. It's quite magnificent," he said, noting that the best time to witness this spectacle is during July and August.In addition to its striking natural scenery, Africa, as the world's second most populous continent, is also renowned for its cultural diversity.Uzodinma Chinenye Gerlof, a 29-year-old Nigerian student at Beijing Foreign Studies University, highlighted that Nigeria is home to around 250 ethnic groups speaking over 500 languages."All these ethnic groups come together to form one country and live peacefully together," he said.He is amazed that Africa's diverse cultures have not hindered the continent's unity, progress, or global interactions.A good example, as mentioned by the episode's host Zhong Yutong, is the Bandung Conference. In 1955, representatives from 29 Asian and African countries and regions gathered in Bandung, Indonesia. This historic event marked the first major international conference where Asian and African nations independently discussed their interests and development.The conference resonated with the rising global movements for national liberation at the time and remains a significant moment in China-Africa cooperation and friendship, which emphasizes principles of equality, mutual benefit, and inclusivity."In Tanzania, we gained our independence in 1961, and our diplomatic relationship with China was established in 1964. This year, we celebrate our 60th anniversary," said Fathiya Mohamed Said, a 25-year-old Tanzanian student.As a medical student at Jiangsu University, Said observed that while many African students study medicine abroad and return home, Africa still faces considerable healthcare challenges.She explained that the problem is often not a lack of medical talent but rather the inadequate supply of essential medical equipment and medications. Fortunately, Tanzania has benefited from China's humanitarian assistance, which has greatly improved the well-being of its people."I really appreciate the Chinese medical team. It's not a one-time occurrence where they say, 'OK, we'll come back in five years or once a decade'; it's an annual thing that they do every year," she said.Asiimwe also mentioned that one of the major hospitals in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, was established through collaborative efforts between China and Uganda.According to her, people traveling from the western city of Fort Portal to Kampala once faced a two-day journey covering 281 miles, which posed a serious risk to those in urgent need of medical care. However, with the support of Chinese enterprises, the road linking the two locations has been significantly improved, reducing travel time to just four hours.Nyagudi also highlighted China's role in helping Kenya develop critical transportation infrastructure. One standout project is the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway, a flagship collaboration between China and Kenya under the Belt and Road Initiative.According to Nyagudi, this railway has played a crucial role in advancing Kenya's economic and social growth, earning it the local title of a "road to happiness".While pursuing his doctoral degree in economics and management in China, Nyagudi has gained valuable insights into poverty alleviation through China's rural revitalization efforts.He pointed out that in the past, inadequate rural infrastructure in Kenya, particularly poor road conditions, allowed middlemen to exploit farmers by purchasing their products at low prices, leading to substantial profits for the middlemen while leaving the farmers disadvantaged.With improved infrastructure now in place, Nyagudi is developing software to address this issue. He is inspired by China's successful e-commerce platforms such as Pinduoduo and the Taobao villages model — a poverty reduction initiative that engages rural residents in e-commerce to promote local products online."They help farmers link directly to consumers," Nyagudi said. "If China can do it, so can we — and we will do it."For Jenny Andrea, a 19-year-old Cameroonian student at Tsinghua University, the advancement of infrastructure not only improves the transportation of goods but also encourages cultural interactions in Cameroon.She explained that Cameroon is often referred to as "Africa in miniature" due to its rich diversity in ethnic groups. In this context, infrastructure plays a crucial role in helping these groups understand and appreciate each other's cultural differences."The world needs China-Africa cooperation because I believe it has the potential to foster growth, cultural exchange, and sustainable development on a global scale, and that's what the world needs right now," Andrea said.Marvelous Realism, the first and largest exhibition of African photography in Asia, opened on Aug 30 at Fotografiska in Shanghai.Curated by Ghanaian-British writer Ekow Eshun and co-presented by Fotografiska and the KT Wong Foundation, the exhibition brings together 16 established and emerging artists using photography and film as a means to envisage contemporary African cultural identity as a state of ongoing possibility.According to Eshun, Africa has long been closely associated with famine and poverty owing to the portrayal of Western news and documentaries, which has created the stereotype of the continent. However, the continent brims with vitality and imagination through the lens of African artists and artists of African descent. Some works featured at Marvelous Realism are specific to Africa, whereas others respond to universal questions that can resonate with a global audience.Sitting in a conservation forum in Northwest China's Gansu province, Afghan archaeologist Azizuddin Wafa was intensely focused, taking notes with one hand and capturing photos of each slide with the other as a Chinese scholar delivered a presentation on desalination techniques.The ongoing forum took place in late August in Dunhuang — home to the Mogao Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage Site — bringing together hundreds of experts and scholars from 16 countries to exchange knowledge on cave temple conservation.Wafa's participation is part of a broader training program in China for Afghan archaeology and cultural preservation professionals."We've gained a lot of experience. China's use of science and technology in preserving cultural relics has been particularly helpful," he says, adding that over the years, China has made continuous efforts to support Afghan talent development.Since 2022, around 70 Afghan government officials and scholars have attended three training sessions organized by China's Ministry of Commerce and hosted by the Central Academy of Culture and Tourism Administration.The latest training session Wafa attended began in Beijing on Aug 14 and includes 23 participants. For 16 days, they studied Chinese law and regulations on cultural preservation, archaeological science and digital techniques. The program also includes visits to cultural landmarks such as the Temple of Heaven, the Great Wall, the Mogao Caves and institutions like the National Museum of China."China and Afghanistan both lie along the ancient Silk Road and share deep historical ties with a long tradition of cultural exchanges," says Miao Bin, deputy director of the international exchange department at the Central Academy of Culture and Tourism Administration.In 2018, a team from the Dunhuang Academy became one of the first Chinese academic groups to conduct research in Afghanistan. An exhibition featuring treasures from the National Museum of Afghanistan has also toured Chinese cities, including Dunhuang and Beijing, garnering widespread acclaim.Mayel Aqa Karimy, director of the ancient coin gallery at the National Museum of Afghanistan, has been involved in cultural relic preservation for nearly two decades. This is his second time attending a training program in China."Afghanistan and China share many similarities in culture and art. The conservation techniques I've learned here can be applied at sites in Afghanistan," Karimy says.During his previous training, Karimy visited Beijing, Xi'an in Shaanxi province and Dunhuang, and was impressed by the sustainable preservation efforts in Chinese cities. This time, he is focusing on China's digital technology, hoping to use these advanced techniques in his country to better protect its cultural heritage.Karimy also highlights China's ongoing assistance in preserving Afghanistan's historical sites and its commitment to training Afghan professionals.Su Bomin, dean of the Dunhuang Academy and a keynote speaker at the forum, also participated in last year's training program. Su emphasizes that China is willing to share its experience in cave temple preservation with the world.According to Miao, China's overseas training programs are fostering deeper cooperation with Afghanistan in cultural preservation.After the Dunhuang forum, the Afghan participants returned to Beijing for further academic discussions. Chinese archaeologists are also scheduled to travel to Afghanistan to conduct joint research at the ancient Buddhist heritage site Mes Aynak, 40 kilometers southeast of Kabul.This year, China has expanded similar training programs to other countries, including Cambodia and Iran, to enhance professional resource exchanges.The Chinese capital rolled out a sample of its many attractions to travelers from Bangkok, Thailand from Friday to Sunday. The event showcased Beijing as a global tourist destination and was jointly hosted by the Beijing Bureau of Culture and Tourism, AirAsia and Beijing Daxing International Airport.It featured exhibitions for calligraphy and paper-cutting, interactive experiences like games and influencer dialogues, and vibrant cultural performances with a distinct Beijing flavor, attracting many local attendees.Thailand is a significant source market in Asia for Beijing, and since the implementation of the visa-free policy, the number of inbound tourists from Thailand has steadily increased. According to the Beijing bureau, from January to July this year, more than 55,800 Thai tourists visited Beijing, a year-on-year increase of 445.1 percent. This event is expected to further leverage the benefits of the visa-free policy by effectively reaching target audiences through airlines, airports, travel agencies, and media channels, thereby attracting more Thai tourists to Beijing.Papermaking technology was introduced to Central Asia in the 8th century and arrived in Europe around the 12th century. "It changed the historical process of Europe because papermaking technology made knowledge dissemination possible at reduced costs and broke the monopoly of knowledge by nobles and clerks," says professor Xi Huidong.Gilbank points out that movable type printing was also a revolutionary invention, "The conjunction of those two things was what really moved us into the early modern world," he says.Professor Xi Huidong points out that besides food, language also traveled along the ancient Silk Road routes. He takes the Shaanxi dialect " kelimacha" as an example.Everybody has heard of the Silk Road，but not that many people know what the Silk Road really is. Xi Huidong, deputy dean of the Institute of Silk Road Studies of Northwest University, uses a color-coded system to illustrate the four main routes of the Silk Road.The ancient Silk Road facilitated the diffusion of various kinds of fruits, vegetables, spices and culinary traditions which we now take for granted. For example, as Professor Xi pointed out, beef and mutton that are used to make the famous Shaanxi dish niurou paomo or yangrou paomo, which means beef or lamb stew with pita bread, were introduced to China from Western Asia about 4,500 years ago.Festa mentions a myth between China and Italy on the origin of pasta, whether the pasta really originated from the noodles that Marco Polo brought to Italy. But the very fact of the existence of this myth testifies to  the "spirit of the Silk Road", she says."It says that we really are like one big community. Our basic needs are the same. And taste could be shared". Watch it again: Embracing Cultures, 'Cultural legacy of the Silk Road'A salon explores the legacies of the ancient trade routes that connected China with the West to discern what they mean for our world today and tomorrow, Erik Nilsson reports in Xi'an.Italian archaeologist Marcella Festa surprised fellow participants of a recent salon about the Silk Road when asked to name the one artifact that she believes best epitomizes the trade route.Her answer? Camels."It reminds us that the Silk Road is not made of objects. It's made of living beings," says the associate professor at the School of Cultural Heritage of Northwest University in Xi'an, Shaanxi province.Indeed, these creatures have, perhaps as much as silk itself, become synonymous with the intercontinental transport network that flourished for millennia. They literally served as the vehicles for trade and exchange that shaped the routes and, ultimately, the world beyond."The Silk Road would not be possible without humans meeting each other, without animals carrying things. So, it's a good reminder for us to not just look at the objects, which are very beautiful and very significant in terms of history and artistic value, but also people — how people lived, why did they meet, how they met — because these are the aspects that actually built the Silk Road."Festa joined two other academics from Northwest University: School of Foreign Languages associate professor Briton Robin Gilbank and Xi Huidong, deputy dean of the Institute of Silk Road Studies, as well as two moderators from China Daily.The formation and development of early text in major ancient civilizations was highlighted at an academic forum that kicked off on the Suzhou Campus of Renmin University of China in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, on Wednesday.Themed on "From Practices to Things: First Books in the Ancient World", the forum was part of RUC's China-Europe Civilization Forum mechanism, a high-level academic dialogue platform in collaboration with partner universities abroad.The two-day event hosted participants from Princeton University, the University of Chicago and Columbia University in the United States, the University of Oxford and Durham University in the United Kingdom and Germany's Free University of Berlin, along with Chinese scholars from Fudan University, Nanjing University, Renmin University of China and Jingzhou Museum of Hubei province, among others.The experts traced the origins of books from multiple ancient civilizations, such as Greece, Rome, Egypt, Sumeria and China, regarding the social and cultural atmosphere, knowledge practices, participants, materials and mediums that facilitated the formation of diverse textual cultures.Sinologist Martin Kern, a professor at Princeton University and co-director of RUC's International Center for the Study of Ancient Text Cultures, pointed out in his report that the book culture of China dates back to the fifth century BC and emerged with social practices such as philosophical debate, poetry performances, historical anecdotes, royal speeches and political remonstrances.These shorter texts were later compiled into larger anthologies of anonymous individual texts, giving rise to the country's earliest book culture which prioritized compilation and annotation over authorship, interpretation and commentary over the written text itself.John Baines, professor emeritus of Egyptology at the University of Oxford, discussed how the initial writing system of ancient Egypt, as a method of display, marking and notation, evolved into continuous language and texts.Glenn Most, a professor of Greek philology at Italy's Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, pointed out that ancient Greeks identified works of natural philosophy by Pherecydes and Anaximander as the earliest Greek books rather than poetic epics of Homer and Hesiod.Don't miss the second episode of Embracing Cultures, "Cultural legacy of the Silk Road", airing Aug 29 at 7:30 PM.The ancient Silk Road connected East and West, facilitating not only the exchange of goods, but also a vibrant flow of culture, ideas, and knowledge. Join us to explore the cultural exchanges that flourish along the routes and to discuss its relevance in today's world, particularly in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative.Hosts:Hu Zhe, Erik NilssonGuests: Xi Huidong, Marcella Festa, Robin GilbankSquares, circles and triangles of vibrant colors neatly line up on the canvases, forming orderly compositions of mathematical allure that enchant and mystify viewers in equal measure.Those geometric shapes, by Uruguayan artist Carlos Presto, are close to each other but carefully separated with small gaps between them, evoking the social distance that people had to practice when the COVID-19 pandemic was ravaging the world.Presto's paintings are on display at his solo exhibition Games of Illusion at the Uruguayan Art Space in Beijing's 798 art district until Sept 20, offering Chinese audiences a window into the Latin American country's contemporary art.Mostly selected from the artist's Virus Series, with works reflecting the experience during the pandemic, representing in different forms an analysis and recreation of social estrangement and the search for a reunion, said Uruguayan gallerist Diana Saravia, who co-curated the exhibition with Chinese curator Zhang Siyong."The purity of Presto's work makes us wonder how he achieves such technical perfection. His passion for rigorous mathematical calculation turns his circles and squares into a complex and ordered puzzle of great beauty," Saravia told the China Daily website during a recent interview.Presto, 64, is also one of around 20 artists represented by the Diana Saravia Gallery in Montevideo, Uruguay's capital and largest city.Fernando Lugris, Uruguayan ambassador to China, commended Saravia as a leading figure in Uruguay's contemporary art scene. Yet, the 52-year-old gallerist came from humble beginnings."I was born in Cerro de las Cuentas, a small town of 300 inhabitants. At the age of 18 I set out for Montevideo, a city that allowed me to develop my studies and activity and where today, with more than 25 years of work, I position myself as a leading and avant-garde woman in the cultural scene of my country," she said.Calling herself an enthusiastic, courageous woman dedicated to the management, dissemination and marketing of works of art in the local and international circuit, Saravia started as a salesperson, which helped her to learn how to sell artwork at international art fairs.During a talk she gave at the Uruguayan embassy in Beijing on Friday, the curator lamented that despite Uruguay's booming contemporary art, the country has a small art market, which necessitates bringing the country's art to the global market."Believe me, the level of art in Uruguay is marvelous. We just need to be able to show it to the world," she said.Editor's note: Amity between the people holds the key to sound state-to-state relations. China Daily will come out with a series of stories highlighting Chinese cities' special connections with sister cities, mutual understanding, trust and friendship between peoples of different countries and cultural backgrounds, and shining light on "city diplomacy".As the Japanese saying goes: "Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend." While this embodies companionship, it only partially captures the dynamic and enduring partnership between Tianjin in northern China and Kobe in western Japan. Their relationship is a fascinating dance of sisterhood and mutual support, forged over decades of collaboration since the two became friendship cities.China and Japan normalized their relations in September 1972, setting the stage for interactions at all levels. Just a year later, in 1973, Tianjin and Kobe embarked on a new journey of friendship. On June 24, 1973, they signed a friendship city agreement, the first of its kind between a Chinese city and a Japanese city. The pact marked the beginning of a relationship that transcends national and political boundaries, forging a special bilateral bond.More than 50 years later, Kenji Takahashi makes his daily commute along the tranquil Haihe River in Tianjin. As Takahashi walks along the river, he can see the striking similarities between Tianjin and his hometown Kobe.As the former representative of Kobe in Tianjin, Takahashi sees a story rooted in their shared history — both were bustling ports and gateways to their respective countries, each boasting a rich maritime heritage.Yet, it was their shared vision for the future that truly cemented their connection. As China began its reform and opening-up, Kobe, with its advanced infrastructure and industrial prowess, emerged as a valuable partner, offering experience and support."In the 1980s, Tianjin Port faced challenges of congestion and outdated infrastructure," Takahashi said. "Recognizing the need for improvement, Kobe city sent delegations to offer guidance and expertise. They proposed a comprehensive long-term renovation plan for the Port of Tianjin, aimed at enhancing its efficiency and competitiveness in the maritime industry."This collaboration served as the bedrock for development of Tianjin Port and stands as a milestone in the enduring ties between Tianjin and Kobe, he added.Today, Tianjin ranks eighth in the American Journal of Transportation's Top 100 Container Ports. Customs data showed that in the first half of the year, Tianjin Port has cumulatively completed a cargo throughput of 248 million metric tons, a 3.1 percent year-on-year rise, and a container throughput of 11.88 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units), an increase of 4.6 percent year-on-year. The Port of Kobe, which ranked third in 1990, now stands at 65th.It is no wonder that Takahashi, a frequent visitor to Tianjin's port, marvels at its state-of-the-art infrastructure; the seamless, automated operations; and the sheer scale of activity.Accompanied by the music of composer Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, nearly 20 Hong Kong dancers showcased the charm of the "shared origin of martial arts and dance" through Chinese martial arts including Tai Chi, Tuishou and Sanda.The Rite of Spring is a great piece of classical music. Miranda Chin, artistic director of Hong Kong-based Miranda Chin Dance Company, said that countless artists around the world have interpreted this work through their own cultures, inspiring her to create a dance drama that integrates Chinese elements and oriental aesthetics.After more than 20 years of creation and refinement, Chin's team's He and The Rite of Spring ("He" means "harmony" in Chinese) made its debut at French May, a large-scale art and cultural event in Hong Kong, in June 2023.The dance drama was one of 12 arts projects in Hong Kong selected and awarded by the China National Arts Fund 2024. The funding enables Chin's dance company to go on a tour in various places throughout the year.Later this year, Chin's team will bring the dance drama to France. Chin looks forward to seeing foreign audiences appreciate Chinese culture which values harmony and peace through familiar music.The dance drama is a successful attempt to blend East and West. In 2002, Chin began creating the dance drama when she was passionate about learning Tai Chi and martial arts. Based on ancient Chinese sacrificial rites, Chin incorporated Tai Chi, Tuishou and Sanda in her initial creation."Being able to interpret new connotations for the classic work The Rite of Spring from a unique Chinese aesthetic perspective and modern dance style not only reflects the charm of traditional Chinese culture, but also shows the innovation of contemporary artistic creation," said Chin, who will continue to explore more possibilities for the integration of Eastern and Western cultures in the future.In the 1960s, as a dancer, Chin had the opportunity to be exposed to a diverse range of dance styles, including ballet and jazz. Among all dances, she was most passionate about Chinese dance."The costumes, music and movements of Chinese dance are very unique and rich, which fascinates me," Chin said, adding that she had always hoped to understand her own culture through dance.Over the past decades, Chin has choreographed and directed nearly 100 dance works, many of which were rooted in Chinese culture. "I hope these dances will serve as ambassadors of cultural exchange, spreading Chinese culture more widely," she said.Documentary maker brings 62-year-old ambition to life by finishing explorer's fabled route, Xing Yi reports in London.It's a story about pursuing one's dream, a story of collaboration between China and the United Kingdom, and a story of cultural exchanges and mutual learning — all contained within the new documentary film In the Footstep of Marco Polo, which had its world premiere in London earlier in July.Marco Polo was an Italian merchant and explorer who traveled through Asia along the ancient Silk Road in the 13th century, ending his journey in Dadu, the capital of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), which is present-day Beijing.His observations and details about his route were recorded in the book The Travels of Marco Polo, which was later translated into many European languages and that inspired generations of Western travelers to go East.Stanley Johnson was one such follower of Marco Polo.An author, environmentalist, and former member of the European Parliament, he is also the father of the former United Kingdom prime minister Boris Johnson.Last year, Stanley and his youngest son, Max Johnson, participated in a China-UK documentary project that showcased the country's astonishing landscapes while featuring engaging interviews with locals and capturing the hilarious banter between the 84-year-old father and his 39-year-old son.Following part of the ancient route, their journey covered more than 5,000 kilometers, starting from a land port 5,100 meters above sea level on the China-Pakistan border at the Khunjerab Pass and crossing the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, through the Taklamakan Desert, through Gansu province to the Mogao Caves, traversing the highlands of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, and concluding in Beijing.BEIJING - Chinese hit video game "Black Myth: Wukong" has taken the gaming world by storm, selling more than 10 million copies across all platforms in just three days after its release, developer Game Science announced on Friday night.Considered the first Chinese-developed "Triple-A" title, "Black Myth: Wukong" topped the "most-played games" list on Steam, a leading gaming platform, merely an hour after its debut on Tuesday morning.Game Science revealed that the game's maximum number of concurrent players across all platforms surpassed 3 million."Black Myth: Wukong" draws inspiration from the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. The novel follows the adventures of a monk and his three disciples, with a particular focus on Sun Wukong, the legendary Monkey King known for his supernatural powers and mischievous nature.Although most players are from China, the game's popularity is spreading rapidly worldwide. Some enthusiastic fans have compiled over 200 pages of background material to help international players understand the story's deep cultural roots.Celebrated for its rich cultural heritage and modern gaming aesthetics, the game has become a sensation transcending the gaming community. Its unprecedented success has even boosted the stock prices of some companies and spurred tourism in Shanxi province, one of the key filming locations for the game.With the first weekend now underway, industry experts anticipate that game sales will continue to surge.Goldman Sachs previously projected that "Black Myth: Wukong" could achieve sales of 12 million copies on Steam, generating over 3 billion yuan ($420 million) in revenue. In a bullish scenario, the game could reach 20 million units sold, with revenue topping 5 billion yuan.A gala evening titled The Spirit of the Great Wall, performed by China’s Jilin Provincial International Cultural Exchange Center, was held in London on Monday.Inspired by stories surrounding China’s architectural masterpiece the Great Wall, the event featured a variety of performances, including dance, traditional folk opera, acrobatics, and martial arts, showcasing the country’s diverse ethnic cultures.The show featured 13 performances, starting with a grand display that wowed spectators with the powerful and spirited beats of Chinese drums.The audience was also captivated by the graceful elegance of the folk dances. A group of dancers, wearing red straw hats and flowing red skirts, moved gracefully to the center of the stage, with their nimble dance steps showcasing the unique beauty of the East.The art troupe from Northeast China's Jilin province also brought their show to Edinburgh from August 12 to 14 during the Edinburgh International Festival, one of the world’s most prestigious arts festivals, held in the Scottish capital.“We hope that, through the performance, United Kingdom audiences can understand the profoundness of traditional Chinese culture and experience its diverse ethnic traditions,” said Sha Bin, director of the Jilin Provincial International Cultural Exchange Center."Wukong! My bro!" exclaimed Kalex Willzy when he saw Sun Wukong hiding his golden staff in his ear in an electronic game, which instantly reminded him of the famous scene from the 16th century Chinese novel Journey to the West.Once, Sun Wukong's fame in the West could be attributed to the Japanese anime Dragon Ball, in which he goes by the name Son Goku. Now the name Wukong is attracting a huge number of eyeballs on You-Tube, and online communities dedicated to Journey to the West have appeared on social media platforms.Willzy, a radio host for a hip-hop channel in the UK and a YouTuber, began exploring Journey to the West last year through the 1986 Chinese TV series. His interest in Chinese mythology was sparked after seeing a preview of Black Myth: Wukong, a Chinese video game based on Journey to the West.Online gamers can't stop gushing about the game that was released on Tuesday. "I've been an assassin during the French Revolution, a cowboy on the American frontier and a tough guy in bustling cities, but now I want to be China's Monkey King," wrote one player on social media.For Willzy, it's as much about learning as about playing. "By playing as Wukong we learn much about him and Chinese culture because we have to if we want to be successful. We spend hours, days, weeks and even months playing, so naturally we often learn a lot from them."Cas, 35, a YouTuber in the United States, said: "I wanted to know more about Journey to the West once I began researching Black Myth: Wukong." Cas, who runs Fextralife, a games review channel with more than a million followers, said he delved into Journey to the West by drawing on a variety of sources, including forums, TV shows, anime, manga and online encyclopedias.Wukong's story is "a gateway to Chinese culture", Cas said, adding that Wukong is the "Frodo (of Lord of the Rings) of Asia". He became acquainted with Sun Wukong many years ago from the game League of Legends and Dragon Ball."There is an under-representation of Chinese myths, literary works and fables in gaming," Cas said. "I'm glad I managed to create a relatable overview for one of China's biggest classic novels and received so much support for it."Black Myth: Wukong has become a top seller on Steam, a global digital distribution platform for games, and peak concurrent game players on Steam surpassed two million, reflecting China's expanding cultural presence beyond traditional boundaries, with video games the new ambassadors of its heritage."Chinese cultural elements are merging with cutting-edge technologies to form a digital flow, creating a new image of China that is cute and cool as well as dynamic," Xinhua quoted Shi Anbin, professor for global media and communication at Tsinghua University as saying.Li Tianfei, a writer and popularizer of the epic, said the tale of Sun Wukong and his companions is not just a cultural treasure but a story with global and universal relevance."At its core, Journey to the West is about growth and freedom. This mirrors the journey of Marvel's superheroes and is a key reason why the story is continuously reimagined abroad."What sets Sun Wukong apart from other heroes is the rich tapestry of nearly 1,000 years of Chinese culture that has shaped him. Journey to the West offers a sprawling narrative that covers a perilous journey, numerous encounters and exploration of various cultures. The versatility of its narrative makes it a rich source for diverse storytelling genres and cultural backgrounds.The tale has been translated into more than a dozen languages, with more than 60 versions available worldwide. Digital media has further propelled international adaptations of the story."We need to move beyond the confines of the 400-year-old original to offer something new. The story's core lies in its universal human themes," Li said, adding, "Journey to the West is like a river, continuously taking in tributaries and creating ripples. The ripples are the essence of the tale."Duan Jichu contributed to this story."Black Myth: Wukong", a single-player video game, became an instant hit upon its launch on Tuesday, setting multiple records including that for the highest number of simultaneous online users, with hashtags on the video game accumulating a record 2 billion views on China's X-like microblog Weibo by Wednesday.The game, developed and published by Chinese company Game Science, a new start-up, has since been trending online, both domestically and internationally. Based on the monkey king, Sun Wukong, from the Chinese literary classic Journey to the West, "Black Myth: Wukong" was, at one point, being played concurrently by 2.2 million players on Steam, a major online gaming platform, on Wednesday. No wonder some experts said the adaptation of Journey to the West will prompt Western players to learn more about China's culture."Black Myth: Wukong", even before its official launch in China, benefited not only the gaming industry, but also sectors such as the stock market. On the other hand, the cultural and tourism departments of cities, counties and rural areas have released multiple collaborative videos, demonstrating the potential of such works to integrate the cultural and tourism sectors. Also, ride-hailing enterprise Didi, the Lenovo Group and Luckin Coffee are incorporating elements inspired by "Black Myth: Wukong" into their promotional campaigns.The video game has spread across societies, promoting the coordinated development of related industries in the shortest span of time.None of this has happened by chance. In August 2020, when Game Science, which at the time employed fewer than 30 people, released a promotional video of "Black Myth: Wukong", the realistic details, aesthetic features and exemplary craftsmanship of the video game sparked widespread discussions, with some people asking when China will have its own AAA-level game and when Chinese-made games will reflect a distinctive Chinese style."Black Myth: Wukong" has answered those questions, as it has been widely lauded as China's first AAA game — high development cost, long production cycle and huge investment, with industry analysts viewing its sudden fame and popularity as marking an inflection point for China's PC/console gaming sector.All countries and regions have endeavored to showcase their culture to the world and enhance their image through media such as movies, TV shows, and online posts including video clips and online games. Thanks to such endeavor, the Journey to the West series, which debuted in the 1960s, achieved international success, influencing future Japanese anime creations and laying the foundation for Chinese-made animated films.Subsequent animated films such as Nezha Conquers the Dragon King have left a clear imprint on viewers' mind. This is where the biggest significance of "Black Myth: Wukong" lies.Video games have become an important part of the common cultural experience of youths across the world, irrespective of their ethnicity, race, creed, color and religion. In fact, video games were featured as competitive electronic sports at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, in 2023. And before the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced that the first Olympic Esports Games will be held in Saudi Arabia in 2025, indicating gaming as an official Olympic sport has a promising future.Over the past few years, China's cultural industry, which has become one of the pillar industries of the national economy, has given us one excellent production after another, from The Wandering Earth and The Three-Body Problem to milestone creations such as Chang'an.From original science fiction films and works reflecting foreign cultures to the productions reflecting the rich traditional Chinese culture, a series of high-quality creations with excellent commercial, social and professional value have enthralled audiences in the past years, mirroring the qualitative improvement of China's cultural industry. In the gaming world, an AAA-level game like "Black Myth: Wukong" shows that the Chinese cultural industry has mastered more than just the simple technological and commercial aspects of video games.In the era of mobile internet, online or video games not only influence film and TV productions, but also often serve as the ballast for success in the global market. From Apple, Amazon and Google to Microsoft, Tesla and NVIDIA, the gaming industry chain involves artificial intelligence, cloud computing, global real-time transmission networks, data storage, game engines, virtual reality, augmented reality, and other hardware and software industries, which play a crucial role in determining the global financial order. That's why "Black Myth: Wukong" has had a huge social impact globally.High-dimension media, online or video games, and electronic sports, which influence the global youth, have become a major field of global ideological struggle. Games are increasingly reshaping the virtual world and expanding the geopolitical space of the real world, becoming the main representatives of virtual space geopolitics.Compared with the physical geopolitical landscape, the power struggle in the virtual geopolitical space is more disparate and asymmetric, and like outer space, it is not entirely subject to the direct constraints of traditional sovereignty and international law. As such, there is a need to re-examine and attach greater importance to the strategic value of China's digital cultural industry.The third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China called for promoting Chinese discourse and narrative systems, so as to better tell China's story. In fact, China has already been promoting high-level opening-up, including that of the cultural industry, exploring effective mechanisms for the integration of culture and technology, accelerating the development of new cultural formats, and helping create more high-quality works such as "Black Myth: Wukong".This means the future of China's digital industry is promising.The author is an associate researcher at the Central Academy of Culture and Tourism Administration.

"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."Kirimi was quoting from The Art of War, the Chinese classic by strategist Sun Tzu, dating to the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC).The ancient book, which has influenced people all around the world, continues to inspire reflection among young Kenyans.The Sun Tzu Book House, which opened recently at the university's Confucius Institute, features various iterations of the author's work, including some printed on silk, others on wood or scrolls, and is the first Sun Tzu Book House opened abroad by authorities from East China's Shandong province.Kirimi says that The Art of War opens the minds of young Kenyans to overcoming problems and planning for a better future, adding that it enables them to experience Chinese culture and learning."It is not a book that advocates strength, yet it focuses on strategic wisdom and philosophy that I find useful in life and work," he says."The most important lesson I learned from it is that in every situation, you have to be courageous and strong, and then think it through to complete everything and achieve success."In 2023, Kirimi spent six months studying Chinese at Shandong Normal University, and fell in love with the country's culture, which prompted him to seek a better understanding of Chinese civilization and promote exchange between Kenya and China.On the video games circuit, an arena dominated by Western legends, one can say the Chinese legends have arrived. On Tuesday, the day of its official release, 1.6 million global players were playing together online the newly developed game Black Myth: Wukong on the Steam platform. It had more takers than Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, and Elden Ring, all popular worldwide.Black Myth: Wukong has showcased to the world not only the creativity of Chinese developers, but also the lure of Chinese culture.Before it, there is Dota 2 and its predecessor Dota, which, too, are based on a fictional magical world and listed the Monkey King among its heroes years ago, but most of its other heroes, such as Goblin Alchemist, Paladin Omniknight and Naga Siren can be traced to ancient European tales. Elden Ring's characters are mostly Western in style.Even old favorites such as Red Alert 2 or WarCraft III or SuperMario have a Western cultural background. All of which made some joke that all legendary heroes have one thing in common, they speak fluent English.The monopoly ended some years ago with the advent of Honor of Kings, in which most heroes are drawn from Chinese history or legend. Now Black Myth: Wukong has gone a step further by telling the story of a traditional Chinese legend in the form of a video game, the popularity of which will open the eyes of global audiences to the rich storehouse of Chinese legends.The success of the game owes a lot to the selection of Wukong – the monkey king hero from classic Chinese novel Journey to the West – as the game's hero. The appeal of traditional culture and the application of modern video techniques is working wonders.It will not be so easy to create such a miraculous cultural work again, partly due to the amount of time needed, as also the requirement of funds and human resources. But the investment has received good returns as by Tuesday evening over 3 million copies had already been sold on video game digital distribution service Steam. Another 1.5 million copies were sold on WeGame, Epic! and PlayStation services, with the total sales having exceeded 1.5 billion yuan ($210.3 million).At a time when developers are in a haste to make quick bucks, it's precious to note that some have tapped Chinese masterpieces. As there is no dearth of Chinese legends to tap from, they can also expect good returns in the long run.— ZHANG ZHOUXIANG, CHINA DAILYA highly anticipated video game based on ancient Chinese literature classic was released worldwide on Tuesday, thrilling gamers around the world.The game, Black Myth: Wukong, an action role-playing game developed by Shenzhen-headquartered Game Science, was inspired by the rich tapestry of Chinese mythology and the 16th-century seminal novel Journey to the West, one of the four great classic novels of Chinese literature. It is infused with traditional Chinese cultural elements, offering gamers a novel experience of Chinese imagination and landscape.In the game, players step into the shoes of the iconic Sun Wukong, also known as the Monkey King, who is likewise the leading hero in the novel, as they navigate his epic adventures westward.Available on PS5, Steam, Epic Games Store and WeGame, Black Myth: Wukong is already a top seller on multiple platforms, including Steam and WeGame, marking a new milestone for Chinese Triple-A games — those with high budgets and profiles produced and distributed by large, well-known publishers.Development of the game, which is being hailed as China's first Triple-A masterpiece, started in 2018 and completed after six-and-a-half years of challenges.By July, presales had surpassed 400 million yuan ($56 million), and the physical Collector's Editions are currently sold out. In addition, Game Science's final prelaunch trailer on YouTube quickly hit 1 million views, highlighting the wide anticipation of the game's release, especially amid a 24-hour countdown.As of 10 pm on Tuesday, Black Myth: Wukong had more than 1.5 million concurrent players on the platform Steam, surpassing Counter-Strike 2 to top the Steam trending games chart.IGN China, a branch of IGN, one of the leading media companies covering video games, movies, TV shows, entertainment news, reviews and guides, rated the game with its highest score, 10 points.More than 50 gamers on Metacritic, an international review aggregation website, gave the game a Metascore of 82 points out of 100.One Metacritic commenter called GamesRD, who gave the game a score of 100 points, said, "With breathtaking concept art, stunning graphics and sceneries, wonderful score, and one of the most fulfilling playabilities we've seen in role-playing games, Black Myth: Wukong is unquestionably a Game of the Year candidate, promising a bright future for the genre's fans."Zhinengluzhang, who has nearly 4.6 million followers on Chinese livestreaming platform Bilibili, said in a post that he gave the game 94 points out of 100 and expected its Metascore to rise soon.What particularly impressed Chinese as well as foreign players is the design of the game scenes and characters.Black Myth: Wukong crafts a stunning dreamscape with Chinese scenery, featuring desolate mountains, ancient roads, pavilions among mountains and water, deserts and ancient temples. This vision draws inspiration from the 1986 TV series Journey to the West as well as film director Stephen Chow's adaptation, A Chinese Odyssey.The game's production team traveled across China and meticulously scanned ancient buildings and relics. It incorporated the creations and historical relics into every scene of the game.For instance, in the trailer, the battle between Wukong and the dragon Kang Jinlong features a distant view of an ancient temple modeled after Dule Temple in Tianjin. The temple is one of the country's few remaining structures from the Liao Dynasty (916-1125).The various minor demons, demon kings, gods and Buddhas that appear in the game all feature Chinese aesthetics, forming a contemporary illustrated compendium of creatures from The Classic of Mountains and Seas, a major source of Chinese mythology.Additionally, the game features traditional Chinese instruments such as the guzheng, bowls, wooden clappers and gongs. Much of the music is composed using Chinese-style chord structures.As the game combines ancient dialogue and a worldview that blends Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism, players are immersed in an environment in which simply strolling leisurely or sitting alone by a cold river offers its own unique pleasure.Feng Ji, Game Science founder and CEO, said in a recent interview with Xinhua News Agency that "the script and artistic concepts always take the lead, seamlessly incorporating Chinese stories and classical cultural elements into the game".He said that a game's true value isn't defined by its budget or visuals, but by the genuine enjoyment it offers players.Feng emphasized that the game was crafted entirely by a Chinese team, with the aim of bringing Chinese narratives to the global gaming stage.When choosing to develop a game based on mythology, the developers do not consider whether a theme is "popular or outdated", Feng said, but reflect instead on whether the subject excites them."Traditional Eastern myths, infused with magical elements, aren't sufficient," he said.Feng added that his team aimed to go beyond the myths and also learned from other excellent games."The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring video game involves a team completing a daunting task, similar to Journey to the West," Feng said. "Although the narrative structures and worldviews differ, the core essence is comparable."Citing the growth of other Chinese industries in the international market, including the film industry, Feng said, "Eight years ago, we were confident that the stand-alone game market in China would not only exist but would also become significant." Stand-alone games are those that are not dependent on being online in order to play."Back in 2016, the stand-alone game market in the United States was about $10 billion; Japan's was $5 billion; and China's was less than $1 billion," he said. "We believe that within 10 to 15 years, China's stand-alone game market share will reach or even exceed that of Japan."The highest-ranked AAA titles on Metacritic are still from Western and Japanese companies, such as FromSoftware's Elden Ring and Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, both of which have been given a score of 96, compared with the current 82 for Black Myth: Wukong.The game won the Best Visuals Award at Gamescom 2023, the world's largest annual trade fair for video games, which was held in Germany.ABIDJAN — "One, two, three, four", a young man in a Shaolin Temple training jersey commanded, as he demonstrated movements and postures to students in a gymnasium at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny University in Abidjan, the economic capital of Cote d'Ivoire."I'm a member of our university's Chinese martial arts club, where students of all grades can train. We have three sessions a week, and about 50 students come to learn kung fu and Chinese culture," says Jean Philippe N'Dri, who is responsible for instruction at the club.Like many young Africans, his interest in martial arts and Chinese culture began with martial arts movies."My love was born of watching great actors like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan," he says, adding that they taught him to appreciate martial arts.As children, he and his friends would imitate characters from the martial arts movies they watched, but it wasn't easy to master the movements.In 2014, he enrolled at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny University. During his second year, he joined the martial arts club out of an interest in kung fu.With the assistance of the Confucius Institute at the university and the support of the club, he was given the opportunity to visit the Shaolin Temple in China's Henan province."It was a beautiful discovery and a great dream come true," he says.On the way to China, he and his companions were curious how the Shaolin Temple would look, and wondered what they would see when they arrived."We saw people dressed the way they had been in the movies. They were wearing Shaolin attire and practicing techniques properly," he says of his first impression of the temple.The group underwent three weeks of training, but the first two weeks were really challenging."It was so tough that we wanted to go back home. We understood then why Shaolin monks have such a reputation," he says. "It wasn't just physical training, but also mental fortification that we received."With his kung fu dream coming true, N'Dri was keen to pass on what he had learned to people at home."We have set up the Shaolin Training Camp, which is the first of its kind in Africa. It allows us to give the same training we received at the temple to young people who are not able to go to China, but who share the same dream," he says."We organize several competitions in which all of our students, some of whom are preparing for the Shaolin championship in China, participate. The competitions allow them to gauge themselves nationally."He says that martial arts have become the backbone of his life."Before, I used to love to fight, but I never won," he says. "When I began practicing martial arts, my initial idea was to learn techniques to protect myself from people who wanted to hurt me."But during the nine years he has been practicing martial arts, he has found the opposite to be true."As other people will tell you, I have become wiser. I can channel my anger, and have developed a spirit of sharing with my brothers," he says.He adds that he hopes China will offer more support and opportunities to his compatriots, so that they can promote martial arts at home after returning from their studies."We are ambassadors of Chinese culture and also of African culture. We have these two advantages to enable Africans to get what Chinese and African culture are meant to offer," he says.N'Dri is keen to convey to martial arts enthusiasts that practicing martial arts is an inner journey."You will develop extraordinary discipline. You will cultivate long-lasting health. You will also achieve peace of heart, which is the most essential," he says.The launch ceremony of Chinese Tea Global Communication Program was held on Friday in Beijing, aimed at promoting Chinese tea culture and enhancing its global reach.Under the slogan of "Preserving and Promoting Tea Culture, Sharing and Learning for Global Good", the event was guided by the China International Communications Group and hosted by the Center for International Cultural Communication.The ceremony was attended by around 300 representatives from government entities, universities, cultural and agricultural associations, and corporations."It holds significance to use tea as a medium to implement the Global Civilization Initiative, advance Chinese tea and tea culture on the global stage, and promote cultural exchange and mutual learning," said Du Zhanyuan, president of China International Communications Group, in his speech.A Chinese tea communication proposal was released at the ceremony, that highlights the three aspects of establishing a collaborative platform to research and promote tea, creating premium cultural products centered on tea and promoting select tea brands.As a specific measure of the proposal, the Chinese Tea Culture Global Communication Foundation was launched. The ceremony was followed by two panel discussions, centered respectively on "Heritage and Innovation: Defining the Identity of Chinese Tea Culture" and "Brand First: Bringing Chinese Tea to the World".Chinese artist Liu Jingtao on Thursday kicked off his solo exhibition of 17 artworks on Chinese landscapes, Tibetan buddhist art, and fine-brush flower-and-bird paintings in New York City.Included are several thangka paintings bearing innovative characteristics, one of which was displayed in the Carrousel Hall of the Louvre in Paris, France, in 2023.Liu, an artist from Central China's Hubei province, said his thangka paintings were designed to entertain modern aesthetic interests with innovations on design, use of mineral pigments and intrinsic contents.The exhibition, staged at Murray Hill Art Museum in Flushing of Queens borough, New York, is expected to open through the end of August, according to the museum.Born in 1977, Liu has a doctorate in design art and a doctorate in literature.Over the years, Liu's creation of meticulous landscapes, meticulous flower-and-birds, large thangkas and heavy color freehand brushwork reflects his cognition, inheritance and innovation of Chinese traditional paintings, according to the exhibition.An exhibition showcasing a selection of Russian movies was recently held in three Chinese cities, drawing a large Chinese audience and raising their interest in delving deeper into Russia's history, culture and local customs.The event was held in Beijing, Nanjing in Jiangsu province, and Shenzhen in Guangdong province between Aug 5 and 11.The lineup consisted of seven movies, all released in recent years. Among them were the children's movie Where the White Cranes Dance, the sci-fi tale Guest from the Future, the animated feature My Sweet Monster and Off the Rails.Where the White Cranes Dance, a touching tale about an 8-year-old boy coping with his mother's death through imagination, was the opening film of the exhibition.A netizen on the popular review site Douban commented: "The movie depicts the beautiful villages of Siberia — dense forests, colorful wooden houses, fields filled with various wildflowers, cows and sheep grazing on the grasslands in the morning, and children playing in the twilight, as if creating a fairy-tale world."As this year marks the 75th anniversary of China-Russia diplomatic ties, the exhibition aims to promote cultural exchanges and cooperation between the two countries, according to the organizers.Book and painting lovers in New Zealand indulged themselves in over 2,000 books from China at a book exhibition in Waipa district on Saturday.The book exhibition, which coincides with the Panda Meets Kiwi Youth International Art Exhibition, also included 235 paintings drawn by children from both countries. Both exhibitions were organized by China International Book Trading Corporation (CIBTC), New Zealand Culture and Arts Foundation and Prime Media Group of New Zealand.Chen Shijie, Chinese consul-general in Auckland, noted reading is one of the most important ways that Chinese people realize equal dialogue, mutual learning and common development with other countries, including New Zealand."China's relations with the world changed dramatically. The world needs to understand China better, and China also needs to introduce itself to the world better. China's publishing industry has made remarkable achievements in its globalization, supporting China to expand its influence in major book fairs and increase the popularity of Chinese publishing enterprises," he added.Yang Lufeng, vice president of CIBTC, said that CIBTC is a pioneer and main force in the promotion of Chinese culture going global, committing to building a bridge of cultural exchange and friendship between China and other countries, constantly leading Chinese publishing units to go global, and continuously building a platform for Chinese culture to go global. He hoped both exhibitions would further promote cultural exchanges and integration between China and New Zealand, allowing more and more New Zealand readers to understand a real China.Deputy Mayor of Waipa District Council, Liz Stolwyk noted that this is the third time that Waipa people have met both exhibitions. They have become an important window for the local area to understand China, and an important link connecting local Chinese and other ethnic groups. "They bring two nations' people together in such an inspiring way."Local citizen James visited the exhibitions together with his daughter. He said that New Zealanders are eager to learn about China, the country's largest trading partner. "Books and paintings are the best ways to know a country and its culture."The books will be donated to local libraries and schools.BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN — The 2nd Brunei-China Art and Visual Culture Festival opened in Brunei on Saturday, highlighting the longstanding friendship and history of cultural exchanges between the two countries.The festival, featuring traditional martial arts, opera, calligraphy, exhibitions, lectures and more, attracted over 200 guests, including artists, scholars, officials and diplomats."China and Brunei are close neighbors across the sea, enjoying a long history of cultural exchanges and friendship," Chinese Ambassador to Brunei Xiao Jianguo says."Historical records indicate that the people-to-people contact between our two countries dates back to more than 1,000 years."The festival was jointly organized by the Chinese embassy in Brunei, the foreign office of the Nanjing municipal government in Jiangsu province, and the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports of Brunei.Brunei is located in the northern part of Borneo island in Southeast Asia. A Polish woman who was afraid of needles since childhood has now studied acupuncture at the London Academy of Chinese Acupuncture for three years.

I believe this modern and simple-styled opera production will find wide resonance in Shanghai," Zhang said at the new conference for the show on Monday.Madama Butterfly is very popular with Chinese opera audiences. A number of Chinese vocal artists have achieved international success singing the leading character Cio-Cio-San, such as He Hui, Huang Ying and Zhang Liping.Nearly 90 percent of tickets for the upcoming performances at Shanghai Grand Theatre were sold off a week before the premiere, she says.The Lebanese-Chinese student cultural exchange food fest took place at Sumac Restaurant in Beijing on Monday, offering Chinese students an immersive experience of Lebanese cuisine and an opportunity to learn more about Lebanon and its cultural traditions.During the event, Chinese students presented well-prepared gifts to the Lebanese embassy, including Chinese calligraphy, paintings, handmade crafts and toys. They also performed poetry recitals and sang Chinese folk songs, such as Jasmine Flower.Co-hosted by the Embassy of Lebanon in China and Sumac Restaurant, the food fest aims to foster cultural and people-to-people exchanges between Chinese and Lebanese communities, further strengthening the bonds of friendship between the two nations."This food fest is not just about sharing our cuisine; it is about building bridges of cultural understanding and friendship. We are delighted to invite the vibrant Chinese community to experience the warmth and hospitality of Lebanon", said Mansour Chaya, deputy chief of mission at the Lebanese embassy in China.Lebanon is renowned for its vibrant lifestyle, a perfect blend of rich history, warm hospitality and a love for good food and social gatherings.This dynamic culture is reflected at Sumac Restaurant. Nestled by the elegant and cozy ambiance of the famous Liangma River, the restaurant's dishes, made with fresh ingredients, showcase the diverse flavors of Lebanon, from the aromatic spices to the succulent meats and fresh produce.Rani Jarkas, an investor of Sumac Restaurant, noted that Sumac is one of the few authentic Lebanese restaurants not only in Beijing, but probably in all of Asia. He hopes that the restaurant will contribute to the cultural exchange between the two nations.In the vibrant attire of traditional Sichuan Opera, a dancer gracefully wields a fan, his movements synchronized with rhythmic melodies. With a flick of the fan, his masks, with their intricate designs, swiftly transform to captivate onlookers.The festive ambience is set in a bustling Haidilao hotpot restaurant in Dallas, Texas, in the United States, where 25-year-old Indonesian entertainer Indra Kriswana Putra commands the spotlight.While not a traditional performer, Putra's recent invitation to a cultural event in May at a local school by a loyal patron of the restaurant left the audiences spellbound. As his fan flicked and masks swiftly changed, the room erupted in applause and cheers from the teachers and students.Unbeknown to him five years ago when he first joined the restaurant chain, Putra has become an unexpected ambassador for Sichuan Opera's mesmerizing face-changing art in the heart of the US.His Douyin videos, showcasing this ancient tradition, have garnered over 2.2 million likes. His profile proudly declares him as "an Indonesian youth passionate about Sichuan Opera face-changing, an intangible cultural heritage".At Haidilao, many of the restaurant's face-changing performers were first introduced to this opera art through their work. This unique performance service began around 2013 as part of a business innovation, merging the Sichuan face-changing art with hotpot dining experiences. Since then, face-changing has become a hallmark of Haidilao's entertainment offerings.This captivating tradition has also found its way into some of Haidilao's international locations where employees are attracted to learn and showcase the art.With Haidilao's expanding overseas footprints — 119 branches in 13 countries and regions, face-changing art is not only delighting Chinese patrons yearning for a taste of home but also introducing this cherished tradition to audiences worldwide.Putra's journey began shortly after he joined Haidilao's Indonesian branch in December 2019. Initially introduced to the art through training arranged by his manager, his learning was abruptly interrupted less than a month later by the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing him to turn to online resources like YouTube and TikTok for self-study.Recalling those pivotal moments, Putra expresses how watching countless online videos of face-changing performances, each synchronized with music, captivated him with its intricate techniques."I was not interested in studying, but after I had the opportunity to learn it, I fell in love with this art," he says. "The thing I like most is not only the way of face-changing but also the dance."After dedicated practice, Putra clinched the title of Indonesia's face-changing champion in Haidilao's 2023 overseas star competition.His performance at the finals caught the eye of Wang Ke, a veteran face-changing artist from Haidilao's Singaporean branch. "He executed the plans flawlessly, sometimes even better than us," Wang says.Although Putra didn't secure a podium spot in the finals, his performance earned praise from Haidilao's US regional manager. Early this year, he successfully applied to become a face-changing performer at Haidilao's US locations through an internal recruitment drive.Upon arriving at Haidilao's US store, Putra quickly caught the attention of local diners.Putra observed significant differences in performing face-changing between the US and Indonesia due to cultural nuances. US audiences, less accustomed to such performances, respond enthusiastically, offering praise and encouragement during the shows, he says.Currently, Putra performs face-changing two to three times daily as part of his job. Beyond this, he has also embarked on mastering noodle-pulling, another traditional Chinese folk skill.Despite not having visited China yet, Putra says he has several friends there whom he often chats with online. He eagerly anticipates the opportunity to travel to China and meet his Chinese friends.liyingxue@chinadaily.com.cnThe latest episode of the fourth season of the TV show, National Treasure, which aired recently, featured celebrities such as actresses Xu Fan and Ma Sichun, as well as actor Li Hongyi, visiting Jilin Provincial Museum to narrate the stories behind the artifacts in its collection.Produced by China Media Group, the fourth season has showcased 27 national treasures from cultural institutions like the Palace Museum, Tianjin Museum, Anhui Museum, Fujian Museum, and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in Hong Kong to its viewers.It provides viewers with insights into the stories behind the artifacts, offering a multidimensional view of the wisdom and power rooted in Chinese civilization and showcasing how the outstanding traditional Chinese culture is being passed down in the modern era.Additionally, it explores how these artifacts serve as emotional bridges connecting people from different cultures.This season highlights foreign individuals from countries such as France, Spain and Turkiye who have chosen to reside in Jingdezhen, the porcelain capital of China in Jiangxi province, to learn the ancient art of porcelain making.For example, Jaume Ribalta, who has been involved in ceramic art in Spain for years, discovered that many porcelain-making techniques originated in Jingdezhen. Since 2019, he has been coming to Jingdezhen every summer to learn the craft and later decided to move there, opening his own workshop."Jingdezhen is a paradise for all ceramic enthusiasts," he said.The show aims to showcase the inclusive nature of Chinese civilization and has established a cultural bridge connecting domestic and international audiences.It has also sparked a trend of people visiting museums during the summer.

Known for his vibrant and epic style, his poetry is deeply rooted in social and political commitment, drawing inspiration from 19th-century European avant-garde movements and 20th-century German expressionism. His works are marked by passion and profound critical insight, prompting reflection on human conditions, social justice, and Latin American identity.Approximately 60 years ago, Pablo de Rokha visited China at the official invitation of the Chinese government and lived in Beijing. The decision to erect a bust in his honor commemorates not only his literary achievements but also his significant role in fostering cultural ties between China and Chile.The Chilean ambassador to China Mauricio Hurtado attended the event, expressing gratitude to renowned sculptor Yuan Xikun for creating the bust. The ambassador announced that the Chilean Embassy's library would undergo renovation and the original bust would be placed there. Consequently, the library will be renamed the "Pablo de Rokha Library," dedicated to promoting cultural connections between China and Chile.THE HAGUE — A Wing Chun kung fu master class held recently attracted more than a dozen martial arts enthusiasts. Some of them have developed a passion for this form of Chinese kung fu decades ago.Erik Batstra, head instructor at the Wing-Chun Kung-Fu Association of the Netherlands, also attended the master class. On the sidelines of the event, he says that he began practicing Wing Chun when he was 18."When I came in contact with Wing Chun, it became my life's passion," Batstra says. Since 1981, the Dutch martial artist has dedicated himself to the study of Wing Chun, a martial art characterized by close-quarters hand-to-hand combat, rapid-fire punches and efficiency.The Dutch association, founded in 1974, primarily studies the Wong Shun-Leung lineage of Wing Chun, which favors efficiency and directness. Wing Chun is on the list of China's national intangible cultural heritage.Attendees of the recent master class came to learn from Zheng Zujie, a Chinese Grand Master of Wing Chun. Zheng delved into the history and techniques of Wing Chun and elaborated on the Chinese philosophical and cultural principles underpinning the martial art. Participants had the opportunity to practice its techniques under his guidance.Zheng noted the genuine passion for Wing Chun among the Dutch practitioners. He says that his visit to the Netherlands aimed to foster close interactions with local Wing Chun practitioners."They come from a wide range of ages, with some well into their 60s and 70s, yet all show remarkable dedication to practicing Wing Chun regardless of their age," he says.The veteran martial artist also expresses hope for further exchanges to connect people and jointly promote Wing Chun, emphasizing its benefits for health, happiness and personal development.Expressing his enthusiasm for the Wing Chun master class, Batstra says he is looking forward to going to China for further exchanges.Sebastiaan Kas, a 51-year-old dedicated Wing Chun practitioner, says he has been immersed in the art form since 2006. His journey into Wing Chun was inspired by his childhood fascination with martial arts films of the 80s and 90s, featuring icons like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan."Watching those films, I always said, 'that's what I want to do'," he says.Kas says it has profoundly changed his life. "Wing Chun has become a part of my life that gives me mental and physical strength."The Dutch martial artist says the experience of practicing Wing Chun went beyond the physical movements.The respect for each other and the close community is an important aspect of this art for Wing Chun practitioners, who share knowledge and practice the art through various movements, he says."You have people who train harder and work longer hours. Then boundaries are pushed and you actually experience what the human body is capable of," Kas says. This intense dedication, he believes, fuels the passion and love for Wing Chun.During the master class, Kas shared a personal dream. "For me, being able to go to the South Shaolin Temple in Fujian, China, the birthplace of Wing Chun, is like a dream for me. I'm really looking forward to going."Xinhua In a celebration of musical talent, cultural exchange and educational enrichment, a Chinese symphony orchestra has been launched and is set to embark on a transformative journey to the United States.The Beijing Youth Orchestra, under the baton of conductor Lyu Jia, will perform at the famed Carnegie Hall in New York on Aug 4.On Friday and Saturday, they staged two concerts at Beijing's National Centre for the Performing Arts and the Beijing Performing Arts Centre, warming up for the US performance.The upcoming concert will be part of the new summer concert festival — World Orchestra Week, which was launched by Carnegie Hall. In celebration of international youth orchestras, "the initiative brings five youth orchestras from Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America to New York City for high-level music making with some of today's most internationally renowned artists plus cultural exchange activities among the orchestras over the course of one week", the hall's official website states.The seminal publication of The Art of War by Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu has provided inspiration to Kenyan youth, keen to confront present challenges and chart a brighter future.Students from the Confucius Institute at Kenyatta University, Kenya's second-oldest university, say that after reading Sun Tzu's works, they feel a sense of urgency to be optimistic, courageous and agile in the face of challenges.Kenyatta University recently set up a Study House of Sun Tzu, where his influential works are on display and available for reading by local students and their tutors.Eddy Paul Kirimi, a 20-year-old Chinese language student at the university's Confucius Institute, says he learned about the publication of The Art of War while doing online research, triggering his curiosity."The book itself talks about the art of war. I think it helps a lot in life and also in jobs. The most outstanding lesson I have learned from the book is that in any situation, you have to be courageous and strong," Kirimi says.He adds that upon reading the book, he learned about the virtues of determination, perseverance, focus and strategic calculation to achieve success in life.Kirimi says that Sun Tzu's works have provided a window through which local youth observe and appreciate Chinese culture, philosophy and wisdom.During the discussion about Sun Tzu's seminal works with fellow youth, Kirimi says there is a consensus that life is full of challenges, but armed with wisdom and courage, one can always find a solution.In 2023, Kirimi enrolled at Shandong Normal University in Jinan, Shandong province, for a six-month Chinese language course, exposing him to the country's rich culture.Kirimi admires some aspects of Chinese culture, such as the use of chopsticks and the diverse array of traditional costumes. He envisions a future where cross-cultural exchanges flourish between Kenya and China."Creating this connection between the two countries will help us because many Chinese are opening their companies in Kenya and they need translators," he says.Sun Tzu was a notable military theorist and strategist during the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC). His seminal work, The Art of War, holds significant sway over both Western and Eastern philosophies and military doctrines.With a Study House of Sun Tzu in place at Kenyatta University, local youth including Phyllis Wahura Maina have vowed to deepen their understanding of Sun Tzu and apply his enduring wisdom in real life.As a Chinese language student at the university's Confucius Institute, Maina says that since she started reading Sun Tzu's book, it has influenced her to think positively, strategize in a more targeted manner, and appreciate Chinese culture.According to Maina, the book has also taught her the value of thinking ahead, confronting life's challenges head on even as she has encouraged fellow Kenyans to use it as a guiding light while pursuing their life goals.The 24-year-old, who has benefited from a one-year study tour in China, says she looked forward to robust Sino-Kenya cooperation in the realm of economy and culture.Shanxi province will improve its cultural and tourism industry by leveraging its rich resources and promoting cooperation at a major tourism event that kicked off on Friday.Guests including representatives of foreign embassies in China, international tourism organizations and institutions, and foreign cultural and tourism enterprises came to the ancient county of Taiyuan in Shanxi province to participate in the launch ceremony of the 2024 Shanxi Tourism Development Conference.The event will last until Sunday.A comprehensive cultural and tourism work meeting of the province was convened on Friday morning."In addition, a series of supportive activities will be held, including international renowned IP enterprises and international travel agency visits to Shanxi, as well as an international tourism industry matchmaking meeting," said Wang Aiqin, director of Shanxi's department of culture and tourism."One innovative highlight of the conference is a series of supply and demand matchmaking activities for market entities," she said.The Shanxi Tourism Development Conference has been held since 2015 and has become an important platform for enhancing Shanxi's image, promoting the high-quality development of the cultural and tourism industry, and expanding international exchanges and cooperation."Shanxi is renowned worldwide for three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Yungang Grottoes, Mount Wutai and the Ancient City of Pingyao," said Zhang Zhiren, deputy director of the department."Shanxi boasts 531 nationally protected cultural relics, ranking first across the country, and is called the Chinese Ancient Architectural Art Museum."As of the end of last year, the total number of A-level tourist attractions in the province reached 390, including 10 5A-level attractions.As co-organizer of this event, Li Yongqiang, deputy mayor of Taiyuan, highly recommended the city, which has a history of civilization dating back 5,000 years."We have prepared a luxury package for tourism investors, setting up a special fund of 1.3 billion yuan ($179 million), with project investments eligible for rewards of up to 50 million yuan," he said.For travel agencies, those that attract visitors will be rewarded based on the number of tourists and those ranking top will be eligible for a one-time reward of up to 1 million yuan.At the meeting, Thorir Ibsen, Iceland's ambassador to China, expressed his wish that direct flights between Iceland and China will be available in the next few years."This is my third time to Taiyuan. The Shanxi Museum is very exquisite and very beautiful," he said."The Xuankong Temple and the Yungang grottoes are also very impressive."In a celebration of musical talent, cultural exchange and educational enrichment, a Chinese symphony orchestra has been launched and is set to embark on a transformative journey to the United States.The Beijing Youth Orchestra, under the baton of conductor Lyu Jia, will perform at the famed Carnegie Hall in New York on Aug 4.Major cooperation projects between China and Egypt focusing on the digital scanning, photography, sorting and research of some 1,000 humanoid wooden coffins unearthed in Saqqara, Egypt, have been underway since May, according to the Shanghai International Studies University.The university made its announcement about the China-Egypt Joint Investigation, Research and Digitalization Project on Ancient Egyptian Antiquities, on June 24.All the coffins have been unearthed by the archaeological team of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt at the Bubasteion Site in northern Saqqara, which is home to some of the oldest pyramids in Egypt, since 2018.The project was carried out by the university's World Arthistory Institute, the Saqqara Archaeological Team and other teams from Egypt, and was led by Xue Jiang, an assistant researcher at the institute. The final research results will be released simultaneously in Chinese, Arabic and English.This was "the first time China carried out such a large-scale basic cultural project outside the country", according to the university, as it will provide valuable experience and serve as an example for the implementation of follow-up projects. These include the upcoming Database on Ancient Greek-Gandharan Images, Literature, and Archaeological Artifacts, which is affiliated to the university's World Civilizations Research Database.The project is the latest example of the increasingly strong partnership between China and Egypt. Strengthening people-to-people exchanges and deepening friendship between the two countries are essential to promoting common development and prosperity, according to the scholars.Mutual learning between China and Egypt has also entered a new paradigm, one no longer limited to single archaeological projects, but which will establish the comprehensive collation and research of Egyptian civilization, and make use of technologies, such as databases and artificial intelligence, to carry out systematic, long-term research, according to experts.On a visit to the Shanghai university in May, Mohamed Ismail Khaled, PhD, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, expressed his full support. He said he believed the project was innovative in terms of the mechanism of mutual learning and exchange between China and Egypt as ancient civilizations.Li Yansong, president of the Shanghai International Studies University, says that he expects the project to enhance the school's studies of countries and regions, provide fresh support for China-Arab cooperation under the Global Civilization Initiative, and boost mutual learning and exchange with all parties in Egypt.Zhu Qingsheng, the initiator of the project, says that in the era of digital technology, it is necessary for artifacts to be more comprehensively analyzed through technical means and made known to the public."This marked an important beginning for the continuation of the cultural traditions of China and Egypt, for conducting dialogue among civilizations on an equal footing, and for carrying out international cultural cooperation in a new form," says Zhu, who is also director of the World Arthistory Institute and a professor of history at Peking University."For a Chinese university to enter an Egyptian archaeological site with new image theory, database concepts and micro-trace scanning to collect and sort finds is a new academic strategy," he says.Yan Haiying, who is in charge of the project's academic affairs, says that it was an unprecedented experience for Chinese researchers majoring in Egyptology to participate in sorting out unpublished firsthand information."The digital collection, sorting, research and interpretation of important artifacts signifies that Egyptology in China stands at the forefront of the world. The discovery and research of these new finds will change some theories and research in Egyptology itself," says Yan, a professor of history at Peking University, and a distinguished professor at the institute.The project, which was based on the joint efforts of five researchers from China and six from Egypt, is expected to score several firsts for Chinese scholars involved to Egyptology, Xue says.For example, Chinese scholars will jointly publish research results and present artifacts digitally with their Egyptian counterparts. The projects also marks the first time an ancient civilization from outside of the country has been invited to participate in the World Civilizations Research Database, he says.zhouwenting@chinadaily.com.cn Ancient artifacts depicting the fascinating age of the pharaohs attract thousands, as tickets quickly sell out, reports Zhang Kun in Shanghai.Despite the scorching heat of 37 C, visitors formed long lines in front of Shanghai Museum on July 19, eager to catch the first glimpse of the much-anticipated exhibition, On Top of the Pyramid: The Civilization of Ancient Egypt, which opened to the public that day.In the coming 13 months, the largest showcase of ancient Egyptian artifacts in Asia will be held at the museum on People's Square in downtown Shanghai, featuring 788 objects selected from seven institutions around Egypt.

He actively participated in the renovation of Minyuan Stadium, the country's first sports arena, leaving an enduring mark on the advancement of sports in the municipality.During the challenging period of the Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45), Liddell stood firmly with China, offering his utmost assistance to those in dire circumstances. In 1945, at the age of 43, he died from a brain tumor in a Japanese concentration camp in Weixian county of Weifang, Shandong province.Liddell's story of Olympic glory was immortalized in the 1981 film Chariots of Fire, a globally acclaimed Oscar-winning blockbuster."The spirit of Liddell continues to shine brightly today." said Xue Hui, director of the Tianjin Sports Bureau. "The establishment of the permanent exhibition at the Tianjin Sports Museum aims to preserve his legacy forever."Although Liddell's daughter, Patricia Liddell Russell, 88, could not attend the event because of frail health, she sent written remarks sharing memories of her father and expressing gratitude to the people of Tianjin.She wrote: "My father loved China and its people. Despite his remarkable success at the Paris Olympics in 1924, and immediately after his graduation from the University of Edinburgh, he returned to China. He taught science to Chinese students at the Tientsin Anglo Chinese College and coached them in athletics."Alongside many other foreigners, including over 200 children, he was interned at the Weixian Camp. There, he cared for those in need and was involved in teaching at a school organized within the camp. He taught the children science and even wrote a textbook from memory since none were available. He organized sports activities for the children to keep them happy and help them cope with their frustrations."My father cherished Tianjin deeply. He spent more time in Tianjin than in Scotland. His example of self-sacrifice and compassion continues to inspire and benefit many people to this day."Catriona Radcliffe, head of the Scottish Government Office in China, said, "His exceptional achievements were truly extraordinary, and his athletic prowess was matched by his approach to life, his dedication to helping others and his sense of community spirit. This is why his memory endures and resonates with so many people today. His values of compassion, integrity and passion, and how he embodied them in sports and in his life, continue to inspire."Xue, the sports bureau director, added: "The establishment of the permanent exhibition aims to inspire more individuals to strive for excellence, face challenges with courage, foster unity and friendship and illuminate the Tianjin sports industry with even greater brilliance in the spirit of 'Faster, Higher, Stronger, Together.'"Jake Capistrant absolutely crushed it.

A shared future starts from shared knowledge," says Oda, who is also the owner of the Medemer Africa Art and Sculpture Space, where the 64 paintings are housed.Oda says such an exhibition would strengthen people-to-people ties and cultural exchanges, emphasizing the importance of knowledge and civilizations for human development.The paintings depict the 64 divinatory symbols found in The Book of Changes, which represent the day-to-day interaction between man and nature."They are meant to share knowledge and feeling with visitors, and descriptions are written in Chinese, English, and Amharic," says Muluneh, who painted all 64 paintings in a year.He says the exhibition can be considered a stepping stone to promote cultural exchange and create mutual situations for common development between the peoples of China and Ethiopia."The backgrounds of the paintings make use of Ethiopian styles and express the ideas of heaven, contention, harvest, hindrance, and relief, among others," says Muluneh, who drew similarities and captured essence from the traditional arts of both countries.In an interview with Xinhua, Wu says that he was taken by surprise when he saw an Ethiopian artist painting Chinese characters."The paintings are meaningful in illustrating that China and Ethiopia both have ancient histories in traditional art," Wu says.The exhibition attracted members of the Chinese community in Addis Ababa, Ethiopian artists and painters, and school children. The weather in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, is very hot these days, but it can't dampen the enthusiasm of poets from around the world to experience Chinese culture and communicate with their Chinese peers through the medium of poetry.The First International Youth Poetry Festival: Special Session for BRICS Countries raised its curtain on Friday in Hangzhou, bringing together 49 poets from nine countries — Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Ethiopia, alongside 23 Chinese poets. Organized by the China Writers Association, it aims to foster friendships through poetry and use the art form to enhance cultural exchanges.During a six-day itinerary, the poets will explore scenic spots, visit museums and immerse themselves in ancient villages and towns in Hangzhou. They will also go to the Great Wall, tour the Forbidden City and delve deep into Chinese culture in Beijing next week. The festival includes presenting poetry manuscripts to museums, poetry readings, academic exchanges centered on poetry creation and communications with college students.After visiting the renowned West Lake in Hangzhou, Brazilian poet Luiza Romao was impressed by the beautiful landscape. She said the poetry festival allows poets from various cultural backgrounds to communicate, providing them another way to see the world and to write by learning from each other."When the world is full of uncertainties, such as wars and unexpected new technologies, with so many poets here, we can imagine more possibilities for the future," said Romao.Most of the foreign poets have never visited China before. Their knowledge about the nation was mainly gleaned from the internet. South African poet Gaireyah Fredericks said she never thought that one day she would stand in the land of China and share her poems. Her poetry focuses on people's daily lives and she loves to observe people."It's so beautiful, neat and clean. People here are very friendly. I really expect to explore Chinese culture and communicate with Chinese poets," she said.Hatim Al-Shehri from Saudi Arabia said that the city of Hangzhou is so amazing that it's "a heaven" where he would like to live out his final days. The city has long been described by poets as "heaven" in Chinese history, attracting numerous Chinese poets who praised its beauty in their works. Among them were two of China's greatest poets, Bai Juyi and Su Shi, both of whom lived in the city for years and created many well-known verses.Chinese poet Liang Xiaoming introduced these two great poets to his foreign counterparts. After touring a hall dedicated to Su Shi and Bai Juyi and listening to the verses and stories of these revered poets, attendees responded with enthusiastic applause.Liang said that poets are the conscience of the world, preserving the innocence of humanity. He found that the themes explored by poets taking part in the festival were quite similar, including topics like death, survival and the pursuit of happiness."Regardless of their race or nationality, the hearts of poets across the globe are the same, and the topics they care about are universal," said Liang.Matthew Jane, an English kung fu enthusiast, is one who has, after a chance encounter with Chinese kung fu, sparked a 20-year martial arts journey.Discover how his passion led him to the Shaolin Monastery, transformed his life, and how he brought ancient Chinese traditions back to his London community.Video: Han JingReporter: He XiatingPoets from Brazil, Russia, India and other BRICS member countries joined Chinese poets in Hangzhou for the “Poetic West Lake” visit.

Meanwhile, several legendary athletes emerged, among them Finland's Paavo Nurmi, who won an unprecedented five gold medals.For China, the biggest star of the 1924 Paris Olympics might be a British Olympic champion. Not for his world-record winning performance in the 400 meters, nor for the Oscar-winning film Chariots of Fire, which was adapted from his life story, but because he was born in, died in and dedicated his life to China.Eric Liddell is known in Chinese as Li Airui. His life story and achievements were on display at a memorial exhibition at the Tianjin Sports Museum in Tianjin municipality.Liddell, whose parents were from Scotland, was born in Tianjin in 1902.At the age of 5, he was sent back to the United Kingdom for an education. He showed sporting talent at a young age, always ranking near the top in school running competitions, and captaining its rugby and cricket teams.After he enrolled at the University of Edinburgh in 1920, his athletic talent became more prominent, winning many awards in national athletics competitions.Liddell was one of the strongest contenders for the gold medal in the 100 meters at the 1924 Paris Olympics. However, the advance copy of the Olympic schedule listed the 100m and 4x100m races as being held on a Sunday. As a committed Christian, he chose not to compete in these two races and signed up instead for the 200m and 400m races, which were not his favored events and for which he had only a few months to prepare.Despite this, he not only won the bronze medal for the 200m but broke the world record for the 400m with a time of 47.06 seconds, clinching the gold. Despite being at the peak of his sporting career, Liddell then made a surprising decision. After obtaining a degree in science, he returned to settle in Tianjin at the age of 23.Even today, many are puzzled by his choice. Zhao Yan, a staff member at the Tianjin Sports Museum, suggests that he returned for two reasons: first, to be nearer to his family who were in Tianjin, and second, his belief that his future would be more meaningful in China. As he once said, "From birth to death, everyone seems to be on the same track, but what each person does is different, hence the meaning of life is also different."In Tianjin, Liddell worked as a science and physical education teacher at the Anglo-Chinese Christian College. He also taught chemistry and math, trained athletes and spread the Olympic spirit. Under his tutelage, the school set up teams in soccer, basketball, baseball, table tennis, tennis and volleyball, becoming the most popular and highest-level middle school for sports in Tianjin.Liddell is also known as the "Father of the Minyuan", then the city's most famous stadium. When it was renovated in 1925, he referenced the Stamford Bridge stadium in London to make a series of suggestions on track structure, lighting equipment and grandstand levels.Welcome to Milele, a popular TV series following a Chinese medical team dispatched to work in Africa, began airing on Wednesday in Kenya and Tanzania in a Swahili-dubbed version.The series serves as a tribute commemorating several significant historical milestones, including the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative, the 60th anniversary since China first dispatched a medical team to a foreign country in the early 1960s, and the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Tanzania.In Kenya, the 35-episode drama starring Chinese A-list actor Jin Dong runs on Citizen TV from Wednesday to Friday each week and will also be streamed on Citizen TV's new media platform, Viusasa.Partly filmed in Tanzania, the series will also be broadcast on the African country's local TV channel, ST Swahili, starting from Monday and is set to re-air from Aug 22.

We value our relationship with China, especially with the Shanghai Museum," said Mohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities.The exhibition encompasses 492 sets of more than 780 selected artifacts from different periods of ancient Egyptian civilization, sourced from seven renowned Egyptian museums and including the latest archaeological discoveries. Remarkably, over 95 percent of these artifacts will be making their debut in Asia."The most meaningful aspect of this exhibition is that our team curated the theme and artifacts based on research by our Chinese scholars into ancient Egyptian civilization, and we selected all 788 objects featured ourselves," said Li Feng, deputy director of the Shanghai Museum.To provide a fitting showcase for this special exhibition, the Shanghai Museum has renovated and repurposed three exhibition halls to create a total exhibition space of 3,000 square meters. Through the display area, visitors will embark on a journey through three independent narratives: The Land of the Pharaohs, The Secrets of Saqqara, and The Age of Tutankhamun.Zhong Xiaomin, an official from the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Culture and Tourism, said the exhibition illustrates the continuous expansion of cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and Egypt, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership and the China-Egypt Partnership Year."We believe that this pioneering exhibition about ancient Egyptian civilization will vividly enact a dialogue across time between two ancient civilizations and will serve as an exemplary instance of exchanges and mutual learning among world civilizations," said Zhong.Li Junfeng contributed to this story.Organizers of the Guilin Festival traveled to France and launched a promotion conference on July 11, introducing the theater spectacular to audiences at the Festival d'Avignon, one of the biggest international theater events featuring contemporary live performance.The Guilin Festival was first launched in 2022 and is held annually in Guilin, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.During the promotion conference, which is part of programs marking the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France, cooperation between Festival d'Avignon and Guilin Festival was discussed.According to Harold David, president of the Off, one of the sections of Festival d'Avignon, he participated in the Guilin Festival and was overwhelmed by the diversity of programs.Liu Xinglin, artistic director of the Guilin Festival, introduced the highlights of the event, which is co-organized by the Central Academy of Drama. He also shared the deep connection between theater and the city, Guilin.Ouyang Yuqian, renowned Chinese playwright and director, who was the first president of the Central Academy of Drama, lived and worked in Guilin. In 1940, he initiated the Guangxi Provincial Art Center, one of the first professional theaters in China for staging plays, and worked as its first president.Jin Dong, a member of the festival's art committee, introduced the programs of 2024 Guilin Festival, which will take place from Oct 26 to Nov 3 and will feature three major sections: theater, music and art. Theater troupes from home and abroad will join the festival this year.Meanwhile, the Global Young Chinese Elites Project of Theater Director, one of the programs of the Guilin Festival, which supports young talent interested in theatrical productions, is having two productions staged during the Festival d'Avignon: Cold Blood and Mother Courage and Her Children.The Confucius-Aristotle Symposium 2024, co-organized by the Tsinghua Institute for Advanced Study in Humanities and Social Sciences, the Mencius Foundation, and the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UN SDSN), was held in Beijing on July 11-12.Themed "The Commons in Intellectual Traditions and Future Practice," the two-day event was attended by 101 scholars from 17 countries, including China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Greece, with 66 international participants.The forum aims to expand thinking on the concept of "community" and explore solutions to various contemporary global challenges, such as unequal development, changes in the international order, ecological and climate crises, and technological iterations through discussing how to draw upon the wisdom of ancient civilizations in the East and West.Qiu Yong, Party chief of Tsinghua University, Jeffrey Sachs, president of UN SDSN, and Meng Liang, chair of the Mencius Foundation, delivered keynote speeches at the opening ceremony.In his opening speech, Qiu remarked that the current changes in the world and this era are unfolding in unprecedented ways. To address the common challenges facing humanity, it is essential to harness the power of cultural dialogue to eliminate discrimination and prejudice, enhance understanding and trust, promote people-to-people connectivity, and strengthen unity and cooperation."The profound and enlightening thoughts of Confucius and Aristotle, as outstanding representatives of ancient Eastern and Western civilizations, transcend the course of history," Qiu said.Hailing the event as a cross-temporal dialogue of civilizations and an academic feast of cultural exchanges, Qiu said his university is willing to play an active role in promoting educational exchanges and contributing to the creation of a better future for humanity.Sachs noted the NATO-led military alliance is exacerbating global geopolitical tensions and escalating the risk of hegemony."But in my view, most of the world wants to find a way for peace, peaceful co-existence, and especially sustainable development that can bring us to safety on the planet with sustainable development entailing economic prosperity, social justice, and environmental sustainability," he said.Sachs argued that ancient Eastern and Western philosophical thoughts, especially the concept of "harmony in diversity" embodied in Confucianism, hold significant relevance in addressing present-day challenges. He also called for collaborative efforts to develop a shared understanding of what content in the ancient Eastern and Western philosophies should be taught to students in the 21st century.Meng emphasized that Mencius, as the inheritor and advocate of Confucian philosophy, put forward the concepts of "community" and "benevolent governance." He illustrated that Mencius exhorted feudal rulers to look beyond the narrow horizon of their palaces to cultivate a common bond with their ministers, clerks, and the masses and extend their ren, or benevolence, to the governed to preserve their wealth and power.Meng saw a strong similarity between Mencius' teachings and Aristotle's theories of "justice" and "virtue", both still holding great relevance to contemporary governments and political leaders.The well-received reality travel show Divas Hit the Road has introduced a spin-off series showcasing actress Zhao Zhaoyi as a tour guide for guests from Laos, Thailand and Indonesia.Zhao, a prominent member of the Chinese celebrity cast in Season Five of Divas Hit the Road, guided her international companions on a culturally enriching and memorable expedition.During the fifth season of the show, which concluded earlier this year, the group embarked on a 23-day journey spanning Saudi Arabia, Croatia, and Iceland.In the spin-off program, Zhao led her foreign companions on an exploration of Changsha, Hunan province.

We would like to see more collaboration in other spheres of the arts, such as fashion design, filmmaking and television productions," said Nyanhi in an interview on the sidelines of the first Harare Forum for Africa and Academic Week, which concluded in the Zimbabwe capital last week.He notes that the Chinese-funded Dreamstar program, Zimbabwe's largest talent search competition for young people, has been pivotal in uplifting Zimbabwean artists in various genres."We are excited about the cooperation between Zimbabwe and China, especially in the arts and cultural development," Nyanhi says. "Specifically the Dreamstar program, which has been running for over 10 years. We have witnessed almost 300 artists go from Zimbabwe to China to learn and bring the Chinese work ethic and performance culture back to Zimbabwe."The Dreamstar competition is organized by the China-Zimbabwe Exchange Center, an organization dedicated to promoting ties between China and Zimbabwe, with the support of the Chinese embassy, Chinese businesses and communities in Zimbabwe and the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe.Noting the importance of the arts sector to the economy, the Zimbabwean government is investing in the film industry to help filmmakers develop their skills, according to Nyanhi."We would also like to encourage and invite Chinese filmmakers to come to Zimbabwe and participate in this development," he says. "We would like Chinese producers to come and film their shows here and to use some Zimbabweans in their crews along with Chinese crews for culture and skills exchange."Nyanhi says that Chinese productions, such as the TV series, Journey to the West, have been influential in Zimbabwe, a sign of positive development for China-Zimbabwe cultural engagement."We would love for more of our Zimbabwean productions to be able to do the same thing, whether animations, children's programs, TV series or movies, so we can create more love between Zimbabweans and Chinese by intermingling our cultures and arts," he says. "That way we can do more work and business and host more friendship activities between the countries to better understand each other's cultures."More Chinese cultural products and arts have been marketed in Zimbabwe and we aim to export its arts and crafts to China as well, he says."We need to send more of our culture and arts outside of Zimbabwe to China to see what we do here. We have a rich national culture," Nyanhi says, adding that art is a significant contributor to bringing the two sides closer. A porcelain scroll of Lantingji Xu (Preface to the Collection of Poems of the Orchid Pavilion) is one of the highlights of the Exposition Reviving Craft exhibition in Paris.

Then an official of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, her father had received the painting as part of an art collection donated by a visiting Chinese delegation in the 1950s."The painting is almost like a flag, suggesting that my destiny is closely connected with China," says Sharipova, former deputy chairman of the Tajik Society for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.She and her family have maintained close bonds with China for four generations, from her father to her grandson.Sharipova notes that the gifts from the delegation were a testament to her father's interactions with China, and planted the seed in her heart to carry on his work promoting friendship with China."The special affection our family has for China and our closeness to Chinese history and culture were established by my father. From a young age, I was influenced by him, and my bond with China took root in childhood," she says.In 2003, she served as the chief editor of Friendship magazine, the quarterly publication of the Tajik Society for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.The magazine has extensively covered China and has published several special issues on the country.Between the 1990s and 2018, Sharipova visited China eight times and was able to see the country's rapid development."Every visit revealed new developments. The scale of construction and the architecture were astounding," she says. "Everywhere in China is developing in a visible manner."She also regularly participates in activities held at Dushanbe's Confucius Institute, sharing her experiences in China with students, and encouraging them to learn Chinese culture.Years of personal and professional interactions have also helped Sharipova develop close Chinese friends. "For me, the word 'China' holds immense significance," She says.Every generation of the family has maintained a strong connection with China. Sharipova's son frequently interacts with Chinese companies as part of his logistics job. Her grandson, Sulton Sultonov, engages in cultural exchange with Chinese colleagues in advertising. Her great-niece, Niso Nozirova, a university student majoring in Chinese, is passionate about Chinese culture and music."China has always been a close topic, inspiring a profound interest in our family. Preserving these precious memories and continuing the good deeds of our family are essential," Sultonov says.Sharipova's 14-year-old grandson, Amid Sharipov, is a tech enthusiast fascinated with artificial intelligence and new technology. Inspired by Chinese innovation, he dreams of studying at a Chinese university."China's progress amazes me, and many experts predict a new era of technology led by China," he says.Sharipova intends to enroll her grandson in the Confucius Institute at the Tajik National University to learn Chinese in September."My grandmother's cooperation with China and numerous visits have solidified my desire to pursue a career in China. Realizing this dream would bring immense joy to my family and honor my great-grandfather's legacy," says the 14-year-old. BARCELONA — The Chinese Library of Barcelona, located in Hospitalet de Llobregat, seeks to introduce the residents of the city to Chinese culture as part of a unique initiative in northeastern Spain.It was set up by Ma Xuefeng, who has lived in the city for the last six years, and who spent her retirement savings setting up the library, which offers a free lending service. It took her two years to build the library's collection, importing books directly from China, and it is the first Chinese-language library in Barcelona."After I moved to Spain, I noticed that there are few Chinese books here," Ma says. She expresses her hope that the library would provide an opportunity for Chinese children and local residents alike to explore and appreciate Chinese culture.Ma's inspiration to start the library stemmed from her admiration for the classic Spanish novel Don Quixote. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she compiled a Chinese translation in 64 notebooks over 443 days, which are now displayed in the library.Carlos Gonzalez, a Barcelona resident, expresses his fascination with Chinese culture. He says that there is limited exposure to Chinese culture locally, which is why he'd like to visit China and experience its culture and lifestyle firsthand.Leveraging his language skills in Chinese, Spanish and Catalan, 10-year-old Yixuan Wu volunteers at the library while enjoying access to his favorite books. "I became a volunteer here when they opened the library because I like Chinese books and we don't have many in Spain. I come here to read books in Chinese," he says.Ma is optimistic about the library's future, saying that with everyone's help, it will continue to improve. She made a point of highlighting the fact that the collection also includes Spanish literature translated into Chinese, which will allow Chinese readers to learn about Spain, and foster cultural exchange between China and Spain.There are approximately 4,000 residents of Chinese descent in Hospitalet de Llobregat, part of the 54,000-strong Chinese community in the Barcelona area. Ma hopes her library will serve as a gateway for them to connect to their cultural roots.HAIKOU — In Kuznetsova Aleksandra's studio in Haikou, the capital of Hainan, a tropical island province in South China, an oil painting of St. Basil's Cathedral hangs beside a portrait capturing the grace of a woman from the Li ethnic group, symbolizing two distinct aspects of the artist's life.Raised in a family of artists, the 24-year-old Russian woman developed a profound love for painting from an early age. Six years ago, she relocated to Hainan and set up her studio there.Her enchantment with Chinese culture ignited when she was just 10 years old."I didn't have Mandarin teachers," she fondly recalls."I picked up the language through the internet, books and TV. I simply adore Chinese culture."In 2018, driven by her passion, Aleksandra journeyed to Hainan to study, where she was captivated by the island's tranquil natural beauty and unhurried pace of life."It's an incredibly beautiful place, and the people are kind, charming and authentically simple," she reflects. "Life unfolds at a leisurely pace, allowing them to harmonize with nature."Living in Hainan enables her to immerse herself in nature and humanity, two beloved themes in her artwork. The local people and culture have become essential to her life as she and her husband, whom she met on the island, have ventured through its landscapes together."We ventured into the heart of Hainan. It was during these journeys that I first encountered the Li people," she recalls.The Li brocade has left a lasting impact on her. This traditional textile of the Li ethnic group in Hainan is revered as a "living fossil" of the textile industry, boasting a history of over 3,000 years."When you witness a woman weaving this brocade, she is narrating a tale passed down through generations, such as that of Dalishen, the God of Strength, watching over us. It not only inspires me but also empowers me to create," she says.She strives to capture the intricate patterns of the brocade in her paintings, seamlessly weaving local culture into her creations — a process that has brought her profound satisfaction.Throughout her stay in Hainan, Aleksandra has observed the evolution of the local culture.She expresses delight in the emergence of new cultural landmarks, such as the serene Wormhole Library and the coastal structure Sky Mountain. The latter encompasses bookstores, cafes, galleries and an outdoor stage.Aleksandra highlights the flourishing artistic landscape in Hainan, emphasizing that the island's welcoming atmosphere offers a wealth of opportunities for artists."In recent years, I've crossed paths with numerous artists, designers, filmmakers, photographers, musicians and architects on this island. …The artistic community here thrives on sharing art, music and the simple pleasures of life," she says.In the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Russia and the commencement of the 2024-25 China-Russia Years of Culture, cultural exchange events are underway in both nations."Art transcends borders and possesses the ability to connect disparate cultures," Aleksandra says.With the intention of fostering mutual understanding between the people of China and Russia through her art, she envisions curating an exhibition that showcases the rich tapestry of Chinese and Russian culture."I will stay in China for as long as I can. It's my second home," she says.Xinhua  In 1857, British Sinologist Alexander Wylie founded the first Chinese news monthly in Shanghai called Liuhe Congkan (Shanghai Serial), which introduced Western learning to the East and Chinese culture to the West.Columnist Joseph Edkins, who worked for the monthly publication, wrote essays about classic Western literature, including epics by Greek poet Homer and the ancient Greek theaters. In his piece, A Brief Discussion on Greek Poets, he mentioned the tragic and comic poets Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes, as well as their works."The introduction of these cultures and ideas from the West has played a crucial role in the construction of modern Chinese thought, value standards and aesthetic systems," said Luo Tong, a scholar specializing in Greek theater at the Shanghai Theatre Academy, at a recent launch event for the Chinese translation of the book, How to Fit All of Ancient Greece in an Elevator. The book will be released next month.At the start of the 20th century, Western culture was widely introduced to China along with the New Culture Movement."Mr Democracy" and "Mr Science" from the democratic times of ancient Greece, featured in a contemporary way with updated meanings by Chinese intellectuals, greatly influenced Chinese society, which was going through a profound transformation. Old-generation scholars at that time began translating and studying ancient Greek literature and history more systematically, Luo says.HONG KONG — In a dimly lit exhibition hall at the Hong Kong Palace Museum, exquisitely crafted vintage clothing and accessories are illuminated by spotlights, as clips from classic movies play silently in a loop, creating the sense of traveling through time.Nearly 400 items of French clothing, jewelry, and accessories from the late 18th to the early 20th centuries are on display, telling the story of fashion and attire like a centuries-old scroll.This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France.

Licensed cat veterinarians, a parked medical service vehicle, and cat friendly devices such as cat storage, cat mood stabilizer and cat strollers will be provided. After each event, the entire museum will be thoroughly disinfected, sterilized and deodorized, according to the organizer.On Friday, the renowned Trio Wanderer from France mesmerized the audience at the Beijing Concert Hall with a captivating concert featuring the chamber music works of Austrian composer Franz Schubert.Comprising three musicians — pianist Vincent Coq, violinist Jean-Marc Phillips-Varjabedian, and cellist Raphael Pidoux — the trio delivered a stellar performance, showcasing Schubert's masterpieces including Piano Trio No. 1 in B-flat Major, Op. 99, Adagio in E-flat Major, Op. posth. 148, D. 897, and Piano Trio in E-flat, Op. 100.COLOMBO — Nineteen-year-old Sri Lankan Senuda Sapumal carefully watched his Chinese teacher demonstrate how to do calligraphy, then cautiously dipped his brush in ink, and succeeded in writing two large characters representing "friendship". Around him, dozens of students of similar ages watched attentively and were eager to have a go for themselves.Chinese Culture Meets Students of Sri Lanka, an event hosted by the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka, was held on June 25 at the Sri Lanka Boys' Model School in Malabe. Under the guidance of Chinese teachers, young Sri Lankans born after 2000, who are also known as Generation Z, immersed themselves in traditional Chinese culture by practicing calligraphy, learning paper-cutting, and training in martial arts."I've seen kung fu movies and chopsticks in restaurants, but this is my first time to experience Chinese culture myself. It is amazing," Sapumal says, proudly holding up his calligraphy and posing for a photo to capture the moment.The students here are no strangers to China. Sapumal says that his teacher told them their school uniforms were donations from China. "China, Friendship," he says.On the other side of the classroom, a long display table is filled with Chinese crafts: Peking Opera masks, enamel vases, fan screens, and tea sets. Many students paused to look at them."What do the masks signify?" "During which festival do you hang lanterns?" "Which Chinese zodiac sign is mine?" The students eagerly asked questions. Upon receiving an answer, several senior students showed photos on their phones of traditional Sri Lankan masks and paper lanterns lit during the Vesak festival."It turns out Chinese culture is very similar to ours. It feels like China is closer to us now," one student says.Zhang Min, a teacher at the Bandaranaike Center for International Studies, says that additional Chinese Culture Meets Students of Sri Lanka events will take place at 11 primary and secondary schools in Sri Lanka within the next six months, and that the current program is the third of its kind."I teach Sri Lankan students Chinese paper-cutting. When the children open their cut-out designs, their expressions of surprise are like a result of 'a magic moment'. Many times, students tell me they hang them in their windows at home to share the joy with their families," Zhang says. "I hope that these immersive experiences will plant the seeds of Chinese culture in the hearts of students, and gradually take root and thrive.""I am about to enter university and I'm preparing to study architecture in China. That's what I have always dreamed of," says Sapumal.Africa is seen by many Chinese as a land of immense natural beauty and exotic animals, but awareness about its rich and varied culture is little known outside art circles.In Beijing, cultural aficionados and those who have lived in or visited Africa are trying to deepen cultural links to the continent by introducing its unique arts and crafts to residents.Their dedication to promoting Africa is also adding vibrancy to the Chinese capital through venues that allow visitors to experience Africa's cultural offerings firsthand.Feng Xinxin, who is in her 30s, lived in Namibia for 11 years from 2008. Her African paintings, sculptures, and images and artworks of rare animals are on display at an Africa-themed coffee shop in a cultural park outside Beijing's northeastern Fifth Ring Road."When I came back (from Namibia), and chatted with people around me, their first question about Africa was whether it was a war-torn place and if going there was unsafe," said Feng. "People wondered why a woman would go to Africa at such a young age, and they had a particularly skeptical attitude."I was asked too many questions and this became a motivation for me to build such a place in Beijing, to let more people truly understand Africa."The families of Taiwan writers Yu Guangzhong (1928-2017) and Sanmao (1943-91), born as Chen Maoping and also known to the English-speaking world as Echo Chan, recently donated a selection of their manuscripts and other literary documents to the National Museum of Modern Chinese Literature in Beijing.They made the donation when they attended a forum on June 29 to enhance literary ties across the Taiwan Strait in Xiamen, Fujian province, which was held as part of the Straits Forum, the largest grassroots cross-Strait exchange event.It was the first literary event at the Straits Forum, which attracted 140 renowned writers from both sides, including Shu Ting, Zhang Xiaofeng and A Yi, as well as youth representatives from various universities.Sanmao's younger brother Chen Chieh says that in his sister's short life, she wrote many books beloved by readers on both sides of the Strait."Sanmao loved traveling and writing; she cherished Chinese culture and left deep footprints on the Chinese mainland. This grand event is a rare opportunity to take her legacy home," Chen Chieh said of his sister, who was born and spent the first three years of her life in Chongqing until the family relocated to Taiwan in 1948.Yu's daughter Yu Pei-san talked about her late father's great love for books. "Ever since I was a child, I would see him carefully wiping his books, again and again, using his clothes. He didn't care much about clothes, but books were especially precious."My father used to say that if we compare Chinese culture to concentric circles, the core would be Chinese culture while the radius would be the Chinese language. Wherever the Chinese language reaches, that's how far the circles extend. As long as the language survives, its spirit and culture will advance together, promoting one another."Taiwan writer Chen Hsiu-Mei, whose pen name is Chen Ruoxi, recalls how she embarked on her literary journey and the profound influence a teacher from the Chinese mainland had on her. She says that she hopes her life story will help the younger generations open their minds and create their own literary connections.According to Huang Wentao, deputy head of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, the literary forum included a series of associated events, among which were discussions about writing novels and poetry, lectures and recitations of classical works.From July 1 to Wednesday, writers and youth representatives from the Chinese mainland and Taiwan visited Nanjing, the provincial capital of Jiangsu province, to go to the museums and experience the city's natural and cultural landscapes.Hu Bangsheng, Party group member of the China Writers Association, one of the organizers of the literary event, says that writers from both sides of the Strait share a profound literary tradition and have been enhancing exchange and mutual understanding of late.He says that in hosting the event, the organizers were seeking to deepen the friendship between literary circles on both sides through the medium of Chinese culture to build an exchange platform and nurture young writers.He adds that over the years, the China Writers Association has organized seminars and exchanged visits to promote literary connections between both sides of the Strait, and that the National Museum of Modern Chinese Literature has manuscripts and other literary documents belonging to 30 Taiwan writers. It has also carried out research and preservation in this regard.The China National Tourist Office in Tokyo has recently launched "Nihao! China" - 2024 Silk Road Tourism Overseas Promotion Season, inviting Japanese visitors to explore the enchanting landscapes of China along the Silk Road.The event is hosted by the Network of International Culturallink Entities, in collaboration with the cultural and tourism departments (bureaus) from 13 provinces, cities or districts along the Silk Road. The entire promotion season will last until this October.The China National Tourist Office in Tokyo is introducing relevant tourism resources on its website, X (formerly known as Twitter), Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and other overseas social media platforms.The promotion event includes the Glory of Millennia Silk Road Photo Exhibition, the global screening of the Silk Road-themed video, as well as the exhibition of cultural and tourism resources of the provinces (districts or cities) along the Silk Road.The event comprehensively introduces the cultural and tourism features of the areas along the Silk Road from different angles, and display the charm of the culture and tourism of the ancient Silk Road to the Japanese people.Standing on the stage of the 23rd Chinese Bridge Chinese Proficiency Competition for Foreign College Students in the United Kingdom, Daisy May Lord, one of the contestants, could not hold back her tears as her teacher said, "I am always proud of you", in front of hundreds of audience members.While other participants patted her arms, trying to comfort the crying girl, waves of emotion swept over Lord. On stage, they are rivals, but off stage, they compliment each other's performances and outfits, giving the impression of close friends even though many of them are meeting for the first time in the competition.Francesca Pala, a third-year Chinese studies student at the University of Leeds and this year's competition runner-up, said that a shared passion for China, Mandarin, and Chinese culture bonds everyone together."It was really obvious that we all love China, Chinese culture, and Mandarin. So, it was really nice to be in that environment where other people could feel the same way you feel," she said.With the theme "One World, One Family", the 23rd edition of the event united around 120 candidates from different nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, who are studying at 15 UK universities, for the preliminary selection process that began on April 1.On June 6, eight finalists convened in London to compete.Zhang Qian, senior manager of the marketing department at the Center for Language Education and Cooperation UK, the organization that has hosted the contest since 2010, has witnessed significant growth in the number of participants. Fourteen years ago, only five or six universities sent fewer than 70 students, she recalled.The scale of the event amazed some early adopters of Mandarin. "This (competition) didn't exist when I was learning Chinese," said Frances Wood, a British sinologist and former head of Chinese collections at the British Library.Even in the 1960s when she enrolled at Cambridge University to study Chinese, Wood recalled that the number of British universities offering Chinese language-related programs was so few that they could be counted on one hand.Over the years, Zhang noted that alongside students studying Chinese subjects at universities, a group of enthusiasts has also emerged among contestants who, despite not majoring in Chinese, are learning the language out of personal interest.To encourage their enthusiasm and ensure fair play, the contest has been divided into professional and non-professional categories since 2018, with a certain number of final spots reserved specifically for contestants in the non-professional category.Yet, no matter how the competition innovates its format, it is always for serving Mandarin learners, Zhang highlighted. "And once at the venue, you can be consistently moved by the students, their families and friends recording videos to cheer them on, and their Chinese teachers assisting with the final coaching. This is the fervent atmosphere you can truly feel firsthand.""Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself" is the most well-known saying by Confucius among foreigners who took part in an online survey.More than 47 percent of respondents said it was the most familiar quote from The Analects of Confucius, and that it conveys the moral principle that one should not impose on others what they themselves do not wish to endure.The survey of 312 foreigners, conducted in June by chinadaily.com.cn and the Information Office of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, was dedicated to the upcoming 10th Nishan Forum on World Civilizations and aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of foreigners' knowledge and perceptions of Confucian culture.The two-day forum is scheduled to kick off on Wednesday in the county-level city of Qufu, Shandong province, also known as the hometown of Confucius, with the theme of "Traditional Culture and Modern Civilization"."I feel like Confucianism is popular everywhere because he made such an impact and it's not necessarily country oriented," said Michelle Hsu, a survey respondent from South Africa. "I feel like you could take his teachings anywhere and they would still be relevant."Another respondent, Sayana Mosquera, who is from Ecuador, said that Confucianism is like a bridge connecting cultures to China, and is a good way for China to promote its culture globally.The survey found that "when three people walk together, there must be a teacher among them" and "what a joy to have friends coming from afar" are quotes that are also well-known among foreigners, each of which was chosen by 40 percent of respondents.Some foreigners wrote their favorite quotes from Confucius in the survey, such as "the superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions" and "the gentleman looks within himself; the small man seeks what is in others", highlighting their familiarity with and fondness for The Analects.The survey respondents came from 26 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Canada, Germany, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Kenya, with the majority having visited China. About 60 percent were between 18 and 30 years old, while about 40 percent were over 30.In the survey, about 86 percent of respondents correctly identified Shandong as the birthplace of Confucius, around 80 percent knew that The Analects is the most important Confucian classic, and 46 percent thought that "benevolence" is the core concept of the Confucian school.The survey also found that most respondents believed that encouraging cultural exchanges, hosting art exhibitions and cultural festivals, and cultivating foreign language education were the most effective ways to promote exchanges and mutual learning between different civilizations.Since its inception in 2010, the Nishan forum has been held nine times. The event focuses on dialogues among different civilizations around the world. It has become an increasingly important platform for strengthening the preservation and development of Chinese traditional culture, advocating common human values and promoting international cultural exchanges and cooperation.The 10th forum will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the International Confucian Association and the Shandong Provincial People's Government.It will cover topics including civilizational exchanges and mutual learning amid global challenges, Chinese-style modernization and Western modernization, civilization inheritance and innovation in the process of modernization, and artificial intelligence and human civilization.BARCELONA — Prominent illustrators and writers from China and Spain gathered in Barcelona on Thursday to celebrate the art and literature of comics from both countries.The event "A World of Comics — Closer to Chinese and Spanish Literature and Illustration" was held in the Espai Sol room of Barcelona's Nord train station.Chinese comic artists Xiao Lin Manga and Nie Jun, as well as writer Cai Jun shared their thoughts, methods and experiences in a roundtable discussion with Spanish comic artists, writers and publishers."Comics are very powerful, possessing a language that has no borders. I think the most important part of this type of exchange is that people can learn each other's thoughts through comics," Nie says.The illustrator points out that while Western comics are very popular among young people in China, demand for Chinese comics in Europe is also increasing. Nie's work has been published in France and will soon hit bookshelves in Denmark.Munir Hachemi, a Spanish writer who also lectures at Peking University, says comics are ideal for showing how different Chinese contemporary culture is from outdated preconceptions that often persist in foreign societies."Comics can reach young people, which is ... important and powerful... there's no such thing as traditional Chinese comics, which makes them good for sharing contemporary Chinese culture," he says.The event was also the inauguration of an exhibition of the same name running until July 27, which will display some 200 artworks by comic artists from Spain, China and other parts of the world."A World of Comics" is part of the Get to Know China initiative created by China's State Council Information Office."Publishers say that most of the demand is for manga, both Chinese and Japanese. These days, Asian culture is much more present in Europe than before, in food, fashion, music, literature ... everything," Spanish comic artist Igor Sarralde says.The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization also participated in the event, since Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province, and Barcelona are part of the Cities of Literature network, which consists of 53 cities in 39 countries.The dance theater production Handling Hands, a collaborative creation by Swiss disabled artist Alessandro Schiattarella and Chinese disabled artist Liu Yan, is set to debut at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing on July 6 and 7. Produced by the Beijing Body On & On Cultural Exchange Center, the production is spearheaded by the center's founder, Ge Huichao, who serves as the producer and dance dramaturge, with special backing from the Swiss Arts Council Pro Helvetia.As per the creative team, this joint production intertwines the unique cultural heritage and mutual life journeys of the two choreographers. Centered around the motif of "hands", it delves into inclusivity and innovation within the realm of dance, while exploring the dynamics between life's constraints and the quest for liberation.Drawing inspiration from Schiattarella's prior works and Liu's research, the piece incorporates elements such as Schiattarella's incorporation of Neapolitan gestures and Liu's exploration of hand dance and mudras within classical Chinese dance. This fusion encapsulates the essence of both Chinese and Western classical and contemporary dance styles.ADDIS ABABA — On a typical Saturday morning, a diverse group of Ethiopian-Chinese language enthusiasts from varied walks of life are eagerly immersed in practicing Mandarin dialogues inside one of the small yet vibrant classrooms that are colorfully decorated with Chinese characters and cultural elements in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.This unique institution, called Ni Hao Habesha Language Training School, is the first of its kind in Ethiopia, established with the overarching goal of spearheading Sino-Ethiopian cultural and language exchanges.At the heart of this fast-growing ambition is Kaleab Zelalem, a 27-year-old Ethiopian with an "intense passion and admiration "for Chinese culture and language. It all started when Zelalem traveled to China in 2017 where he studied international law for four years in the city of Huangshi, Central China's Hubei province.Following his return to Ethiopia, Zelalem noticed the ever-growing demand among fellow Ethiopians to learn Chinese. Aware of the gap in addressing this demand and fueled by his newfound admiration for the Chinese culture and language, the young man founded the language training school in 2022, becoming the first private language teaching institution in the East African country, solely specialized in teaching the Chinese language."I saw the gap and the demand. Many government officials and business people were looking to learn Chinese, because most Chinese people would be happy if they communicated in their native language. That is when I felt it was time to open a Chinese language school," he says.His vision was simple — "to not only teach the language but to introduce and impart the unique perspectives and customs that shape the Chinese worldview".One Chinese lesson at a time, starting some two-and-a-half years ago and further expanding its reach, the school is now transforming how Ethiopians view China and its people, while in the process, discovering a newfound appreciation for the richness of Chinese culture.The school, as part of its ambition to promote language and cultural exchanges between the two peoples, also offers short Amharic, Ethiopia's working language, training courses to Chinese nationals who are interested in uncovering Ethiopia's culture and language."The unique thing about this school is that we not only teach the language, we teach the culture, norms and the way Chinese people perceive the world, which is unique," Zelalem says."If we don't understand the language at its heart, we will not be able to communicate effectively. We need to understand the culture to understand China and the Chinese people."This holistic approach has attracted a diverse set of Ethiopians — government officials, business people, tour guides and college students.Bethlehem Abera, a business management graduate currently working as a customer relations officer at a local import-export firm, is one such student who believes that the decision to learn Chinese is already paying dividends professionally and personally."In my time working with Chinese people, we communicated in English at first. But now, after I started my Chinese class, somehow, we communicate some words in Chinese, which makes them happy. I see the happiness on their faces and I feel proud, too. That is why I feel like I need to learn more every day," she says.For Abera, her growing ambition to learn the Chinese language and know more about China, its people and its culture is enshrined in the teaching-learning approach implemented at the school, an embodiment of the founder's dream to promote Sino-Ethiopian cultural exchanges.Senay Alemnew, a 22-year-old graduate student at the Addis Ababa University School of Commerce, is another enthusiast who has been learning Chinese at the school for the past two years.Echoing the sentiment, Alemnew speaks in awe about the opportunity presented to uncover China and its culture."The class is interesting. It has history classes as well, which is nice. My fascination with China is because of its history. It has amazing people and culture. The level of development that they have achieved is very impressive, which is why I started the class, and I look forward to going to China," he says.In its two-and-a-half years of operation, the school has taught Chinese to more than 500 students who are not only Ethiopians, but Chinese enthusiasts from different nations, such as Austria and Tanzania. In doing so, Zelalem has amassed heartwarming compliments and memories from his students.With his unwavering passion for bridging the cultural divide, Zelalem and his fast-growing Chinese training school, which now employs three qualified Chinese language instructors, are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the next chapter of Sino-Ethiopian relations.As Zelalem looks to the future, he is confident that the demand for Chinese language education in Ethiopia will continue to grow."I am pretty sure that for the next few years, the demand for the Chinese language will increase. I do not doubt it," he says.From Florence to Beijing, between figurative and abstract, creative talent blazes its own paths, Lin Qi reports.In 1715, Giuseppe Castiglione, a young man from Milan, Italy, arrived in Macao. His ultimate destination was the imperial court of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) in Beijing, where he was to serve the emperor as a painter.At that time, Castiglione didn't expect that his service at the court would last for decades until he died in 1766. As one of Emperor Qianlong's favorite artists, he left paintings depicting the ruler, his activities and imperial life. Meanwhile, he helped train several Chinese pupils to master Western painting techniques.On June 30, the "Lanting Pavilion" yaji cultural salon on Chinese Yu Opera and calligraphy was held at the China Cultural Center in Paris. The event was co-hosted by the China Cultural Center in Paris, the China Arts and Entertainment Group Ltd., as well as the Culture, Radio, TV & Tourism Bureau of Kaifeng, and was co-organized by the Kaifeng Investment Group and China Performing Arts Agency.Liu Hongge, director of the China Cultural Center in Paris; Ji Suchen, deputy general manager of the China Arts and Entertainment Group Ltd.; Wang Lu, general manager of the China Performing Arts Agency; and over 100 Chinese and French guests attended the cultural salon.Wu Suzhen, now an inheritor of the Chen School of Yuju Opera, who in 2019 won the Plum Performance Award, China's top honor for traditional Chinese theatrical art, performed on stage in the traditional "qingyi" role of Yu Opera. Wu specializes in the role of qingyi — dignified female characters who often exude elegance and maturity. Wu performed an excerpt from the opera Fanwang Gong (Palace of Brahma) to narrate a beautiful Chinese love story.At the event, besides vividly explaining the professional aspects of Chinese opera through body movements and vocal demonstrations, Wu also invited the French audience to learn opera on the spot. Originating from Henan province, Yu Opera is China's leading local opera with the largest number of performers and troupes. In 2006, it was listed by the State Council as part of the first batch of national intangible cultural heritage. In recent years, as Yu Opera has continuously reached the world stage, it has earned the title of "Eastern Aria" in the West.This cultural salon served as an excellent warm-up for the upcoming 9th Traditional Chinese Opera Festival in Paris to be held in November.After the opera performance, attendees moved to the calligraphy experience area, where they watched the renowned calligrapher Li Jian demonstrate his unique "slender gold" calligraphy style. "Slender gold" is a unique style of calligraphy attributed to Zhao Ji, Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), named for its resemblance to twisted and turned gold filament in Zhao's writing.
