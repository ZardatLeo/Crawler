SEOUL - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) test-fired a new-type tactical ballistic missile and an improved strategic cruise missile on Wednesday, as the country's top leader called for bolstering up the military capability for self-defence when he guided the event, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Thursday.The test-fire of the new-type tactical ballistic missile, called Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5, was aimed at verifying the hitting accuracy at medium range of 320 km and explosive power of its payload of a 4.5 tonnage super-large conventional warhead, the KCNA said.The DPRK also test-fired a strategic cruise missile whose performance has been highly upgraded for its combat use, according to the report.Kim Jong-un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the DPRK, said the security situation makes it an imperative for the country to bolster up the military capability for self-defence, the KCNA said.The DPRK leader stressed the need to continue to bolster up the nuclear force and have the strongest military technical capability and overwhelming offensive capability in the field of conventional weapons, it added. BEIJING -- At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Malaysia's King Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar will pay a state visit to China from Sept 19 to 22, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced Wednesday.China and Malaysia have a long-standing traditional friendship and are good neighbors and partners in mutual assistance and win-win cooperation, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at Wednesday's press briefing.Lin noted that in March last year, President Xi reached an important consensus with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on building a China-Malaysia community with a shared future, which has provided direction for the development of China-Malaysia relations in the new era.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Malaysia and the Year of China-Malaysia Friendship, and Chinese Premier Li Qiang's successful official visit to Malaysia in June injected new impetus into the development of China-Malaysia relations, he added.Lin said the visit by King Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar is his first visit to a non-ASEAN country since assuming office as the head of state. President Xi will hold a welcome ceremony and a banquet for him. The two heads of state will hold talks and Premier Li will meet with King Sultan Ibrahim.Lin said China is willing to work with Malaysia to take this visit as an opportunity to continue the traditional friendship, deepen strategic alignment, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, further enrich the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Malaysia, and achieve new results in building a China-Malaysia community with a shared future.At an anti-nuclear power rally in Tokyo on Monday, Japanese citizens renewed their calls for an immediate halt to the ocean discharge of contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.The event drew 5,000 participants from across Japan, with the organizer, a local citizens' group, expressing its goal to expand the movement nationwide.Chiyo Oda, co-director of the Citizens' Conference to Condemn Further Pollution of the Ocean, a nonprofit organization based in Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, criticized the ongoing discharge.She noted that, despite widespread opposition and broken promises to the fisheries community, the ocean release continues, with numerous contradictions and injustices remaining unaddressed.Oda added that previous claims, such as the lack of space for additional storage tanks or the lower cost of releasing contaminated water into the sea, have lost credibility. The justification of needing storage for debris removal is also becoming less convincing given the current state of the cleanup efforts."We are repeatedly told that decommissioning is essential for recovery, and for that, the removal of debris is necessary. However, is it really possible to safely remove such dangerous debris? And what will they do after removing it? The ultimate form of the decommissioning process has not been discussed, and it seems like they are proceeding blindly," said Oda.Furthermore, not only tritium but also other radioactive substances, such as strontium and carbon-14, remain in the water after being released. Even the dangers of tritium itself have not been adequately explained, she added.Thirteen and a half years have passed since the triple meltdown at the Fukushima plant, which was triggered by the 9.0-magnitude Great East Japan earthquake and the subsequent tsunami in March 2011. Despite the severe damage, local fishermen still wish to continue their work and persist in opposing the ocean discharge of contaminated water.However, the local fishing industry in Fukushima seems to be overwhelmed by a deep sense of exhaustion. The number of fish markets in the region has dwindled and supermarkets are now selling fish caught in other prefectures.Insufficient explanationOn Aug 24, which marked a year after the ocean discharge began, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visited Iwaki, where he praised the local sashimi as "delicious" and assured the head of the fisheries cooperative that he would take full responsibility for the discharge until the end."I can't help but wonder what he's talking about, imposing a life on the residents where they can't honestly say the fish are good like they could before the accident," said Oda.Following the nuclear disaster, Tokyo Electric Power Company, or TEPCO, the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, and the Japanese government are now deliberately releasing radiation from the incident into the global environment, she added. This process began without sufficient explanation or the public's consent, making it completely unacceptable, Oda said."Our concern is the long-term impact of radiation, and we refuse to allow further contamination of the Earth's environment," she said.At the rally, participants voiced their concerns about the determination of the Japanese government and power companies to restart nuclear reactors, despite operating with aging and deteriorating facilities, and regardless of the potential for large earthquakes.Satoshi Kamata, a writer, said: "When you look at the promises being made in the current Liberal Democratic Party leadership race, they're focused on restarting nuclear power plants … They are completely disregarding the lives of the people, yet these candidates are leading the race."A new Foreign Direct Investment law in the Maldives is expected to enhance investors' confidence and boost the South Asian nation's economy, according to Maldivian officials and experts.It prioritizes transparency and investor protection, local media quoted Maldives' Minister of Economic Development and Trade Mohamed Saeed as saying.Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has ratified the FDI Act, which will bring new benefits to the country, said the ministry's news release on Sept 3. The new law will come into effect three months from the date of ratification and will apply to all foreign companies and individuals intending to undertake business on a long-term basis in the Maldives, according to the government.It noted, "The primary objective of the new law is to promote FDI in the Maldives by creating a more transparent and secure environment for foreign investments."The purpose of the new act is to establish guidelines on which sectors foreign investors can invest in within the Maldives, outline the regulations for granting investment permissions, and ensure protections for investors, said the release.The previous law, enacted in 1979, had been in effect for 45 years and is no longer aligned with the present-day global investment environment and economic situations.The news was encouraging to investors around the world, including in China, with observers saying the new law can provide impetus for infrastructure projects and related investments in the nation.Enhancing confidence"I am convinced that the passage of the new law will enhance the confidence of investors from all over the world to invest and do business in the Maldives, and promote the strong support of relevant financial institutions," Fang Qiuchen, chairman of the China International Contractors Association, told China Daily during the 9th Belt and Road Summit held in Hong Kong from Sept 11-12.According to Fang, more member companies of the China International Contractors Association would like to invest in the Maldives and participate in the infrastructure investment and construction of the nation that has joined the Belt and Road Initiative.Late last month, Maldives leader Muizzu extended his congratulations on the sixth anniversary of the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge.The bridge, inaugurated on Aug 30, 2018, has become a symbol of the close relationship between the two nations, he said in a post on X.Muizzu said the impressive engineering achievement not only connects the Maldivian islands but also represents the enduring partnership and mutual trust between China and the Maldives.Wang Lixin, China's ambassador to the Maldives, noted in a social media post that over the past six years, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge has greatly promoted the social and economic development of the Maldives and brought transformative changes in the lives of its people.The project has vividly shown how the Belt and Road Initiative and friendly cooperation with China benefit the local people. The ambassador added that she looks forward to a more fruitful collaboration in the future.China and the Maldives signed an agreement on the expansion and upgrading of the Velana International Airport, the gateway connecting the Maldives with the world, in 2014. In the past 10 years, the airport has renovated and expanded an apron area of approximately 250,000 square meters.Xinhua contributed to this story.More Asian nations are welcome to join hands with China in preserving regional cultural heritage to promote the inheritance and prosperity of the entire Asian civilization, China's envoy to Malaysia said."China has always been committed to fostering mutual understanding, respect, and trust among nations. It supports the communication between different civilizations," Ambassador Ouyang Yujing said in an interview with China Daily.China and Malaysia have a long history of cultural exchanges and deep-rooted ties, which have resulted in fruitful cooperation in cultural heritage, said Ouyang.For example, the Wangchuan ceremony, jointly nominated by China and Malaysia, was inscribed to the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list in 2020.According to the UNESCO lists, the Wangchuan ceremony and related practices are rooted in folk customs of worshipping. Developed in China's Minnan region between the 15th and 17th centuries, the element is now centered in the coastal areas of Xiamen Bay and Quanzhou Bay, as well as in the Chinese communities in Melaka, Malaysia."This is a successful practice and a typical example of transnational inscription by Asian countries," said Ouyang, adding that China and Malaysia have been maintaining close communication in establishing follow-up protection mechanisms to better protect and promote the cultural heritage.In addition, the two countries agreed to jointly nominate the lion dance, a well-known ancient art form, for UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list after a visit by Chinese Premier Li Qiang to Malaysia in June.As China and Malaysia celebrates the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations, China Daily and newspaper alliance Asia News Network held on Sept 5 a "Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation" in Malaysia. Think tank KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific co-organized the event.Ouyang said he hopes such a platform can encourage deeper exchanges in cultural heritage preservation and inheritance among various countries for shared heritage and shared future."The cultural heritage of the Chinese diaspora in Malaysia has become a bridge of China-Malaysia friendship, playing an indispensable role in cultural exchange and cultural heritage cooperation," said Ouyang, noting that it is also a vivid example of the spread and integration of the Chinese culture along the Maritime Silk Road route."I believe that in the future, the Chinese cultural heritage will continue to play a crucial role in the amicable exchanges and cooperation between China and Malaysia, further enhancing the bilateral relationship," the envoy said.This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The ambassador said China is looking forward to cooperating with different countries on multilateral platforms to jointly promote the preserving of cultural heritage.In a reception held on Sept 13 by the Chinese embassy in Malaysia to celebrate the founding anniversary, Ouyang said China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace, promotes the building of a community of a shared future for mankind, and proposed frameworks such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the global initiatives in development, security and civilization.The Global Civilization Initiative, put forward by Chinese President Xi Jinping in March 2023, advocates mutual respect and mutual learning among different cultures, drawing positive response from the international community.Later in the same year, the Alliance for Cultural Heritage in Asia, an organization initiated by China and joined by over 20 Asian countries, was officially established, marking the only intergovernmental organization for implementing Asian cultural heritage activities.Malaysia has expressed its willingness to become a member, according to Ouyang,"We hope to see more Asian nations engage in the preservation of cultural heritage, fostering deeper people-to-people exchange and jointly promoting the inheritance and prosperity of Asian civilizations," said Ouyang.With its long history, China has 43 elements inscribed on the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list, ranking first in the world.Noting that cultural heritage protection and inheritance requires a systematic approach, Ouyang said China has been continuously making efforts to improve relevant work, including enhancing archaeological research, improving museum access, fostering innovation, strengthening legislation, cultivating professional talent, and engaging the public.A Thai minister called for a positive perception of its trade with China, emphasizing benefits from the two partners' collaboration while urging relative sectors to strengthen laws to guarantee fair competition and safeguard consumers.In a government policy statement on Friday, Commerce Minister Pichai Naripthaphan noted that the new administration should make the best interests of the trade with the major markets — China and the United States in particular.He reaffirmed Thailand's neutral attitude and expectation of drawing more investment and opportunities. "Thailand should take advantage of the changing world and seek its own development," he said.In response to an increasing concern among Thai industry groups over the Chinese goods influx, Pichai expressed his confidence in the revival of the country's economy and called for a rational and positive view on imports from China.Last year, trade volume between China and Thailand reached $126.3 billion, according to the statistics from the Chinese embassy in Thailand. At least 40 percent of agricultural products in Thailand were exported to China annually.For the tourism sector, Thailand had welcomed more than 22 million foreign tourists by Aug 18 this year, bringing an income of nearly 1.06 trillion bahts ($31.8 billion).Sompop Manarungsan, president of the Panyapiwat Institute of Management, said the new government should address the perception that Chinese goods and investments are seen as negative by Thais before it escalates, Bangkok Post reported.He suggested that collaboration between China and Thailand could build a win-win trade model. "If the perception and attitude toward Chinese trade and investment are not addressed promptly, the result would significantly impact Thailand's export and tourism sectors," he said.After taking the role last month, Thailand's new Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra confirmed the plan to deepen the close bond with China on social media platform X, saying that the friendship with China is based on "mutual trust and respect, a common vision toward prosperity and progress, as well as familial ties between our two countries' peoples."Narongsak Putthapornmongkol, president of the Thai-Chinese Chamber of Commerce suggested that Thais should look at its trade with China objectively. "China always opens its door to products from Thailand and welcomes the trade with mutual benefits," he added.Narongsak said China always supports the export of Thai products to the Chinese market through multiple channels and has invited Thai partners to participate in its major trade fairs for years. The Chinese government even provided free booths for Thai enterprises for 20 consecutive years for the China-ASEAN Expo.Chinese enterprises in Thailand also help with employment in the country, he said, adding that the Thai-Chinese Rayong Industrial Zone helped boost Thai exports of $3 billion last year and provided jobs for more than 55,000 Thai people.yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cn An important need of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is how to regain public trust as a record nine candidates debate their prospects for the party's leadership, analysts said.During a public debate at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo on Saturday, the nine candidates shared their views on party reforms, addressing political funding controversies, economic policy and social security, among other topics.At the start of the debate, the candidates held up boards showing the key message they wanted to convey. Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi displayed "Economic Growth," former Economic Security Minister Takayuki Kobayashi showed "A Nation Leading the World," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi wrote "Economic Revival You Can Feel," former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi presented "Political Reform," Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa emphasized "A New Japan Where No One is Left Behind", former Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato displayed "Doubling National Income," Digital Minister Taro Kono emphasized "Achievements in Reform: Passion and Speed," former LDP Secretary-General Shigeru Ishiba presented "Safety and Security for Everyone," and current LDP Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi displayed "Promoting a 'Zero Tax Increase' Policy."During the two-hour debate, candidates first chose opponents to engage in discussion, followed by a Q&A session hosted by the Japan National Press Club.The LDP leadership election was officially announced on Thursday. With a 15-day campaign period, the longest since the current party presidential election rules were adopted in 1995, the goal is to create more opportunities for debate and help the party recover from the recent political funding scandal. Voting and ballot counting will be held on Sept 27, when the new party leader will be selected.Kazuyuki Hamada, a scholar of international political economy and former parliamentary vice-minister for foreign affairs of Japan, noted the candidates are once again rehashing policies that have been discussed for the past 30 years: income doubling, controlling inflation, labor market reform, reducing inequality, supporting strategic industries, regional revitalization, deregulation and peace diplomacy."Japan's outstanding government debt has now surpassed 1,000 trillion yen ($7.1 trillion), signaling a potential fiscal collapse. Without confronting the difficult reforms that involve painful budget cuts, this party leadership election — filled with empty promises — risks accelerating Japan's decline," he said.At the beginning of the debate, Koizumi expressed his commitment to political reform, stressing that the LDP leadership election is fundamentally about whether the party can truly change and who can lead that transformation."We will eliminate the policy activity expenses set for disclosure in 10 years, as they lack transparency.… Without these reforms, the LDP cannot advance politics or regain public trust," he said.Challenging taskRestoring public trust in politics appears to be an extremely challenging task. "On the surface, they pledge to 'reinvent the LDP' or 'put an end to money politics' with slogans that sound appealing, but if they were truly concerned or motivated, why haven't they done anything about it until now?" Hamada asked.The candidates must also clearly outline their vision for Japan's future, particularly in addressing domestic issues, said Noriyuki Kawamura, emeritus professor at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies. The public has two primary expectations: improving the social welfare system and tackling income inequality, Kawamura said.In the past year or two, inflation has become a pressing issue. With more than one-third of Japan's population reliant on pensions, many are struggling to cope with rising prices, Kawamura explained.Additionally, Japan's adherence to neoliberal policies over the past 20 years has created a stark divide between regular and non-regular employees. There are now nearly 20 million non-regular workers in Japan, whose income is less than half that of regular employees and who are treated much less favorably in various ways, he said.jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cn China has successfully safeguarded its territorial sovereignty with the Philippines withdrawing its unlawfully anchored vessel from Xianbin Reef in the South China Sea on Saturday afternoon after five-month illegal halt, and China will take countermeasures if Philippines continues its political provocations, said military experts.The Philippine Coast Guard vessel No 9701 was illegally anchored near the Xianbin Reef since April 17, during which time, China took several necessary measures to warn and control the vessel in accordance with the law, deterring several Philippine attempts to carry supplies to the vessel.Liu Dejun, spokesman of the China Coast Guard, said on Sunday the Philippines' move to illegally strand the vessel severely infringed on China's sovereignty and is a breach of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which was signed by China and the members of ASEAN in 2002, and damaged regional peace and stability.He said the Philippines should stop hyping the issue and infringing on China's sovereignty, and move in the same direction with China to protect the validity of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.He stressed that China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, including Xianbin Reef, and the adjacent waters. The China Coast Guard will take necessary measures to firmly safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.Zhang Junshe, a former researcher at the Naval Research Academy, said that Philippines' attempts to transport supplies to its vessel during its illegal halt at Xianbin Reef under the garb of "humanitarian aid" was a lame excuse."It is the Philippines' largest and modern vessel on active service, which has been put into use in recent years, so 'humanitarian aid' is purely an excuse for its scheme of unlawfully anchoring near the reef and jostling with China for the reef," he said.He added that Philippines tried to test China's resolve in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty by keeping the vehicle stranded for such a long time. It was also hoping for a favorable response from the United States. "But China's mighty deterrence and the slim chance of getting support from the US finally made Philippines leave in dismay."He said the vessel's withdrawal proved that China's policies and measures for coping with South China Sea issues are appropriate. The nation always insists on handling disputes through peaceful means such as negotiations and talks, it respects historical facts and behaves in accordance with international laws.The military expert added that the possibility of Philippines continuing its political provocations in the future by sending another vessel to the South China Sea cannot be ruled out as it has played unreasonable and shameless tricks in the region in recent years."China will definitely take countermeasures to defend national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests," he said.VIENNA - Giant pandas Yang Yang and Yuan Yuan left Austria on Friday and arrived in Chengdu in Southwest China's Sichuan province on Saturday, according to Vienna's Schoenbrunn Zoo.A cargo plane carrying the two pandas, who were among the most popular animal stars at the Schoenbrunn Zoo, departed the Vienna Airport on Friday night. The pandas' favorite snacks, including bamboo, sweet potatoes and carrots, were also on board.When visiting the pandas at the Schoenbrunn Zoo on Wednesday, Chinese Ambassador to Austria Qi Mei thanked the zoo and the Austrian side for taking care of the pandas. She said that the Austrian people will have more opportunities to see the beloved pandas with a new panda conservation agreement between the two countries.In June, Schoenbrunn Zoo and the China Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA) signed an agreement to strengthen their cooperation on giant panda protection and related research. Under the agreement, a new pair of pandas will be sent to the zoo under a 10-year project after Yang Yang and Yuan Yuan's return to China.Stephan Hering-Hagenbeck, director of Schoenbrunn Zoo, said in a statement that visitors to the zoo will not wait too long for the giant pandas as "a young pair of pandas will be moving in the near future."He added that the zoo will renovate its facilities to welcome the new panda pair.SEOUL -- Kim Jong-un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), met with visiting Secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council Sergei Shoigu on Friday, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Saturday.During the talks, they had a wide exchange of views on the issues of steadily deepening the strategic dialogue between the two countries and strengthening cooperation to defend the mutual security interests and on the regional and international situation, and reached a consensus on the issues discussed, the KCNA said.Kim expressed his appreciation for the development of bilateral ties in all fields including politics, economy and culture, and said that the DPRK government would further expand cooperation and collaboration with Russia in the spirit of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the future, it added.The DPRK leader and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the treaty in Pyongyang in June of this year.The Philippine government's dependence on United States' military aid is further straining Philippines' ties with China, keeping relations between the two Asian countries in crisis, a forum in Manila heard Friday.In addition, expanded US access to Philippine military bases has undermined the cause of peace in the South China Sea and continues to threaten Philippine sovereignty, observers said at a hybrid event organized by the Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute, or ACPh, a Manila-based think tank."It seems almost forgotten now that the Philippine Constitution mandates an independent foreign policy for the country. The Constitution states that foreign military bases, troops, or facilities shall not be allowed in the Philippines," Herman Tiu Laurel, ACPh's president said.Laurel said that under the administration of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the US military bases in the Philippines have even "installed banned intermediate missile launchers within the country, which has put the country in the crosshairs of America's enemies".Laurel was alluding to the US' deployment of the Mid-Range Capability missile system at Luzon. The northern Philippine island faces China's Taiwan region — a flashpoint of tense Sino-US relations.Sass Rogando Sasot, a political blogger and scholar of international relations, said the US wants to ensure that Filipinos "will always see China as a threat" and to use the military bases in the Philippines "to prevent the unification of Taiwan with the Chinese mainland"."The United States has to make sure that Philippine and China relations will remain in permanent crisis. It is never on the US agenda for China and the Philippines to pursue a compromise solution," Sasot said.Sasot said the Philippines needs to recalibrate its foreign policy to avoid being a battleground."Just ask yourselves, how many times has the United States initiated any diplomatic talks between the Philippines and China? None," Sasot said.She said the US will never go against Vietnam or Malaysia — both of which have competing claims over the strategic waterway — for the sake of the Philippines."The US will keep on encouraging Filipinos to pursue absolutely unrealistic goals," Sasot said.She said "the only realistic goal" for the Philippines is to pursue joint development with China over the South China Sea."This transforms the relationship of China and the Philippines from (a) relationship in perpetual crisis into a collaborative relationship," Sasot said.Daniel Hugo Santos, ACPh's youth representative, said the South China Sea is "just one part of the relationship" between the Philippines and China, and called for more cultural and trade exchanges between China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.prime@chinadailyapac.com  Implementing political reform and restoring trust of the public in politics are among the most important themes in Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, leadership election, but none of the current candidates have clearly presented policies on these matters, experts said.A record nine candidates launched a 15-day election campaign on Thursday to vie for leadership of the LDP, aiming to succeed Fumio Kishida as the country's next prime minister.Kishida announced on Aug 14 that he will not seek reelection as leader of the ruling party. His cabinet has continued to struggle with low approval ratings.Noriyuki Kawamura, an emeritus professor at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies, said: "Most of the candidates are focusing on creating a superficial sense of renewal, or so-called changing the atmosphere. In other words, they believe that by changing the face of the top leader, the atmosphere will change. But that alone is highly insufficient."He emphasized that whoever becomes the leader of the LDP will also become the prime minister of Japan, and the person must carry out fundamental political reform. Only by doing so can the public's trust in politics be restored."The Kishida cabinet has not conducted any thorough investigation into the issue of politics and money, and the Political Funds Control Act has not undergone any fundamental revision but rather only minor surface-level adjustments," said Kawamura.Despite receiving large sums of taxpayer money through party subsidies, LDP politicians repeatedly held political fundraising events and failed to report the funds they received, said Kazuyuki Hamada, an international political economy scholar and former parliamentary vice-minister for foreign affairs of Japan.The LDP's ability to reform itself and its vision for national reconstruction are being called into question. The people have lost faith in the current political system and nearly half of them do not even bother to vote in elections, said Hamada."This race seems like something orchestrated by the LDP to divert attention from the issue of politics and money … However, the candidates are not addressing the critical issues facing Japan's politics, economy, or defense," said Hamada.Satoshi Tomisaka, professor at the Institute of World Studies at Takushoku University, said that voters can experience a certain sense of renewal by observing a somewhat transparent process of power transfer, but that effect will not last long.Both the renewal of a change in leadership within the LDP and the renewal of a change in the governing party have the same temporary effect of raising expectations. However, this does not stop the overall systemic fatigue, said Tomisaka.In addition to the need to tackle the issue of politics and money, a significant shift in Japan's foreign policy is also required. Stabilizing relations with China will be a key challenge for the country's next leader, according to Kawamura of Nagoya University of Foreign Studies.In recent years, Japan's foreign policy has increasingly aligned with the United States, particularly in its adherence to US efforts to contain China. This approach has contributed to growing instability and tensions in Japan's relationship with China, Kawamura said."To safeguard Japan's national interests and determine its future direction, it is essential to balance its relationships with both China and the US," he said.China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations remain interconnected and interdependent not only in economic and trade ties, but also in regional security, according to ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn.Attending an event in Jakarta marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Friday, Kao mentioned the urgency of maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, saying that ASEAN and Beijing should ensure the area remains a sea of peace, stability, friendship and cooperation."In essence, our security is profoundly interlinked and interconnected and its growing interdependence underscores the importance of ASEAN and China security cooperation," Kao said.ASEAN highly values China's support for ASEAN centrality and unity, which together with interconnected security is a testament to the two sides' shared dedication to fostering a peaceful, stable and secure Asia Pacific, he said."Beyond our extensive economic ties, the cultural ties, and the people exchange between ASEAN and China, the deep historical roots spanning centuries remain a cornerstone of our relations," Kao.Kao noted that the ASEAN-China relationship had evolved significantly from its humble beginnings in 1991 to establishing a comprehensive economic partnership in 2021."The important evolution spans a wide range of sectors," Kao said, noting geopolitical security, trade and investment, cultural exchange and collaboration, technology, education and health, sustainable development and environment, agriculture, and energy.China's Ambassador to ASEAN Hou Yanqi stressed China's path of socialism with Chinese characteristics suits China's national conditions and has made China the world's second-largest economy.Sound relations"China has maintained sound relations and built partnerships with almost all countries in the world. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence proposed by China 70 years ago has become widely recognized principles of international society and continues to play its role in the era," Hou said.She said that China's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind points the way for human society and will lead to peace, security and common development.She noted the two sides are working closely to implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and upgrade the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement.The Permanent Representative of Malaysia to ASEAN Sarah Nava Rani Al Bakri Devadason said her country appreciates China's unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and ASEAN community-building efforts."As the current country coordinator for ASEAN-China relations, Malaysia looks toward working closely with other ASEAN member states and China to further advance the ASEAN-China Comprehensive strategic partnership," Devadason said.Noting this year is the ASEAN-China year of people-to-people exchanges, she said they play "an irreplaceable role in enhancing mutual understanding, friendship and trust, consolidating social foundation and public support, promoting economic and social development, and maintaining regional peace and stability".In addition to China retaining its position as ASEAN's largest trading partner since 2009, Devadason lauded the sociocultural pillars established as foundations for cooperation in other fields.Devadason noted the progress made by both sides on public health, science and technology, education, culture, environment, media, youth, social development, poverty reduction and disaster management.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.In the face of multiple economic challenges, Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra announced the new government's intent to focus on revitalizing the economy and improving people's welfare in her policy statement.In her statement on Sept 12, Paetongtarn stressed that the new government will prioritize economic stimulation and continue the policies of the former government led by former leader Srettha Thavisin, including his "digital wallet" cash handout program.Initiated during last year's general election campaign, the program gave 10,000 baht ($300) to 50 million people aged 16 and older. The policy is now expected to reach vulnerable low-income groups in the coming weeks, while others who are eligible may be paid later this year."It will take some time to build the digital wallet system but people cannot wait, so we need to make adjustments to ensure the plan works first," Paetongtarn said. "Along with other stimulant measures, payment in tranches will help boost the country."Paetongtarn, leader of the Pheu Thai Party, was elected as Thailand's new prime minister in August following the court-ordered removal of Srettha for ethical violations. Under the Thai constitution, the new government is required to announce its policy to parliament before commencing work.Starting on Sept 12, the policy statement was expected two last days but Paetongtarn arranged an urgent trip to the northernmost Chiang Rai Province on Sept 13 due to severe flood damage.As Thailand faces several economic challenges, Paetongtarn said her government will conduct comprehensive debt restructuring targeting home and car loans. Household liability in Thailand is estimated at over 90 percent of its GDP.Amid household debt in Thailand exceeding 16 trillion baht and rising non-performing loans, Paetongtarn said the initiative seeks to assist borrowers both within the formal financial system and outside of it.Also, Paetongtarn noted that the government will maintain measures to widen opportunities for people to access funds for developing communities and jobs.To relieve the concerns of small and medium-sized companies over international trade, Paetongtarn confirmed that the new government will safeguard those enterprises, especially in online platforms.She also noted that her administration will introduce measures to reduce energy prices and public utility fees by revising energy price structures and exploring new energy sources. Paetongtarn said this will also boost tourism and bring new technologies to the agricultural sector.Paetongtarn's Sept 12 statement did not reveal any changes in Thailand's foreign policy. However, just days after taking office the prime minister wrote on social media platform X that she would deepen the close bond between China and Thailand.Paetongtarn wrote that Thailand's friendship with China is based on "mutual trust and respect, a common vision towards prosperity and progress, as well as familial ties between our two countries' peoples".The new prime minister is the youngest daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, one of Thailand's most influential political figures for over two decades and prime minister from 2001 to 2006.At 37, Paetongtarn is the youngest leader in the country's history and its second female prime minister after Yingluck Shinawatra, who was Thai prime minister between 2011 and 2014.Tributes are pouring in for Sitaram Yechury, a veteran leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), who passed away on Sept 12 at the age of 72 after battling a prolonged illness.The veteran Communist leader was in a critical condition and had been receiving respiratory support at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. According to CPI(M) leaders, Yechury was being treated in the hospital's intensive care unit for acute respiratory tract infection. Over the past few days, he had been under treatment by a multidisciplinary team of doctors.Born on Aug 12, 1952, Yechury was serving as the general secretary of the CPI(M) since 2015. He was a member of the Politburo of the CPI(M) since 1992. Earlier, he was a member of India's parliament from 2005 to 2017.China's Ambassador to India Xu Feihong expressed sorrow at Yechury's passing, remembering him as "a staunch Marxist and an old friend of the Chinese"."Deeply saddened by the passing of Comrade Sitaram Yechury, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). My deepest condolences to his family and comrades of CPI(M) during this difficult time. He is a staunch Marxist and an old friend of the Chinese people. His contribution to China-India relations and friendship will be remembered forever," Xu said in a post on the social media platform X.The Polit Bureau of the CPI(M) also paid a heartfelt tribute to their comrade, saying in a statement that he was an outstanding leader of the Left movement and a well-known Marxist ideologue.Yechury's passing marks the end of an era for the CPI(M), where he was known for his unwavering commitment to Marxist principles and his ability to engage in thoughtful dialogue with political adversaries."The untimely demise of Sitaram Yechury at this crucial juncture in our national politics is a big blow for the CPI(M) and a grievous loss for the Left, democratic and secular forces. The Polit Bureau pays respectful homage to our beloved colleague and dips the red banner in his memory. The Polit Bureau calls upon all Party ranks to unite and work harder to advance the struggle for an exploitation-free society," it said."He was a brilliant student who secured a first class in both his undergraduate and post-graduate degrees in economics. He joined the student movement in Jawaharlal Nehru University in 1974 and became a leader of the Students Federation of India. He was the All India President of the Students Federation of India from 1984 to 1986 and played an important role in developing the student organization as an all-India force," the CPI(M) Polit Bureau said in the statement.Indian President Droupadi Murmu, in her condolence message, praised Yechury's "distinct and influential voice". "Though a committed ideologue, he won friends cutting across the party lines. My heartfelt condolences to his family and colleagues," she said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also offered his condolences, noting that Yechury was a "leading light of the Left" and "known for his ability to connect across the political spectrum.""He also made a mark as an effective Parliamentarian. My thoughts are with his family and admirers in this sad hour. Om Shanti," the PM said in a post on X.Political leaders cutting across party lines mourned the passing of the veteran Marxist leader.Sitaram Yechury "was a friend and a protector of the Idea of India, possessing a deep understanding of our country. I will miss the long discussions we used to have. My sincere condolences to his family, friends, and followers in this hour of grief," Indian National Congress, or INC, leader Rahul Gandhi posted on X."I am deeply aggrieved by the demise of Comrade Sitaram Yechury. Sitaram was one of the most outstanding leaders of the Left & Communist movement in contemporary times," Communist Party of India General Secretary D Raja said in a post on X.Yechury started his political career as a student leader with the left-wing Student Federation of India. He was arrested during the Emergency in 1975, when the Congress government led by former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi enforced a widespread restriction on civil freedom.He played an important role during the peak years of federal government's coalition politics when keeping together divergent agendas and ideologies essential to the stability of India's federal government. In 1996, he was a key figure in the formation of a 13-party coalition that ruled India for almost two years.In 2004, Yechury's party won a historic 44 seats in the parliamentary election.The Left parties, which include the CPI(M), subsequently provided "outside" support to help form an INC-led government. "Outside support" was a proposal was put forth by Yechury at that time for endorsing the administration without joining the government or taking up any ministerial positions.Yechury is survived by his wife Seema Chishti, son Danish and daughter Akhila.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.SUVA -- A report released by Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) saying "Chinese state-backed hackers attack Pacific Islands Forum (PIF)" is "purely a made-up story and has no basis at all," the Chinese embassy in Fiji said in a statement on Thursday.China firmly opposes the practice of politicizing cybersecurity issues, accusing other countries without evidence, and wantonly associating cyberattacks with the government of any country, said the statement."We have been resolute in combating all kinds of malign cyber activities in accordance with law, and never encourage, support or condone cyberattacks," said the statement, noting that China is a major victim of cyberattacks.Cybersecurity is a common challenge for all countries and the shared responsibility of all, it said.Committed to the peaceful use of cyberspace, the Chinese government pursues constructive cooperation with the international community in protecting peace and security in cyberspace on the basis of equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit, said the statement."We urge the relevant media outlet to respect facts and abide by principles such as objectivity, impartiality and professionalism, avoid making a presumption of China's guilt without verifying the facts, and stop spreading disinformation that misleads public opinion and smears China," it added.Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning also commented on this report on Thursday, saying that the PIF Secretariat did not associate this cyberattack with China."We have seen similar disinformation many times already, which is politically motivated and aimed at sowing discord between China and countries in the region," Mao said.She stressed that the South Pacific is no one's backyard, adding "We hope parties concerned will fully respect the right of South-Pacific countries to a balanced approach when developing relations with various parties."Chinese-style modernization not only concerns the country's own development but also brings new opportunities for global cooperation, Chinese and Japanese politicians and experts said at a seminar in Osaka, Japan, on Wednesday.Xue Jian, Chinese consul general in Osaka, said China's modernization is deeply interconnected with other countries.As China continues to develop, its path forward will become broader, creating new opportunities for global development and contributing positively to world peace, he said.Xue expressed his hope that Japan will join China on the journey toward modernization, encouraging Tokyo to approach Beijing's progress in the spirit of seeking common ground while respecting differences.Gao Anming, editor-in-chief of China Foreign Languages Publishing Administration, emphasized the importance of fostering a greater understanding of Chinese-style modernization across various sectors in Japan.Last month, the Academy of Contemporary China and World Studies conducted an online survey of the Japanese public to understand their views on "Chinese-style modernization". A total of 1,005 responses were collected.Among those polled, more than 60 percent agreed "developing Chinese-style modernization requires inheriting traditional Chinese culture and values, achieving an organic integration of cultural traditions with modern civilization", said Fan Daqi, vice-president of the academy.In a statement, former Japanese prime minister Yukio Hatoyama said China's current situation differs from Japan's after the collapse of the latter's bubble economy and the former Soviet Union during the Cold War."I firmly believe that Japan and the United States should avoid falling into the trap of value-based diplomacy and should not abandon their policy of engagement with China. At the same time, Japan should take on a strategic role as a bridge between China and the US," Hatoyama said.Hidetoshi Tashiro, chief economist at Japan's Infinity LLC, said the digital sector is the driving force behind China's economy. The rise of this vast digital ecosystem, unlike anything the world has seen before, is now propelling China's economic growth. This growth is fueled by semiconductor design and the development of applications, Tashiro said.China already commands a large share of the global market in many sectors. In industries such as electric vehicles and solar panels, as digitalization continues to expand globally, the demand for products and services that enable this transformation will increase, Tashiro said, adding that China's economy will enter a new phase of growth.Yangchoon Kwak, a professor of the College of Economics at Rikkyo University in Japan, said the primary driver of China's future economic growth will be green industries.China's development goals go beyond mere quantitative growth, aiming to foster industries that contribute to global peace and prosperity, he said."As a leading country, China can reap even greater benefits by concentrating on green industries, tourism, culture and arts. By further enhancing these sectors, I believe China is well-positioned to lead the global economy in the 21st century."Regarding claims that China is going to experience an economic slowdown, Kwak said there is an opportunity to avoid prolonged stagnation that Japan faced by focusing on emerging industries.This, he suggested, could allow China to navigate what is perceived as global recession.Noriyuki Kawamura, an emeritus professor at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies, highlighted two essential factors for China achieving high-quality development.The first is the pursuit of innovation, particularly through advancing cutting-edge technologies. This includes further progress in areas such as artificial intelligence and information technology.The second crucial factor is the continued expansion of economic and trade openness.TOKYO - Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Thursday officially began its leadership race as the two-week campaign started, with a record nine candidates competing to become the new party chief and the country's next prime minister.The contest for the position of LDP president, which carries a three-year term until 2027, kicked off amid declining trust for the party in the wake of its slush fund scandal, with party reform being a key issue in the upcoming election.The candidacies were filed at LDP headquarters on Thursday morning, with the official start of the election announced by party lawmaker Ichiro Aisawa in his capacity as chairman of the LDP's election administration committee.As both houses of parliament are controlled by the LDP and its coalition partner, the Komeito party, the winner is certain to become prime minister early next month when the Diet, Japan's parliament, reconvenes.Upon current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's decision last month to not seek reelection as the LDP president, the election has become the most crowded race in the party's history and one of the most unpredictable, according to local media reports.As the 15-day campaign began on Thursday, the nine presidential candidates would set out on a nationwide campaign, engaging in debates, delivering stump speeches, and lobbying local LDP chapters.Voting and ballot counting are slated to take place on Sept 27, when the candidates will compete for a total of 734 votes, of which 367 are cast by LDP lawmakers and 367 by general party members.A winner must obtain more than half of the votes in order to be elected as the new party chief, however, if no one wins a majority in the first round, a run-off vote between the top two candidates will be held on the same day, when the 47 prefectural chapters get one vote each and the 367 lawmakers vote a second time.Among the veteran candidates and public favorites is former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba, 67, making his fifth and final bid to become LDP chief over his 38-year political career.Another hopeful vying for the LDP presidency is 43-year-old Shinjiro Koizumi, a former environment minister and son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.Two female contenders are Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, 63, and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, 71.Other candidates include former Economic Security Minister Takayuki Kobayashi, 49; Digital Minister Taro Kono, 61; Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, 63; LDP Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi, 68; and former Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, 68.According to an opinion poll conducted by the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun in late August, Koizumi has emerged as the most popular candidate with 23 percent support. Ishiba was second at 18 percent and Takaichi third with 11 percent.Chinese entrepreneurs play an important role in supporting the economy of Malaysia and that of the wider world, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim told a forum in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.In a world marked by complexities and fraught with increasing instability, uncertainties and unpredictability, Chinese entrepreneurs globally can assume a bigger role in safeguarding regional economic cooperation, ensuring the security of crucial supply chains and promoting the global socio-economic development agenda, Anwar said at the 17th World Chinese Entrepreneurs Convention."From Southeast Asia to East Asia, the United States, Canada, Europe and Africa, Chinese entrepreneurs have collaborated closely with others and have laid the foundations for forging deeper and stronger business and economic links across national borders," he said.Held from Monday to Wednesday, the convention focuses on green economy, the semiconductor industry and investment opportunities in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations under the theme "Reimagineering the Future". More than 4,000 corporate leaders, experts and researchers from all over the world joined the event.Noting that China has been Malaysia's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years and a major source of foreign direct investment, Anwar said Malaysia's comprehensive strategic partnership with China will help not only his country but also the region.Wang Huning, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, sent a congratulatory letter to the convention.China will consistently adhere to the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, steadily expand its institutional openness, shorten the negative list for foreign investment, further open its modern service sector, and strive to create a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, rules-based and internationalized, said Wang, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.This will provide a brighter prospect and more cooperation opportunities for global investors including Chinese entrepreneurs, he said.Low Kian Chuan, president of The Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia, the event's organizer, said legendary acumen and the adaptability to innovate in a fast-paced and competitive environment have helped Chinese entrepreneurs thrive and navigate current and future global challenges.Keith Li, president of the China Entrepreneurs Association in Malaysia, said that Chinese companies investing in Malaysia have made a big contribution to the local economy.The two countries' cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative has also generated tangible results, Li added.Thailand's Chulalongkorn University signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Chinese Academy of Sciences Innovation Cooperation Center Bangkok (CASICCB) on Tuesday, aiming to boost deeper collaboration on science and technological innovation between China and Thailand.The MOU covers a wide range of fields, including personnel exchanges, joint research programs on environmental protection, and also application of artificial intelligence.As the oldest and one of the most prestigious universities in Thailand, Chulalongkorn University, founded in 1917, its main mission is to be the center for academic learning and professional excellence.Officials from the university discussed possible internship programs with the center's affiliated companies, giving students from the university opportunities to further develop their knowledge and skills on areas such as green solutions and environmental protection.Moreover, the two partners set out plans to encourage exchanges among scholars and researchers, aiming to enhance both countries' technological influences in the region via joint programs, seminars and research sharing. Scholarships may also be established to attract talents.SEOUL -- The top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) called for greater efforts for economic development and strengthening national defense on the occasion of the country's 76th founding anniversary, state media reported on Tuesday.Kim Jong-un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and president of the State Affairs of the DPRK, made the remarks during a National Day speech on Monday at the headquarters building of the WPK Central Committee in Pyongyang. He outlined a detailed state work plan based on a review of the country's development so far this year, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.The DPRK's top leader said economic growth has trended up this year as the national economic sectors met their production targets "without fail." The country's light industry and urban management are also poised for further improvements, the KCNA said.According to the report, during his speech, Kim also listed favorable agricultural production rates and expected "fairly good harvests" for the rest of the year. He added that the DPRK's military strength was due to critical national defense research and production achievements.In his National Day address, the DPRK's top leader also emphasized the need to boost national productivity by guiding key industries to meet their production targets. He also stressed the importance of the construction sector achieving this year's plan, emphasizing "thoroughly" ensuring construction quality, and reminded the agricultural sector to meet this year's farming goals while preparing for the next, according to KCNA.It said Kim expressed heightened urgency to strengthen national defense capabilities given current security developments on the Korean Peninsula.Noting the U.S.-led military alliances in the region have turned into "a nuclear-based military bloc," posing a grave threat to the military security environment around the DPRK, Kim vowed the country would "take more important measures and make constant efforts to maintain and further boost its military supremacy," the KCNA reported.Strong power means "a genuine peace and an absolute guarantee for the development of our state," Kim was quoted by the KCNA as saying.Saudi Arabia is targeting more Chinese participation in its maritime tourism ambitions, a visiting industry insider said as Riyadh reiterated its goal to become a global tourism powerhouse."Come in and capitalize on those opportunities", Tareq Alshaghrood, general manager of investment planning and attraction at the Saudi Ministry of Tourism, told Chinese investors, developers, and operators.Alshaghrood, in an interview with China Daily on the sidelines of the International Hospitality Investment Forum Asia in Hong Kong from Sept 9 to 11, said one of their aims is to broaden the potential of the Saudi yacht market and attract more traffic to the Red Sea through water activities like snorkeling, cruises, beach outing and diving.On Sept 5, the Saudi Red Sea Authority (SRSA) issued the country's first-ever regulations for Saudi yachts.According to the Saudi Press Agency, these include regulating their activities, outlining requirements and conditions, and overseeing the issuance of tourism and leisure licenses and permits.Alshaghrood said the aim is to ensure environmental protection, sustainability, and adherence to all safety requirements as part of the SRSA's key role in developing a sustainable coastal tourism sector."The Saudi Red Sea Authority is one of the initiatives we launched following the release of our strategy because the water activities, in general … there were obstacles and issues," said Alshaghrood.One hurdle, he said, was the yacht maritime regulation having multiple steps just to bring the yacht to the Red Sea. This is solved by the SRSA handling all of the regulations and acting as a single interface for users."It will make things easier for people that decide to bring their yachts to the kingdom and enjoy the beautiful Red Sea. And it extends beyond that," said Alshaghrood.BISHKEK - A center dedicated to blindness prevention cooperation with China has officially opened in a hospital in southern Kyrgyzstan.According to a report from the Chinese embassy on Monday, the China-Kyrgyzstan Cooperation Center of Blindness Prevention is designed to enhance ophthalmological collaboration between China and Kyrgyzstan. It will foster mutual visits, training, and academic exchanges among eye care professionals, and its establishment is expected to benefit Kyrgyz patients suffering from eye diseases. The center is located inside the Interstate United Clinical Hospital in Osh."This project is a new beginning of our cooperation in the field of health," Kyrgyz Health Minister Alymkadyr Beishenaliev said during the center's opening ceremony. The minister hoped that the friendly relations between Kyrgyzstan and China would continue.As part of this collaboration, the "Brightness Journey of LifeLine Express" project was also launched in Osh on Sept 2. Under this initiative, doctors from the People's Hospital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are performing free cataract removal surgeries. Chinese doctors will provide these life-changing operations to 200 patients while also conducting training sessions for local medical professionals.Chinese Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, Du Dewen, highlighted the center's significance, calling it another major milestone in the two countries' healthcare collaboration. She expressed her hope that the center would fulfill its purpose and contribute further to building a community with a shared future between China and Kyrgyzstan.One of the patients, Laimzhan Kaderkulov, who had been struggling with deteriorating vision in his left eye, successfully underwent surgery on Sept 6. "I can see clearly now. I am deeply grateful to the Chinese doctors," Kaderkulov said.This initiative aligns with China's commitment -- announced at the 22nd meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in September 2022 -- to provide 2,000 free cataract surgeries to patients in SCO countries over the next three years.TOKYO - Natsuo Yamaguchi, leader of Japan's ruling coalition party Komeito, said on Tuesday that he would step down and not run in the party's upcoming leadership election.Stressing a smooth generational shift within the party, Yamaguchi made the announcement at a press conference during the day, marking the first leadership change for Komeito in 15 years.The 72-year-old politician will step down upon the expiration of his eighth term on Sept 28 following his decision not to run for the leadership election scheduled on Sept 18.Yamaguchi, who has led Komeito since 2009, has played a significant role in the coalition government with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, notably contributing to the party's successes in national elections.With Yamaguchi's departure, Secretary-General Keiichi Ishii, 66, is expected to run unopposed and likely to be formally approved as the new leader at the party's convention on Sept 28.HANOI -- Super typhoon Yagi and its subsequent floods and landslides in Vietnam's northern region have claimed at least 82 lives as of Tuesday early afternoon while 64 others remain missing, said the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.The mountainous province of Cao Bang has suffered the most with 19 deaths and 36 missing.Fatalities also include 19 from Lao Cai province, 22 from Yen Bai province, nine from Quang Ninh province.Other deaths were from capital Hanoi, Hai Phong city, Hoa Binh, Hai Duong, Lang Son, Tuyen Quang, Ha Giang and Lai Chau provinces.According to the ministry's Department of Dyke Management and Disaster Prevention and Control, typhoon Yagi with powerful winds damaged 48,337 houses, mostly in the coastal province of Quang Ninh and Hai Phong city.The northern region is expected to see rising water levels on Tuesday and Wednesday, with several rivers reaching the highest alert level, said the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. CANBERRA -- Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a plan to ban children from using social media.The prime minister stated on Tuesday that the government will introduce legislation in 2024 to enforce a minimum age for access to social media and other relevant digital platforms."We know social media is causing social harm, and it is taking kids away from real friends and real experiences," he said in a statement.He said that the legislation would be informed by engagement with the states and territories, but his preference is to set the minimum age at 16 years.According to a poll conducted by state broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in August, 61 percent of Australians supported restricting social media access to those younger than 17.At the same time, Peter Malinauskas, the premier of South Australia, commissioned former federal judge Robert French to explore legal pathways to ban children younger than 14 from social media.The prime minister said that the federal government would consider Robert French's review when drafting the legislation.With the Mid-Autumn Festival drawing near, the mooncake market is bustling in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Belonging to the Mekong River system, Tonle Sap is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia.The women masters of the tourist boats, usually middle-aged, hail from the three villages of the Kampong Phluk commune in Siem Reap's Prasat Bakong district, a popular natural tourism area on the Tonle Sap Lake.Each morning during the rainy season, they gather under the shade of large trees, waiting to paddle tourists in their small wooden boats, which are equipped with mats, life vests, umbrellas and cushions.These women, who are not just oarsmen, but skilled tour guides, are pleased to share their depth of knowledge about the local environment and the traditions of their communities, all maintaining a warm and friendly demeanor, according to the district administration.Sang Kong, head of the Kampong Phluk Natural Tourism Community, explained that the group was established in 2013 and currently includes 1,058 boats.Every family in the three villages — Tnaot Kambot, Dey Krahom, and Kork Kdol — owns a boat."We established this group to empower women by giving them occupations similar to men. We want to enhance the dignity of women, who were traditionally seen as confined to household tasks."Now, we have women who can take charge in the same way as their husbands and brothers," Kong said.To ensure fairness, the boats are assigned to tourists on a rotational basis according to the number of daily visitors, meaning that not every craft is deployed every day.Five boats belonging to the village's most elderly women are prioritized however, allowing their children or grandchildren to earn them an income without needing to follow the rotational system.This occupation is only seasonal, lasting from August until late November or early December.Tourists can enjoy experiences such as observing the local way of life — including stilt houses, fish and prahoc production — or rowing through the flooded forest to admire the scenery, do some bird watching or watch the sun set over the lake.Khut Vanda, a member of the Meanchey Kampong Phluk Tourist Transportation Community, explained that the service costs $6, with each boat typically carrying two passengers on a 30-minute ride.Each day, around 70 of the boats are in operation.Additionally, around 800 larger boats crewed by men are available, at a cost of $20 for a two-and-a-half-hour trip."While men generally go fishing or operate larger boats, women have free time at home, so the community organized the option of paddling tourist boats, helping them to generate additional income to support their families," said Vanda."Most of the women are middle-aged or elderly. They have free time and grew up on the lake, so they are confident at handling their small vessels."Many tourists are particularly interested in the women skippers, after seeing posts on social media," he added.According to Department of Information of Siem Reap Province, over 220,000 tourists visited Kampong Phluk in the first seven months of 2024.THE PHNOM PENH POST, CAMBODIAEditor's note: In this weekly feature China Daily gives voice to Asia and its people. The stories presented come mainly from the Asia News Network (ANN), of which China Daily is among its 20 leading titles.Kuala Lumpur should establish a comprehensive underground mapping system for city infrastructure and utilities, if it does not already have one, said Malaysian experts and politicians.President of the Institution of Engineers Malaysia, or IEM, Jeffrey Chiang Choong Luin, said the recent sinkhole that swallowed 48-year-old Indian tourist Vijaya Lakshmi in Jalan Masjid India, or "Little India", in the city center of Kuala Lumpur, highlighted urgent need for action.Heavy rain that deluged Kuala Lumpur in the past weeks meant there was a lot of fast-moving water in the sinkhole and sewer, complicating the search efforts.The Malaysian authorities said a portion of a large concrete sewer at the bottom of the sinkhole was broken, and the victim might have fallen in and been swept away.A second sinkhole appeared in Jalan Masjid India on Aug 28, about 50 meters from the first one on Aug 23, causing further alarm."This is an opportunity to leverage technology and map out the city's intricate underground infrastructure. With the right resources and determination, future disasters can be prevented," Chiang told The Star."Furthermore, IEM is willing to assist in this crucial endeavor, should the DBKL (Kuala Lumpur City Hall) be open to collaboration," he added.IEM, which has over 50,000 members, had earlier issued a statement regarding the Jalan Masjid India sinkhole incident, urging DBKL to conduct a thorough investigation and offering its expertise to support the effort.The organization called for more stringent safety checks by qualified professional engineers in the design, construction and supervision of critical infrastructure to prevent a recurrence.In 2020, The Star reported that then Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan had ordered an interagency study with utility companies to map out the extensive network of underground cables and pipes in the capital city, prompted by the increasing number of sinkholes.Nor Hisham said that while Kuala Lumpur had developed a basic framework for addressing such issues, significant challenges remained due to aging infrastructure, some of which were over 50 years old.In a recent interview, Nor Hisham stressed the need for comprehensive underground mapping for Kuala Lumpur as well as good collaboration between agencies.During his tenure, Nor Hisham said he had difficulties obtaining accurate underground mapping due to lack of cooperation from utility companies."One of the significant challenges we faced was getting utility companies on board with the mapping process.China and Singapore have reiterated their commitment to enhancing ties in a volatile world, agreeing to plan for the next phase of key high-level exchanges, as Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan wrapped up a two-day visit to Beijing on Monday.It was Balakrishnan's first visit to China under Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's administration. Wong was sworn in as prime minister of the Southeast Asian country in May.Cai Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met separately with Balakrishnan on Monday.In a bilateral meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Wang called on the two countries to fully utilize dialogue mechanisms at various levels and in multiple areas, tap the potential of the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, and reach new heights of cooperation in the digital economy, green development and marine energy.Faced with a turbulent international situation, China and Singapore, as two forces for stability, need to strengthen strategic coordination and communication, Wang said.Singapore was one of the first countries to participate in and deeply integrate with China's reform and opening-up process, and the two countries have fostered close cooperation and mutual learning, he said, adding that this has contributed to the modernization and development of both countries.China is willing to enhance its alignment with Singapore's development strategies, and seeks to implement the newly established partnership envisioned by both leaders, he said.China and Singapore upgraded bilateral ties to an all-around, high-quality, future-oriented partnership in April 2023.Singapore is China's fifth-largest trading partner among member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and China has been Singapore's largest trading partner for 11 consecutive years.In 2023, bilateral trade reached $108.39 billion, according to the Foreign Ministry.Noting that China and Singapore enjoy mutual visa exemption, Wang urged the two countries to expand people-to-people exchanges, strengthen cooperation on training programs and communication between think tanks, media and youth organizations, and promote local-level exchanges.Balakrishnan said the upgrading of the relationship last year reflected "the unique, the longstanding and the very close ties between our two countries".He expressed the hope that the 35th anniversary of diplomatic relations next year will be taken as an opportunity to prepare for more high-level visits and expand cooperation.Singapore firmly supports China and ASEAN expanding two-way investment, and is ready to work with China to uphold the multilateral trade system centered on the World Trade Organization and to ensure the smooth functioning of global industrial and supply chains.Both sides agreed to strengthen coordination to ensure positive outcomes at the upcoming Leaders' Meetings on East Asia Cooperation.Voices for new tourism trends and a bright future ahead are echoing at the International Hospitality Investment Forum (IHIF) Asia, held on Monday through Sept 11, gathering top players in family offices, global hotel brands and leading developers.Speakers from across the world are analyzing empowering tourism destinations, exploring plans for growth potential, investment, innovating and even future leadership of sustainability on the opening day.Rizki Handayani, deputy minister of Industry and Investment of the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy of Indonesia, said meetings, incentives, conferencing, and exhibitions, or MICE, were getting "bigger and bigger" in the ten-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN."As a government, we produced some regulations inviting investors to come. We have special economic zones," Handayani told a session, noting that Indonesia is keen on more MICE event investment in Indonesia for infrastructure and attracting international organizers.Indonesia has started developing maritime tourism, which has prompted them to collaborate with other sectors such as fisheries, while open to sustainable tourism solutions. "When we talk about investments not only in the hotel industry but now it's also related to smart tourism, digital tourism, and also to focus on creative industries like the film industry," said Handayani.Sultan Al-Shehri, chief of investment at Aseer Development Authority in Saudi Arabia said giga projects — such as the country's NEOM project, Diriyah, and the Aseer region — were helping reshape the Saudi tourism sector. "All these are opening doors. It will create more momentum (for) businesses to look into Saudi".He said the Saudi government has moved to make doing business easier, noting that the pandemic had also forced Saudis to explore the country more. This benefited the country after it welcomed more than 100 million tourists in 2023.Al-Shehri said they have a dedicated fund for SMEs and have incubators and accelerators to help entrepreneurs in the sector.Taimur Baig, managing director and chief economist of group research at DBS Bank Limited, said they were bullish about Southeast Asia, with China being a major player in the global landscape.Despite "all the pushback on tech", the world is "seeing Chinese brands innovate" and that the Chinese entrepreneurs were bearing fruit amid global challenges, he said, noting that US domestic politics is "forcing the Chinese to become self-sufficient".Given the way the world is shaping up, Asia is the region that stands to substantially benefit from "all this globalization, policy, tech restrictions", Baig said. "It's happening as we speak."Liz Ortiguera, managing director of Asia Pacific and senior advisor to the CEO at the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), said the region's governments had underestimated the reach of travel and tourism."We really are a mega sector ... if you include our colleagues in West Asia, we're even larger," she said during the "Catalysts of Tourism and Hospitality Investment: Infrastructure, Regulation, Policy, and Mega Projects" panel."Today, we encompass 10 percent of the jobs in the Asia Pacific and that's going to grow in the next years to 12.5 percent. Not only is travel and tourism going to create 100 million jobs in the next 10 years, 64 million of them are in this region," she added.Ortiguera said a high concentration of those jobs will be in ASEAN with several trends proving this prospect.Post-pandemic tourism has seen a growing interest in food, heritage, spiritual, and wellness travel, sectors catalyzed by COVID-19, she said, and the last two years were about "switching everything back on" and getting everyone back to work."Even though there's slow recovery in this region, we're going to be the engine for growth in the future," Ortiguera said.She added that governments have focused on sustainability and communities and urged investors to consider communities in their investments.HANOI -- As of Monday noon, Typhoon Yagi and consequent landslides and floods have left 59 people dead and missing in Vietnam's northern region, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said.The natural disasters also injured 247 people, including 157 in Quang Ninh province and 40 in Hai Phong City; sank 25 unmanned vessels, mostly fishing boats; damaged over 113,000 hectares of rice and more than 22,000 hectares of other crops; damaged or swept away 1,500 aquaculture cages; killed 190,000 fowls; and uprooted or damaged nearly 121,700 trees, the ministry said.A steel bridge in Vietnam's northern Phu Tho province collapsed on Monday morning, causing 10 automobiles and two motorbikes to fall into the Red River and leaving 13 people missing, Vietnam News Agency reported.It also reported that 21 people in Cao Bang province were killed and missing by landslides, and 15 people in Lao Cai province faced the same fate.Typhoon Yagi was the strongest storm to hit Vietnam's northern region in the past 30 years, according to the ministry.The two-day China Festival 2024, which concluded in Tokyo on Sunday, garnered widespread attention and participation from people from all walks of life in both China and Japan.The festival has been held at Yoyogi Park for many years. It has become an important platform for Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and cooperation, said Wu Jianghao, Chinese ambassador to Japan.The goal of the festival is to showcase the rich, traditional Chinese culture and the country's achievements, allowing more people to experience and understand contemporary China up close."We are willing to work with various sectors in both countries to use the China Festival as a bridge, encouraging more people — especially the younger generation — to participate in friendly exchanges between China and Japan," Wu said at the opening ceremony of the festival in Tokyo on Saturday."We hope that through the two-day China Festival, more Japanese friends will get to know and understand China, and have the opportunity to visit and experience the real and vibrant China," he added.This year's China Festival marks the largest in its history, featuring a record-breaking nearly 150 booths. In addition, the organizers successfully brought in a greater number of artists from China for stage performances than ever before, according to Yoichiro Aoyagi, a member of Japan's House of Representatives and secretary-general of the festival's executive committee.Japan and China, as neighbors, have now become leading nations in Asia and globally, particularly in the economic sphere, said Aoyagi."Although there are indeed many challenges between Japan and China, I believe it is crucial to maintain dialogue and exchanges between the people of both countries. We play a key role in ensuring these connections continue," he said.Former Japanese prime minister Yasuo Fukuda emphasized that mutual exchanges are crucial for sustaining good relationships between the two countries. It's not only about government-level interactions but also about fostering people-to-people exchanges.He further highlighted that the festival aims to showcase the very best of China, with the hope of encouraging more people from Japan to visit and experience the country firsthand.The China Festival plays a key role in promoting such exchanges. Since its launch in 2017, it has consistently attracted large crowds. Masahiro Komura, the parliamentary vice-minister for foreign affairs, said the event offers the Japanese people a valuable chance to experience Chinese culture, including tourism, the economy, regional interactions, and authentic Chinese cuisine.Voicing hope"I strongly hope that the exchange between the people of both countries will deepen and that mutual interest and understanding will grow even further," he said.At this year's China Festival, 147 Chinese companies participated, nearly three times the number from last year, according to Wang Jiaxun, president of China Enterprises Association in Japan. "Currently, relations between China and Japan are not particularly ideal. Many Japanese citizens hold certain prejudices against China and Chinese people, while Chinese citizens also have some misunderstandings about Japan. These issues arise in part due to distorted media coverage. Events like the China Festival help foster mutual trust and understanding, promoting friendly exchanges between the two countries," said Wang.People from Chinese provinces such as Shandong and Hunan also attended the China Festival 2024 to highlight regional interactions.During the opening ceremony of the Shandong cultural exhibition at the festival, Cheng Shoutian, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee, noted that Shandong and Japan are separated by just a sea and have strong cooperation across various fields.He expressed his hope that the event would provide an opportunity for more people to discover Shandong, establish a closer platform for cultural exchange, and enhance cultural interaction and collaboration between China and Japan.Many people showed up at the festival. Hiroko Wada, a 38-year-old Tokyo resident, stopped by a booth offering panda-related souvenirs."I'm here for a panda-themed event because I'm such a big fan of pandas," said Wada, who also loves Chinese cuisine.Nene, a 22-year-old woman who preferred not to share her last name, gave the festival's game of playing ping-pong with a slipper a try."I'm really interested in Chinese culture. I studied Chinese at university, but speaking it is quite challenging," she said."I'm also excited to enjoy some authentic Chinese flavors. There are so many delicious-looking foods here, and I can't wait to stroll around, eating and drinking along the way," she added.Younger people are gradually taking over Japan-China relations, said Toshiyasu Ogawa, a participant of the Japan-China Friendship Association."Five years ago, people in their 70s and 80s were mostly the ones running the festival. But now, it's people in their 30s and 40s, and I feel hopeful that they are passing Japan-China relations on to the next generation," Ogawa said.As sustainable development is facing headwinds, officials from home and abroad said China-proposed Global Development Initiative has injected new energies to the common progress and high-quality development.They made the comments on Saturday at a dialogue meeting on the GDI held in Xiamen, southeast China's Fujian province, attended by nearly 150 representatives from over 30 countries and international organizations.Stephen Kargbo, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization representative to China, said the role of the GDI in promoting global development has become increasingly important as it emphasizes innovation, inclusiveness and sustainable development.The GDI has helped mobilize resources, establish cooperation mechanisms and advance practical cooperation, he said, adding that great progress made in fields including poverty reduction, food security and health demonstrated China's determination and ability to contribute to global well-being and common prosperity.At the just-concluded 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, China announced it would work with Africa to take 10 partnership actions, and would implement 1,000 "small and beautiful" livelihood projects, which were lauded by Kargbo to be positive and help set a model of GDI cooperation."China has always been the UNIDO's key cooperative partner," Kargbo said, adding that the organization would continue to actively respond to the dialogue mechanisms of GDI.Wilmot Reeves, deputy minister of Ministry of Commerce and Industry in Liberia, hailed the GDI for "providing a powerful framework for countries to achieve the goals of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development" and "contributing to creating a more equitable and prosperous world for all."As a raft of elements such as the pandemic and geopolitical tensions challenged the accomplishment of the sustainable development goals, Reeves highlighted countries needed to strengthen collaboration and establish global partnership."Under the framework of the GDI, we can make efforts to utilize our collective resources and expertise to drive structural and economic transformation, and to achieve more inclusive development," he said.He also called for greater investments in key areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure to promote the GDI to achieve substantial progress."The GDI is a great initiative and charts a new blueprint for global development. It not only attaches importance to development, but also emphasizes balanced and harmonious development among all countries," said Cameroon Minister of Commerce Magloire Mbarga Atangana, calling on more countries to join in the GDI to facilitate the achievement of SDGs."Many countries have joined in the GDI, which fully shows its value," said Serbia's Minister of Economy Adrijana Mesarovic.She hailed cooperation between the two countries based on mutual benefit and respect."Today, Serbia is the main window for promoting Chinese expertise and knowledge in Europe. At the same time, my country is also a main platform for Chinese companies to make inroads into markets such as Europe."Zhao Fengtao, vice-chairman of China International Development Cooperation Agency, called on upgrading development cooperation by accelerating development of new quality productive forces.China last year established a global project pool and raised a special development fund to support the GDI. According to Zhao, to date, the pool includes over 1,000 projects, with projects in progress account for over ＄4 billion.All parties need better cooperation and coordination to combat global climate change in a concrete way, and in this regard, China could help, given its technological advancement and innovative experiences, according to Indonesia International Sustainability Forum.Indonesian President Joko Widodo, senior officials from Indonesia and neighboring countries as well as top executives and philanthropists admitted that achieving net-zero emission not only require collaboration between developed and developing countries, but also between societal groups within a country.Opening the two-day forum on Sep 5, Widodo specially called on developed nations to make investment in developing countries, open widely to them their research and technology, and provide them with quick funding.The IISF was jointly held by the Coordinating Ministry for Investment and Maritime Affairs and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Themed "Towards Sustainable and Inclusive Growth" and meant for the public to learn more about sustainability agendas, the gathering was attended by about 8,000 people from more than 50 countries in Asia and beyond. This number was three times bigger than that in the first IIAS last year. Divided into 10 sessions, around 50 keynote speakers and panelists, including three from China, spoke at the Jakarta Convention Center.Widodo stressed in his speech that issues of climate change can never be fully settled if countries use economic approaches only and do calculations merely for their own interests."Settling those issues needs collaborative approaches and human approach," the president said.Also attending the forum were Luhut B. Pandjaitan, Indonesia's coordinating minister for investment and maritime affairs; Retno L.P. Marsudi, foreign minister; Dato Sri Haji Fadillah bin Haji Yusof, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and minister of energy transition and water transformation; Tan See Leng, Singapore's minister for manpower and second minister for trade and industry; Teo Chee Hean, Singapore's senior minister and coordinating minister for national security; and Peter Thomson, UN secretary-general's special envoy for the ocean.Keynote speakers and panelists elaborated particularly crucial things relevant to carbon emission reduction such as alternative energy resources, technologies and innovation, funding, human capital and public education, and electrical vehicle enterprising.Pandjaitan said each nation has a different starting point as they have different capacity and capabilities. "Therefore, this forum reminds us that collaboration, let me repeat, collaboration is essential to our sustainability agenda," the minister said in his keynote speech.Tan said Indonesia-Singapore provides a good example of cooperation, saying that Indonesia's revenue from its low-carbon electricity that would be exported to the island city-state could also be used to catalyze more renewable energy projects in Southeast Asia's largest economy, thus helping accelerate its decarbonization journey.Singapore had earlier announced that it would work toward imports of four gigawatts of low-carbon electricity from its neighbors by 2030, and now the country is seeking to increase that amount to around six gigawatts by 2035.Tan said that over the past five years five companies, namely Pacific Medco Solar Energy, Adaro Solar International, EDP Renewables APAC, Vanda RE, and Keppel Energy had been conducting marine surveys and feasibility studies so as to determine the commercial and technical conditions and subsequently make their projects a success. Indonesia's solar power exports to Singapore was expected to start by 2028, Indonesian officials said.Dato Sri Haji Fadillah bin Haji Yusof reminded forum participants that every action by respective country in Southeast Asia can significantly impact their neighbors. As such, regional collaboration and cooperation in the area of energy transition is crucial, he said. He pointed to ASEAN plan of action for energy cooperation.ASEAN countries signed ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation 2016-25, which is one of the series of policy documents first signed in 2019 and which aims to promote multilateral energy cooperation and integration to attain the goals of the ASEAN Economic Community.Dato said that solar energy is a cornerstone of Malaysia's renewable energy strategy that would drive the adoption of solar technology for large-scale solar farms to rooftop installations. Hydro power remains a pivotal component of Malaysia's renewable energy scheme, he said.Ma Jun, an environmentalist and director of the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs in Beijing, explained about China's ambitious development of human capital for pollution monitoring in the country."Ten years ago China tapped into the online monitoring technology to become the first in the world to require major air polluters to report to the public of their automatic monitoring every hour and tap into the data," Ma told forum participants.Speaking on the sidelines of the forum discussions, Ma explained how solar power and wind power are now being developed in a very rapid speed in China and that they are put into different use such as desalination of sea water on coastal regions, particularly in the northern part of China."So China is no longer just a manufacturer, it's also an innovator," Ma said.Under China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, ASEAN countries, including archipelagic Indonesia, could make use of China's technologies for producing potable water, Ma said.Han Han, founder and president at China Blue Sustainability Institute, shared in the forum panel discussion about what China can learn from neighboring countries like Indonesia, namely the very local community-based management network for the solution of local problems.Jamal Karsli, a German politician from the Green Party, said women could give critical support to carbon emission reduction efforts as women are found everywhere, at home and in various other places where energy is used for cooking and washing and for doing other kinds of work."In Germany people talk a lot about environment, the Green Party also talks a lot about it. But, the industries do other things," he told this correspondent on the sidelines of the sustainability forum.Shinta Widjaja Kamdani, vice-chairwoman of KADIN, said that green financing remains a global challenge as developing countries, except China, need to invest around $2.4 trillion annually, combined, for climate action up to 2030.Of the $2.4 trillion, 40 percent is designated to come from external parties, and so far very small portion of the external sources has been received by developing countries, Kamdani told this correspondent.She said the IISF can help strengthen Indonesia's strategic positioning as a global hub for collaboration that aims to accelerate sustainability growth.The two-day gathering saw the signing of 14 Memoranda of Understanding on critical areas such as cross-border electricity interconnection, carbon capture, acceleration of energy transition, and green transition in transportation.The third IISF is scheduled to be held in Bali next year.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.The two-day China Festival 2024 has drawn attention at Yoyogi Park in Tokyo on Sept 7-8, garnering widespread participation from people of all walks of life in both China and Japan.Video by Jiang Xueqing in Tokyo / China DailyState Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co sent two engineers to Malaysia to support the construction of a seawater desalination plant in late August. The facility, expected to be operational by mid-September, will produce up to 500 tons of fresh water daily, which can meet the demand of around 3,000 residents.The project comes in response to Malaysia's increasing demand for freshwater, driven by rapid urbanization and industrial growth. Coastal regions have been particularly impacted, facing significant water shortages.State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co's desalination system uses energy-efficient technology to convert seawater into fresh water. The method is highly effective in filtering out impurities while significantly reducing energy consumption compared to traditional techniques."Our project team spent over 20 days customizing the desalination plan for this project. The equipment offers high resource conversion efficiency and low operating costs," Zhu Jiaqi, project engineer and director of the seawater desalination division at Jiangsu Fenghai New Energy Seawater Desalination Development Co Ltd said.The technology has already been successfully applied in similar projects in Brazil and Oman.Moving forward, State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co plans to deepen its cooperation with Malaysian companies, focusing on renewable energy and water management initiatives aimed at fostering sustainable development.Zhu Sidi contributed to this story.BEIJING -- Minister for Foreign Affairs of Singapore Vivian Balakrishnan will visit China from September 8 to 9, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning announced on Saturday.Balakrishnan's visit is at the invitation of Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and foreign minister, Mao added.Asian culture experts called for regional cooperation to protect cultural heritage and uncover the contemporary values of ancient civilizations at a panel discussion on "Transnational Cooperation for the Conservation of Shared Cultural Landscapes in Asia", highlighting shared cultural connections across the region.The discussions were held on the sidelines of the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Selangor, Malaysia, on Thursday.Speaking about the rich connotations of cultural heritage and its multifaceted value, Chin Yew Sin, president of the Oriental Culture Research Centre, said that "comprehending our cultural heritage can give us a sense of personal identity", while economically, a rich cultural heritage can drive development, such as through the promotion of cultural tourism.Given the benefits and seeing cultural heritage as a shared asset of Asian nations, he said countries should work together to promote conservation. He suggested regular meetings to share experience, and called on more advanced countries to support less developed nations in the region with financial and technical aid.Ivan Henares, chairperson of the Southeast Asian Cultural Heritage Alliance, agreed, saying there should be a "comparative analysis of heritage laws and policies in Southeast Asia". Such an initiative can help facilitate information sharing and promote best practices in the region.He highlighted the region's untapped potential for shared cultural heritage, noting that 10 of the 11 nations in Southeast Asia have coastlines, offering an opportunity to explore their common maritime heritage.Laurence Loh, director of Think City — a Malaysia-based organization known for its urban regeneration programs — broadened the discussion of the cultural connections of the significant Chinese diaspora between the port city of Quanzhou in China's Fujian province, which was the starting point of the ancient Maritime Silk Road, and Malaysia's Melaka and George Town, Penang — two historical places along the Strait of Malacca.Loh, also a former president of Badan Warisan Malaysia (The Heritage of Malaysia Trust), cited the restoration of the Clan Jetties in Malaysia as an example of transnational heritage protection.Su Junjie, director of the Yunnan Provincial Research Base of Intangible Cultural Heritage, delved into cultural landscapes within the scope of cultural heritage which, in his view, demonstrate the interaction between nature and people.Su said the Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site last year, is an example of this harmonious coexistence.Daisy Wang Yiyou, deputy director of Hong Kong Palace Museum, shared the insights from her field, emphasizing the importance of training the next generation of experts in response to the current talent gap. Noting that transnational collaboration is "imperative", she called for closer collaboration among various sectors. "Only when we can work together, we can really make real and impactful changes."Zhang Zhenguang, managing director of China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd — a subsidiary of the China State Construction Engineering Corporation — emphasized that preserving cultural heritage is also a shared responsibility of the corporate sector, especially for a Fortune Global 500 company like the CSCEC, which has offices in more than 130 countries and regions.Editor's note: On Thursday, China Daily and newspaper alliance Asia News Network held the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Selangor, Malaysia. Co-organized by think tank KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific, nearly 200 government officials, senior executives, cultural leaders, researchers and media representatives from across Asia attended the forum, which was themed "Shared Heritage, Shared Future", to discuss ways to jointly preserve cultural heritage and drive sustainable development in the region. Here are highlights of the forum.Asian media 'an important force' in promoting civilizationChina Daily's publisher and editor-in-chief said Asian media members are an important force for promoting the progress of civilization in the region, and serve as a crucial bridge in cultural exchanges.Qu Yingpu made the remarks at the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Malaysia on Thursday.Qu called on the industry to take responsibility for protecting cultural heritage and to collaborate in bringing down barriers for better collective progress."We should encourage more people to become involved in the protection of our cultural heritage. We should make our own contribution to the brilliance of Asian civilization in a new era," Qu said.In his welcoming speech to the forum, Qu highlighted the importance of appreciating and preserving cultural and natural treasures in Asia, a cradle of human civilization that is home to three ancient civilizations — Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and China — and has been the birthplace of numerous vital achievements in human history.He called for the revitalization and transformation of Asian civilization to infuse it with new vitality and radiance, saying the only way to preserve culture is to "bring it to life", enabling it to enter daily lives.The media leader suggested using new technology such as virtual reality, the metaverse, and artificial intelligence, to transcend the barriers of time and space, allowing people to "experience cultural heritage up close without the risk of harming it". Qu also proposed promoting research and interpretation of the traditional cultures of Asian countries."As Asian media, we should work together to break down cultural barriers, and promote the common progress of Asian civilizations through exchange and mutual learning," he said.In 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the Global Civilization Initiative, guiding cultural exchanges, mutual learning, and the prosperous development of Asian civilizations. Citing Xi's key remarks, Qu emphasized that the best way to protect a civilization is to "create a modern civilization", and called on the media industry to continue expanding international cultural and humanitarian exchange and cooperation, to provide new support to regional progress.This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Asia News Network. As the leader of China Daily, a member of the media alliance, Qu urged his fellow colleagues to strive for a more equitable international communication order and to become "supervisors of Asia's heritage protection"."We should help establish a new Asian model for the development of cultural heritage and for international cooperation. In this way, we can jointly contribute to fostering a community with a shared future for both Asia and all humanity," Qu said."Let's harness the fundamental, profound, and enduring cultural forces of Asia for the development of the region and the building of an Asian community with a shared future," he added.The Tourism Authority of Thailand and the Association of Thai Travel Agents led 60 local tourism enterprises to promote what the country has to offer at a road show in Beijing on Tuesday.The event showcased new products and services from Thai travel agencies, scenic spots and transport providers to boost bilateral tourism. More than 500 people, including Chinese travel players, joined the event.Experts from the United States, China, Japan, and South Korea mostly agreed that a new Cold War in Northeast Asia can be avoided, though there is still a risk, as they discussed peace-building at a conference in Tokyo.The Asia Peace Conference 2024, which closed in Tokyo on Wednesday, aimed to explore what kind of efforts are needed to ensure peace in Northeast Asia, said Yasushi Kudo, president of the Genron NPO, the host organization of the conference.Daniel Russel, former US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said people should be careful about labeling the current situation as a "Cold War" because it "creates a mindset that could drive policies and would actually escalate risk."There is a substantial difference nowadays from the Soviet-era Cold War situation, given the economic interdependence and the lack of Cold War-style proxy wars. In addition, international and regional frameworks have been established, and technology has really changed the game, Russel noted."Projecting the Cold War framework onto today's geopolitical landscape clouds our vision and can create self-fulfilling prophecies. So I think it's a mistake to think in Cold War terms but at the same time, there's a lot we can learn from the Cold War," he said."Adaptation of Cold War policies, not replication of Cold War policies, can be helpful in preventing a new Cold War and promoting a more secure and cooperative region," he said.Ouyang Wei, deputy director of the Academic Committee at Grandview Institution, said: "Following the old way of thinking is not good for the current situation. We should avoid using the definition to shape the new Cold War. It's very dangerous to shape two blocs (that) confront (each other) in Northeast Asia."Ouyang warned that maybe someone wants to use this concept to shape the two blocs, which is not good for the world.A new Cold War would make most countries suffer, said Fan Gaoyue, retired senior colonel and former chief specialist at the PLA Academy of Military Science.Globalization stressedHe emphasized that globalization has made all countries dependent on each other economically to a certain extent. Their economic interests are mutually interconnected, which makes it difficult for them to pick sides."A new Cold War in Northeast Asia can be avoided, though there is such a risk," said Fan, who is now a guest professor at Sichuan University.To avert a new Cold War, Northeast Asian countries should try what they can to defuse hostilities through dialogue and military exchanges, deepen mutual understanding and trust-building through people-to-people exchanges, and prevent crises and friction from escalating into conflicts and confrontation, through communication channels, he said.Jia Qingguo, a professor and former dean of the School of International Studies at Peking University, said that the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union had three characteristics — ideological competition, military confrontation on a global basis, and economic separation."Judging by those three criteria, we are not quite at a Cold War yet," said Jia.However, he noted that people on both sides are thinking in terms of a worst-case scenario approach. Each side plans for the worst possible situations and takes measures in that direction, and that prompts the other side to do the same."We need to change this worst-case scenario approach. We need to give the benefit of the doubt to the other side," said Jia.Besides, other countries also have a role in shaping the relationship. Probably, they need to make sure that they do not take sides to fuel the conflict, he said.Christopher Johnstone, senior adviser and Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the reality of economic interdependence is such that the US is not going to decouple from China, and the US has no ability to ask its close allies to decouple, either."We are not in a new Cold War. It's not a bipolar system," said Johnstone."Where we are really heading for is a world of competing coalitions and shifting coalitions of countries that align on issues and move apart on other issues," said Johnstone.Asian countries should make full use of the power of culture and civilization to support regional unity, openness and progress for a shared future, a forum in Malaysia heard on Thursday."We should help establish a new Asian model for the development of cultural heritage and for international cooperation," said Qu Yingpu, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily, at the Forum on Cultural Heritage Conservation in Selangor, Malaysia."In this way, regional countries can jointly contribute to fostering a community with a shared future for both Asia and all humanity," Qu said.Themed "Shared Heritage, Shared Future", the forum was jointly organized by China Daily, newspaper alliance Asia News Network and the KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific, a think tank."We have to work together to promote the exchange and mutual learning of Asian cultural heritage," said Christina Yeo Ken Yin, undersecretary of the International Relations Division in Culture at Malaysia's Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture.In addition to cooperation programs in cultural heritage with countries such as China, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore and Indonesia, Yeo said Malaysia is preparing to join the Alliance for Cultural Heritage in Asia — an intergovernmental platform initiated by China to promote regional cooperation in preserving regional cultural heritage."Civilization exchanges and mutual learning form an important drive for human progress and global peace and development," said Chang Shan, counselor of the cultural affairs department of the Chinese embassy in Malaysia.With Asia being an important cradle of human civilization, China and countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are linked by mountains and rivers and share historical bonds, which have led to close people-to-people exchanges, said Chang.Noting that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Malaysia, Chang said the two countries' cooperation in cultural heritage protection will continue to play an important role in bilateral exchanges.Mahfuz Anam, chairman of Asia News Network and editor and publisher of Bangladesh's The Daily Star, said cultures speak louder than languages and act as effective communicators among different people.He urged people, particularly journalists, to devote more energy to learning and comprehending different cultural heritages to reduce misunderstandings in a world with more conflicts and uncertainties.Ronald Gan, president of Persatuan Peranakan Baba Nyonya Malaysia, said the Baba and Nyonya community is a typical example of cultural exchanges between China and Malaysia, with blended elements in cuisine, attire and architecture."We are, after all, the descendants of the wise Chinese who migrated to Nanyang with the values of inclusiveness and mutual benefit," said Gan, who has been organizing a Wangchuan ceremony in Melaka.The ceremony, jointly nominated by China and Malaysia, was added to the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list in 2020.As climate change can affect cultural heritage sites, Michael Yeoh, president of KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific, said countries in the region should enhance public, private and people partnerships to protect the environment.Upholding the 5Ps — planet, people, prosperity, partnership and peace — will ensure a more sustainable future, said Yeoh.A panel discussion on "Transnational Cooperation for the Conservation of Shared Cultural Landscapes in Asia" was also held during the forum, with experts from across the region exchanging views on future strategies for preserving cultural heritage and landscapes.VLADIVOSTOK -- Malaysia is seeking to join BRICS for strengthening cooperation with its member countries and promoting fair global trade, said Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Thursday.Joining BRICS will boost Malaysia's trade relations and help prevent financial monopolies worldwide, Anwar said at the 9th Eastern Economic Forum, held in Russia's Far East city of Vladivostok from Tuesday to Friday.BRICS, an acronym for an emerging-market cooperative mechanism, originally included Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. In January, BRICS expanded its membership with the inclusion of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Ethiopia.Indonesia's drive to diversify export markets is reaching a new path with participants in this week's second Indonesia-Africa Forum seeking closer economic partnerships between Southeast Asia's largest economy and the world's second-most populous continent. Energy, food and healthcare sectors were the main sectors discussed in the three-day forum from Sep 2-4. Leading officials from Indonesia and 54 African countries as well as from Timor Leste convened in the archipelago's most popular tourist island of Bali to discuss ways of strengthening economic diplomacy between Indonesia and African countries and boosting trade and investment.Among them were Liberia President Joseph Nyuma Boakai, Rwanda President Paul Kagame, Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo, and Zimbabwe Vice-President Kembo Dugish Campbell Muleya Mohadi. Joining them was Timor Leste Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao, along with ministers, entrepreneurs and scholars. The meeting went together with High Level Forum on Multi Stakeholders Partnership. Indonesian President Joko Widodo opened the forum on Monday in the presence of president-elect Prabowo Subianto, who will be sworn in next month.Widodo said that the Indonesia-Africa Forum and the High Level Forum on Multi Stakeholders Partnership were held to materialize the commitment made by participating countries in the 1955 Asia-Africa Conference in Bandung, Indonesia. Indonesia-Africa partnership had so far seen a rapid increase in trade volumes between the two sides. The amount is six times bigger than that reached in 2018, the first Indonesia-Africa Forum, also held in Bali, the president said. "Even, Indonesia-Africa Forum this year has recorded businesses agreements that reached a total of $3.5 billion," Widodo said. The amount is six times bigger than that reached in 2018, when the first Indonesia-Africa Forum was held, also in Bali. Along with Eastern Europe, Central Asia, South Asia and Latin America, Africa has so far been a "non-traditional" market of resource-rich Indonesia, whose export products have mainly gone to ASEAN, China and the United States. Indonesia exports to Africa palm oil, paper, noddle, biscuit, pharmaceutical products, beauty items. Tire, coffee and furniture are among the country's potential products for the African market. Africa exports to Indonesia cows, soybean, crude oil and iron, and potential products for the Indonesian market include critical minerals such as cobalt, lithium, and steel. In the Bali forum, Indonesia's state oil and gas firm PT Pertamina, which has had operations in the upstream sector in Algeria, Gabon, Nigeria, Angola, Namibia and Tanzania over the past decade, reached new agreements for its operation expansion in Africa. Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, executive director of Next Policy and an international economics lecturer at the University of Indonesia, said Africa is a potential market for Indonesian products, though presently, Africa is not as big as the Asian market.Historically, Indonesia and Africa have been close to each other, which could support Indonesia opening manufacturing operations in the continent so as to reduce logistic costs, Hastiadi told this correspondent. He said Indonesia could also follow the routes taken by China, which has had an even stronger presence in Africa. "We just go where China goes. This is because the countries where China does business are the places that have larger economic potentials," Hastiadi said. Richard Mshomba, a Tanzania-born economics professor at La Salle University in Philadelphia in the United States, said via email that the Indonesia-Africa Forum in Bali can create diplomatic space for increased economic cooperation. He said in general Indonesia is an insignificant trade partner for Africa, although that varies by country. For the 2018-22 period, Sub-Saharan African exports to Indonesia were only 1.2 percent of its total exports. Its imports from Indonesia were even less, only 09 percent of its total imports.Yet, "Indonesia should not approach African countries as if it was trying to compete with China," said Mshomba, who provided a systematic study of Africa in relation to the World Trade Organization.Indonesia can try to find opportunities to invest in mining and energy as it has done in Kenya and Tanzania, and can also take advantage of African countries having easier access to the EU and the US markets, Mshomba said. Muhammad Habib Abiyan Dzakwan, a researcher at the department of international relations of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, said Indonesia should not ostensibly believe that meetings like the Indonesia-Africa Forum can achieve two goals on one strike: generating concrete economic benefits and excercising leadership on the global stage. "Adequate resources and public awareness are crucial. Unfortunately, African countries are yet to enjoy these privileges from Indonesia. Not only did the country spend less than 1 percent of its gross domestic product on foreign policy, but limited amount is also concentrated on management support and presence at various multilateral platforms," Dzakwan said in an op-ed article in the Sept 4, 2024, issue of The Jakarta Post. Building more footprints in Africa matters as long as rational economic calculation and analyses precede and complement the decision, not merely diplomatic interests, Dzakwan told this correspondent.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily. The King of Thailand has endorsed new cabinet lead by the Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. There are 12 new faces in her collation government, according to the Royal Gazette announcement on Wednesday.The 35-member list includes: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Phumtham Wechayachai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport Suriya Juengrungruangkit, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Anutin Charnvirakul.Pichai Naripthaphan, former energy minister and also adviser of Paetongtarn's Pheu Thai Party, is now the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. The party remains dominant force in the new cabinet, retaining Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa.The ruling Pheu Thai Party leader Paetongtarn was elected as the 31st Prime Minister of Thailand last month.

More than 500 participants from over 90 official delegations have confirmed their attendance at the 11th Beijing Xiangshan Forum scheduled for Sept 12-14 as of Tuesday, according to the organizer of the forum.Wu Jiangang, a member of the preparatory work committee for the forum, said during a press briefing on Wednesday that more than 30 defense ministers and chiefs of defense force are among the participants.More than 200 experts from home and abroad will also participate in the event, Wu noted.Themed "Promoting Peace for a Shared Future," this year's forum consists of four plenary sessions, eight special sessions, as well as other feature activities.While continuing to provide an equal dialogue and collective voice platform for developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, the forum further expands the participation of developed countries such as European countries and the United States, as well as major emerging countries, Wu said, noting that this concerted effort will facilitate both South-South cooperation and North-South cooperation.Initiated in 2006, the Beijing Xiangshan Forum is a high-level security and defense forum in Asia-Pacific with significant international influence.BANGKOK --Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has endorsed members of a new cabinet under the leadership of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, a royal command said on Wednesday.According to the official Royal Gazette, the king appointed 35 cabinet ministers as selected by Paetongtarn, including six deputy prime ministers and other ministers, after her endorsement as the new prime minister of the Southeast Asian country last month.The ruling Pheu Thai Party holds the largest share of 17 seats in the cabinet, with most of the appointees being existing ministers and deputy ministers who served under the previous Srettha Thavisin administration.Pichai Chunhavajira retains his post as finance minister and Maris Sangiampongsa as foreign minister, while Phumtham Wechayachai is named defense minister and has been replaced as commerce minister by Pichai Naripthaphan.Core partners in the Pheu Thai-led coalition, including the Bhumjaithai Party and Ruam Thai Sang Chart Party, command the remaining 19 portfolios.The new cabinet is scheduled to take an oath of allegiance before the king on Friday, paving the way for its policy statement address to the parliament before officially assuming office.Paetongtarn said earlier that the new cabinet should continue the unfinished initiatives from Srettha's administration, including her party's flagship policy, the digital wallet cash handout scheme, which will move forward with some adjustments.The 38-year-old Pheu Thai Party leader and the daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was elected Thailand's youngest and second female premier after winning a parliamentary vote in August.Her appointment came after the sudden dismissal of Srettha by the constitutional court for breaching ethical standards under the country's constitution when appointing a cabinet minister earlier this year.Japanese citizens are voicing strong objections to the government's attempts to amend the nation's pacifist Constitution and rapidly expand the military.Naohiko Hasegawa, a Tokyo-based lawyer, said he is absolutely against the revision of Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan, which renounces war.However, recently, due to the significant influence of the media, there are many who intentionally use the situation with China or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a basis to advocate for constitutional revision, he said.Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, agreed on Monday it will seek to specifically mention the name of the Self-Defense Forces in a revised Constitution. This decision outlines key proposed changes as the party prepares for an upcoming election to select its new leader. The LDP plans to retain the wording of the war-renouncing Article 9 while adding a new section to explain the Self-Defense Forces, Kyodo News reported.The LDP's panel on constitutional reform made this decision, which will have a bearing on whoever wins the party leadership election on Sept 27. In this race, candidates are expected to clearly state their positions on revising the Constitution, which has been in force since 1947, according to the Japanese news agency.Government officials claim that changes in the security environment necessitate military expansions, but what they are proposing, including acquiring the capability to strike enemy bases, is extremely dangerous from the perspective of neighboring countries, said Kohei Aoyama, 33, a member of the Democratic Youth League of Japan.Currently, many conservative members of the LDP, particularly those in the faction formerly led by late prime minister Shinzo Abe, support such an amendment, and winning their support is crucial for any candidate aspiring for the LDP presidency. As a result, candidates tend to emphasize the importance of amending Article 9 to gain the support of these members.However, the public is not particularly keen on this issue, instead urging the government to focus on economic measures, said Shigeaki Koga, a policy analyst and a former official of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.Low approvalOpinion polls conducted by Japanese public broadcaster NHK and major newspapers show that the percentage of Japanese citizens who favor revision of the Constitution is low."The public is more concerned about improving their livelihoods and social security than about constitutional revision. Yet, the LDP is pushing for this because of its inherently conservative nature, which is a big problem," said Takakage Fujita, president of the Alliance to Stop the Impermissible Acts of Slush Fund and Tax Evasion by the LDP.Igarashi Hajime, a 66-year-old resident of Tokyo, is firmly against revising the Constitution."Thanks to Article 9, Japan has managed to stay out of wars alongside the United States, even when pressured by the US," Hajime said during a rally in Tokyo last week to oppose the proposed constitutional changes.Toshihiro Inoue, a special committee member of the Japan Congress against A- and H-Bombs, believes that Japan cannot truly protect its people by strengthening its military power. Instead, he argues that Japan should focus on fostering friendship and goodwill with its neighboring countries, guided by the principles of the Constitution.Keisuke Okamoto, a 49-year-old resident of Yokohama, stressed that war could lead to the extinction of humanity. Speaking on behalf of many who oppose Japan's massive military buildup, he said, "The Constitution was founded on the principle of peace, shaped by reflections on the postwar era, and we are committed to protecting it."jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cn The International Atomic Energy Agency's senior communication official hailed the "significant progress" China has made in nuclear development and said the IAEA looks forward to deepening the collaboration with the country, as this year marks the 40th anniversary of China's accession to the international organization.Sophie Boutaud de la Combe, director of the Office of Public Information and Communication of IAEA, made the remarks during an international media tour organized by the China Atomic Energy Authority's news office, themed Atoms for Better Home.She said the IAEA highly values its partnership with CAEA and looks forward to deepening its collaboration and exploring future directions together."Through its extraordinary economic growth and advance in knowledge, technology and expertise, China has become a key supporter of the agency financially, politically and through our collaborations," said the official.China's decades of experience is a solid foundation to build on for the agency and for its other member states, she said, while expressing thanks for Chinese experts who share their knowledge to other countries through IAEA capacity-building programs.The multifaceted cooperation between the IAEA and China covers areas such as nuclear energy, nuclear safety and security, nuclear technology applications and nonproliferation, said the official, adding that many important projects promoted by CAEA and IAEA have achieved remarkable results."These achievements are not only crucial for China's development, but also have far-reaching impact on the peaceful use of nuclear energy globally," the IAEA official added."Therefore, I look forward to learning more about China's progress in those areas and exploring how to leverage and promote those successful experiences through the partnership with CAEA news center," she said.During her visit, the IAEA official also toured the mainland's first nuclear power site at Qinshan in East China, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in South China and two IAEA collaboration centers at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Sun Yat-sen University respectively, to learn about China's innovations in the nuclear sector.Sophie Boutaud de la Combe said China's nuclear development is avoiding "tons of carbon emissions and air pollution" and is creating a conducive environmental- and biodiversity-friendly source of energy for the people of China and also for industrial development.In addition, she praised China's efforts to help other countries build their own nuclear industry safely and achieve their own energy goals."This is showing the world that it's possible to build nuclear power plants quickly and with integrated cost," said the official.CANBERRA -- Australians have been told to prepare for possible cyclones, storms, fires and flooding during the upcoming high-risk weather season.Minister for Emergency Management Jenny McAllister on Tuesday said the federal government is preparing for the worst-case disaster scenarios as the nation heads into warmer months of the year.She said Australian people need to be thinking about a range of perils in the high-risk weather season, which traditionally runs from October through April."Fire is one of them. But we are, of course, thinking about the cyclone season and we're thinking about the risk of severe storms like some of the rain and flooding that we've seen in recent days," McAllister told Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio."All of the information in front of us tells us we can expect severe weather to become more frequent and more intense in the coming years as a consequence of a changing climate. And so we do need to start preparing ourselves for that reality as a community."Over 100,000 properties lost electricity as destructive winds and heavy rainfall hit Australia's southeast in late August and early September.Two people were killed by falling trees, one each in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, and towns were evacuated in the island state of Tasmania due to major flooding.McAllister said on Tuesday that staff members from the National Situation Room -- the government's crisis management and coordination facility -- are currently engaged in briefings with authorities from states and territories in advance of the high-risk season.The federal government will convene the second annual National Preparedness Summit in Canberra on Sept 18 to 19 where government, industry and non-government organizations will be brought together to better prepare for disaster scenarios.NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday embarked on a three-day official visit to Brunei Darussalam and Singapore.Modi's Brunei visit will be the first-ever bilateral visit by an Indian premier. The visit also assumed significance as this year marked the 40 years of diplomatic ties between the two nations.In the second leg of his visit, Modi will travel to Singapore which is scheduled for Sept 4 to 5.In his departure statement, Modi said the focus of his twin visits would be on further deepening India's ties with the two countries."India-Brunei Darussalam diplomatic ties complete 40 glorious years. I look forward to meeting His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah," he stated in a written statement."In Singapore, I will hold talks with President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong. We are eager to further cement ties in key sectors," he further added.The constructive collaboration among major powers to end World War II serves as a valuable example for building a stable and secure world in the future, a Russian scholar said on Sept 2."Despite significant political and ideological differences, the allied powers managed to cooperate effectively in the face of a global threat," said Alexander Lukin, professor of international relations at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow. The allied powers refer primarily to the United States, the United Kingdom, China and the Soviet Union.Lukin was speaking at a roundtable discussion "The End of World War II in the Pacific: Its Consequences and Legacy" held by the Russian Consulate General in Hong Kong.Noting this is the first time that the consulate held a discussion on the topic of WWII, Russia's Consul-General in Hong Kong, Anatoly Kargapolov, said with the growing influence of Asia, the interest in the history of the Far East, including WWII, has received more attention in Russia."This year marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Russia and China," said Kargapolov. "Many experts in Russia continue to research the topic of the Soviet Manchurian Strategic Offensive operation which resulted in the liberation of Northeast China from the Japanese."Kargapolov said the consulate also specifically chose the topic after seeing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region paying greater attention to this period in history, with the Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence to be opened on Sept 4."It is found that Russian emigrants and Soviet sailors had been killed or injured during an attack on (Hong Kong) by the Japanese military in 1941," said Kargapolov.After reviewing the Soviet Union's involvement in China, Japan and the Korean Peninsula during WWII, Lukin, the Russian scholar, said the Soviet Union played a pivotal role in ending WWII in the Pacific and shaping the postwar landscape of the region.Michael Share, visiting professor at the Department of History at the Hong Kong Baptist University, said that compared to the discussions on WWII in Europe, its study in Asia has been neglected.Share pointed out that WWII caused huge damage and destruction across Asia with millions dead and infrastructure destroyed.Hung Wing Lok, lecturer of social science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, said WWII affected Hong Kong in different dimensions, ranging from its population and housing to industries and human capital."The population in Hong Kong was about 1.6 million at that time and about 600,000 were coming from the Chinese mainland during the war," said Hung.In December 1941, Japan attacked Hong Kong and conquered the city, then a British colony, after just 18 days, to usher in "three years and eight months of darkness" under Japanese occupation.Edmund Sheng Li, distinguished professor of Shandong University's Qingdao campus, said the Soviet Union played a decisive role both in the war theaters in Europe and in the Far East during WWII, while also contributing to the founding of the Communist Party of China, the formation of the anti-Japanese National United Front in China and the founding of the People's Republic of China.Noting the Soviet Union was the first to recognize the PRC and establish diplomatic relations in 1949, Sheng said it provided China with considerable support.Sheng noted the contributions of the Soviet Union to China and the world during and after WWII embody the spirit of concerted efforts, unity and mutual assistance."Today, we pledge to uphold the hard-won victory (in WW II), and deepen the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Russia for our mutual benefit," said Sheng.A photo exhibition dedicated to the liberation of northern and eastern China in WW II was also held alongside the roundtable discussion with photos and documents provided by the embassy of Russia in Beijing.Officials and experts from China and Indonesia called on further shoring up media cooperation to promote mutual trust and understanding and counter misinformation and disinformation, on Monday.They made the remarks at the second China-Indonesia Media Forum held in Beijing, highlighting the media's positive role in building a community with a shared future for China and Indonesia.Djauhari Oratmangun, Indonesian ambassador to China, expressed hope for the media to covey accurate and informative reports to promote relations between the two countries to scale new heights.Indonesia and China enjoy close and strong ties ranging from politics, economy, trade, culture and people-to-people exchanges, the ambassador said.He said the two nations need to keep seeking new breakthroughs to grow their ties, while hoping media will continue to advance China-Indonesia relations to develop along an upward trajectory.Irfan Junaidi, editor-in-chief of Indonesian National News Agency Antara, said media diplomacy helps to bridge cultural and political gaps by providing audiences with insights into each other's socio-economic and cultural contexts.Also, media in both countries contributes to shaping public perception and helps counteract stereotypes and misinformation that may arise from less comprehensive sources, he said.China and Indonesia can enhance media cooperation through joint projects and partnerships, such as co-produced documentaries, joint news reporting ventures, and journalist exchanges, he added.Fan Daqi, vice-president of Academy of Contemporary China and World Studies, said the deepening cooperation between Chinese and Indonesian media in recent years has drawn the hearts of the people in both countries closer.It's imperative for media outlets in the region to join hands to present real and objective information to peoples especially when certain countries attempted to concoct false narratives to hinder cooperation between China and other countries in the region, Fan added.SYDNEY - A major flood warning was issued on Monday in the Australian island state of Tasmania, with people living near major rivers told to evacuate immediately.Residents near the Derwent and Styx rivers in Tasmania's southeast were on Monday morning advised to leave immediately.TasAlert, the state's emergency warning system, said that the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has issued a major flood warning for the Derwent River, with properties expected to be isolated or inundated by floodwaters by Monday afternoon."Floodwaters are a threat to safety," the TasAlert warning said. "Property, livestock, equipment, and crops are likely to be threatened by floodwaters."It comes 24 hours after residents were told to prepare to evacuate amid severe weather conditions that have left much of the state without power.Mick Lowe, executive director of the State Emergency Service (SES), told Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television that approximately half of the residents in the flood zone had evacuated within two hours of the alert being issued."We continue to encourage people to leave the area. Houses will become inundated and there are going to be a lot of houses in those rural communities that are going to become isolated over the next 24 to 40 hours," he said.He said that the SES received over 300 calls for help in the 24 hours to Monday morning as strong winds caused widespread damage.Winds exceeding 150 km per hour were recorded in the island state on Sunday night.As of Monday morning, more than 10,000 properties were affected by power outages across the state.The airport in Launceston, Tasmania's second-biggest city, was relying on generators for electricity on Monday morning but was still operating flights despite the strong winds.Conditions in Tasmania are forecast to ease by Tuesday but the SES has urged people to remain cautious.JAKARTA - The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, locally known as Whoosh, has served 4.2 million passengers within the 10 months from its inauguration in October 2023 to July 2024, according to PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC) President Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi on Sunday.The company also noted an increase in the average daily passenger count from 9,000 to 18,000 on weekdays, and between 22,000 to 24,000 on weekends."At the beginning of its operation, Whoosh had only 14 trips per day, which has now increased to 48 trips since May 2024," said Dwiyana, adding that the company aims to reach 62 trips per day by 2025.In addition to being a modern and eco-friendly mass transit solution, Whoosh, with its average speed of 350 km/h, has cut down the travel time between Jakarta and Bandung from over three hours to around 40 minutes.A memorial service was held in Tokyo on Sunday, marking the 101st anniversary of Chinese victims who were killed following the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan.During that tragic event over 100 years ago, more than 700 Chinese people in Japan survived the earthquake, only to meet their deaths in a bloody massacre perpetrated by the Japanese military, police and militaristic thugs. Some extremists, influenced by militaristic ideology and strong xenophobic sentiments, deliberately fabricated excuses to carry out a massacre of innocent Chinese people.Over the past 11 years, family members of the victims have been working tirelessly between China and Japan to seek justice. They have organized and participated in more than 40 meetings and attended more than 20 memorial services at the massacre sites in Japan. They have repeatedly submitted petitions and demands to the Japanese government to express their strong determination and deep dissatisfaction."We, the families, persist because we have yet to receive a clear apology, and this matter remains unresolved," said Zhou Songquan, a representative of the families of Chinese victims.On behalf of the victims' families, Zhou extended their gratitude to the conscientious Japanese people from all walks of life, who have spent years dedicating tremendous efforts to comfort the souls of the victims and are committed to uncovering the truth and pursuing justice."By holding such memorial events, we hope to revisit that period of history and help more people understand and recognize the truth of the tragedy. Our purpose is not to perpetuate hatred, but to prevent the recurrence of such tragedies and to better create the future," said Zhou."We hope that the Japanese government can truly take up its political and moral responsibilities, seriously address and properly handle the relevant historical issues, and demonstrate its commitment to reflecting on history through concrete actions," he said.Liu Sipan, counselor of the political division at the Chinese embassy in Japan, noted that the immediate cause of the massacre was the malicious spread of rumors and the incitement of social panic, but the root cause lay in Japan's path towards militarism at the time, where extreme nationalism, xenophobia and anti-foreign sentiments prevailed.This also set the stage for Japan's subsequent aggressive wars of invasion, which inflicted immense suffering on China and other Asian countries, she added."It is regrettable that, more than 100 years later, this tragic memory is fading in Japanese society. The Japanese government's stance on historical issues has regressed, and there are negative trends in Japan where the denial, distortion, and beautification of its history of aggression occasionally occur," said Liu.BAKU -- Azerbaijan's ruling New Azerbaijan Party won the most seats in the country's parliament in a snap election on Sunday, Mazahir Panakhov, the Central Election Commission head said early on Monday after counting the results from about 5,895 polling stations.Preliminary results suggest that candidates from the ruling New Azerbaijan Party won about 68 of 125 seats in the single-chamber parliament, based on 91 percent of the vote count.A host of small parties and independents took almost all the rest.The voter turnout was 37.27 percent.The education authorities and specialists were astonished as 27 young voices from Asia-Pacific shared their perspectives on the coexistence of civilizations in a regional English-speaking contest in Bangkok on Saturday.Now in its second year, the MicUp! English Speaking Competition cum Belt and Road Youth English-Speaking Competition (Thailand) reached new heights, bringing together 600 young orators from local secondary schools and universities since the competition's kickoffs in Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines and Nepal earlier this year, and rounded off with a rousing regional final held at Chulalongkorn University.Thanh Theerapasiri, a Thai student from Regents International School Pattaya, and Myat Noe Phyu of MCTA: RVi Academy Mandalay in Myanmar were crowned champions in the junior and youth categories, respectively. The winners will move on to the next leg of their journey — the Global Final — to be held in Wuxi, China's Jiangsu province, next month.This year's speech topic, Civilizations: Clash and Coexistence, was applauded for being a vital stimulus for young talent to reflect upon varied global trends and for allowing them to advocate closer bonds of friendship and multilateral cooperation.Grabbing the audience's attention with an elaborate aqua ensemble consisting of a top inspired by the traditional Chinese qipao and a dress made from Thai silk, Roongpraew Wiwatkamolwat, a 16-year-old student of Ekamai International School in Bangkok, said it was her genuine affection for her Chinese roots and belief in cultural inclusiveness that motivated her to get into this competition and strive to excel."My costume echoes today's topic — civilization, which is an ongoing process of exchanges and fusion," she said, adding that her great-grandparents were from Beijing and her grandparents lived in China's Guangdong province."I'm a generation of such culture fusion, a mixture of Thailand and China. The culture, common values and many other connections, such as cuisine, are bridging the two nations closer than ever before," she said.Nan Suriya Khattiya, the first runner-up in the junior category, also expressed great appreciation for the rare opportunity to engage in close and direct dialogue with many of her peers from other Asian countries.The event coincided with the Silk Road spirit, which was "highlighted in many of today's speeches as an embodiment of coexistence and mutual learning among civilizations", Nan said. "The Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China links countries from the past to the future. It's not only the exchange of goods but also people-to-people interaction."This upbeat note, shared among contestants, also struck a chord with their Chinese counterparts. During a session with the finalists, Luo Ying, the national second runner-up in the 2022 21st Century Cup National English Speaking Competition, and a postgraduate student at Peking University, appealed for a step-up in international communication among youths."The Belt and Road Initiative is about connecting the dots between people, cultures and nations," she said. "The experience we share and the relationships we build are the lines that connect the dots, forming a path toward a more inclusive and understanding world."The competition, initiated last year by VDO English, the educational arm of China Daily Hong Kong, and the RVIPS, the publishing arm of the RVi Group, a social enterprise dedicated to international education based in Singapore, aims to hold forth an annual regional celebration of linguistic prowess, take the pulse of the younger generation, and push for integration of fresh voices into cross-cultural dialogues."Since its launch in 2019 as one of our major undertakings capitalizing on the BRI, the competition has been aligning itself with the initiative's goals and missions, committed to promoting cultural diversity and exchanges," said Tan Yan, deputy general manager of China Daily Asia-Pacific and director of VDO English.Argus Ang, CEO of RVi Group, said: "Applause should be given to all participants who have spoken at the stage with their public speaking power. I also want to give my wishes to them all. The future is yours. Please remember to be the best version of yourself, not just in the digital world but also the physical universe. Don't let anyone think less of you because you are young."A crowd of education authorities and specialists was revved up as 27 young voices from Asia-Pacific shared their perspectives on the coexistence of civilizations in a regional English-speaking competition in Bangkok, Thailand, on Saturday.Now in its second year, the MicUp!

The winners from each participant country will move on to the next leg of their competition journey – the Global Final to be held in Wuxi, China, in October.With multiple global challenges hitting a tipping point – from extreme weather in full swing to geopolitical conflicts on the edge – this year's speech topic Civilizations: Clash and Coexistence was applauded for being a vital stimulus for young talents to reflect on varied global trends, and for allowing them full rein to advocate closer bonds of friendship and multilateral cooperations.Grabbing the room's attention with an elaborate aqua ensemble consisting of a top inspired by traditional Chinese qipao and a dress piece made of Thai silk, Roongpraew Wiwatkamolwat, a 16-year-old student of Ekamai International School in Bangkok, noted that it was her genuine affection for her Chinese roots and belief in cultural inclusiveness that motivated her to get into this competition and strive to excel."My costume echoes today's topic — civilization, which is an ongoing process of exchanges and fusion," she said, adding that her great-grandparents were from Beijing and her grandparents lived in South China's Guangdong province."I'm a generation of such culture fusion, a mixture of Thailand and China.

No coral diseases were found," said Wei Zheng, a senior engineer at the South China Sea Development Research Institute.The scientific expedition team conducted material analysis of coral debris from the six cays of Xianbin Reef and found no terrestrial material input, proving that the cays are naturally formed.The report also shows that the cays at Xianbin Reef have sufficient materials supporting their development and formation, and their locations and geomorphology comply with natural laws."This indicates that the claims made by the Philippines about China artificially depositing coral debris in Xianbin Reef, leading to mass coral bleaching and death in the area, are completely unfounded," Wei said.However, the frequent human activities by the Philippines in recent months have started causing a certain degree of environmental damage to the reef, said Xiong Xiaofei, chief scientist from the South China Sea Ecological Center.During a field investigation in May, Xiong and his team observed the presence of the Philippine Coast Guard vessel MRRV-9701, which had been anchored in the lagoon of Xianbin Reef since April."We also observed some Philippine fishing boats, and witnessed littering and discarded fishing nets," he said, noting that the expedition team also observed Filipinos throwing cigarette butts into the sea.Chen Xiangmiao, deputy director of the Marine Science Research Institute at the National Institute for South China Studies, said: "We speculate that the actions of the Philippines are an attempt to repeat their past tactics, as they did with Ren'ai Reef and Huangyan Island, trying various means to establish a long-term presence at Xianbin Reef through fishing vessels and coast guard ships, then asserting their claims over the reef and attempting to occupy it.""They have also been spreading rumors in the international community, claiming that China intends to construct 'artificial islands' at Xianbin Reef, which we have never done at all. The facts prove that all these claims are fabricated lies.""The international community should also clearly see the shameless face of the Philippines," he added.Wei, from the South China Sea Development Research Institute, said further efforts should be made in the future to strengthen the investigation, assessment, monitoring, early warning and protection of Xianbin Reef and its surrounding waters, to reduce the adverse impacts brought by human activities.VIENTIANE - The member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) pledged to toughen their stance against transnational crime during the 18th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime and related meetings here, according to a Lao National Radio report on Thursday.The ASEAN ministerial meeting and its related meetings are scheduled to be held in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, from Tuesday to Thursday.The ASEAN ministerial meeting on transnational crime is intensifying its efforts to shape ASEAN's collective agenda to combat current and emerging transnational crimes. It needs to take a more proactive role in leading the implementation of future strategic action plans, according to the media report.It was agreed during the meeting that the evolving nature of transnational crime in the digital age underscores the importance of effectively adapting strategies to address new threats. Today's landscape of transnational crime is increasingly complex, driven by the rapid evolution of cyberspace and its interconnected nature with various forms of crime.Addressing these challenges requires a continuous adaptation of strategies and a multifaceted approach, including enhanced international cooperation, the development of robust legal frameworks, capacity building, and leveraging technological innovations to stay ahead of evolving threats.China-Japan relations "are now at a critical stage" and are "in need of progress to avoid backpedaling", senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said on Wednesday.Wang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the comment as he met with a delegation led by Toshihiro Nikai, chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union, in Beijing.It is hoped that "the Japanese side will set up an objective and correct perception of China", pursue a positive and rational policy toward China, and put into practice its position of comprehensively promoting the strategic and mutually beneficial relations, Wang said.China is willing to work with the Japanese side to learn from history; open up the future; remember the original aspiration; guard the right and break new grounds; and jointly promote the sustained, healthy and stable development of China-Japan relations along the right track, he added.The Japanese guests said they will continue to work to stabilize and improve Japan-China relations, promote people-to-people contacts and exchanges between legislative bodies, and enhance mutual understanding and friendship among generations.The aim is to promote the common development and progress of the two countries, they said.Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, appreciated Nikai for his active long-term involvement in the cause of China-Japan friendship.China and Japan are neighbors, and staying true to the general direction of peaceful coexistence, generational friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation "serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is the only correct choice", Wang said.In the past two years, the two sides jointly commemorated the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral diplomatic relations and the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship.Leaders of the two countries reaffirmed their commitment to comprehensively promote the strategic and mutually beneficial relations, and they agreed to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era, providing strategic guidance for the development of bilateral relations, Wang noted.Typhoon Shanshan struck Japan’s southwestern main island of Kyushu on Thursday morning, bringing heavy rain and powerful winds, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.The agency issued a rare special typhoon warning for most parts of Kagoshima Prefecture, leading to widespread cancellations of trains and flights by public transport operators. These special warnings are reserved for particularly severe storm systems.JR Kyushu announced that all high-speed and other train services on the island would be suspended by Thursday afternoon. Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways also canceled numerous flights to and from airports in the affected area.JR West added that some bullet trains between Hakata in northern Kyushu and Hiroshima in western Japan would also be canceled Thursday evening.As of 5 am Thursday, the typhoon was advancing northward at 15 kilometers per hour and was situated approximately 30 kilometers southwest of Satsumasendai, a city in Kagoshima Prefecture, with maximum winds reaching 252 kilometers per hour. The storm’s central atmospheric pressure was recorded at 935 hectopascals, Kyodo News reported.Residents in these areas have been urged to prepare for strong winds, high tides and waves, with the weather agency advising people to be prepared for evacuation before conditions deteriorate further. The forecast predicts up to 600 millimeters of rain in parts of Kyushu over a 24-hour period.China has much to offer Samoa and other small island countries in the transition to clean energy and infrastructure, said Samoa's ambassador to China."China's leadership in clean energy development and potential partnerships with Samoa and other small island states could significantly address the climate crisis and contribute to saving our planet," Luamanuvae Albert Mariner told China Daily.The international community has shown great admiration for China's environmental and sustainability initiatives, he said. China is leading in green technology and clean energy, and has a real opportunity to be a global leader in the renewable energy sector.China boasts about 80 percent of the world's solar manufacturing capacity. The vast output has lowered solar panel prices worldwide, reducing cost barriers for developing countries to access clean energy technology and expertise.On tackling climate change, he said, "Now more than ever, the world needs political (partnerships)... to resolve the crisis that we face." Large economies must find a way, because at the end of the day, politics is at the heart of climate change negotiations, he said.China recognizes the context of small island countries' developmental aspirations, because "these are countries that have nothing to do with climate change, and yet they're right at the forefront facing constant challenges and the impacts of climate change", he said.Speaking about China's Belt and Road Initiative projects, the ambassador said the program is critical as every country needs infrastructure development. The focus now is on sustainability built into the infrastructure, which holds the key to any country's development, he said."What China has offered is critical for development," he said, citing the example of Samoa, which is said to have one of the best international airports among small Pacific Island countries, after the facility was built with help from China.Mariner said a country involved in the BRI is always certain that China is providing what their country truly needs. "The BRI is a process and opportunity that allows ongoing conversations between China and the recipient countries," he said.Samoa and China enjoy a comprehensive strategic partnership and will celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations next year.Mariner said Chinese migration to Samoa began in the late 1800s, and China is a large, multicultural country with a fascinating and unique history."The more I read about China's history, the greater I understand and appreciate China's complexity," he said."China's … success in eliminating extreme poverty is a remarkable achievement."The Pacific region, where Samoa was the first small island country to gain independence, is often at the heart of geopolitics in some ways, Mariner said. In today's world, apart from geopolitical tensions, there is also a battle of narratives.One narrative comes from the Western media, which is very anti-China and biased. Another perspective, of people like him who come to China, reveals that this mainstream Western narrative is "so unfortunate and wrong", he said, adding that China seeks to be understood and respected.China places peace and stability as important prerequisites to its national economic development programs, he added."It continues to pursue, where possible, peace mediation efforts in some of the most difficult global conflicts in the world and remains one of the biggest contributors to the UN peacekeeping fund."Japanese citizens are urging that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal become the central issue of the upcoming Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) presidential election, as a means to eliminate corrupt, money-driven politics.On Tuesday, Takakage Fujita, president of the Alliance to Stop the Impermissible Acts of Slush Fund and Tax Evasion by the LDP, filed for a prosecutorial review with the Tokyo No 1 Committee for the Inquest of Prosecution.He did this with his legal representatives to challenge the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office's decision to return their criminal complaints. These complaints were against senior politicians in the LDP faction led by former prime minister Shinzo Abe and then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, concerning a slush fund scandal and the misuse of the Cabinet's secret funds.Earlier this year, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office returned their complaints, claiming that the facts of the crime were not specified.In these cases, the special investigation squad of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has already conducted forced searches and seized numerous accounting records, so the facts of the crime should be well-known to the prosecutors. Therefore, this response from the prosecutors office shows either a lack of understanding or a willful disregard for the overwhelming anger of the public over the LDP slush fund and tax evasion scandal, Fujita said at a news conference on Tuesday."Ordinary people are forced to pay higher taxes down to the last yen with the introduction of the invoice system. Meanwhile, LDP politicians can obtain millions of yen under the guise of political funds through fundraising party ticket sales, use this money for personal extravagances, and engage in all sorts of unacceptable behavior that defies common sense. This is the essence of the scandal that has angered not just LDP supporters, but many citizens," said Fujita.He emphasized that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal has not been properly resolved, and the political funding reform law that the LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito forced through in the last ordinary session of Japan's parliament is "an empty, meaningless sham of reform".The LDP will hold its upcoming leadership election on Sept 27, with the official campaign period for the race scheduled to start on Sept 12. As the Japanese media will focus on the LDP candidates for the next month, Fujita is worried that the scandal might be laundered through the hype surrounding the election."If the LDP presidential election is going to dominate the media, we strongly hope that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal will be made the main theme of the election," he said.The prosecution has repeatedly stated that it will not pursue this case, citing reasons such as unspecified facts. However, ordinary citizens lack the authority or resources to conduct investigations and can only file complaints based on the evidence they possess. The prosecution should be investigating and bringing charges based on these complaints, said Akihiko Ohaguchi, a lawyer representing the complainants."The way the prosecution and police are protecting the government's interests is evident … As citizens, we must strongly criticize such actions by the prosecution," said Ohaguchi.Naohiko Hasegawa, another member of Fujita's legal team, said they filed two criminal complaints regarding this matter, but both were quickly returned on the grounds that the facts were not specified.An accusation is a request for investigative authorities to look into suspected facts. Therefore, even if the specifics are not clear, it is unacceptable to reject it outright just for that reason. On the contrary, there should be some level of investigation before a final decision is made, said Hasegawa."It appears that from the beginning, there was no intention to address the slush fund issue seriously. The matter seems to be handled with minimal effort, with only lower-level figures being targeted while key influential members of the LDP remain untouched," said Hasegawa.He noted that there is significant anger over the political funding issue and genuine frustration over the lack of a serious response. "What the people truly need is thorough and meaningful action, including expulsions and strong recommendations for resignation or tax payment," he added.Shigeaki Koga, a policy analyst and a former official of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, said: "The people want to know the facts about the scandal — when did these wrongdoings start, who initiated them, who spent how much money, and for what purpose? After clarifying these facts, they want those who committed these wrongdoings to be appropriately punished, possibly even criminally prosecuted."In addition, they also want the rules governing political funds to be fundamentally reformed to ensure transparency and fairness so that such incidents never happen again, said Koga.From the perspective of the LDP, Fumio Kishida's resignation as Japan's Prime Minister is viewed as a way to take responsibility, with the hope that this will put the issue to rest. They also believe that introducing a new candidate might create the impression of change and help regain the trust of the public, he said."However, from the public's viewpoint, Kishida's resignation is not so much appreciated as it is considered too late. Moreover, even if a new leader is introduced, the public still cannot see any substantial change at this stage, and it is unlikely that they will, so the LDP might fail to regain the trust of the public," said Koga.Global experts and leaders called for higher utilization rates under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, and making collective efforts to unleash the full potential of the framework for economic prosperity for all."ASEAN members have rather low utilization rates of RCEP, which constrains the realization of the agreement's benefits," said Ong Tee Keat, president of the Belt and Road Initiative Caucus for Asia Pacific in Malaysia.Speaking at a panel discussion during the Boao Forum for Asia held in Bangkok Tuesday, he said so far there's no official data on all the member countries' utilization rates under the framework. A mechanism should be created to facilitate better functioning of the framework, he added.As the world's largest trading bloc, the RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries, 10 member states of the ASEAN, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.Since the agreement came into effect on Jan 1, 2022, it has been driving and reshaping the landscape for economic globalization with a framework that aims to lower trade barriers and secure improved market access for goods and services for businesses in the region.According to data from the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Vietnam's total exports to the RCEP region in 2022 amounted to $146.502 billion, with RCEP preferential exports reaching $980 million. It accounts for an RCEP export utilization rate of less than 1 percent.Studies indicated the utilization rates for China's exports and imports were 4.21 percent and 1.46 percent, respectively, last year.The minimum tariff differential with other trade agreements is among the factors leading to a low policy utilization rate, said Yose Rizal Damuri, executive director of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Indonesia."A smart system should be adopted to assist in the implementation and make the whole process simpler," he added.Beacon of stabilityAmid economic uncertainties and persistent downward pressure, the RCEP stands as a beacon of stability, said Jittima Nakamano, director of the Bureau of ASEAN Economic Community under the Department of Trade Negotiations, Thai Ministry of Commerce.As Thailand's biggest trading partner for nine consecutive years, China's proactive high-level opening-up to ASEAN will have a significant leverage effect, enhancing RCEP's vitality, she said."Together with the Belt and Road Initiative that has largely improved logistics links between China and Thailand, the implementation of RCEP will bring more diversified trade and transportation modes and significantly boost China-Thailand trade ties," she said.In 2022, the China Institute for Reform and Development initiated the RCEP Think Tank Network, with 18 think tanks from 13 countries being involved so far. It aims to gather suggestions from experts in the region for better implementation of the agreement."RCEP holds enormous potential for economic growth in Asia," said Chi Fulin, president of the institute. "We will keep focusing on the policy practices and conduct assessments regularly," he said.He said the institute will continue to serve as an open platform to promote policy exchanges, coordination, and communication among member countries, and provide intellectual support for mutual policy learning and macroeconomic policy coordination.Chi also said the institute plans to establish an RCEP Implementation Capacity Building Academy to provide institutionalized RCEP implementation capacity training.The United Nations and Pakistan have strongly condemned a series of terrorist attacks that claimed more than 50 lives in the country's southwestern Balochistan Province on Monday."The secretary-general stresses that attacks against civilians are unacceptable," said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN chief Antonio Guterres, at a daily briefing on the same day.Guterres extended his deepest condolences to the families of the victims and called on the Pakistani government to conduct an investigation and ensure that those responsible are held accountable, he added.At least 53 people, including 10 security forces soldiers and four law enforcement personnel, were killed by militants in Pakistan's largest province by land on Monday, according to Pakistan military authorities.President Asif Ali Zardari said the "brutal killing of innocent people was the killing of the entire humanity" and demanded that the culprits be brought to justice, Radio Pakistan reported.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also strongly condemned the attacks, demanding an immediate probe to bring the perpetrators to justice. "The nation stood by the security forces in the war against terrorism … Terrorists' nefarious designs to spoil the country's peace would never succeed," Sharif said.China voiced strong condemnation of terrorist attacks in Pakistan and expressed deep condolences to the victims on Tuesday.Maintaining unityForeign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a daily briefing that China firmly opposes all forms of terrorism and will continue to firmly support Pakistan in advancing counterterrorism operations, maintaining social unity and stability and protecting people's safety.Attacks on police stations, other law enforcement buildings and innocent civilians were launched shortly before midnight on Monday, continuing into the morning with gunfire, grenades, suicide bombings and bomb attacks.Terrorists launched attacks in various areas of Balochistan, including Musa Khel, Kalat and Las Bela districts, according to a statement from the Inter Services Public Relations Pakistan, or ISPR, the media arm of the Pakistani military.The largest attack in Musa Khel saw 23 people killed at close range after their vehicles were stopped, the district's Assistant Commissioner Najeeb Kakar said.Terrorists blocked the highway connecting Balochistan with the eastern Punjab Province in Musa Khel, stopping buses and trucks and checking the identities of passengers before shooting them. Most of the victims were from southern Punjab.The banned Balochistan Liberation Army, or BLA, reportedly claimed responsibility for the offensive in a statement emailed to some local journalists.The ISPR reported that 21 terrorists were killed in tense fighting during a clearance operation conducted by security forces after the attacks.Clearance operations are ongoing and the perpetrators and facilitators of heinous acts targeting innocent civilians will be brought to justice, the ISPR added."These attacks are a well thought-out plan to create anarchy in Pakistan," Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement on Monday.The ISPR noted that the terrorists attempted to engage in numerous attacks in Balochistan aimed at disrupting the peaceful environment and development of the province by targeting mainly innocent civilians.The Pakistani military said security forces and law enforcement agencies remained determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress in Balochistan.Xinhua contributed to this story.Almaty will host Asia's largest Finance and Post-Trade Event, DKnews.kz reports.The 26th Annual General Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Central Securities Depository Group (ACG) will take place in Almaty from September 9 to 12.

Unlike traditional coal and gas power plants, nuclear facilities do not emit carbon dioxide during electricity generation, making them indispensable for achieving global greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. For developing countries, nuclear energy provides a unique opportunity to strengthen their energy independence and ensure reliable energy supplies. This is particularly important for countries where the population and industry require stable energy sources to sustain economic growth.How can international cooperation influence the development of the nuclear industry within a country?International cooperation plays a vital role in developing nuclear energy at the national level. It allows countries to exchange knowledge, advanced technologies, and best practices. Such partnerships can help developing countries access modern nuclear technologies and improve their safety standards. An example of such cooperation is the work of Women in Nuclear Global, which provides a platform for experience exchange among women experts in nuclear energy from around the world. This not only contributes to the professional growth of participants but also strengthens ties between countries, which is crucial for the sustainable development of the nuclear industry.What are the main barriers to achieving gender equality in the nuclear industry, and how does Women in Nuclear address these issues?One of the main barriers to achieving gender equality in the nuclear industry is the stereotypical perception of this field as "male-dominated." Many women face bias and a lack of support early in their careers. Women in Nuclear actively tackles these issues through mentorship programs, educational initiatives, and awareness campaigns. We aim to inspire young women by showcasing examples of successful professionals in the nuclear industry and providing opportunities for training and career development. Our efforts are focused on creating an inclusive environment where women can fully realize their potential.What specific programs and initiatives make the nuclear industry attractive to young female professionals?Within WiN Global, we implement several programs aimed at attracting young women to the nuclear sector. For instance, we organize international conferences where young professionals can meet industry leaders and receive career-building advice. We also support educational programs that give women the opportunity to gain the necessary skills and knowledge in nuclear energy. At the national level, we collaborate with universities and research centers to offer students internships and research projects. This helps create a positive image of the nuclear industry as an innovative and promising field for women.How does the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) support new nuclear countries, such as Kazakhstan, in building and maintaining their nuclear facilities?The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays a key role in supporting new nuclear countries. The Agency offers technical assistance, training programs, and advisory services to help countries build and manage safe nuclear facilities. For Kazakhstan and other newcomers to nuclear energy, this means access to international safety standards, best management practices, and support in developing regulatory and legislative frameworks. WiN Global works closely with the IAEA, providing professional training and support to women working in the nuclear industry. This collaboration helps create a highly skilled and gender-inclusive workforce necessary for the successful development of nuclear energy in countries just starting their journey in this field.The development of nuclear energy in Kazakhstan could become an important step towards ensuring the country's stable and environmentally friendly energy supply. In the context of the global fight against climate change, nuclear energy offers unique opportunities for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and strengthening energy independence. Cooperation with international organizations such as Women in Nuclear and the IAEA can help Kazakhstan implement advanced technologies and establish a safe and sustainable nuclear industry.DKnews.kzAsian countries should work closely to unleash their full potential of comparative advantages for the common benefit of all, making collective efforts and converging to shape a brighter future for the Asia-Pacific region, global and regional leaders say.Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia Roundtable in Bangkok on Monday, Dennis Francis, president of the 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, called for Asia-Pacific countries to embrace open regionalism, handle regional affairs with mutual respect and equal rights, accelerate regional economic integration, and ensure the stability and resilience of global supply chains."The Asia-Pacific region is shaping the future of international cooperation, innovation and progress," he said. "By amplifying the diverse voices, perspectives and actions across Asia, the roundtable's esteemed gathering undoubtedly plays a vital role in fostering peace and prosperity on a regional and global scale."Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi sent a congratulatory letter to the opening of the roundtable, which is themed "Future of the World: from the Perspective of Asia"."We should continue to promote deeper integration and better connectivity, pursue innovation-driven development, strengthen cooperation in such areas as new industrialization and artificial intelligence, and accelerate the development of new quality productive forces to create a future full of opportunities for all countries in Asia," said Wang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.Focusing on AsiaAs the host country, China will continue to support the forum in focusing on Asia, keeping a global perspective, promoting cooperation and leading the way for the future, making greater contributions to the common development of countries in Asia and the world, he said.Secretary-General of the forum Zhang Jun, in his welcome remarks, said that at this historic juncture for the world, Asia is duty-bound to take up its responsibility, strengthen strategic coordination, come up with Asian solutions and play a greater constructive role in shaping the shared future.Chairman of the forum Ban Ki-moon urged the region to seize opportunities in seeking shared future of sustained peace and sustainable development."We are expected to bring Asian perspectives and solutions to those global challenges. No country can manage the challenges on its own. The only way out is the strong and sustained international cooperation," he said.As one of the 29 initiating countries of the forum, Thailand called for all Asian countries to unite together, turn the tide in the global economy and unlock the untapped economic potential in new markets and industries of the future."We firmly believe that the multilateral system, with the UN at its core, remains critical in overcoming these challenges," said Eksiri Pintaruchi, Thailand's permanent secretary for foreign affairs. "The UN is undeniably the most inclusive platform, where the Global South can speak loudest and best heard."The China Coast Guard has confirmed that it implemented control measures against two Philippine coast guard vessels illegally intruding into waters near China's Xianbin Reef in the South China Sea on Monday.The Philippine vessels "kept trying in a dangerous way to approach the China Coast Guard vessels, which were sailing normally there", and Manila rolled out media hype about what happened, the China Coast Guard said in a social media post.Chinese law enforcement officers took controlling measures on Sunday to tackle intrusion into waters near Xianbin Reef by the Philippine vessel No 3002.Manila has frequently sent coast guard vessels and government ships to intrude into the waters around Xianbin Reef.Lin Jian, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, warned on Monday that Manila is "attempting to provide supplies to the Philippine coast guard vessel that has anchored for a long period of time in the lagoon of Xianbin Reef, seeking to achieve a long-term presence"."This move by the Philippine side seriously infringes on China's sovereignty, gravely violates the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and damages peace and stability in the South China Sea," Lin said at a regular news conference in Beijing."China urges the Philippines to immediately stop provocations and infringement of (China's) rights, and immediately withdraw the vessel concerned," he said.The spokesman emphasized that Xianbin Reef is part of China's Nansha Islands.Speaking of Sunday's intrusion by the Philippine government vessels that ignored China's resolute opposition and repeated warnings, Lin said, "The responsibility for causing the collision between the vessels of the two sides rests entirely with the Philippine side".The China Coast Guard took necessary measures to tackle the Philippine vessels in accordance with domestic and international laws, and "the on-site operation was professional, coolheaded and disciplined", he said.China will continue to take resolute and strong measures in accordance with the law to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and uphold the sanctity of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, Lin added.zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com.cnThe world will have to endure a very long struggle in achieving zero-net emissions and China could become an example of how to proceed in that journey, an environment forum heard on Aug 24."We need milestones in our very long and complex struggle" against climate change, Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in her speech at the Indonesia Net-Zero Summit in Jakarta.About 3,000 people attended the day-long forum, including senior government officials, foreign diplomats, academics, business people, NGO activists and university students. The majority of the participants were young people from Jakarta and other provinces.The forum focused on opportunities and challenges faced by Indonesia and the global community in achieving the 1.5 degree Celsius global warming target to be met around mid-century as stipulated in the Paris Agreement. The legally binding treaty was signed by Indonesia, China and 194 other countries and world organizations at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in Dec 2015 and entered into force in November 2016.The most critical issue discussed in the Indonesia-Zero Summit was whether economic growth can go hand in hand with emission reduction.Li Zhenmin, a special envoy for climate change of the People's Republic of China, was a keynote speaker along with Indrawati; Tomas Anker Christensen, Climate Ambassador of Denmark; Dominic Jermey, British Ambassador to Indonesia and Timor Leste; and Pahala Nugraha Mansury, Indonesia's vice foreign minister.In addition, 55 other panelists also presented their views in different sessions and rooms at the Jakarta Theater Building.Speaking in the early session that saw her receiving the "Climate Hero Award" from the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia (FPCI), which held the dialog forum, Indrawati said that compromising the ongoing trade-off between welfare enhancement and environmental sustainability was a challenge to the global community, which not only required people's resolution but also a shift in their mindset and lifestyle.Minister Indrawati said there needs to be formulas adequate for compromising the tradeoff and she called on young people in the audience to get involved in developing new technologies for solving carbon emissions.She said that the war against climate change requires proper technologies in the fields of renewable energy, transportation, forestry, agriculture, and waste management.Indrawati specially mentioned the urgency of establishing a strong foundation for carbon market trading and the creation of inter-state rules and regulations for such a market.Indonesia officially opened carbon trading in Sept 2023 after the establishment in the previous year of the Indonesian Carbon Exchange (IDX Carbon) in the previous year.The minister, who initiated serious budgeting for environmental preservation, encouraged young people to solve ecological problems.Li Zhenmin noted that the current air pollution in Jakarta is about the same as seven years ago, the last time he came to the capital city. In July of this year, the Indonesian capital, with a population of about 12 million people, ranked fifth as the most polluted city in the world."How do you improve it? I think it's good for the Indonesian government, for the municipality government, to use this opportunity of electric transition," Li said.Li suggested that the Indonesian government encourage people to use more electric cars. China saw its air quality improve after more and more people use EVs, following the implementation of the country's new emission vehicle mandate, the Chinese official said."So please combine controlling the pollution and reducing the emission together in the cities," the Chinese official said.China is committed to pushing forward to achieve its carbon emission reduction goals by actively developing a circular economy, Li said. In China, circular economic development contributes more than 25 percent of total carbon emission reduction."China also vigorously leverages market mechanisms to regulate carbon emission trade. We have established carbon markets covering the largest greenhouse gas emissions in the world," Li said.China is also actively developing renewable energy through continuous innovation. At the end of 2023, the stored capacity of renewable energy in China reached nearly 52 percent, surpassing fossil fuel energy capacity for the first time. Since the beginning of this year, renewable energy in China has continued to maintain strong growth momentum, accounting for 92 percent of the newly stored power capacity in this year's first quarter."China's new energy products such as new energy vehicles, diesel batteries, and photovoltaic products have made important contributions to the world," Li said.China's efforts notably over the past decade have enabled the country to reduce the proportion of its coal consumption to a staggering 56 percent, Li said.Li said climate change is a global issue that requires concerted cooperation among countries around the world as "energy transition is a process that cannot be accomplished overnight."Christensen explained Denmark's aim of becoming a leading nation in international climate efforts, saying that his country has both a historical and a moral responsibility to take the lead.Denmark, by passing the 2020 Climate Act into law, has a long-term target for becoming a climate neutrality society by 2050.Dino Patti Djalal, founder and chairman of FPCI's board of trustees, said cooperation for fighting global climate change remained unstable due to an unstable geopolitical situation."The majority of world economies have not yet fully gone online with the zero-net target … Public opinion remains indifferent," Djalal said.Esther N.S. Tamara, director of the climate unit of FPCI, said funds for emission reduction work should be jointly made available by the government and private sector parties, but the question is whether Indonesia is serious enough to turn away from dirty energy."It should no longer be business as usual," she said.Fabby Tumiwa, executive director of the Institute for Essential Services Reform, said Indonesia needs to learn from China in reducing carbon emissions.But, he said China's environmental policies might not be that easily emulated by Indonesia."We are talking about political leadership, fiscal capacity, and industrial capability," Tumiwa told this correspondent in an interview.Widely known for his views on the car industry, Tumiwa said Indonesia could learn much from China's efforts to develop its electric car industry.One thing Indonesia needs to emulate from China is the latter's outstanding R&D in building the ecosystem of its EV industry, Tumiwa said. Indonesia needs large-scale EV ecosystem that comprises EV battery technology, EV manufacturing and EV charging stations, Tumiwa said.Indonesia holds 24 percent, or the highest percentage of the world's nickel reserves globally, and nickel is used for making EV batteries.Currently, EVs in Indonesia account for about 7 percent of the country's total number of cars, which is higher than last year's 4 percent, Tumiwa said. They include Chinese-made EVs.He said the percentage could rise to 10 percent in 2025. The government has set a target to see two million EVs plying roads in Indonesia by 2030.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.BANGKOK - Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Thailand's new prime minister, stated on Monday that Thailand and China share a "close friendship" and she is committed to further strengthening bilateral ties.Paetongtarn wrote on social media platform X that Thailand's friendship with China is based on "mutual trust and respect, a common vision towards prosperity and progress, as well as familial ties between our two countries' peoples."The prime minister added that she is committed to further strengthening the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between Thailand and China and looks forward to jointly celebrating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 2025.Paetongtarn, the 38-year-old Pheu Thai Party leader, was elected Thailand's new prime minister on Aug 16 after winning a parliamentary vote. She has received a formal appointment by Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn to become the second female prime minister and youngest leader in the country's history.ISLAMABAD - Militants in Pakistan's southwest Balochistan province killed 23 passengers after blocking a highway for several hours, officials said.The incident happened in Musa Khel district of the province where the terrorists offloaded the passengers from the vehicles after checking their identities, the sources told Xinhua."The terrorists entered the vehicles and checked the identity cards of the passengers, following which they offloaded those coming from east Punjab province and shot them dead," the sources added.The road connecting Punjab to Balochistan was blocked between 12:00 am (GMT 1900 Sunday) to 3:00 am local time (GMT 2200 Sunday), the source said.The terrorists also torched several vehicles during the roadblock.No group has claimed responsibility for the incident. However, in a message on social media, the proscribed organization Balochistan Liberation Army claimed to have blocked several roads across the province.SEOUL -- The top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) oversaw on Saturday a drone performance test organized by the Drone Institute of the Academy of Defence Sciences, the DPRK's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Monday.Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the DPRK, got first-hand information on the drones currently being developed, which are intended to strike enemy forces on the ground and at sea, the report said.During the test, drones of various types accurately identified and destroyed the designated targets after following different preset flight routes, it added.Noting that developing different types of drones and enhancing their combat capabilities play an important role in war preparations, the DPRK leader stressed the need to ramp up drone development and production, urging more intensive testing of their combat applications and the swift equipping of military units with them, the report said.A year after Japan began releasing nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean, many Japanese citizens are still urgently calling for an immediate halt to the discharge, which has failed to reassure both neighboring countries and the Japanese public."Our opposition to the ocean discharge of Fukushima's nuclear-tainted water remains unchanged. We want it to stop immediately," said Ruiko Mutoh, a representative of the Complainants for Criminal Prosecution of the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster.None of the concerns regarding safety, stakeholder agreement, or justification have been addressed, and the citizens of the Pacific Island countries are even more outraged, Mutoh added. "I am very sorry that Japan is contaminating the world's oceans instead of trying to contain the nuclear pollution in its own country."On Saturday, Japanese citizens gathered for a rally in Shinjuku, a bustling district of Tokyo, marking one year since the ocean discharge of nuclear-contaminated water on Aug 24, 2023.Participants called for an end to the release of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, expressing concern that the discharge is causing anxiety about the safety of food from Fukushima.The Citizens' Conference to Condemn Further Pollution of the Ocean, a nonprofit organization in Iwaki, a coastal city in Fukushima Prefecture, called for global action on Saturday. The organization invited people worldwide to join in by standing up and holding homemade placards to express their opposition to the discharge.Chiyo Oda, co-director of the organization, also known as KOREUMI, said the process of deciding to release the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean was done in a way that ignored the opposition from the public."When I eat fresh and delicious fish and shellfish, or when children and young people play by the sea, I feel anxious that the effects of radiation may appear one day. I feel that we are losing our natural way of life, which is to eat delicious products and play freely in the sea around us," said Oda, a resident of Iwaki.On Sunday, Japan completed its eighth release of around 7,800 metric tons of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea. This was the eighth release overall.Tokyo Electric Power Company, or TEPCO, the operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant, has already released over 60,000 tons of contaminated water. The discharge is expected to continue for several decades.Three Japanese civic groups, namely the Fukushima Prefecture Peace Forum, the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center, and the Japan Congress Against A- and H-Bombs, submitted a second round of signatures to government officials in Tokyo on Wednesday, requesting an immediate halt to the ocean discharge.Earlier this year, they submitted a petition, accompanied by the first batch of 184,712 signatures collected nationwide. On Wednesday, the second batch of 22,744 signatures was handed over to officials of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, bringing the total number of signatures to 207,456.TEPCO has used the Advanced Liquid Processing System, or ALPS, to remove multiple radioactive substances from the contaminated water before discharging it into the sea.However, this has not alleviated the safety concerns of the Japanese public and residents of other countries."Even though ALPS can reduce radioactive particles in the water, it cannot eliminate them entirely. Moreover, the water release is expected to continue for 30 to 40 years, resulting in a tremendous amount of water containing radioactive substances being discharged," said Hajime Matsukubo, secretary-general and researcher at the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center.Masashi Tsunoda, co-representative of the Fukushima Prefecture Peace Forum, expressed skepticism over whether the discharged water truly meets safety standards.No assessment"The government speaks of implementing a long-term monitoring system, yet no comprehensive long-term assessment is being conducted. Therefore, I find it hard to simply accept the safety claims based solely on official statements," said Tsunoda.Masayo Ikeda, secretary-general of the Women's Conference, a nonprofit organization, criticized the Japanese government and TEPCO for claiming the released water is safe without thorough verification."The presence of tritium and various radioactive substances means there is no guarantee that it won't have any environmental impact," Ikeda said. She stressed the importance of Japan continuously verifying the safety of the facilities and the water being released.Toshihiro Inoue, a special committee member of the Japan Congress against A- and H-Bombs, criticized the government and TEPCO for using the term "ALPS-treated water," which gives the impression that the water is not contaminated."This kind of image manipulation has made it increasingly difficult for us to call it 'contaminated water.' But the reality is that the water remains contaminated with radiation. Even if radioactive materials are reduced, they are still present," said Inoue.He expressed serious concerns over the long-term environmental impact of releasing this water over an extended period, especially regarding its potential effects on marine products that enter the food supply.On Thursday, TEPCO suspended experimental work to extract nuclear fuel debris from one of the reactors at the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi plant after discovering an error in the installation of a debris removal device.The government has set a goal to decommission the plant by 2051.However, the recent setback in debris removal underscores the uncertainties surrounding the entire decommissioning process, raising concerns that the timeline may be extended even further. If the timeline is indeed prolonged, it would mean the release of contaminated water could continue, said Inoue."What's really needed now is an acknowledgment that the plans are delayed and that achieving the original goals might be impossible. However, instead of admitting this and communicating openly with local residents and those in surrounding areas, the authorities continue to insist that everything is fine. This approach is alarming because it puts undue pressure on the workers, which could lead to mistakes and further complications," he said.Before the Fumio Kishida administration, Japan's nuclear policy was to "reduce nuclear power as much as possible", but under Kishida, it has changed to "make maximum use of it", said Motoo Tomizuka, a member of No Nukes Plaza Tokyo."With earthquakes becoming more frequent each year, continuing to operate aging nuclear power plants only heightens the risk of another severe accident. It's a reckless decision," said Tomizuka.Masahide Kimura, a member of the Japanese anti-nuclear campaign group, said that in TEPCO's monitoring results, the term "Not Detected "is used to indicate that radioactive material levels are below the detection limit. However, TEPCO treats these levels as if they are zero."Given the large volume of water being released, if you multiply this by the detection limit, it becomes evident that a significant amount of radioactivity is being discharged. They're releasing numerous radioactive substances, including plutonium and strontium, not just tritium," Kimura said during a protest in front of Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority on Wednesday.Approach slammedMany others have expressed concern over the Japanese government's approach of proceeding with the ocean discharge without properly securing international understanding.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday that China strongly opposes Japan's unilateral discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean."Let me stress that the more transparent and open Japan is on the issue, the easier it will be for Japan to alleviate international concerns," said Mao.China once again calls on Japan to seriously address both international and domestic concerns, and fully cooperate in establishing an independent international monitoring arrangement that remains effective in the long haul and includes substantive participation from Japan's neighboring countries and other stakeholders, she said.Kimura supports China's proposal. "Ideally, Japan should engage in international dialogue and address these issues with other countries before concerns are raised. The discharge is expected to continue for 30 to 40 years, possibly even longer. It is essential to reassess the situation and initiate discussions now, even though a year has already passed," he said.Ikeda, representing the Women's Conference, shares a similar perspective. "I believe that an international monitoring system is absolutely necessary, and I think it should be established," she said.The reforms initiated by China's late leader Deng Xiaoping and currently being amplified by President Xi Jinping have set China on the road to modernization and peaceful development as well as making greater contributions to the world by building a community with a shared future for mankind, global experts say.Xi hailed Deng's significant contributions and called for the advancement of socialism with Chinese characteristics as the country commemorated Deng's 120th birth anniversary on Thursday.Karori Singh, former director and emeritus fellow of the South Asia Studies Centre at the University of Rajasthan in India, said China has made remarkable progress in the past 75 years.Chinese leaders have continuously made their contributions in leading China to modernization, Singh said. "Chairman Mao Zedong consolidated unity while Deng set the road to economic growth and progress. President Xi further advances and synergizes Marxist ideology, Mao's thoughts and Deng's theory in socialism with Chinese characteristics and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."Xi has enunciated the Chinese worldview and global vision through the initiatives of Global Development, Global Security and Global Civilization, by advancing its flagship Belt and Road Initiative for realizing the Chinese ideal of world order inspired by Deng Xiaoping Theory, Singh said.Tom Harper, a lecturer and researcher specializing in China's international relations at the University of East London, said Xi's remarks are "symbolic in several key aspects".They confirm that "China is still following the path that Deng had set China on", and in this sense, the policies adopted thereafter have been the logical step in following this path, Harper said, adding it is worth noting how the Chinese leadership adapted to the context they find themselves in to achieve modernization in the economic and technological spheres.Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former prime minister of Pakistan, said the reform and opening-up policy initiated by Deng "has led to prosperity and progress for China, and greatly impacted China's relationship with its neighbors and trading partners".In Pakistan, Deng is revered as a leader who helped "foster and expand the relations with Pakistan during the 1980s", he said. "This relationship has continued to grow over the last four decades with collaboration in trade, investment, infrastructure, etc."Under the leadership of President Xi, the China-Pakistan relationship, termed as "Iron Brothers", has grown exponentially under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as part of the BRI, he said. "The people of Pakistan look forward to strengthening the special relationship between China and Pakistan."Dennis Munene, executive director of the China-Africa Center at the Africa Policy Institute, said: "The African Renaissance dream is being realized as China remains Africa's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years."Greater contributionsThe reforms initiated by Deng and currently being amplified under the leadership of President Xi, who is committed to making greater contributions to the world by building a community with a shared future for mankind, continue to empower Africa to seek its independent path to modernization, Munene said.Booker Ngesa Omole, organizing secretary of the Communist Party of Kenya, said there is hardly any literature on China's economic advancement without referring to Deng."A towering figure in Chinese history, Deng formed part of Chinese politics from the day the People's Republic of China was proclaimed," Omole said.He said poverty affects different segments of Africa's population in comparative terms and that Africa's economic policies should address this reality, adding China's policies are tailored to its own reality.Wang Mingjie in London and Otiato Opali in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed to this story.SEOUL -- Three Chinese nationals were among the five people killed in a traffic accident in South Korea, the Chinese embassy in South Korea confirmed on Saturday.Early morning on Saturday, a van carrying day laborers collided with a bus at an intersection in Ansan, about 30 km south of the capital Seoul, at around 5:45 am local time (2045 GMT Friday), killing five people and injuring nine others, local media reported citing the fire authorities.Affected by the collision, the van bounced off and hit a passenger car waiting in the opposite lane before coming to a stop. Five laborers in the van were sent to a nearby hospital and confirmed dead.Seven others in the van, including a driver, were injured, while two in the passenger car were wounded. One of the injured was in critical condition.The police suspected that the van violated a traffic signal at the intersection, planning to investigate the exact cause of the accident.The deputy prime minister of Thailand's caretaker government urged on Friday for an investigation into a passenger plane crash to be done as soon as possible, as he visited the site of the crash in Chachoengsao Province.The plane carrying nine people crashed into a mangrove forest in Bang Pakong district in Chachoengsao Province, en route from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Trat Airport. The accident occurred just 10 minutes after it departed at 2:46 pm on Thursday.All on board, including four Thais and five Chinese tourists, were found dead, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand. Of the five Chinese victims, there were two teenagers aged 12 and 13. Hong Kong immigration authorities said the victims were not residents of the special administrative region.Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, also deputy prime minister of the caretaker government, said the cause of the accident should be determined as soon as possible."Although 40 percent of plane parts have been found, we need to wait for further analysis to identify the wreckage. Everyone is trying their best to help, including the rescue team and even villages nearby that came to assist. I expressed my appreciation to all of them," Anutin said.Investigation neededHe also said none of the plane parts being found is complete, which is very sad. He added that the plane's vertical fall was abnormal, which should be investigated by experts.When asked whether the accident happened because the plane was used for a long time, Anutin said all aircraft follow strict standards and will be in service up to the end of its service life. He also expressed confidence in the pilot's professional skills.Thai media reported that the nine victims have been identified. However, the black box has yet to be located and is believed to be submerged underwater beneath the wreckage.Rescue teams, including forensic experts from the Royal Thai Police, are running against time on the crash site, facing challenging terrain and weather conditions.The aircraft, a Cessna Caravan C208B, was operated by the Thai Flying Service. Flight TFT209 was carrying five passengers, two flight attendants and two pilots, the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand said.One witness reported hearing a loud explosion before the plane crashed into the forest, with debris hitting a nearby house, The Nation reported.After receiving the crash report at 3:30 pm, local rescue teams arrived at the scene and found the wreckage of the small plane scattered and submerged in mud, with a skid mark about 100 meters long.The plane had plunged nose-first, embedding itself more than 10 meters deep into the muddy ground. The search for missing victims continues.yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cnChina and Indonesia agreed on Friday to shore up bilateral and multilateral cooperation in various fields as Foreign Minister Wang Yi co-chaired the 5th Meeting of the Joint Commission on Bilateral Cooperation between the two countries with Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi in Beijing.Both sides will ensure the high-level and secure operation of the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, and accelerate the development of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and "Two Countries, Twin Parks", the flagship projects of the Belt and Road Initiative, according to a news release issued by the foreign ministry.They will also tap the potential for cooperation in new energy vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaics, and the digital economy, as well as expand two-way investment, agricultural and food product cooperation and cultural exchanges.Both sides pledged to work together to improve global governance, enhance the representation and voice of developing countries, uphold the common interests of countries in the Global South, and explore third-party cooperation with Africa.During the meeting, Wang noted China has always viewed and developed friendly relations with Indonesia from a strategic and long-term perspective, and is willing to continuously elevate the building of a community of shared future between the two countries to new heights.China is speeding up high-quality development and expanding high-level opening-up, which Wang said will bring new opportunities for its cooperation with Indonesia and regional development.He called on the two countries to keep deepening high-level exchanges, strengthening strategic communication, consolidating strategic mutual trust and firmly supporting each other in safeguarding core interests.China and Indonesia should continuously expand mutually beneficial cooperation, deepen alignment of strategic development, he said, while highlighting a leading role of joint building of the Belt and Road cooperation in upgrading pragmatic cooperation between the two sides.Wang also urged Beijing and Jakarta to encourage exchanges among youth, think tanks and media and improve personnel facilitation to enhance mutual understanding and amity.Calling China one of the Southeast Asian country's most important strategic partners, Marsudi said Indonesia is committed to developing stronger ties with China.Indonesia is willing to work closely with China in multilateral collaboration, uphold multilateralism, and strengthen South-South cooperation, she added.KATHMANDU - Twenty people were killed and 16 others injured after an Indian passenger bus with 43 aboard skidded off the road in central Nepal on Friday, a Nepali official said.Twelve of the injured have been airlifted to the capital Kathmandu for treatment and four others shall be sent as well in a while, said Janardan Gautam, chief district officer of Tanahun district where the accident happened.The remaining seven have also been found, but their conditions are yet to be confirmed, he told Xinhua."All the 43 passengers have been retrieved, among them 20 have been killed," he said.The bus fell into the bank of the Marsyangdi river at Tanahun's Aanbookhaireni as a huge stone stopped it from falling further, said Deepak Kumar Raya, spokesperson for the district police.He told Xinhua that the accident occurred when the bus was heading to Kathmandu from Pokhara, a popular tourist attraction in Nepal.Driving becomes more difficult and dangerous in mountainous Nepal during the monsoon season.BEIJING - A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Friday urged Japan to cooperate fully in creating an independent, effective and long-term international monitoring scheme with substantive participation of its neighbors and other stakeholders over the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the ocean.Spokesperson Mao Ning made the remarks in response to a question regarding the progress of negotiations between the two sides since the Japanese government began discharging wastewater into the sea a year ago, and Japan's requests for China to lift its ban on aquatic products from Japan.Without full consultation with neighboring countries, Japan unilaterally started the discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the sea, shifting risks to the world, Mao told a press briefing, adding this practice is extremely irresponsible, and is neither in line with international law nor the way to get along with neighboring countries.China firmly opposes it and has repeatedly voiced grave concerns to the Japanese side, the spokesperson said.Mao said it was entirely legitimate, reasonable and necessary for China and other countries to take precautionary measures to protect food safety and people's health in response to the discharge.Noting China and Japan have maintained consultations on the issue of discharge, Mao stressed that the more transparent and open Japan is, the more it will help ease the concerns of the international community.China once again urges the Japanese side to seriously respond to domestic and international concerns and earnestly fulfill its responsibilities and obligations, she said. All nine people on board a small passenger plane are confirmed dead in a crash in Thailand on Thursday evening, the Thai civil aviation authority announced.Victims include four Thai nationalities and five Chinese, according to the authorities. Local news portals said five Chinese passengers, including two teens aged 12 and 13 respectively, are tourists.The plane crashed into a mangrove forest in Chachoengsao nearby Bangkok while en route from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Trat Airport. It crashed just 10 minutes after it departed at 2:46 pm on Thursday.The plane’s black box which is crucial to determine the cause of the crash is not yet found and is believed to be submerged underwater beneath the wreckage.The aircraft, flight TFT209, a Cessna Caravan C208 with registration HSSKR, operated by Thai Flying Service Co, was carrying five passengers, two flight attendants, and two pilots, according to the Department of Civil Aviation.One witness reported hearing a loud explosion before the plane crashed into the forest, with debris hitting a nearby house, according to the Nation.After receiving the crash report at 3:30 pm, local rescue teams arrived at the scene and found the wreckage of the small plane scattered and submerged in mud, with a skid mark about 100 meters long.The team did not find any bodies of the passengers initially, because the plane had plunged nose-first, embedding itself more than 10 meters deep into the muddy ground.The rescue team later found a suitcase that belonged to a foreign woman and some baby items. At 7:40 pm, the backhoe unearthed human remains at the crash site, along with various belongings, including suitcases, airplane seats, and passengers’ documents.The search for the missing victims continued. The Governor of Chachoengsao Province visited the site on Thursday, overseeing the operation to recover the wreckage and deployed backhoes to dig and clear the waterway at the crash site.Concerns and opposition persist as Saturday marks one year of Japan beginning to release contaminated water from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean.The date serves as a grim reminder of the environmental and economic impacts of a "deeply irresponsible" move, experts said. Despite assurances from Japanese authorities, skepticism remains as fears of long-term contamination and its consequences continue to grow.Despite fierce opposition both at home and abroad, Japan began discharging so-called "treated" water from the nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean, with the latest and eighth round carried out on Aug 7.The Chinese embassy in Japan expressed its firm opposition to the irresponsible move, noting that it concerns the health of all mankind, the global marine environment and international public interests, which meant it was not a private matter of Japan.The move to dump nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean "severely violates the international law" and is "highly irresponsible and selfish", drawing widespread condemnation from the international community, particularly neighboring countries that bear the brunt of the impact, Meng Xiaoxu, a researcher at the Institute of Japan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told China Daily."Under international law, states have a duty to prevent harm and must minimize trans-boundary damage," Meng said, citing the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, adopted by the International Maritime Organization in 1972, to which Japan is a signatory. The convention aims to control and prevent marine pollution by prohibiting the dumping of hazardous materials.Japan has violated other international laws such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, adopted in 1982, Meng said.South Korean environment activists staged a rally near a building that houses the Japanese embassy in Seoul on Wednesday to demand Japan stop the discharge. The country's opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung denounced Japan's action as an "act of terror".In April, Japanese civic groups submitted more than 180,000 signatures to the government, demanding an immediate stop to the release."The Japanese government has not effectively addressed the concerns of its citizens, or neighboring countries, and the international community," Wang Zhen, a research professor of international politics at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of International Relations, told China Daily. The behavior is entirely "self-serving and harmful to others, driven by narrow selfishness at the expense of others", he said.A significant leak of 25 tons of radioactive water detected this month at Fukushima, once again highlights the "management chaos "at Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the plant, Wang said.A massive earthquake and ensuing tsunami on March 11, 2011, severely damaged the nuclear reactors at the Fukushima plant, resulting in a level-7 nuclear accident, the highest on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale.In 2015, the government and TEPCO promised local fishermen and fishing federations that they would not dump nuclear-contaminated water into the sea "without the understanding of those concerned".However, in 2021, the Japanese government unilaterally decided to discharge millions of tons of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea in 2023 after "treatment and dilution", a process that can continue for decades.According to Wang, Japan initially adopted a cautious attitude. He added that the shift in 2021 was driven by the fact that TEPCO's storage tanks were projected to become full by autumn 2022.Mitsuhisa Furuichi, a parliamentarian from the Fukushima Prefecture, said the Japanese government and TEPCO opted for what they call the "cheapest" way of getting rid of the nuclear-contaminated water.The Japanese government set up a committee to determine what to do with the water, Furuichi told CGTN in April. "The committee decided that the cheapest way was to discharge the water into the sea. And since it could be done at a cost of 3 billion yen ($20 million) or so, they chose to do that … Also, about 80 billion yen was spent on 'reputation damage' control.""The primary consideration for discharge is cost-saving, rather than the environmental safety of its citizens and the international community," Wang said. "TEPCO's spending on public relations, rather than investing in nuclear security and proper treatment, further highlights the 'narrow self-interest and opportunism' of both the Japanese government and TEPCO."The "cheapest" solution turned out to be the "most costly" for the international community in terms of the nuclear risks borne by the whole of humanity, Meng said.Without sufficient scientific evidence and transparency, the irresponsible discharge will inevitably result in serious consequences, Meng added.The US State Department said in a statement in August last year the United States "is satisfied with Japan's safe, transparent, and science-based process"."There is a clear tendency among Western countries to politicize the environmental issues surrounding Japan's move," Meng said. "From a strategic perspective, the US supports its ally Japan and sees potential benefits in deteriorating Sino-Japanese relations."Some US politicians not only refrain from condemning Japan's discharge but criticize other countries' legitimate concerns and moves including the suspension of seafood imports from Fukushima, Wang said."Would the US and its Western allies remain as calm and 'satisfied'if other non-Western countries adopted similarly irresponsible practices as Japan?" Wang asked.Voting in Australia is compulsory, and while this may be considered a good thing, confusion sets in when voters cast their ballots, especially for immigrants voting for the first time.A recent survey of first-generation Chinese and South Asian migrants found more than half the Chinese said the voting system can be daunting and confusing, while just under half the South Asian respondents said the same thing.Australia's voting system is by proportional representation, where a candidate who gets 40 percent of the vote could still lose to one with 35 percent once preferences from other parties are distributed.In some elections, ballot papers have had up to 100 candidates which need to be numbered in order of preference. For example, if a Labor candidate is number 20 on the ballot paper, the voter needs to put 1 in the candidate's box and fill the rest in order of preference. A missing number or a repeated number means the ballot is spoiled and not counted.Fan Yang, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne's law school and one of those involved in the research, told China Daily the system can be confusing for migrants at first.For several years, Fan, along with colleague Sukhmani Khorana from the University of New South Wales, has been looking into Australia's voting system and how it impacts migrants.Their latest survey was conducted on first-generation Chinese and South Asian migrants. About half of those polled said they lacked political literacy and were thus unable to make an informed choice."This gap in understanding among newer migrant communities has allowed for the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation," Khorana, an expert on migrant and refugee communities, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Aug 6.Sri Lanka's tourism recovery is expected to gain further momentum on the back of a planned new promotional campaign and the nation's diverse attractions, with the sector's rebound aiding the nation's broader economic revival, experts said.Sri Lanka expects to attract 2.3 million foreign tourists this year, and 3 million in 2025, its tourism authorities said.According to the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, a new promotional campaign covering key source markets will be launched in the second week of September. The first phase of the campaign will target five countries — China, Britain, France, Germany and India.Sri Lanka's cabinet approved issuing free tourist visas to visitors from 35 countries including China, India and Russia, said cabinet spokesman and Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana on Thursday.Tourists will be given 30-day visas under a six-month pilot program that will start from Oct 1, Gunawardana told reporters at a weekly cabinet briefing.Natalia Bayona, executive director of UN Tourism, said Sri Lanka's tourism sector is distinguished by its diverse attractions, which include beaches, wildlife sanctuaries, rainforest areas, tea plantations, ancient heritage and Buddhist cultural sites."This variety appeals to a wide range of tourists like those interested in adventure and culture," she said.According to UN Tourism's World Tourism Barometer, Sri Lanka's tourism sector has shown a steady and encouraging post-pandemic recovery. While challenges remain, consistent growth in tourist arrivals demonstrates that Sri Lanka is successfully regaining its position as a popular travel destination, signaling a positive outlook for the continued recovery and expansion of its tourism sector, the UN agency said.Priantha Fernando, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, said that whatever a tourist may look for within one island, they can find it in Sri Lanka, which enjoys different climatic conditions in its various regions."For certain, China is one of our key markets," he added.Niraj de Mel, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board, said Sri Lankan tourism has different levels, offering suitable options based on travelers' budgets and preferences. For instance, the country draws in a lot of people who are attracted to beaches, as well as those who like to visit the tea estates known for cultivating the world-class Ceylon tea, he noted.Rising revenueTourism has become one of Sri Lanka's top foreign revenue generators. Statistics from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka show that the nation's earnings from tourism rose to over $1.88 billion in the first seven months of this year, a 73.3 percent increase compared to the same period last year.The industry will continue to play an indispensable role in the South Asian nation's economic recovery, analysts said.Bayona from UN Tourism said Sri Lanka offers significant opportunities for investment and trade in the tourism industry."The government's initiative to provide beach land and islets for development encourages investments in new resorts, eco-friendly accommodations, and tourism infrastructure," she said."This creates a favorable environment for economic growth, job creation, and the sustainable expansion of the tourism sector."Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story.In a significant move to bolster Thailand's creative economy, authorities are focusing on developing coastal city Pattaya into a film industry hub as part of the country's soft power strategy."Pattaya is not only well known as a tourism city, but also holds strong potential to become Thailand's 'City of Film', taking the center stage in the film and creative industries," said Arunya Keatkeaw, deputy director-general of The Government Public Relations Department.At the Pattaya Film Festival, which began on Wednesday, she highlighted Pattaya's growing role in the national economy and its contribution in promoting Thai films internationally, aiming to boost the country's global soft power and creative industries.Earlier this year, the Thai government introduced the "Ignite Thailand" development plan, which prioritizes soft power across 11 sectors, including sports, tourism and film. Soft power is seen as a way to enhance the country's economy and tourism through culture.As a crucial part in film industry, Pattaya is set to be developed into a "City of Film" and a location for film shooting. The Pattaya Film Festival aims to bring films of diverse sensibilities to audiences for free and includes a film competition, workshops and seminars.Siwat Bunkerd, deputy permanent secretary of Pattaya, said on Thursday the city aims to become a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the field of film."Under the plan, the city will be a one-stop service center for film and creative industries. In addition, a theme park covering 640,000 square meters will be built to accommodate film industry," he said, adding that some educational institutes will also provide relevant curricula and training.Thailand, recognized as one of the world's investment hubs for filmmaking, earned more than 6.6 billion baht ($192 million) from foreign filmmaking last year, the Thailand Film Office said.To enhance films that promote Thailand's soft power, the Ministry of Culture has allocated a 30 million baht ($870,000) subsidy for each film or animation film project."We believe that the development of Thailand as a center for filmmaking will also help promote other related industries, generate more employment and income and distribute wealth across regional areas," said Panidapa Suankaew, chief of the film business promotion section of Thailand Film Office.Major target marketNuanvan Daraswasdi, an expert in policy and strategy from the Ministry of Culture, said: "China is our major target market. We realized the fact when we participated in a major film festival in China years ago and surprisingly found that Chinese audiences are very interested in Thai films and TV dramas."Chalermchatri Yukol, president of the Film and Series Subcommittee of the National Soft Power Strategy Committee, highlighted the strong connections between Thailand and China, including blood ties, friendship and fruitful collaboration in the film industry.Apart from film production and investment, many education institutes offering film courses have Chinese sponsorship, he said. "Almost all the high-quality and affordable film equipment is made in China, which contributes a lot to a better future of our domestic film industry."Shared blood ties foster the same empathy between audiences in both countries, he said. "We are also discussing with Chinese authorities, hoping to introduce more Thai films to Chinese audiences."BANGKOK - Five Chinese nationals were confirmed dead in a small plane crash in Thailand's eastern province of Chachoengsao on Thursday, the Chinese embassy in Thailand told Xinhua, citing Thai authorities.A search and rescue operation is underway after the charter flight carrying two pilots and seven passengers on board crashed into a mangrove forest at around 3:10 pm local time while traveling to the eastern coastal province of Trat, said Chachoengsao Governor Chonlatee Yangtrong.According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand, the Cessna Caravan C208B aircraft flight TFT 209 operated by Thai Flying Service lost contact with air traffic control center and disappeared from radar after departing from Suvarnabhumi Airport in the capital Bangkok.SEOUL -- Six people were killed and 11 others injured as a fire broke out at a South Korean hotel, multiple local media said Thursday citing the fire authorities and the police.The fire broke out at a nine-story hotel in Bucheon, some 20 km southwest of the capital Seoul, at about 7:39 pm local time (1039 GMT).Six guests were killed, and three were seriously wounded. Eight others suffered minor injuries. The number of casualties may increase as recuse operations were underway.The fire, which started from a room on the eighth floor, did not spread throughout the hotel, but the entire building was filled with black smoke, causing casualties.Up to 46 fire vehicles and about 150 firefighters were sent to the scene for rescue operations.The China-Uzbekistan Global Allium Garden (Kunming Center) has attracted tens of thousands of visitors since its establishment. It has become a prime example of how the Belt and Road Initiative can support global biodiversity conservation. Allium is a type of flowering plant with hundreds of species, including chives and onions.The China-Uzbekistan Global Allium Garden (GAG) has two centers. The Kunming Center is part of the Kunming Botanical Garden of the Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Tashkent Center is at the Institute of Botany of the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences. The Kunming Center began construction in November 2017 and opened in April 2018. The Tashkent center started construction in May 2018.In April 2019, the construction of the China-Uzbekistan GAG was highlighted as an important demonstration platform for technological support in the Belt and Road Initiative at a State Council Information Office news conference."Central Asia and Southwestern China have a rich diversity of Allium species. Establishing the Global Allium Garden in China and Uzbekistan leverages our unique geographical advantages," said Niu Yang, deputy director of the Kunming Botanical Garden at the Kunming Institute of Botany."Our collaboration with Uzbekistan has mainly focused on two areas: collection exchange and scientific cooperation, including personnel exchanges and hosting joint academic conferences. We have also jointly trained many graduate students," Niu added.According to data from the Kunming Institute of Botany, the two Global Allium Garden centers have collected and conserved over 200 Allium species, representing one-third of the world's total. The garden is a crucial base for the conservation and research of allium species.The number of species at the two centers is expected to reach 500, according to Niu."The commonly known scallions and onions are just a small part of the Allium genus. There are nearly 1,000 species of Allium worldwide, some of which are highly ornamental and produce large flowers. Additionally, we can extract valuable compounds from these plants," Niu explained.TOKYO - Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) on Thursday decided to halt preparatory work for the test retrieval of nuclear fuel debris from one of the crippled reactors at the disaster-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.The TEPCO was set to attempt to remove a small amount of melted fuel from the No 2 unit at the plant in Fukushima Prefecture on Thursday, but setup errors were discovered during preparations in the debris retrieval device, according to the utility.The company has not said when it will try again, noting that the preparations would not resume within the day.It is the first such attempt to take out fuel debris in the 13 and a half years since the Fukushima nuclear plant was devastated by a massive earthquake and tsunami.According to the plan, the TEPCO aims to retrieve up to 3 grams of debris using a telescopic device equipped with a gripper tool. The device can extend up to 22 meters and access the debris through a penetration point in the primary containment vessel.On March 11, 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami that hit Japan's northeast led to core meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear plant operated by TEPCO, resulting in a level-7 nuclear accident, the highest on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale.Among the three reactors, No 1, 2 and 3 reactors, which suffered core meltdowns in the accident, the TEPCO chose the No 2 reactor as the first to start the fuel debris retrieval work as its reactor building was the only one not to suffer a hydrogen explosion.An estimated 880 tons of fuel debris remain in the three reactors. The experimental removal of the deadly debris was initially planned for 2021 but was postponed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic and technical difficulties.NEW DELHI -- The death toll in Wednesday's explosion at a pharmaceutical manufacturing unit in India's southern state of Andhra Pradesh rose to 17, confirmed a police officer on Thursday.More than 35 injured people were admitted to a local hospital, he added. However, some media reports stated that nearly 50 people were injured in the mishap, which was said to be the biggest in the past decade in the state.A major fire was triggered by the blast near the reactor site inside the factory in Atchutapuram Special Economic Zone of Anakapalle district, about 30 km west of Vishakhapatnam, one of the main cities of Andhra Pradesh.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences at the deaths and announced a monetary compensation from the PM National Relief Fund for the deceased's families, and those injured.BANGKOK -- Thailand reported its first suspected case of a more infectious variant of mpox in a European man who previously traveled to Africa before entering the Southeast Asian country last week, health officials said on Wednesday.According to the Department of Disease Control (DDC), the 66-year-old has been diagnosed with mpox and quarantined in a hospital, while further tests are underway to confirm if the patient contracted the Clade 1b strain of the viral disease, as initial examinations showed it was not the less severe Clade 2 strain found earlier in the country.The infected person arrived in Thailand on Aug 14 on a connecting flight from the Middle East, said DDC Director-General Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, adding that officials have dispatched a team to trace and monitor 43 individuals who had close contact with him.Authorities are stepping up preventative measures amid rising cases across Africa as health screening has been put in place at international entry points, including temperature checks and observation for skin rashes, Thongchai told a news conference.He noted that Thailand detected its first case of mpox in 2022. Over 800 cases of Clade 2 mpox have been reported so far, with about 140 cases occurring this year.The World Health Organization last week declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern amid an increasing number of cases of a deadlier new variant reported across and outside Africa.Japanese citizen groups submitted a second round of signatures requesting the immediate suspension of the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean to the Japanese government in Tokyo on Wednesday.The petition, accompanied by the first batch of 184,712 signatures collected nationwide, was submitted to the government on April 24. On Wednesday, the second batch of 22,744 signatures was handed over to officials from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, bringing the total number of signatures from the first and second rounds to 207,456.Those who signed the petition urged the Japanese government and the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, to immediately stop the ocean release of the so-called “ALPS treated water.”It has been nearly a year since Japan began releasing nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea on Aug 24, 2023.This water, processed by the Advanced Liquid Processing System, also known as ALPS, after coming into contact with fuel debris at the Fukushima plant, is being forcibly discharged into the ocean. Despite treatment, the water still contains radioactive substances which cannot be entirely removed.The Fukushima plant suffered a triple meltdown following a major earthquake and subsequent tsunami on March 11, 2011.“We hope for a world where all people connected by the sea can live safely, free from the threat of radioactive materials released by the nuclear accident,” said the petitioners.“The ocean is not just for humans; it is the source of life for all marine creatures. We desire a sustainable life where the natural environment is not further damaged, where humans and nature can coexist, where fishermen can fish without worry, where people around the world can eat seafood and enjoy the ocean without fear, and where everyone can raise their children with peace of mind and smiles on their faces,” they said.The petition, signature collection, and government negotiations were organized collaboratively by the Fukushima Peace Forum, the Citizens’ Nuclear Information Center, and the Japan Congress Against A- and H-Bombs, also known as Gensuikin.The unilateral imposition of further radioactive contamination under the pretext that “ocean release is unavoidable for decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant” is absolutely unacceptable, said Masashi Tani, secretary-general of Gensuikin.Instead of hastily releasing the water into the ocean, it is necessary to advance the development of technologies for removing radioactive substances. In the meantime, other methods such as solidifying the radioactive substances with mortar or storing them on land should be thoroughly considered and verified, said Tani.Malaysia is emerging as a champion of a multipolar global order, opting to remain nonaligned as it contends with the changing geopolitical situation, analysts said.While the United States remains one of Malaysia's biggest investors, Southeast Asia's third-biggest economy also "understands the limits and dangers of relying too heavily on the West".Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has been in power for nearly two years, has criticized the US and its allies over the prolonged conflict in the Gaza Strip, denounced "China-phobia", and rejected external interference in settling the disputes over the South China Sea. In July, Anwar sent an application to Russia, the current chair of BRICS, to join the group of emerging economies.Awang Azman Awang Pawi, associate professor at the Academy of Malay Studies in the University of Malaya, said the government seeks to position Malaysia as a neutral and nonaligned state, to help it navigate the tensions between the US and China. He said this approach also supports Malaysia's economic interests, as the country can be marketed as a politically stable and neutral location to potential investors.Malaysia has long been a proponent of nonalignment, having been a member of the Non-Aligned Movement since 1970. It established diplomatic relations with China in 1974 at the height of the Cold War.Awang Azman said Anwar's stance is a continuation of Malaysia's nonaligned foreign policy but this time with "stronger leanings toward China, reflecting a shift from previous governments that maintained closer ties with Western powers".Julia Roknifard, assistant professor at the School of Politics, History and International Relations, University of Nottingham Malaysia, said Malaysia sees the rise of a multipolar world as an opportunity, not a threat.She said Malaysia's interest in joining BRICS signifies the country's refusal to be dragged into the "negative geopolitical adventurism of the West that tilts increasingly belligerent against countries such as Russia and China".Roknifard said Malaysia also understands where its economic interests lie, as China has been its biggest trading partner for the last 15 years."Malaysia understands the limits and dangers of relying too heavily on the West."Roknifard said the US pressure against Malaysia's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict and its refusal to adhere to US sanctions against Iran and Russia is further pushing Malaysia to diversify its foreign policy. On the other hand, Malaysia has a positive view of China's mediation efforts in the Middle East, she noted.Anwar's foreign policy also resonates with the local populace. According to The State of Southeast Asia survey published in April by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, more than 80 percent of Malaysians polled ranked the Israel-Palestine conflict as their top geopolitical concern and nearly 60 percent of the respondents supported their government's stance.More than 66 percent of Malaysian respondents perceived China as the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia and over 75 percent considered China as the preferred alignment choice.BAKU - Azerbaijan has formally applied to join the BRICS group, the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday.The bid follows Azerbaijan's expression of interest at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Astana in early July this year. During the summit, a Joint Declaration on Strategic Partnership was signed between Azerbaijan and China, with one of its provisions outlining Azerbaijan's intention to join the BRICS. China has endorsed Azerbaijan's application and pledged to support its entry into the group.BRICS currently includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, with Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates also part of the bloc. BRICS has evolved into a key international forum, organizing annual summits and coordinating on various multilateral issues.Defense Minister Dong Jun met with his Vietnamese counterpart Phan Van Giang in Beijing on Tuesday.According to the Ministry of National Defense, Dong said that the meeting between the top leaders of both countries provides a new opportunity for the development of bilateral military relations.He said that China and Vietnam are a community with a shared future of strategic significance, noting that the two militaries should seize the momentum, strengthen their commitment to cooperation, and enhance the cooperation quality and efficiency across various fields.The two militaries should maintain the momentum of cooperation in areas such as political work, personnel training, joint exercises and training, and international collaboration, continuously expanding into new areas, and jointly consolidating and developing their relationship, pushing for more practical results in military cooperation, the defense chief said.Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang noted that both Vietnam and China are socialist countries led by communist parties, and the top leaders of the two parties have pointed the way for further deepening the Vietnam-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Cooperation.He said that Vietnam is willing to continue strengthening cooperation with China in areas such as mutual visits of delegations and friendly exchanges along the border, aiming to elevate the relationship between the two militaries to new heights.TOKYO - Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) decided Tuesday to hold its presidential election on Sept 27 to select a successor to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, local media reported.The upcoming election, the first since 2021 when Kishida was elected party's leader, is expected to see about a dozen lawmakers vie for the post to succeed Kishida, with the winner to be anointed prime minister given the ruling coalition controls both houses of parliament, Kyodo News reported.Kishida, whose three-year term as LDP president expires at the end of September, made a surprise announcement last week that he will step down without seeking re-election, leading a wide field of LDP figures to consider running, the report said.Former economic security minister Takayuki Kobayashi, 49, on Monday became the first to throw his hat into the ring for the LDP presidency.The LDP decided to start on Sept 12 a 15-day campaigning period for the race, a few days longer than the more common 12 days, in an apparent bid to improve transparency in hopes of restoring public trust in the party following a slush funds scandal, Kyodo News said.More than 10 candidates have emerged in the Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race, after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida decided not to seek reelection for the presidency.The LDP is considering holding its leadership election on Sept 27, Jiji Press reported on Monday.Kishida faced mounting pressure from LDP lawmakers who fear the party would face significant losses in upcoming elections under his leadership.On Monday, Takayuki Kobayashi, former minister of economic security, officially announced his candidacy. That same day, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa told reporters at Tokyo's Haneda Airport before her trip to India that she is preparing for her candidacy.Unlike previous LDP leadership races, which typically featured a 12-day campaign period, this election will have an extended timeline to allow for more local debates, The Nikkei newspaper reported."Today's LDP lacks the kind of heavyweight politicians it once had," Takakage Fujita, secretary-general of the Association for Inheriting and Propagating the Murayama Statement, a Japanese civic group, told China Daily."As a result, while more than 10 politicians have expressed their intention to run in the race, none of them have presented a grand vision or a comprehensive plan for Japan's future."The Asahi Shimbun commented that Kishida's government has gone awry after losing public trust and failing to present concrete measures to regain it.Satoshi Tomisaka, a professor at the Institute of World Studies at Takushoku University, said dissatisfaction has erupted among younger members of the LDP, who believe they cannot win the next general election.Kishida failed to gain the support of LDP Vice-President Taro Aso, a key figure he had relied on, Tomisaka told China Daily."The most important factor leading to Kishida's decision seems to be the significant decline in his approval ratings. The LDP remains in power not because of its superiority, but as a result of elimination, with voters concluding that it is still better than the opposition," he said.Public support for Kishida's cabinet was 19.4 percent this month, below 20 percent for the ninth straight month, according to a recent opinion poll published by Jiji Press.Public dissatisfaction with the Kishida administration and Japan's political scene is mostly directed at economic issues, Tomisaka said.The LDP covering up problems associated with the issues of politics and money has also led to public disappointment, experts said.Fujita said changing leaders is a tactic that the LDP has repeatedly used. "When facing a crisis, the LDP changes its party leader, who is also the prime minister, to instill a sense of renewal among the public, thereby making them forget about past money politics and corruption."The LDP could potentially secure victory in the next general election, allowing the ruling coalition with the Komeito party to continue, he added.Fujita urged the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition party, to avoid this outcome by fielding a capable candidate, energizing their leadership race and preventing the LDP from dominating Japan's television and newspapers for the next month.The China Coast Guard took control measures on Monday against Philippine Coast Guard vessels, which successively intruded into the waters near Xianbin Reef and Ren'ai Reef, as the Chinese side accused the Philippines of "attempting to seek a long-term presence" at Xianbin Reef.One of the Philippine vessels "deliberately rammed" a Chinese law enforcement ship "in a dangerous manner" at Xianbin Reef, causing a collision, Chinese authorities said on Monday, noting that the China Coast Guard's response was "professional, standardized, reasonable and lawful".On Monday, the CCG issued five consecutive statements, detailing the provocative actions of the two Philippine Coast Guard vessels and releasing video footage of one Philippine vessel deliberately ramming a Chinese ship twice at Xianbin Reef.Gan Yu, a spokesman for the CCG, said in a statement that two Philippine Coast Guard vessels illegally intruded into the adjacent waters of Xianbin Reef in China's Nansha Islands without the Chinese government's permission, prompting the CCG to take control measures in accordance with the law.At 3:24 am, one of the Philippine vessels ignored multiple stern warnings from the Chinese side and deliberately rammed a Chinese law enforcement vessel in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, causing a collision, he said, noting that the responsibility for this lies entirely with the Philippine side.However, the Philippine Coast Guard's provocations did not stop at Xianbin Reef.At around 6 am on Monday, the Philippine vessel that deliberately rammed the Chinese ship ignored repeated warnings and navigation controls from the Chinese side, and illegally intruded into the waters near Ren'ai Reef following its provocation at Xianbin Reef, according to the CCG.Gan said in a separate statement that the CCG also took control measures against the offending Philippine vessel in accordance with the law and regulations.The Philippine side's repeated provocations have violated the temporary arrangement between China and the Philippines on the supply of living materials to a Philippine warship, which has been illegally grounded at Ren'ai Reef for 25 years, seriously infringing on China's sovereignty and severely undermining regional peace and stability, Gan said. "We sternly warn the Philippine side to immediately cease its infringing provocations. Otherwise, it will bear all the consequences arising from such actions," he added.In another statement, Gan said that the CCG monitored and controlled the Philippine vessels effectively during the whole process in accordance with laws and regulations."China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, including Xianbin and Ren'ai reefs, and their adjacent waters," he said. "The China Coast Guard will continue to carry out law enforcement activities in the waters under China's jurisdiction in accordance with the law, resolutely thwart any infringements and provocations, and safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests."Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday that the Philippines' action at Xianbin Reef was "attempting to resupply a Philippine Coast Guard vessel anchored in the reef's lagoon, seeking to achieve a long-term presence".She emphasized that Xianbin Reef, which is part of China's Nansha Islands, is both China's inherent territory and an uninhabited reef."This action by the Philippines has seriously infringed upon China's sovereignty, gravely violated the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and severely jeopardized peace and stability in the South China Sea," Mao said."China firmly opposes such actions and will continue to take resolute and strong measures in accordance with the law to safeguard its territorial and maritime rights and interests, and to uphold the DOC."According to media reports, a Philippine Coast Guard vessel entered the lagoon of the reef without China's permission in April and has been there since then.Liu Lin, a professor of international strategy at the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that with the recent provocations by the Philippines, the scope of the China-Philippines dispute in the South China Sea has now expanded to Xianbin Reef, in addition to Huangyan Island and Ren'ai Reef."The Philippines is attempting to establish a permanent presence on the uninhabited Xianbin Reef by keeping a vessel anchored there," she said. "Meanwhile, it also intends to divert China's attention through this move, although it's fully aware of China's vigilant stance regarding its intentions."However, China is resolutely determined to ensure that the Philippines' objectives will not be achieved, Liu emphasized.Additionally, China's statements serve as a clear warning and deterrent, the expert noted."Should the Philippine side continue to escalate its provocations, China's countermeasures will inevitably escalate accordingly," she said.jiangchenglong@chinadaily.com.cn China rolled out the red carpet on Monday for Vietnam's top leader To Lam, and the two socialist countries vowed to further enhance their comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and advance the building of a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance.During their talks at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Chinese president, welcomed Lam's state visit to China, which is the Vietnamese leader's first overseas trip since he became general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee on Aug 3.Xi said the visit reflects the great importance Lam attaches to the relations between the two parties and the two countries, and also embodies the high level and strategic importance of China-Vietnam ties.Lam succeeded Nguyen Phu Trong, who passed away last month, and has been serving as the Vietnamese president since May.The first stop of Lam's three-day state visit to China, which started on Sunday, took him to Guangzhou, Guangdong province, where former leader of Vietnam Ho Chi Minh spent time promoting revolutionary activities around a century ago.Saying that the traditional friendship between the two parties and the two countries is as good as "comrades and brothers", Xi called for consistent efforts to build the China-Vietnam community with a shared future, a consensus reached between the two sides during his visit to Vietnam in December.China regards Vietnam as a priority in its neighborhood diplomacy, Xi said.Noting that both countries are at a critical stage of national development and revitalization, he underlined the need for them to solidify a pattern for the development of bilateral relations featuring higher political mutual trust, more substantial security cooperation, deeper pragmatic collaboration, stronger public support, closer multilateral coordination and better management of differences.China is willing to maintain close strategic communication and high-level exchanges with Vietnam, and actively explore ways to expand the synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative and Vietnam's Two Corridors and One Economic Circle strategy, he said.Xi also emphasized the need for both sides to step up the connectivity of railway, highway and port infrastructure, enhance connectivity of smart customs, and work together to build secure and stable industrial and supply chains.Lam highlighted the importance of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries, emphasizing that China is a strategic choice and top priority in Vietnam's foreign policy.The CPV and the Vietnamese government will inherit Trong's legacy, uphold the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist path, and steadfastly advance on the path jointly set by the older generations of leaders of both countries, especially Trong and Xi, he said.Lam told Xi that Vietnam adheres to independence and autonomy, firmly upholds the one-China policy and considers Taiwan an inseparable part of Chinese territory. He added that his country resolutely opposes any form of "Taiwan independence" separatist activities and firmly supports China in achieving reunification.Lam also expressed Vietnam's willingness to work with China to properly manage maritime disputes, in order to jointly maintain regional peace and stability.Vietnam is ready to have closer coordination with China on international affairs, and uphold multilateralism as well as international fairness and justice to contribute to world peace and development, he said.After their talks, both leaders witnessed the signing of multiple bilateral cooperation agreements in various fields such as Party schools, mutual connectivity, industry, finance, customs inspection and health.Observers said that Lam's visit marks a milestone in China-Vietnam relations, which will be an example of a new pattern of cooperation between two socialist countries facing challenges and tasks of modernization based on a similar historical trajectory and common international environment.Hannan Hussain, co-founder and senior expert at Initiate Futures, a policy think tank based in Islamabad, Pakistan, said the visit is an occasion for both countries to take stock of their cooperation achievements, promote a common vision for aligning markets, and increase favorable exposure for their industries and manufacturers.China has been Vietnam's top trading partner for many years. Vietnam is China's top trading partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China's fourth-largest trading partner globally. Trade between China and Vietnam reached $229.8 billion in 2023, according to the Foreign Ministry.Hussain said Lam's visit is expected to play a crucial role in expanding future investments, fast-tracking development projects and promoting new directions for trade and industrial cooperation.caodesheng@chinadaily.com.cn Bangladesh's interim government said it plans to hold national elections soon after introducing vital reforms, adding that its top priority is to bring the law and order situation under control.At the same time, the administration said it will undertake robust and far-reaching economic reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and sustain growth."We will hold a free, fair participatory election as soon as we can complete our mandate to carry out vital reforms in our election commission, judiciary, civil administration, security forces and media," said Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser to the interim government. The interim government was formed after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and left the country on Aug 5 after weeks of student-led protests that even stormed her official residence in Dhaka.Yunus was speaking during a meeting with diplomats in Dhaka on Aug 18. "We will be close to normalcy within a short period of time, with the unwavering support of our people and patriotic armed forces. The police force has also resumed their operations," he noted.The government has instructed all the educational institutions across the country to resume academic activities from Aug 18 after about one month of closure. All the educational institutions at secondary and higher secondary levels, as well as polytechnic institutes were declared closed for an indefinite period from July 17 amid tensions over students' demonstrations.In addition, a circular from the Bangladesh Central Bank on Aug 17, said that commercial banks are now required to raise cash withdrawal limits to 300,000 taka ($2,542) per account daily, up from the previous limit of 200,000 taka. On Aug 8, the interim government limited cheque withdrawals to 100,000 taka.Meanwhile, the Financial Times newspaper reported on Aug 18 that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accused Bangladesh's interim government of failing to protect the Hindu minority and creating tensions in the country.But Yunus told the diplomats at the meeting on Aug 18 that the government will ensure the safety and security of all religious and ethnic groups.He added that the government will nurture friendly relations with all countries in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding and shared interests.Bangladesh's Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said last week that the interim government is keen to work closely with China. His remarks came after Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen paid a courtesy call on him."Hon'ble Foreign Adviser stated the importance of the historic relations between Bangladesh and China and said that the interim government is keen to work closely with China," Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a post on Facebook."I also said that the people of Bangladesh view China positively," Hossain told media, adding that "regardless of government changes, relations will always be good".UN officials said that a team will visit Bangladesh this week to set up a probe into the hundreds of deaths that occurred during the student-led protests.An independent inquiry commission will be funded and led by the UN, according to Gwyn Lewis, the UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh, who met in Dhaka with Hossai.Xinhua contributed to the story.vivienxu@chinadailyapac.comAn updated AUKUS agreement tabled in the Australian parliament on Aug 12 has done nothing to dispel concerns about the controversial A$368 billion ($245 million) nuclear submarine deal.The AUKUS pact, comprising Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, allows the UK or the US to withdraw with one year's notice.The deal calls on the US and the UK to "not unreasonably" withhold information, material or equipment, but it can be canceled if it undermines the military capabilities or naval nuclear programs of the partner countries.The revelation has sparked a renewed political storm over Australia's sovereignty and forced Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government on the defensive.Former prime minister Paul Keating has weighed in on the debate with a stinging attack on the government and its relationship with the US.In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Aug 8, Keating said the submarine deal will turn Australia into the "51st state of the United States".He described the current Labor government as a "sellout"."In defense and foreign policy, this is not a Labor government. This is a party which has adopted the defense and foreign policies of the Morrison Liberal government," he said.Scott Morrison, who was prime minister from 2018 to 2022, was the prime mover of the AUKUS deal.Keating, who has been a critic of the AUKUS deal from its inception, called it the "worst deal in history"."This government has sold out to the United States," he said.Alison Broinowski, former diplomat and past president of Australians for War Powers Reform, told China Daily the agreement is "full of holes".Under the AUKUS nuclear submarine agreement, announced in San Diego, California, last year, Australia will buy at least three Virginia-class submarines from the US in the 2030s while nuclear-powered submarines are built. The nuclear submarines are dependent on US naval shipyards and the US Navy's submarine program.The out clause "appears to mean the US or UK", Broinowski said."It also appears to leave Australia responsible for all the costs from the start of the program until that date (of termination)," she said.'No clarity'Defense Minister Richard Marles has said no nuclear waste will be stored in Australia, she said. "But there is no clarity about how or where that waste is generated. It could involve waste from US operations in Fremantle (Western Australia) or Darwin or elsewhere."The agreement matches the ANZUS security treaty "in obliterating Australia's independence and security", she added. "Australians are being underinformed or deceived by the government they elected."Marty Branagan, a senior lecturer in peace studies at the University of New England in the Australian state of New South Wales, said Keating described the AUKUS deal as the largest defense project since World War II and the worst foreign policy mistake since a failed bid to introduce conscription during WW I."The agreement came about with no public consultation, supported by a 'Red Alert' series of fearmongering front-page articles in Australia's Nine newspapers in consultation with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which has close ties to arms dealers, and which argued for greater defense capabilities to resist a supposedly imminent war with China," he told China Daily."Yet China and Australia have a mutually beneficial trade relationship which this deal will harm."It will contribute to a regional arms race which could have disastrous consequences. It is already shifting valuable resources away from the more pressing threat of global warming facing both countries."Australian Greens party's defense spokesman David Shoebridge said the agreement was riddled with "multiple escape hatches" for the US.The new AUKUS agreement says that if at any point the US thinks supplying material under the AUKUS agreement to Australia prejudices their defense, they can effectively terminate the agreement and pull out, Shoebridge said.He called on the government to be "honest about the size of the gamble"."The growing national movement wants an end to AUKUS, claiming that its cost and the open-ended commitment to foreign military priorities are to the detriment of priorities for a resilient, safe and peaceful Australian society," he said.Indonesian President Joko Widodo led the celebration of the country's 79th Independence Day in the planned new capital Nusantara on Saturday, a symbolic move that showcases balanced development.Officially known as Ibu Kota Nusantara, the future capital is carved from the lush rainforest of East Kalimantan Province on Borneo Island, about 1,260 kilometers north of the current capital Jakarta.While analysts said the relocation can help distribute development outside Java island and promote a green city, concerns remain about construction delays and funding gaps in establishing Nusantara.The celebration featured a flag ceremony at the State Palace compound and was attended by 1,300 people, including first lady Iriana, president-elect Prabowo Subianto and foreign diplomats.The State Palace is only one of the few infrastructures that have been built, with Nusantara expected to be fully developed by 2045."Indonesia is a very large country; equality in all regions is needed," Widodo said after the ceremony, state news agency Antara reported. "Eastern, central and western regions must get the same cake."Apart from the grand ceremony in Nusantara, celebrations were also held at Merdeka Palace in Jakarta, with various competitions and celebrations taking place in recent days.Sawidji Widoatmodjo, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Business at Tarumanagara University in Jakarta, said there is nothing wrong with relocating the capital — an idea first floated by president Sukarno in 1957. "But the problem (we) faced then ... is the same as now. It is funding," he said.Rezha Bayu Oktavian Arief, co-founder and CEO of Obviously Sustainable, a social enterprise and advisory firm in Jakarta, lauded the government's commitment to the project but highlighted the "significant challenges" in attracting foreign investors."From what we have gathered, the primary obstacles revolve around policies and regulations, particularly concerning land management rights in (Nusantara), which continue to be a contentious issue," Arief said.Relocating the capital is estimated to cost more than $30 billion. On Aug 12, Widodo announced at his first cabinet meeting in Nusantara that 56.2 trillion rupiah ($3.58 billion) has already been invested in the future capital.Jakarta's challengesApart from distributing wealth in other regions, Widodo said earlier that relocating the capital would also relieve Jakarta's huge environmental challenges. The city, home to 10 million people, suffers from regular flooding and is one of the fastest-sinking cities because of the excessive extraction of groundwater.The new capital is being envisioned as a smart city, featuring accessible public transport and social services, a diverse community, low-carbon energy sources and more than 75 percent green governmental zones.Bernadia Irawati Tjandradewi, secretary-general of United Cities and Local Governments Asia-Pacific in Jakarta, said the government's thrust on developing Nusantara as a smart city "will not only improve the quality of people's life through technology and innovation, but it will also push equal distribution of development across Indonesia".Josua Pardede, chief economist at PermataBank in Jakarta, lauded the government for being selective of investors because this will ensure that investments are aligned with its vision for Nusantara's development."The government will get high-quality investment and will not merely strive for the quantity," he said.But he said it might be difficult for Prabowo's administration to realize the public-private partnership framework adopted by his predecessor. The framework needs to be developed into a more detailed program to make it easier for investors to calculate their return on investment, he added.Leonardus Jegho is a freelance journalist for China Daily.The China Coast Guard said on Monday that the Philippine Coast Guard vessels illegally intruded into the adjacent waters of Xianbin Reef and Ren'ai Reef in the South China Sea early Monday morning without China's government permission, with one vessel "deliberately ramming" a Chinese law enforcement ship "in a dangerous manner".The coast guard took control measures in accordance with the law at both reefs and accused the Philippines of violating the temporary arrangement between China and the Philippines on the supply of living materials to the Philippine warship, which has stayed illegally grounded at Ren'ai Reef for 25 years, seriously infringing on China's sovereignty and severely undermining regional peace and stability.On Monday morning, the China Coast Guard issued four consecutive statements, detailing the provocative actions of the two Philippine Coast Guard vessels and releasing video footage of the Philippine vessel deliberately ramming Chinese ship twice at Xianbin Reef.Gan Yu, a spokesman for the coast guard, said in a statement that on Monday the two Philippine Coast Guard vessels illegally intruded into the adjacent waters of Xianbin Reef in China's Nansha Islands without China's permission, prompting the coast guard to take control measures in accordance with the law.At around 3:24 am, one of the Philippine vessels ignored multiple stern warnings from the Chinese side and deliberately rammed a Chinese law enforcement vessel in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, causing a collision, he said, noting that the responsibility lies entirely with the Philippine side."We sternly warn the Philippine side to immediately cease its infringing provocations. Otherwise, it will bear all the consequences arising from such actions," Gan said.China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, including Xianbin Reef, and their adjacent waters, he said."The China Coast Guard will continue to carry out rights protection and law enforcement activities in the waters under China's jurisdiction in accordance with the law, resolutely safeguarding national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights," said the spokesman.However, at around 6 am on Monday, the Philippine vessel that deliberately rammed the Chinese ship in Xianbin Reef ignored repeated warnings and navigation controls from the Chinese side, and illegally intruded into the waters near Ren'ai Reef following its provocation in Xianbin Reef, according to the coast guard.Gan said in a separate statement that the coast guard also took control measures against the offending Philippine vessel in accordance with the law and regulations."The Philippine side's repeated provocations have violated the temporary arrangement between China and the Philippines on the supply of living materials to the illegally grounded Philippine vessel at Ren'ai Reef, seriously infringing on China's sovereignty and severely undermining regional peace and stability," he said.The spokesman warned again of all the consequences arising from such infringing provocations of the Philippine side.China and Fiji signed multiple agreements on Sunday on bilateral cooperation in fields including trade and infrastructure construction as part of a wide-ranging partnership between China and Pacific island countries.Premier Li Qiang and visiting Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka witnessed the signing of the documents following their talks at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Rabuka is on a 10-day official visit to China that started on Aug 12.Highlighting that Fiji was the first Pacific island nation to establish diplomatic relations with China, Li told Rabuka that China has always regarded Fiji as one of its most important partners in the South Pacific region.He said that China consistently supports the Fijian people in choosing their own development path, and is willing to take next year's 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries as an opportunity to strengthen bilateral relations and continue being true friends who trust and support each other.Li called for enhancing high-level exchanges and interactions at various levels between China and Fiji to promote the healthy and stable development of their comprehensive strategic partnership.The premier underlined the need for both countries to further leverage their advantages in economic complementarity to deepen partnership in infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries, light industry, education, tourism, poverty reduction and other areas within the framework of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, in order to promote shared development.China is willing to import more high-quality products from Fiji and support Chinese enterprises in investing and establishing businesses in the Pacific island country, Li said.Noting that both China and Fiji are members of the Global South, Li expressed China's willingness to enhance communication and coordination with Fiji and other Pacific island countries, actively implement initiatives proposed by President Xi Jinping, including the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and jointly advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world as well as inclusive and universally beneficial economic globalization.Rabuka expressed his admiration for China's achievements and growing influence under the leadership of Xi, emphasizing that Fiji always regards China as its reliable partner.He said that Fiji firmly adheres to the one-China principle and supports China-proposed initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.Fiji is ready to deepen cooperation with China in areas such as trade and infrastructure construction, and promote cooperation between Pacific island countries and China, he added.In July last year, Xi, while expounding on China's policy toward Pacific island countries during a meeting with Manasseh Sogavare, prime minister of the Solomon Islands, made it clear that China fully respects the sovereignty and independence of Pacific island countries, fully respects their will, fully respects their cultural traditions, and fully respects their unity and self-reliance.Rabuka met with Xi for the first time in November in San Francisco in the United States on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders' Meeting. He is set to meet with Xi again during his stay in Beijing.caodesheng@chinadaily.com.cnISLAMABAD - Torrential rains and flash floods starting in July have killed 187 people and injured 333 others in different parts of Pakistan, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has reported.Ninety-six children and 30 women were among the dead, the NDMA said in a report on Saturday.The eastern Punjab province was the worst affected area with 68 deaths, followed by the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the southern Sindh provinces with 65 and 32 deaths, respectively, said the report.It added that 13 people were killed in the southwestern Balochistan province, five were killed in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and four died in the northern Gilgit-Baltistan region.The NDMA also noted that 352 livestock animals have perished while 2,293 houses and 30 bridges were damaged during the cited period.SEOUL - Lee Jae-myung, South Korea's former liberal presidential candidate, on Sunday won his second two-year term as leader of the main opposition Democratic Party with the highest-ever vote in the party's history.Lee was re-elected as the party chief by garnering 85.4 percent of the votes, including ballots cast by party members and opinion polls from the general public.It topped the previous high of 77.7 percent, which Lee obtained in the party's previous national convention in 2022.BEIJING - General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and Vietnamese President To Lam arrived in Beijing on Sunday. BANGKOK - Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has appointed Paetongtarn Shinawatra as the country's prime minister, Secretary-General of the House of Representatives Arpath Sukhanunth announced on Sunday.In a ceremony held on Sunday morning at the Pheu Thai Party headquarters, Arpath delivered the royal command stating that Paetongtarn has been appointed premier as she received majority support in the parliamentary vote on Aug. 16.The royal endorsement paves the way for a cabinet formation as the 37-year-old officially assumes office as the youngest and second female prime minister in the Southeast Asian nation.In her first official speech as prime minister, Paetongtarn said she will collaborate with the legislative branch during the remaining three years of the parliamentary term and create space to listen to every opinion with the goal of propelling Thailand forward with unwavering determination."My hope is to harmonize the strengths of all generations, uniting individuals from all corners of Thailand, whether they serve in the government, belong to political parties, work in the private sector, or are fellow citizens," Paetongtarn said in the nationally televised ceremony."I accept this responsibility with the utmost dedication and will make Thailand a land of opportunity and happiness, where every citizen stands on equal ground."Paetongtarn, the youngest daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, entered politics in 2021 as Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Participation and Innovation of the Pheu Thai Party. She was a leading prime ministerial candidate of the Pheu Thai Party in last year's general election and later became the party's leader.GUANGZHOU - General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and Vietnamese President To Lam arrived in Guangzhou on Sunday and started his state visit to China. BANGKOK - Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been included in a royal pardon to end his jail term earlier than scheduled, his lawyer Winyat Chatmontree said on Saturday.Winyat made the confirmation following an earlier issued Royal Gazette, which announced that three categories of prisoners will be pardoned on the occasion of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's 72nd birthday anniversary.The royal pardon will take effect on Sunday, allowing Thaksin, who is currently on parole, to be free two weeks earlier than the scheduled date.Winyat added that the former prime minister will receive a certificate from the prison assuring his freedom.The 74-year-old former prime minister returned to Thailand from self-exile last year and was previously convicted of multiple charges. He was released on parole in February from a police hospital in Bangkok, where he spent six months serving a one-year prison sentence.Thaksin served as the Southeast Asian country's prime minister from 2001 to 2006 and had been in self-exile abroad since 2008.COLOMBO -- Sri Lankan tourism authorities are expecting 3 million foreign tourists in 2025, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau Managing Director Nalin Perera has said.From the second week of September, Sri Lankan tourism authorities will launch a promotional campaign covering key source markets, Perera said on Friday.Perera said the first phase of the campaign will target China, Britain, France, Germany, and India, while the second phase of the campaign will target Russia, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Poland, Italy, as well as Scandinavia, the Middle East and the Benelux countries. These campaigns are expected to increase tourist arrivals by 700,000 next year.Perera said over 1.2 million tourists have arrived in Sri Lanka by Aug 12 and another 1.1 million are expected to arrive during the coming months, particularly from October to December. Sri Lanka expects to attract 2.3 million tourists in 2024.Tourism is one of Sri Lanka's top foreign revenue generators. Sri Lanka's earnings from tourism rose to over $1.88 billion in the first seven months of 2024, a 73.3-percent increase year on year, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka said in its latest weekly report.NEW DELHI -- Twenty-two coaches of a passenger train derailed Saturday in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, officials said.The accident took place after the train's engine hit a boulder near Govindpuri station in Kanpur, about 96 km southwest of Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh.However, no loss of life or injury was reported.India's Federal Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the accident was caused after the train's engine hit an "object placed on the track."Local media reported that the passengers heard a loud noise before the train started shaking and eventually stopped.Reports quoting officials said the track was damaged for up to 50 meters and even the clip that holds the track in place had come off. The cattle guard (front of the engine) was badly damaged in the accident.Railway authorities have ordered an investigation into the accident.Last month, two people were killed and 20 others injured after 18 coaches of a passenger train derailed in Jharkhand.In June, at least 15 people were killed and 60 others injured when a goods train crashed into the rear of a stationary passenger train in West Bengal.KOLKATA — Holding candles, hundreds of thousands of women marched through the night in cities across India to protest the brutal rape and murder of a young female doctor in a hospital that has fueled anger over a lack of safety for women despite tough new laws.A 31-year-old trainee doctor was raped and murdered inside the medical college in Kolkata where she worked last Friday, triggering nationwide protests among doctors and drawing parallels to the notorious gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012."We have come here to demand justice because even I have a daughter. I am scared to send her anywhere ... I am scared to send my daughter to study," said Rinky Ghosh, who took part in a protest in Kolkata. "So I am here today because something ... must be done, this injustice must stop."The doctor had retired to sleep on a piece of carpet in a seminar room in the R. G. Kar Medical College after a marathon 36-hour shift, given the lack of any dorms or resting rooms for doctors on the premises, her colleagues told Reuters.She was found dead on Friday. Police said she had been raped and murdered and a police volunteer was subsequently arrested in connection with the crime.Many government hospitals in cities across India suspended all services except emergency departments earlier this week, as junior doctors sat outside in protest, demanding justice.The victim was found bleeding from her eyes and mouth, with injuries to her legs, stomach, ankles, right hand and finger, a doctor's inquest report on Aug 9 that was accessed by Reuters said.In protests called "Reclaim the Night", women marched across several Indian cities from midnight on Wednesday, on the eve of the country's 78th Independence Day, to protest against the lack of safety for women in India."As a society, we have to think about the atrocities being committed against our mothers, daughters and sisters. There is outrage against this in the country. I can feel this outrage," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an Independence Day address to the nation on Thursday.The 2012 Delhi rape case was seen as a turning point in attitudes toward women's safety in Indian society. It triggered huge protests and was the catalyst for rapid change in laws tackling crimes against women.These included fast-track courts for swifter convictions in such cases.Crimes against women in India rose 4 percent in 2022 from the previous year, data released late last year from the National Crime Records Bureau showed.Agencies via XinhuaIndonesian President Joko Widodo presented the 2025 budget proposal to the parliament on Friday, with Southeast Asia's biggest economy expected to expand by 5.2 percent next year.Widodo, whose second and final term as president will end in October, said Indonesia "is one of the few countries that had been able to recover sooner" in the post-pandemic era, with average GDP growth topping 5 percent in the past few years. The Indonesian government is targeting 5.2 percent growth this year.Education, healthcare, connectivity and the development of the new capital city Nusantara are among the priorities outlined in the proposed budget. Members of parliament have been deliberating the 2025 budget plan since May and will discuss the budget plan with incoming president Prabowo Subianto.Widodo said inflation this year is kept under control at 2 to 3 percent. He said the inflation target in 2025 is set at around 2.5 percent.He also expects the rupiah to trade at 16,100 against the US dollar with the 10-year government bond yield at 7.1 percent. Indonesian crude oil prices are estimated at $82 per barrel.The proposed budget has allocated state spending at 3,613.1 trillion rupiah ($230.2 million), which includes 2,693.2 trillion rupiah for central government spending and 919.9 trillion rupiah for transfer to the regions. The 2025 budget deficit is planned at 2.53 percent of GDP, equivalent to 616.2 trillion rupiah.Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at Solaris Strategies Singapore, said by outlining the economic gains of his administration, Widodo is telling both the domestic and international audience that the Indonesia he passes on to Prabowo is "on the rapid ascendancy because of the collective efforts of his administration"."Widodo has left an indelible mark on the political history of Indonesia and he will be seen favorably in generations to come," he said.Josua Pardede, the chief economist at the Jakarta-based Permata-Bank, said the proposed 2025 budget would help Indonesia escape the middle-income trap by leveraging the country's demographic bonus, continuing economic transformation, enhancing investment attractiveness and creating more job opportunities.Pardede said that given the relatively stagnant global economy, domestic demand will be the key driver of Indonesia's economic growth. He said inflation control, job creation and support for social welfare programs and subsidies can support household spending.Widodo also said in his speech that Indonesia has taken great leaps in boosting productivity and has focused on exporting processed products instead of raw materials.Although many other countries lodged complaints against Indonesia, and even tried to abort the country's efforts, "we, as a sovereign state, as a great nation, will not falter, and even we will leap forward", Widodo said, alluding to his administration's downstream policy.The leader of the ruling Pheu Thai Party, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was elected as the 31st prime minister of Thailand and is also the country's second woman in the post, the House of Representatives announced on Friday.As Thailand's youngest prime minister, the 37-year-old Paetongtarn gained 319 votes in the election. There are 493 elected House representatives and a total of 489 MPs were present in the chamber on Friday.Her success came two days after the Constitutional Court removed Srettha Thavisin from the prime minister's post, after finding him guilty of violating ethical standards due to the appointment of a former lawyer who was once jailed to his cabinet.Both Paetongtarn and Srettha are from the Pheu Thai Party, which came in second at the 2023 election but formed a ruling coalition.Paetongtarn is the youngest daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose younger sister Yingluck Shinawatra was also prime minister from 2011 to 2014.Sorawong Thienthong, Pheu Thai's secretary-general, nominated Paetongtarn as the sole prime ministerial candidate on Friday morning when Parliament President Wan Muhamad Noor Matha began the House meeting at 10 am.Anutin Charnvirakul, leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, the coalition's second-largest group, said that to ensure continuity in governance, coalition parties are prepared to collaborate with and support Paetongtarn in her bid for the premiership.Paetongtarn said she would continue with the government's policies. "The country has to move ahead. We are determined, together and we will push the country forward," Paetongtarn told The Nation after winning Pheu Thai's nomination."She will be under scrutiny. Also, she will be under a lot of pressure and have to rely on her father," Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University, said in an interview with The Nation.Paetongtarn spent her childhood steeped in the country's tumultuous politics. Educated at elite schools in Thailand and then going to university in the United Kingdom, she spent some years working at the Shinawatra family's Rende hotel group, where her husband serves as deputy chief investment officer.Last October, after Pheu Thai navigated a circuitous route to form government, Paetongtarn was anointed the party's leader. She reaffirmed that Pheu Thai will continue with its important mission in improving people's livelihoods.Despite being relatively new to politics, a person from the young generation like Paetongtarn will be a strength instead of a hindrance, Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries, said.He believes that she will be a bridge between the new and old generations. "Most policies put forward by the government will continue as planned," he said.China congratulates Paetongtarn on her election as Thai prime minister, and believes that the Thai people will make greater achievements on the development path in line with their own national conditions, China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday.The statement added that China is willing to further work with Thailand to build a China-Thailand community with a shared future.yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cnChina will deepen cooperation with ASEAN countries in all dimensions, utilizing nuclear technology and further boosting the region's sustainable development, officials from the China Atomic Energy Authority, or CAEA, said on Friday."We will establish a regular dialogue mechanism among government sectors, research institutes and enterprises to further expand civil use of nuclear technology, benefiting local people and the green development," Huang Ping, secretary-general of the authority, said.Speaking at the China-ASEAN Forum on Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Technology held in Bangkok, Huang said the implementation of nuclear technology in the region will cover a wide range of areas, including security checks, crop seed breeding, sewage treatment and medication."We will make joint efforts to boost professional exchanges and expand training programs, aiming to further help the region to cultivate domestic talent and achieve their own development," he said.To promote exchanges and cooperation between China and ASEAN countries and further advance the civil uses of nuclear energy, the forum was held during the Thailand National Science and Technology Fair, attracting experts from several countries, including Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Indonesia."The forum serves as an important platform for exchanges and to promote cooperation. As we all have realized the need of ASEAN countries in developing their energy solutions and related technical support," Permsuk Sutchaphiwat, the permanent secretary of the Thai Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, said.To achieve the carbon dioxide emissions peak by 2045 and net-zero emissions by 2060, collaboration is needed in building the first nuclear power plant in Indonesia, said Agus Puji Prasetyono, a member of the Indonesia National Energy Council."Under the support of China's technology and experiences, it will be less difficult for us to achieve our development goal despite the current challenges," he said.As a major country in the application of nuclear technology, China has accumulated decades of technological expertise and industrial experience.China National Nuclear Corporation, as a leading nuclear corporation in China, has implemented various projects with ASEAN countries, and has made substantial contributions.As comprehensive strategic partners, China and ASEAN countries have established successful cooperation in various fields of nuclear technology application.So far, the CAEA has helped Thailand to establish its first electron beam irradiation disinfection and sterilization project. In Malaysia, a gamma irradiation facility for latex glove sterilization and the first electron accelerator for material modification were also completed."We will continue to serve the growing demand for industrial upgrades and improvement of living standards in the region, contributing wisdom and strength to a better life for people throughout the region," Liu Jing, vice-chairman of the CAEA, said.yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cn In the process of Cambodia's green and low-carbon development, the active participation and contributions of Chinese enterprises are crucial, according to a Cambodian official.Chuop Paris, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Environment in Cambodia, said that by the end of 2023, the installed capacity of operational power projects held by Chinese enterprises in Cambodia accounted for about 60 percent of the whole installed capacity in Cambodia, reflecting Chinese enterprises' prominent contributions to Cambodian energy transition and green low-carbon development.In the meantime, the projects constructed by Chinese companies in Cambodia, which continuously supply electricity to hundreds of thousands of households in the Southeast Asian country, also bring warmth and light to people there, he added.Chuop Paris made these remarks at an international symposium in Beijing on Thursday.Themed as "Environment, Development and Human Rights: Green and Low-carbon Development in the Process of Modernization", the symposium, hosted by the China Foundation for Human Rights Development and China Datang Corp, gathered about 70 international participants from countries including the US, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, Cambodia and Thailand.Wang Gang, deputy minister of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, who also attended the symposium, said that green and low-carbon growth is key to modernization and meeting people's desires for a better life."With unprecedented efforts, China has achieved historic improvements in ecological protection, boasting bluer skies, greener landscapes, and cleaner waters," he said.TOKYO - While the world observes the anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender in World War II (WWII) on Aug 15 every year, some Japanese politicians would openly visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, a symbol of Japanese militarism and its wartime aggression.This year, Japan's incumbent defense minister was found among the senior officials visiting the notorious shrine, and Japanese scholars warned that amid the government's efforts to enhance military capabilities, the Yasukuni Shrine is contributing to the revival of Japan's militaristic past.In January, Hiroki Kobayashi, deputy chief of staff of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (SDF), led dozens of SDF members in a collective visit to the shrine riding in an official vehicle. In April, retired Maritime SDF Admiral Umio Otsuka was announced as the 14th chief priest of Yasukuni Shrine, the highest religious position at the shrine.The bond between the SDF and Yasukuni Shrine is strengthening with activities such as group visits by Maritime SDF trainees to the shrine's war-memorial Yushukan museum.On Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida sent ritual offerings to the shrine in his capacity as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.Atsushi Koketsu, an emeritus professor at Yamaguchi University of Japan, noting that Yasukuni Shrine, which played a key role in supporting Japanese militarism, is central to Japan's state Shinto, pointed out that visits by SDF members clearly violated the constitutional principle of the separation of religion and state."This is an attempt to revive the pre-war militarism that used State Shinto, and such moves should be strongly criticized," the scholar stated.Why is the SDF leadership so obsessed with Yasukuni Shrine? In a recent public lecture in Tokyo, Tetsuya Takahashi, an emeritus professor at the University of Tokyo, explained that many of the SDF predecessors, such as members of the National Police Reserve and the Maritime Guard, had participated in Japan's aggressive wars."To put it simply, the SDF has not severed ties with the old Japanese military, nor does it wish to," Takahashi remarked.The scholar said that the SDF is now openly teaching students at the National Defense Academy of Japan about how officers of the former Japanese military commanded their subordinates, by inviting right-wing politicians to promote the so-called "military spirit" of the old Japanese forces.According to Takahashi, the SDF also uses Yasukuni Shrine as an "educational base," where young people who lack a proper understanding of Japan's history of aggression are taken to visit. There, they are indoctrinated with the idea that dying for the country allows one to enter the shrine and be enshrined as a deity, a concept Takahashi described as an "emotional alchemy."Sayuri Saito, a constitutional law professor at Keisen University in Japan, argued that Yasukuni Shrine "has not erased the militaristic, colonialist, and imperialist values of the old Constitution, or the so-called 'Meiji Constitution,' but affirms instead a historical perspective that could revive these values."In her view, the controversial shrine "does not recognize the value of the current pacifist Constitution, with its beliefs incompatible with the basic principles of peace enshrined in the Constitution," which explains why forces that support the "Yasukuni historical perspective" are eager to revise Japan's Constitution.Saito pointed out that although Yasukuni Shrine lists words like "safety" and "peace" on its website, its very concept is entirely different from the peace envisioned by the Japanese Constitution.The Yasukuni Shrine, located in central Tokyo, honors 14 convicted Class-A Japanese war criminals from World War II, including Hideki Tojo. In-person visits of Japanese politicians to the shrine have long been strongly condemned by peace advocates within Japan and the international community.Koketsu warned that the SDF's frequent involvement with Yasukuni Shrine would only heighten concerns in Asia, particularly in China and South Korea, and increase distrust and vigilance toward the Japanese government."The growing power of the SDF and the revival of the 'Yasukuni ideology' will be seen as a resurgence of Japanese militarism...True peace will not come from an elite SDF, but from efforts to cultivate peace and build mutual trust," the scholar noted.Former prime minister of Thailand Thaksin Shinawatra's 37-year-old daughter and party leader of Pheu Thai Paetongtarn Shinawatra was selected on Friday as the new prime minister.In her first statement since resigning and leaving Bangladesh on Aug 5, Bangladesh's former prime minister Sheikh Hasina called for an investigation into the violence during weeks of student-led protests in the country."I demand that those involved in these killings and vandalism be properly investigated and the culprits be identified and punished accordingly," she said in a statement, which was posted on social media platform X by her son Sajeeb Wazed.It came hours after a court in Dhaka ordered police to launch a murder investigation into Hasina and six top figures from her administration over the death of a grocery shop owner on July 19 during protests that took hundreds of lives in Bangladesh.It is estimated that more than 300 people died and about 10,000 were arrested during the demonstrations. Initially, students protested against quotas in government jobs, but that soon transformed into an unprecedented challenge against Hasina and her ruling party.Earlier, India's The Economic Times reported that Hasina blamed the United States for her ousting, as she did not want Washington to control Bangladesh's Saint Martin's Island.It said Hasina had delivered the message to those close to her. However, Wazed posted on X denying she had ever made such a statement.Saint Martin's, a small island in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, is known for its strategic importance and geopolitical influence in the region. Hasina in the interview with The Economic Times alleged that she could have remained in power had she surrendered the sovereignty over Saint Martin Island in the Bay of Bengal to the United States.When asked about reported claims of the US role in Bangladesh's change of government, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told a news briefing on Monday: "We have had no involvement at all."Wazed, who is based in the US, said Hasina had not "resigned" as prime minister before leaving Bangladesh."My mother never officially resigned. She didn't get the time," he told Reuters.Wazed also said his mother "absolutely" did not order anyone to commit violence against the protesters. "The police were trying to stop the violence, but some police officers used excessive force," he said.Following Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus' swearing-in as head of the interim government last week, the government has made efforts to restore order.Primary schools across Bangladesh reopened on Wednesday after one month of closure, the United News of Bangladesh reported.Traffic police resumed duties on major roads and highways in Dhaka on Monday, after a weeklong strike since the fall of Hasina's administration.Xinhua contributed to the story.General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and Vietnamese President To Lam will kick off a three-day state visit to China on Sunday, the first overseas trip since the 67-year-old was elected as the top leader of the Southeast Asian nation in early August."China is the first country that General Secretary To Lam will visit after assuming office. This says a lot about the great importance that he attaches to the relations between the two parties and countries," a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement released on Thursday.During President Xi Jinping's state visit to Vietnam at the end of last year, the two countries agreed to build a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance.The two countries are working intensively to implement the outcomes achieved from the visit, the statement quoted the spokesperson as saying.China hopes to carry forward the traditional friendship and work with Vietnam to achieve success in respective socialist paths toward modernization with distinctive characteristics to jointly advance the global socialist cause, according to the statement.Du Lan, deputy director and associate fellow at the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies of the China Institute of International Studies, said, "Vietnam has always taken developing relations with China as a top priority and strategic choice. The visit is sending a signal to the outside world that its China policy will be consistent."It shows that To Lam will inherit and uphold the revolutionary achievements made by late General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and previous generations of leaders, she said, adding that his visit will further confirm the two neighbors' determination and confidence to continue the sound development momentum of bilateral ties.President Xi sent a message to To Lam, congratulating him on his election as general secretary on Aug 3, following the passing of Trong two weeks earlier.Du said, "Through high-level exchanges, the two countries can further implement consensuses and outcomes reached during President Xi's state visit to Vietnam in December, and deepen strategic mutual trust and practical cooperation in multiple areas."Vietnam is China's largest trading partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and also China's fourth-largest trading partner in the world. The trade volume between the two countries has exceeded $200 billion for two consecutive years, data from the Ministry of Commerce showed.zhaojia@chinadaily.com.cn Japan's opposition party and civic group leaders urged the Japanese government to seriously reflect on the past, seek peaceful diplomacy centering on civil exchanges, and never go to war again at a memorial in Tokyo on Thursday.Masashi Tani, secretary-general of the Tokyo-based Forum for Peace, Human Rights and Environment, said after the memorial mourning the war dead at Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery, "The purpose of today's rally is to offer our condolences to all those who lost their lives in the war, and also to use the occasion to say that we will never repeat war again."Tani emphasized that peace cannot be achieved through armed confrontation."The most important thing for the Japanese government in its relations with foreign countries is peaceful diplomacy centering on civil exchanges, rather than a foreign policy that incites tension," said Tani."We believe that reflection on the past and an apology are essential for envisioning the future. If we do not start from that point, we will be left with the idea of justifying what we have done in the past. Therefore, a peaceful society can only come from a future in which we properly acknowledge the mistakes we have made in the past and apologize for them," he said on the day when Japan marked the 79th anniversary of its surrender in World War II.Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, said at the memorial: "The lesson we can learn from the damage caused by war is that we must never go to war again. But Japanese politics is clearly against this."The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, promoted legislation that was passed in September 2015 to allow the country's military to participate in foreign conflicts, overturning its previous policy of fighting only in self-defense. In December 2022, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's Cabinet approved revision of three key national security documents."I have walked the sites in the southwestern islands of Okinawa since 2016…Every island is being turned into a military fortress, and preparations for war are underway. If we attack enemy bases in the exercise of the right of collective self-defense, it could be considered a preemptive attack by the other country, and Japan could be covered under the sun," said Fukushima.Last year, the National Diet, Japan's national legislature, passed the Act on Enhancing Defense Production and Technology Bases to revitalize the country's defense industrial base.Fukushima emphasized that Japan must never go to war in Asia because of its aggression against the region during World War II, and anywhere in the southwestern islands of Okinawa and all of Japan must not become a battlefield.At a meeting of the LDP's Headquarters for the Realization of Revision of the Constitution on Aug 7, Kishida expressed his intention to prioritize adding a contingency clause to the Constitution to deal with such matters as armed attacks and large-scale disasters.The contingency clause is martial law, which centralizes power in the Cabinet and stops the Diet as the sole legislature, said Fukushima."The Constitution of Japan was obtained by us with many sacrifices, and no war is Japan's promise to the Japanese people and the world. It is not the preparation for war that is necessary now, but the construction of peace diplomacy. We need a political shift," she said.Kenta Izumi, the leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, did not attend the memorial, but his speech was read by the moderator."In the midst of the turbulent international community, Japan made a mistake in its national policy during World War II, and proceeded on the path of territorial expansion and war. As a result, more than 3 million people lost their lives, and the people of other countries, especially those in Asia, suffered tremendous damage and pain," said Izumi."Today, on this day of discussion and the end of the war, we renew our resolve for peace and stability in the world," he said, conveying the idea that all conflicts should be resolved peacefully and diplomatically, not through the use of force.Japan has been marching headlong down the path of becoming a military superpower, doing as it is told by the United States, especially since the second Abe Cabinet under the leadership of Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe, said Masatoshi Uchida, secretary-general of the Committee of 1,000 to Prevent War.Hiroyuki Some, co-representative of the Forum for Peace, Human Rights and Environment, also believes that Japan's steps today go against the principles of the Constitution and are about to return to discipline in the prewar and wartime state.He noted that after the war, Japan was supposed to have made a resolution never to become a military superpower that threatens other countries by adopting a policy denying the exercise of the right of collective self-defense and banning the export of arms."Japan is now running after an arms buildup. I cannot help but fear that Japan today poses a threat to neighboring countries in Asia and is amplifying mutual distrust," said Some.Reflecting on World War II, he said: "We must not merely understand that epic matchup as a historical fact, but that it must never be repeated. It is our responsibility today to pass the story on from generation to generation, and to ensure that a peaceful society is passed on to the future."Chinese tech giant Huawei Cloud announced on Thursday its commitment to joint efforts with the Thai government and build the kingdom a regional cloud hub with its digital technologies.Huawei Cloud is set to boost its efforts in Thailand over the next five years, focusing on local digital infrastructure to ensure data security and processing efficiency, according to Shi Jilin, president of Global Marketing and Sales Service of Huawei Cloud.Speaking at Huawei Cloud Summit Thailand on Thursday, Shi noted that the substantial investment will bolster Thailand's position as a digital leader in Southeast Asia.She said Huawei has increased its investment in the cloud infrastructure in Thailand and that the suite of technologies and tools available to Thailand from its cloud platform has kept growing over the years."We are committed to boosting our efforts with our partners in Thailand by bringing more advanced technologies and tools and growing the digital services here. We shall not only bring real benefits that are tangible in our daily life, but also leverage the role of the cloud infrastructure to drive the wider digital transformation," she said.Since 2018, Huawei has invested 5.5 billion baht ($156.83 million) to build its cloud infrastructure. Huawei Cloud has partnered with the Thai Ministry of Digital Economy and Society to launch the e-Government cloud for enhancing digital collaboration and public service quality. It has also supported Thailand's first smart city in the Eastern Economic Corridor, improving public services and infrastructure.The company also helped to train local talents to meet the digital trends. The ASEAN Academy Thailand, which was set up in 2020, has trained over 96,200 individuals, including ICT practitioners, cloud AI developers, green engineers, and rural students."Our partnership with Huawei Cloud underscores our dedication to building a robust, secure, and reliable digital ecosystem. Its investment in local infrastructure and advanced technologies will play a crucial role in supporting our Cloud First vision," said Prasert Chanthararuangthong, minister of Digital Economy and Society.During the summit, Prasert said that joint efforts between the ministry and Huawei Cloud aims at showcasing the benefits of the government "Cloud First" policy for the Thai people."Cloud First" policy that was unveiled last year is more than just a technological initiative, he noted. "It's a comprehensive strategy to drive Thailand's digital transformation, enhance public service efficiency, and foster innovation across all sectors."He added that the policy will not only enhance the efficiency and security of the country's digital infrastructure but also provide the foundation for Thailand to become a hub of technological innovation and economic growth."We are confident that this policy will accelerate our digital transformation, create new opportunities for economic development, and position Thailand at the forefront of the digital revolution in Southeast Asia," Prasert said.yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cnSEOUL - South Korea on Thursday expressed regret over Japanese leaders' offering and visit to the notorious war-linked Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of the militaristic and colonial past of Japan.The Seoul foreign ministry said in a statement that the government expresses deep disappointment and regret over the fact that responsible leaders of Japan once again sent offering to and paid respect at the Yasukuni Shrine, which glorifies Japan's war of aggression and enshrines war criminals.The ministry urged Japanese leaders to squarely face history and demonstrate through action their humble reflection and sincere remorse for Japan's past affairs, adding that it will become an important foundation for the development of future-oriented South Korea-Japan relations.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida sent a ritual offering to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine on Thursday, as the country marked the 79th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.While Kishida has not visited the notorious shrine in person, several lawmakers from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, including Shinjiro Koizumi, a former environment minister and son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, on Thursday visited the shrine to pay homage.The Yasukuni Shrine, located in central Tokyo, honors 14 convicted Class-A Japanese war criminals from World War II. It has long been a source of diplomatic friction for Japan and its neighbors.Visits and ritual offerings made by Japanese officials to the controversial shrine have consistently sparked criticism and hurt the feelings of the people of China, South Korea and other countries brutalized by Japan during the war.To Lam, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and Vietnam's president, will pay a state visit to China from August 18 to 20, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying announced on Thursday.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who is also the president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, announced on Wednesday he does not intend to run in the party's leadership election next month.As public distrust of the LDP is rising because of a political fundraising scandal involving the party's factions, Kishida, 67, decided that he could no longer ignore the growing calls within the party for a change in leadership. He said he would step down at the end of his three-year term as LDP president next month.At a news conference, Kishida said it is important to demonstrate to the public that the LDP will change, indicating that his decision would serve as a clear signal of the party's intent to reform itself.His term as LDP president lasts until Sept 30, and the party's rules stipulate that the leadership election to choose his successor will take place between Sept 20 and Sept 29.With the House of Representatives' term set to expire by Oct 30 next year, the LDP election will also serve as a way to select the "face of the party" for the next general election, The Yomiuri Shimbun reported.The reason for Kishida's decision to step down is simply because of a lack of public support, said Ukeru Magosaki, co-representative of the Association for Inheriting and Propagating the Murayama Statement, a civic group dedicated to upholding the 1995 statement that admits Japan's wartime mistakes.Public support for Kishida's cabinet was 19.4 percent this month — below 20 percent for the ninth straight month, though the figure rebounded slightly from last month. The latest cabinet disapproval rating was 53.6 percent, according to an opinion poll published by Jiji Press last week."The starting point for the loss of support was the political funding scandal involving factions within the LDP," said Magosaki, who is also a former senior official with Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs."There was no prospect of the approval rating improving, and if things continue as they are, there is even a possibility that the LDP could lose in the House of Representatives election."Kazuyuki Hamada, an international political economist and former member of the House of Councillors, attributed Kishida's decision to step down to his lack of leadership."As symbolized by the issues of politics and money, the LDP's response of covering up problems has led to public disappointment. With the Kishida administration's approval rating falling below 20 percent, there is little chance of winning the upcoming House of Councillors and House of Representatives elections under the current conditions. The administration could not withstand the calls for resignation from both inside and outside the party," Hamada said.Kumiko Haba, a professor of international politics at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo, said, "Like (United States President) Joe Biden passing the baton to (Vice-President) Kamala Harris ... Kishida may have thought that stepping down himself could present a new image of the LDP."Leadership raceKishida's announcement is likely to intensify the LDP leadership race, experts said.Among current party executives and cabinet ministers who support Kishida, LDP Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi, Minister for Digital Transformation Taro Kono and Minister in charge of Economic Security Sanae Takaichi have expressed interest in running for the post, as has Shigeru Ishiba, a former LDP secretary-general.Other potential candidates include former minister for internal affairs and communications Seiko Noda, former environment minister Shinjiro Koizumi, former minister in charge of economic security Takayuki Kobayashi and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, experts said."The possibility of generational change and the emergence of a female party leader or prime minister is now a real consideration," Hamada said. "The issue will be whether the candidates can address public dissatisfaction and mistrust with innovative and creative policies that offer hope for the future."The LDP seems to be not fully prepared for Kishida's decision, Haba said, so there may be some initial turmoil within the party. However, if his decision leads to a smooth transition in leadership and policy changes, Kishida might have thought that it could help quell public criticism of the LDP and lay the groundwork for the party's continued governance, Haba said.TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida sent a ritual offering to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine on Thursday, as the country marked the 79th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.Kishida dedicated the Tamakushi fees to the shrine, a symbol of Japan's past brutal militarism, in his capacity as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).It came a day after Kishida took the public by surprise by announcing that he would not run in the ruling party's presidential race next month, ready to step down as prime minister after three years in power.While Kishida has not visited the notorious shrine in person, several LDP lawmakers, including Shinjiro Koizumi, a former environment minister and son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, on Thursday visited the shrine to pay homage.The Yasukuni Shrine, located in central Tokyo, honors 14 convicted Class-A Japanese war criminals from World War II. It has long been a source of diplomatic friction for Japan and its neighbors.Visits and ritual offerings made by Japanese officials to the controversial shrine have consistently sparked criticism and hurt the feelings of the people of China, South Korea and other countries brutalized by Japan during the war.Pakistan offering online visas for Chinese citizens signals closer economic cooperation and mutual exchanges between the South Asian nation and China, analysts said, adding that it can help enhance Pakistan's economy.Starting from Wednesday, visas for Chinese citizens will be available online, making it much easier for Chinese businesspeople to come to Pakistan, Pakistan's Ministry for Information and Broadcasting said on its website.Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said this earlier this month during a meeting with a representative delegation of the Chinese business community led by Chinese Consul General in Lahore Zhao Shiren.There will be ample facilities provided to Chinese citizens for business, and the Pakistani government attaches top priority to the protection of Chinese citizens living in Pakistan.Zafar Uddin Mahmood, president of the Understanding China Forum and former special envoy for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, said the streamlined online visa process for Chinese nationals is good for the facilitation of bilateral exchanges.Imran Khalid, an international affairs commentator based in Karachi, Pakistan, said the ease in visa applications will undoubtedly facilitate the frequent movement of Chinese individuals and companies, thereby strengthening economic interdependence.Pakistan is expected to receive more Chinese tourists, as the summer travel season will be followed by the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays, according to sources from Chinese travel agencies.The Pakistan side has been keen to attract Chinese outbound tourists to scenic and historic sites of the country by adopting various plans.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of Chinese tourists to Pakistan increased beyond 225,000 a year. Last year saw Chinese tourists returning, as the two countries marked the Pakistan-China Year of Tourism Exchanges.In January, Caretaker Minister of State for Tourism Wasi Shah announced that Pakistan witnessed an increase of 115 percent in foreign tourism last year, leading to $1.3 billion in foreign exchange revenue. The South Asian nation achieved a remarkable 92 percent recovery to pre-pandemic levels last year, according to the United Nations' World Tourism Organization.Khalid said: "The implications of this streamlined online visa process may extend beyond tourism and business for China. It can pave the way for increased collaboration in various fields, including academia and technology, better fostering innovation and shared growth between the two countries."Businesspeople, technical staff members and professionals can now travel to Pakistan with more ease, enabling them to be more involved in joint venture projects, particularly CPEC-related projects, Khalid said.Kaswar Klasra in Islamabad contributed to this story.Thailand's Constitutional Court on Wednesday removed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from his position after less than a year in office for breaching ethics rules by appointing a lawyer who had served a jail term to his cabinet.The case against Srettha centers around the appointment of Pichit Chuenban as a minister of the Prime Minister's Office. In 2008, Pichit was sentenced to six months' imprisonment on charges of attempting to bribe a court official.Although Pichit resigned from the cabinet in May, a decision seen as a bid to spare Srettha from legal trouble, the court pressed ahead with the case initiated by a complaint from a group of 40 senators.The Constitutional Court judges began their deliberations at 9:30 am on Wednesday. The nine-judge bench voted 5:4 to dismiss Srettha from office. Srettha did not attend the hearing due to prior work commitments but sent his secretary-general Prommin Lertsuridej.The cabinet must also resign but will stay on in a caretaker capacity with Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Phumtham Wechayachai taking over as caretaker prime minister, according to Wissanu Krea-ngam, the PM's adviser and a legal expert.The parliament will convene on Friday for a special meeting to choose a new prime minister, the legislature announced on its website, following the court's decision.According to parliamentary rules, a candidate nominated for prime minister must win the support of more than half of the lower house, which currently has 493 members.There are several potential candidates, including Pheu Thai party leader Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, Energy Minister Pirapan Salirathavibhaga and Prawit Wongsuwan, an influential former army chief who was involved in the last two coups.Local media reported that Srettha visited a Buddhist temple on Wednesday morning, where his mother's cremation ceremony was held last week. He told reporters he had slept well and would carry on with his normal schedule for the day, saying he was not unduly worried about the court case.Srettha said after the ruling that he respected the court verdict. "I performed duties to the best of my ability and adhered to ethical principles throughout my nearly one-year tenure in office."As Pheu Thai's prime ministerial candidate, Srettha received majority approval in parliament on Aug 22 last year.In the past two decades, Thailand has witnessed several prime ministers being ousted by legal decisions and coups.Some political experts believe that it is likely that Pheu Thai would still have the clout to lead the next administration."The coalition remains united," said Olarn Thinbangtieo, deputy dean of Burapha University's Faculty of Political Science and Law. In an interview with Reuters, he said there may be some impact on confidence, but that would be in the short term.Xinhua and agencies contributed to this story.As China continues to promote high-quality development and expand high-level opening-up, its cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will see broader opportunities and further boost stability and prosperity in the region as well as across the world, according to a senior official.Shi Zhongjun, secretary-general of the ASEAN-China Center, said that China and the ASEAN countries, which are all key members of the Global South and at a critical stage of pursuing national revitalization, represent development opportunities for each other."I have visited the 10 ASEAN member states since taking office in 2022. What impressed me the most is that all of them, regardless of their distinct national conditions and different cooperation priorities, have the same strong desire to collaborate with China," he told China Daily in a written interview.On the journey to modernization, China and ASEAN have always been good friends and partners who can trust each other, support each other, and move forward side by side, Shi said.Since the establishment of dialogue relations in 1991, China and ASEAN have become a fertile ground for cooperation, showcasing the most fruitful, profound and substantive partnership in the Asia-Pacific region, and are leading in regional economic growth, he said.Noting that the economy and trade serve as the ballast and the propeller of China-ASEAN relations, Shi said the two sides have been each other's largest trading partners for four consecutive years as well as each other's significant sources of investment.Data from the General Administration of Customs showed that in the first seven months of 2024, the trade volume of goods between China and ASEAN increased 10.5 percent year-on-year. It also showed that China's investment in ASEAN countries surged 44.6 percent last year, while the cumulative two-way investment exceeded $380 billion.Shi said that while strengthening practical cooperation in traditional areas such as the economy, trade, investment and infrastructure, the two sides should also tap the cooperation potential in emerging fields such as the digital economy, green energy, artificial intelligence and the blue economy.He said that by doing so, China and ASEAN could foster new growth drivers and better play the roles of important economic growth engines in the region and the world.Seven rounds of negotiations have been held on the 3.0 version of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area since November 2022."I believe that the in-depth advancement of negotiations will help build an inclusive, modern, comprehensive and mutually beneficial China-ASEAN market, and boost the China-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership," Shi said.Highlighting people-to-people exchanges as the third pillar of China-ASEAN relations, after political and economic cooperation, he said that China and ASEAN countries are working together to promote mutual understanding and friendship among more than 2 billion people."People-to-people exchanges are not just vital spiritual bonds that are continually rejuvenating between China and ASEAN countries, but also form the solid foundation for the growth of bilateral ties and the creation of an even better future for all," Shi said, noting that exchanges and cooperation in areas including culture, tourism, education and the media have yielded fruitful outcomes.He said that China and the ASEAN member states have taken coordinated actions to encourage the orderly and free flow of tourists in the region.China signed visa-exemption agreements with Thailand and Singapore in January, and announced the extension of its visa-exemption policy for residents of Malaysia in June.In the first half of the year, the number of direct flights between China and ASEAN countries reached more than 2,300 per week, and China regained its position as the largest source of tourists for Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, Shi added.In Kazakhstan, amidst global trends towards the transition to clean energy sources, the topic of constructing a nuclear power plant (NPP) is becoming increasingly relevant. With the growing demand for reliable and stable energy capacities, the government is considering the possibility of creating its own NPP, which would not only strengthen Kazakhstan's energy security but also position the country as a leader in the nuclear industry in Central Asia. The construction of an NPP opens new horizons for attracting advanced technologies, international cooperation, and investments, which will ultimately contribute to the sustainable economic development of the country.However, along with the prospects, this project raises many questions regarding safety, ecology, and public support. These aspects are discussed in an interview with Edgar Siberger, a business development expert in the nuclear industry from the international company Assystem, France. In a conversation with DKnews.kz Executive Editor Arman Korzhumbayev, Siberger shares his views on the challenges and opportunities awaiting Kazakhstan on the path to building its first nuclear power plant.How do you think Kazakhstan's strategic position in Central Asia influences decision-making in the field of nuclear energy, especially in relation to neighboring countries?Kazakhstan, as the largest country in Central Asia, plays a key role in the region, especially in terms of energy. Its strategic location and vast resources, including the largest uranium reserves in the world, make Kazakhstan an important player in nuclear energy. Decision-making in this area is largely dependent on neighboring countries and international partners. Kazakhstan actively cooperates with Russia, China, and other countries in the field of nuclear energy, which opens up opportunities for creating effective regional energy systems. Such cooperation also helps Kazakhstan strengthen its energy independence and ensure stability in the region.What mechanisms do you consider effective in managing international cooperation on nuclear and energy projects, and how can they be applied to Kazakhstan's NPP construction plans?On the international stage, the key mechanisms for successful cooperation are transparency, trust, and clear legal frameworks. It is important to establish sustainable and long-term relationships with partners, based on mutual interests. For Kazakhstan, this means active participation in international organizations such as the IAEA and the development of bilateral agreements with leading nuclear powers. Applying these mechanisms to NPP construction projects in Kazakhstan will not only attract advanced technologies but also ensure compliance with high safety standards, which is crucial for the successful implementation of such projects.From your perspective, what new opportunities in the nuclear industry could Kazakhstan capitalize on as it moves forward with its NPP plans?Kazakhstan has unique opportunities not only as a uranium supplier but also as a producer of nuclear energy. With the growing interest in clean energy sources, Kazakhstan can become a leader in the development of small modular reactors (SMRs), which offer more flexible and economically advantageous solutions for energy supply. Additionally, Kazakhstan should consider participating in international projects for the development and implementation of nuclear waste recycling technologies, which could significantly increase the added value in the country's nuclear industry.Based on your professional experience, what measures could the Kazakh government implement to attract foreign investments and expertise and ensure the success of the project?To attract foreign investments and expertise, Kazakhstan needs to focus on creating favorable conditions for investors. This includes developing and implementing clear and predictable legal frameworks, ensuring long-term stability in the investment environment, and guaranteeing transparency in the contracting process. Additionally, it is important to establish partnerships with leading global companies in the nuclear industry, which can bring in the necessary knowledge and technologies. Kazakhstan should also consider providing tax incentives and other financial stimuli to attract strategic investors.How important is public support for the success of nuclear projects? What mechanisms does the French nuclear regulator usually use to ensure support for its energy strategy and effective communication with the general public?Public support plays a crucial role in the success of any nuclear project. In France, where nuclear energy is the main source of electricity, regulators place great emphasis on communication with the public. The main mechanisms include transparent information about safety, environmental aspects, and the benefits of nuclear energy. Public hearings, meetings with local communities, and educational programs are regularly held. It is important to ensure that people have the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers, which builds trust and reduces concerns. Kazakhstan should pay attention to these practices and adapt them to its conditions to ensure broad support for its nuclear initiatives.Thank you very much, Edgar, for an interesting conversation and valuable insights!Thank you for the opportunity to discuss such important issues! I am confident that Kazakhstan has all the chances to become a leader in the nuclear industry in Central Asia.DKnews.kzMANILA - The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on Wednesday said that Philippine divers have started siphoning industrial fuel oil (IFO) from an oil tanker that sank off Bataan province, west of Manila, on July 25.The tanker, MTKR Terranova, carrying 1.4 million liters of IFO, sank before dawn on July 25 in the waters off Limay town in Bataan. One of its 17 crew died in the accident.Bataan Coast Guard Station Chief Lieutenant Commander Michael John Encina said that divers started siphoning one of the eight tanks on Wednesday. Each tank contains 175,000 liters of IFO.Encina said sealing the seven tanks is ongoing to prepare for underwater siphoning. He did not say when divers will empty all tanks of oil.Aside from MTKR Terranova, the PCG said divers also began siphoning 5,500 liters of oil from another sunken tanker, MTKR Bradley, which sank off Bataan province around the same time MTKR Terranova sank.The PCG is also cleaning up the oil from another boat, MV Mirola 1, that ran aground on July 31 off Bataan province due to bad weather.TOKYO - About 25 tons of radioactive water have leaked within the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the plant's operator has reported, a week after the latest round of ocean discharge started.The nuclear-contaminated water, which leaked from a surge tank connected to the Unit 2 reactor building, was meant to be contained in a tank receiving overflow from the spent nuclear fuel pool, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).Accumulating on the first basement level of the reactor building, the leaked water led to a rise in the level of contaminated water already present in the area, TEPCO introduced on Tuesday, confirming that the contaminated water had not escaped outside the reactor building.The leak was first identified last Friday, when a decrease in the water level of the surge tank was detected, according to TEPCO, which upon further investigation discovered water flowing into a drain in a room on the third floor of the reactor building.The company plans to use a remotely operated robot to measure radiation levels in the room by Friday and further pinpoint the exact location and cause of the leak. The cooling pump for the pool has been temporarily shut down as part of the investigation.Hit by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and an ensuing tsunami on March 11, 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant suffered core meltdowns that released radiation, resulting in a level-7 nuclear accident, the highest on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale.The plant has been generating a massive amount of water tainted with radioactive substances from cooling down nuclear fuel in reactor buildings. The contaminated water is now being stored in tanks at the nuclear plant.Despite furious opposition both at home and abroad, the ocean discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water began in August 2023, and the eighth round of ocean discharge started last week.In fiscal 2024, TEPCO plans to discharge a total of 54,600 tons of the contaminated water in seven rounds, which contains approximately 14 trillion becquerels of tritium.Amid raging credibility and safety concerns among the Japanese public following a series of accidents at the crippled plant, TEPCO and the Japanese government have been frequently challenged for mishandling the contaminated water.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who is also the president of the Liberal Democratic Party, informed party executives on Wednesday that he does not intend to run in the party's leadership election scheduled for late September. Having plans to step down in line with the end of his three-year term as party president.As public distrust in the Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, is rising due to a political funding scandal involving the party's factions, 67-year-old Kishida decided that he could no longer ignore the growing calls within the party for a change in leadership.Kishida's term as LDP president lasts until Sept 30, and the party's rules stipulate that the leadership election to choose his successor will take place between Sept 20 and 29. With the House of Representatives term set to expire by Oct 30 next year, the election will also serve as a way to select the "face of the party" for the upcoming general election, according to The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest national newspaper.As of now, no candidate has officially announced their candidacy for the leadership election, but Kishida's announcement not to run is likely to accelerate the race. Among the current party executives and cabinet ministers who support Kishida, LDP Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi, Minister for Digital Transformation Taro Kono, and Minister in charge of Economic Security Sanae Takaichi have expressed interest in running.The mid-career and younger members of the LDP have been increasingly vocal about the need for generational change and party reform ahead of the leadership election. The emphasis on reform is largely driven by the strong headwinds caused by the political funding scandal involving party factions. Disciplining the involved members and amending the Political Funds Control Act have not been sufficient to restore public trust.The mid-career and younger members of the LDP believe that without demonstrating a commitment to change, the party is likely to struggle in the next House of Representatives election. Some candidates eyeing the "post-Kishida" era are responding to these calls, making party renewal one of the key issues in the upcoming leadership race, The Yomiuri Shimbun reported.Indonesian President Joko Widodo's first cabinet meeting in the new capital city Nusantara, or IKN, is a "strong symbolic gesture" that shows his determination to pursue its development despite construction delays and funding concerns, analysts said.Widodo presided over the Monday meeting at Garuda Palace, a majestic bird-shaped palace modeled after the mythical Garuda, Indonesia's national emblem. Vice-President Ma'ruf Amin and 38 ministers attended the meeting, along with incoming President Prabowo Subianto and his running mate Gibran Rakabuming Raka, Widodo's eldest son.Widodo will be stepping down from office in October, but Prabowo said his government will continue with the development of IKN, or Ibu Kota Nusantara.Dedi Dinarto, lead Indonesia analyst at public policy advisory firm Global Counsel, said Widodo is "clearly sending a strong symbolic gesture to the wider public, portraying the new capital project not only as a top priority, but also as a lasting legacy".He said that in the current climate of high interest rates, foreign investors are cautious about pouring money into projects with less attractive value propositions. Widodo thus aims to reassure global investors that the project is here to stay even after the end of his administration, Dinarto added.The IKN development is estimated to cost over $30 billion. While a total of 40 trillion rupiah ($2.5 billion) has been allocated this year for IKN, the government is hoping to secure 100 trillion rupiah in private investments to finance this mega project.Rezha Bayu Oktavian Arief, co-founder and CEO of Jakartabased social enterprise and advisory firm Obviously Sustainable, said the cabinet meeting is a "strategic move" to send a message to future investors and other stakeholders."Despite the challenges, the (development of the) new capital is on track, and the government is working diligently to complete all necessary developments," he said.Arief said holding the meeting in Nusantara also highlighted a key reason behind Widodo's decision to relocate the capital from Jakarta — "to promote equality and prosperity for all Indonesians". He said this has been a consistent theme in Widodo's vision for the project since he announced the relocation plan in 2019.Canvas for futureIn his opening speech at the cabinet meeting, Widodo said moving the capital to Nusantara in East Kalimantan Province would lead to "equal distribution" of economic development. He noted that Java island, where Jakarta is located, accounts for 58 percent of the nation's GDP. The new capital will serve as a canvas for painting Indonesia's future, he added.More than 50 percent of Indonesia's population of 280 million also live in Java, and nearly 11 million live in Jakarta. In contrast, East Kalimantan in Borneo — an island that Indonesia shares with Malaysia and Brunei — is home to less than 6 percent of the population. Widodo said this is another consideration to relocate the capital as Jakarta is densely populated.Josua Pardede, chief economist at PermataBank in Jakarta, questioned its readiness to function as the new capital, alluding to reports on problems with electricity and water supply in IKN."Investors typically look for stability and infrastructure reliability when making decisions," Pardede said. "While the symbolic cabinet meeting might generate some positive sentiment, significant investment will likely hinge on tangible progress in addressing these basic infrastructure needs."Leonardus Jegho is a freelance journalist for China Daily. BEIJING - Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Chinese Foreign Minister, will visit Myanmar and travel to Thailand to co-chair the ninth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Foreign Ministers' Meeting and attend the Informal Discussion Between the Foreign Ministers of China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand from August 14 to 17.On Wang's upcoming visit to Myanmar, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said it is aimed at deepening bilateral mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, cementing the close bond of friendship between the two peoples, and advancing the building of the China-Myanmar community with a shared future.As a friend and neighbor of Myanmar, China strictly follows the principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, supports Myanmar's effort to uphold stability, grow the economy and improve people's livelihood, and provides constructive help for parties in Myanmar to properly address differences through political consultation within the framework of the constitution and other laws, the spokesperson added.About the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC), the spokesperson said it is an innovative type of regional cooperation mechanism among China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam featuring collaboration, consultation and shared benefit. Since its launch in 2016, the mechanism has delivered fruitful results, contributing effectively to the economic and social development of the six Lancang-Mekong countries, and bringing tangible benefits to their peoples.The spokesperson said that in recent years, under the strategic guidance of leaders of China and the Mekong countries, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam have each announced jointly with China the building of a community with a shared future. All countries in the Mekong region are engaged in building a community with a shared future both bilaterally with China and multilaterally under the LMC mechanism.China hopes to work with the Mekong countries at the LMC Foreign Ministers' Meeting to review the progress of cooperation, take stock of past experience, and plan for next steps to advance LMC, to build the Lancang-Mekong region into an exemplar for high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, a pacesetter for implementing the Global Development Initiative, a pioneer for implementing the Global Security Initiative and a frontrunner for implementing the Global Civilization Initiative, and form an even closer community with a shared future for Lancang-Mekong countries, the spokesperson added.On the sidelines of the LMC meeting, at the invitation of Thailand, Wang will attend the Informal Discussion Between the Foreign Ministers of China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand to exchange views on the regional situation, jointly combating cross-border crimes and other issues, said the spokesperson.DHAKA - Inflation in Bangladesh accelerated to 11.66 percent in July, the highest in 13 years, mainly driven by higher food prices, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) reported on Monday.Data showed that it was 9.72 percent in June.Food inflation soared 14.10 percent in July, the highest in at least a decade. In June, according to BSS, food inflation was 10.42 percent.Non-food items inflation also increased to 9.68 percent in July from 9.15 percent in June, the data showed.The country's average inflation surged to 9.73 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 (July 2023-June 2024), much higher than the budgetary target of 7.5 percent for the fiscal.In the previous 2022-23 fiscal year, overall inflation was 9.02 percent.The heat wave that has scorched Asia over the past few weeks has hit Malaysia hard, with a water shortage threatening national food security and hurting key industries.Experts said the falling water reserves in the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia have shown the "broader impact" of climate change.Malaysia's National Disaster Management Agency said that as of Aug 5, raw water reserves at the Muda Dam in Kedah, the Bukit Merah Dam in Perak and the Teluk Bahang Dam in Penang have dropped to a "dangerous level" of 7.44 percent, 16.43 percent and 28.20 percent, respectively.Likewise, water reserves in five other dams in the states of Kedah, Penang and Perlis have reached a warning level of less than 59.99 percent.Serina Abdul Rahman, a lecturer at the Department of Southeast Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore, said that while Malaysia goes through cycles of drought and flooding every year, this seasonal occurrence is happening more severely and frequently."Climate change has made extreme weather phenomena more frequent and this ranges from high temperatures to more severe storms," Serina said.Extreme heat for prolonged periods, coupled with lack of rain, dries out the dams and reduces water availability, she said.Mohamad Faiz Mohd Amin, an associate professor of earth science at the Universiti Malaysia Kelantan, said the current drought in Northern Malaysia is "a stark indication of the broader impacts of climate change".Mohamad Faiz, who is also an invited researcher at the Water Resources Research Center at Kyoto University in Japan, said data showed that average temperatures have increased and rainfall patterns have become erratic in the past few years. These factors have reduced reservoir water availability, he said.He cited Kedah and Perlis, which are experiencing one of the driest periods in decades.The low water reserves have dried up the paddy fields of Kedah and could potentially slash rice production by as much as 40 percent, he said. This could lead to higher food prices and a shortage of the national staple as Kedah is the country's rice bowl.Reduced water levels are increasing the concentrations of pollutants and cutting oxygen levels, he said, which can kill fish populations and lead to a decline in biodiversity.The effect could be felt beyond the food and agricultural sector. Other water-intensive industries may face production cuts and the tourism industry could suffer as natural attractions such as rivers and lakes dry up, Mohamad Faiz said.The Malaysian Institute of Economic Research has estimated that water shortages could result in a 0.5 percent reduction in GDP growth, he said.Health issuesWater rationing is being implemented in many areas and residents are experiencing intermittent water supply, which disrupts daily activities and increases the risk of waterborne diseases and other health issues, he said.Citing data from the Malaysian Health Ministry, Mohamad Faiz said the incidence of waterborne diseases rises by 15 percent during prolonged dry periods as the dry spell usually compromises water quality.Serina from the National University of Singapore said water shortage "makes life very difficult for citizens no matter where they are"."The water shortages could happen anywhere, and people need to be more careful with water usage," she said.Mohamad Faiz said the situation stresses the urgent need for national climate adaptation strategies.There is a need for comprehensive policies on water management, infrastructure resilience and community preparedness, as well as investment in climate-resilient infrastructure and sustainable practices for long-term adaptation, he said.Officials from China and the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations reaffirmed on Monday their commitment to exploring new areas and unlocking new opportunities for cooperation and innovation, in order to pave the way for a more prosperous and sustainable future.They made the pledge at the opening ceremony of the ASEAN-China Week 2024 held in Changzhi, a city in North China's Shanxi province, vowing to build a closer community with a shared future for China and ASEAN.In a congratulatory message sent to the event, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China and ASEAN, as friendly neighbors and vibrant markets, enjoy boundless potential in their relationship.Wang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, expressed the hope that the countries could leverage complementary advantages, accelerate coordinated development, and jointly foster and strengthen new quality productive forces to inject fresh impetus into respective development and revitalization as well as boost regional stability and prosperity.The third plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee held last month reaffirmed high-quality development as the primary task in seeking Chinese modernization, with fostering new quality productive forces being one of the key instruments toward that goal.The term "new quality productive forces" is also gaining attention from ASEAN countries in the context of pursuing quality economic growth and cooperation in the long run."Innovation, as we all recognize, is the key to unlocking new avenues of growth and ensuring that our economies remain resilient and competitive in the global landscape," said Neth Pheaktra, Cambodia's minister of information.He said that new areas of collaboration in sectors such as the digital economy and green technologies are emerging, and the ongoing implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement and the progress of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement 3.0 would continue to bolster economic ties.According to statistics from ASEAN, the trade volume between the two sides reached a record of $702.3 billion last year, making China the group's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years.The Cambodian minister also spoke highly of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, saying that over the past decade, the BRI has been "a key driver" of Cambodia's infrastructure, trade and economic growth, and has brought significant infrastructure developments to the region.Moving forward, Pheaktra said he believed the innovation-driven and interconnected ASEAN-China cooperation will deliver benefits to all peoples in the region.Thet Thet Khine, Myanmar's union minister for hotels and tourism, said: "Innovation, in all its forms, is the cornerstone of sustainable development. I am particularly excited about the role that innovation can play in our industry. Tourism has been a vital component of the economies of both ASEAN and China."Noting that 2024 has been designated as the ASEAN-China Year of People-to-People Exchanges, she underscored the need to leverage innovative practices to create more resilient and sustainable tourism, and enhance cultural exchanges to build trust and strengthen bonds between ASEAN and China.Also at Monday's event, Shi Zhongjun, secretary-general of the ASEAN-China Center, announced the official launch of the ASEAN-China Import and Export Service Platform.The platform, which is already in operation, has received thousands of cooperation requests and is expected to generate an annual market demand of more than $10 billion in the future, Shi added.Jin Xiangjun, governor of Shanxi province, said the ASEAN-China Week serves as a bond to strengthen cooperation and exchanges between the province and ASEAN member states, and called for deepening cooperation in areas such as trade, education, culture and tourism.With melodious Nepalese music playing in the background, a dancer gracefully twirls and leaps on a vibrant stage. Adorned in a traditional Nepalese gunio choli in red and yellow hues, her attire flows elegantly with her movements.The inauguration of The Nepal Culture Promotion Center, along with the "Belt and Road" — Light of Culture 2024 Traditional Cultural Exchange Activity took place in Beijing on August 8.The event was organized by the China-Nepal Culture Exchange Center and drew a diverse group of participants, including experts in Chinese and Nepalese culture, tourism, and society.As an important platform to showcase and disseminate the traditional culture of China and Nepal, the "Belt and Road" — Light of Culture 2024 project aims to further promote in-depth cooperation between the two countries in the cultural field through a variety of projects such as art exhibitions and traditional performances.Bishnu Pukar Shrestha, Nepalese Ambassador to China, highlighted the rich cultural connection between the two countries that dates back to ancient times."Over the years, we have consistently shared stories that symbolize the enduring cultural ties between our nations," he said.Li Bo, President of the China-Nepal Culture Exchange Center, remarked at the ceremony: "In China, the venerable sage Laozi resides, while in Nepal, the esteemed sage Siddhartha Gautama abides. It is through the boundless wisdom of these sages that our spirits intertwine."In 2017, China and Nepal signed Memorandums of Understanding to enhance cooperation. This year marks the 69th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries."China's assistance in Nepal's development has promoted the further deepening of relations between the two countries. In particular, infrastructure, investment, trade, tourism, health, agriculture, information and telecommunication technology, and medical areas have benefited," ambassador Shrestha said."Nepal-China relations are an exemplar of barrier-free exchanges, peace, and friendship between two countries of different sizes and systems," Shrestha said.Hu Xinyue contributed to this story.SYDNEY -- The pilot of a helicopter that crashed into the roof of a hotel in Australia's Far North Queensland early Monday morning has died while two other people were injured in the incident, local media reported.The pilot was a man in his 40s, the Sydney Morning Herald reported, adding that an 83-year-old man and a 76-year-old woman were taken to hospital in a stable condition.Police have declared an emergency around the DoubleTree by Hilton on Cairns Esplanade and evacuated up to 400 people after the crash, according to the Australian ABC News broadcaster.The Cairns Post reported earlier that there were grave concerns about the male pilot, who was assessed at the scene and was reported to have sustained life-threatening injuries.According to the report, a man in his 80s and a woman in her 70s who were staying in a hotel room near the crash site suffered from smoke inhalation. They were treated for their injuries and taken to Cairns Hospital for further medical attention.Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are keen to explore nuclear energy to meet climate commitments and promote energy security, but they still need to overcome concerns over safety and funding, a regional forum heard recently."The energy needs of our regions are growing, and finding reliable, sustainable solutions is more crucial than ever. Nuclear energy, with its potential to provide consistent and low-carbon power, is a topic that we can't afford to overlook," Beni Suryadi, deputy executive director of ASEAN Center for Energy, told a forum it organized in Jakarta on Friday.The ASEAN Energy Booklet Volume 2: Nuclear Energy Development in ASEAN, was launched during the forum, featuring regional nuclear energy development, nuclear power's role in ASEAN's energy transition and advancements in nuclear technologies.Marcel Nicky Arianto, associate research analyst on power at ASEAN Center for Energy, said that while ASEAN countries aim to reach carbon neutrality by generating renewable energy such as solar and wind, they are not stable sources of power owing to their intermittency. But he said nuclear energy will not only cut carbon emissions but is also a stable and flexible energy source.As of 2022, more than 66 percent of the power generated in the ASEAN region was from coal and gas, while renewables accounted for about 33 percent.Arianto said the first step in deploying nuclear power in the region is for the governments to have "a strong political will" to use nuclear power as a means to secure energy supply and transition to a cleaner source of fuel; to create policies and laws on nuclear development; and to build the nuclear power plants.Significant progressThe ASEAN booklet has highlighted several countries that have made significant progress in their plan to use nuclear energy in the future. Indonesia, for example, has regulatory and research agencies on nuclear power and is planning to develop its first nuclear reactor by 2035. Vietnam is likewise conducting research and plans to have a small-scale nuclear reactor after 2030, while Thailand is eyeing building a power plant by 2036.But Arianto said ASEAN is facing many challenges in building nuclear power plants, the most crucial of which is ASEAN's geographic location as some countries are located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and concerns over nuclear waste management. The Fukushima nuclear accident and the Chernobyl disaster are also weighing on plans to develop a nuclear energy policy.Brianna Lazerwitz, energy economist at the International Atomic Energy Agency, said that while nuclear projects share similarities with other large scale, capital-intensive infrastructure projects, they also "present unique considerations, and that translates to unique risks for investors".prime@chinadailyapac.com KABUL - A blast was heard in Dasht-e-Barchi locality on the western edge of Afghanistan's capital city Kabul on Sunday, casualties feared.China has lodged solemn representations with Japan, urging it to immediately rectify erroneous actions after Japan twice took actions against Taiwan fishing vessels.It's reported that two Taiwan fishing vessels were detained by Japanese official ships and accused of violating fisheries regulations. The boats and the crew were released after paying fines.The Chinese government attaches great importance to safeguarding the legitimate interests of Chinese fishermen, including those from the Taiwan region, a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement.According to the China-Japan Fisheries Agreement, Japan has no right to enforce measures against Chinese fishing vessels in relevant waters, the statement said.Beijing demands Tokyo to correct mistakes and take effective measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again, the spokesperson said.TOKYO -- An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.3 on Friday struck Japanese prefecture of Kanagawa, south of Tokyo, local weather agency said.The temblor occurred at 7:57 pm local time, measuring lower 5 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7, said the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).At a depth of 10 km, the epicenter was located off the western Kanagawa prefecture at a latitude of 35.4 degrees north and a longitude of 139.2 degrees east, said the JMA.The tremor was strongly felt in Tokyo and Saitama prefecture, with no tsunami warning issued. Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka will pay a 10-day official visit to China starting from Monday, the first of its kind since taking the office in 2022.During the visit, leaders of the two countries will have in-depth exchanges of views on major issues of common concern, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Friday.China has received several leaders of Pacific Island countries this year and Prime Minister Rabuka is yet another Pacific Island country leader set to visit the country, which Mao said speaks to the close relations between China and the South Pacific region.Fiji is the first Pacific Island country to have established diplomatic ties with China.China hopes to take the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries to a new level and work with Fiji to build an even closer community with a shared future between China and Pacific Island countries, Mao said.Young Cambodian graduate Uk Sophearith hopes to make a meaningful contribution to the people living in the Lancang-Mekong River region by seizing the opportunities provided by a multilateral framework.Known as the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, or LMC, the framework was established in 2016 between China and five Southeast Asian countries along the river."For young individuals like myself, close cooperation across the Lancang-Mekong countries offers fascinating potential," Uk, who graduated recently from the Royal University of Phnom Penh, told China Daily.In July, Uk and his two teammates from China and Vietnam won the Best International Team award for their project, which offers affordable and accessible yoga classes to students to improve their mental health. They won the award at the eighth Youth Innovation Competition on Lancang-Mekong Region's Governance and Development, held at the Phuket Campus of Prince of Songkla University in Thailand.Lancang-Mekong River refers to the waterway that flows across six countries. Originating from China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, it is called Lancang River in China, while further downstream — after flowing out of Southwest China's Yunnan province — it is known as Mekong River, running across Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.Since the launch of the cooperation mechanism, member countries have been upholding the principle of "shared river and shared future" and jointly promoted the high-quality cooperation of the Belt and Road Initiative, turning it into a "golden model" of regional cooperation.The resolution adopted by the third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee on July 18 states that China will continue improving the mechanisms for high-quality cooperation under the BRI.This includes promoting cooperation in science, technology and innovation, redoubling efforts to develop multilateral platforms for cooperation in green development, the digital economy, disaster mitigation and others, which are expected to elevate LMC regional collaboration.Referring to the LMC framework, Uk said: "Expanded educational exchange programs may result from increased regional integration, giving me the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a variety of viewpoints."Cooperation in different industries will also generate new jobs, he added."I hope that more Mekong countries can grow like China," said Khun Zaw, founder and CEO of Densilar, a Myanmar-based company in the avocado industry.Noting that China has become a leader in technology and innovation, Khun Zaw said he hopes to see more cooperation in agricultural technology among the Lancang-Mekong countries, so that the neighbors can learn from China and prosper together.In July, Khun Zaw participated for the first time in the Lancang-Mekong Youth Entrepreneurs Forum in Kunming, Yunnan. During the gathering, he also met potential business partners from China and Cambodia, and is now preparing for follow-up meetings.Khun Zaw said the LMC framework provides a good platform for regional young entrepreneurs to know and network with each other.Working togetherChhay Hongmey, 18, a member of the Youth Empowerment in Climate Action Platform, told China Daily that she is interested in the training programs for youth under the LMC framework because it is important for the region's young people to work together on climate issues.The platform was established in 2020 by the United Nations Development Programme in Asia-Pacific in collaboration with its partners to engage regional youth in climate action.Chhay was a speaker at an event on climate adaptation actions and community practice sharing in 2023. The event was held at UNICEF China during the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Week in April last year.Chhay, who is working on tackling food waste in Cambodia, said she was inspired by discussions on agroecology and sustainable agriculture at the LMC event.Having read the Five-Year Plan of Action on Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (2023-2027), Chhay said the framework can make a big contribution to capacity-building, joint research and technical exchange in terms of tackling climate change challenges and facilitating water management across nations."I hope the LMC can be turned into a total green project so we can be more sustainable," said Chhay. She added that China's experience, technology and funding will be helpful for the region to implement relevant projects.Uk, the Cambodian graduate, said young people have the potential to promote the development of the Lancang-Mekong region because their energy, innovation and cultural understanding can position them as catalysts for positive changes."In the future, I hope to work across borders to gain significant expertise and knowledge while also contributing to the prosperity of the region."The Organization of Islamic Cooperation held Israel responsible for the attack on Hamas leader while affirming Iran's right to retaliate in an Iran-initiated emergency meeting.In a final communique adopted by the OIC and foreign ministers of its 57 member states on Aug 7, the OIC holds Israel "fully responsible for this heinous attack", the communique read, which it said constitutes "a crime of aggression, a flagrant violation of international law and the UN Charter and a serious infringement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran".Ismail Haniyeh, former Palestinian prime minister and head of Hamas' political bureau, was assassinated in the Iranian capital Teheran on July 31 by a projectile attack against his residence.The Muslim bloc called on refraining from engaging in any kind of assistance, cooperation, or support to Israel, which it called "the occupying power".They said such support "would prolong Israel's illegal occupation of the Palestinian territory", grant it impunity, and embolden it to "continue its crimes and flagrant violations of international law and relevant UN resolutions". And key powers in the international community are called to uphold their responsibilities in ending the 10-month conflict in Gaza.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on his X account that in the terminology of the US and Europe, those who defend their land against foreign occupation forces and fight for their home, family, and human dignity are branded terrorists.Similarly, any party who supported oppressed people under occupation "is a sponsor of terrorism", he said.This is in contrast to the West's view of Israel, he said."The occupying regime and killer of more than 40,000 people in 10 months — of whom about 10,000 are children — is not branded terrorist, but deserves ovation and applause and all-out political, security, military and arms support," Kanaani wrote."The West has lost its integrity and honor in the Gaza war and is seriously suffering moral decay and civilizational collapse," he added.Tensions remained high this week following Haniyeh's assassination. Iran, Palestine's Hamas, and Lebanon-based Hezbollah have threatened to retaliate against Israel.The ongoing conflict has already prompted some governments to issue travel advisories for their citizens in Middle Eastern countries or those planning to travel there to avoid the conflict hotspots.The United States, the United Kingdom, and France appealed to their citizens to immediately leave Lebanon.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that "no one should escalate" the conflict in the Middle East. He said that the US has been engaged in intense diplomacy with its partners and had communicated directly to Iran and Israel.He reiterated that the US would continue to defend Israel against attacks from terrorist groups or their sponsors, just as they would "continue to defend our troops"."It's urgent that everyone in the region takes stock of the situation, understand the risk of miscalculation, and make decisions that will calm tensions and not exacerbate them," said Blinken.His comments came during a joint press conference with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, and Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles in Annapolis, Maryland, US.Arhama Siddiqa, a Middle East analyst and research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan, told China Daily it was "no secret" that US support for Israel has long been a cornerstone of its foreign policy and deeply rooted in historical precedent."The Zionist lobby wields considerable influence over American political, economic, and social spheres. However, every action has its limits, and now US support for Israel is generating significant backlash," said Siddiqa.She said if the US were to navigate this turmoil, the Biden administration must pressure Netanyahu into agreeing to a cease-fire as the Israeli prime minister's actions "are central to the ongoing conflict"."The US currently has a narrow window of opportunity to address the severe and unprecedented backlash (against Israel). This moment is critical, as domestic and international criticism has reached an all-time high," said Siddiqa.Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told CNN that he believed a cease-fire could be achieved but lamented the actions of Netanyahu."The challenge that we have is that every time we get near, Israel does something that complicates the situation further, including, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in the middle of negotiations," Safadi told CNN.Safadi said their message to the world was "enough is enough" and that the only path forward was to bring about an immediate cease-fire that would help de-escalate the regional situation.This will "save the region from the abyss of further conflict" and protect it from "the agenda of Netanyahu who continues to provoke, continues to escalate", he said."So, the question is do we allow Netanyahu and his radical government to impose their agenda on the region and doom it to a future of more conflict?""Or do we do what we all believe is right and bring about that permanent and immediate cease-fire and then work with everybody to make sure that we are on a path that will ensure that everything that has happened since Oct 7 does not happen again?", referring to the day that Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel.TOKYO -- A 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Miyazaki Prefecture and other areas in southwestern Japan on Thursday, the country's weather agency said.Tsunami advisories have been issued for Miyazaki, Kochi, Ehime, Oita, Kagoshima prefectures on the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).Miyazaki Port in the southern Miyazaki Prefecture was hit by 50 cm tsunami waves following the quake, the JMA said.No abnormalities were found in nuclear plants near the quake-hit area, Kyodo News reported.Kyushu Shinkansen bullet train service was halted after the quake, the report added.The earthquake, measuring lower 6 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7, occurred at 16:43 local time. At a depth of 30 km, the epicenter was located off the waters of Hyuga-nada in southern Kyushu, according to the weather agency.The magnitude had been revised to 7.1 from 6.9.China's efforts to promote new quality productive forces will significantly contribute to the development of a pan-Asia rail network, experts say.This is especially true in Southeast Asia, they said, where China has provided technology for high-speed railways and supported the establishment of international cargo rail services. Examples include the recently launched ASEAN cargo express and the China-Laos Railway, a key project under the Belt and Road Initiative.The resolution adopted by the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stressed the importance of "improving the institutions and mechanisms for fostering new quality productive forces in line with local conditions". China is supporting all-round innovation, with education, science and technology, and talent as the basic and strategic underpinnings for Chinese modernization, all to benefit countries taking part in the BRI.Linda Tjia Yin Nor, an associate professor at the department of public and international affairs, City University of Hong Kong, said China's promotion of new quality productive forces is centered on innovation. This approach goes beyond developing the state-of-the-art technology; it also focuses on leveraging the existing technologies to benefit a broader population.Drawing on her extensive research on Chinese and Japanese railway technology, Tjia highlighted the current railway partnership between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China. She said ASEAN countries need a reliable and safe railway that is suitable for the local market, rather than "very expensive and exceptionally sophisticated "railway technologies.Boosting tradeTjia cited the ASEAN cargo express, which links Malaysia, Thailand and Laos with China, facilitating trade between ASEAN and China.The cargo express recently completed a 14-day trip from Chongqing, returning to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on July 11. The train, operated by Malaysia's railway company KTMB, traveled through Thailand and Laos. KTMB is planning to make two to three trips per month at present.Chin Yew Sin, president of the Malaysia Strategy Research Center, a Kuala Lumpur-based think tank, said the ASEAN cargo express will enhance both intraregional connectivity among ASEAN countries and external connectivity with China.It is important for ASEAN to develop a regional railway express, he said, noting its cost-effectiveness compared with air or sea transport.Chin estimates the ASEAN cargo express will reduce transportation costs between Malaysia and China by 30 percent.Rosli Azad Khan, managing director of MDS Traffic Planners & Consultants, a transport consultancy firm in Kuala Lumpur, said the launch of the ASEAN cargo express is timely in light of the sharp rise in global shipping costs.The current Palestine-Israel conflict has spurred attacks by Yemen's Houthi group on ships plying the Red Sea. The intensified attacks in the strategic waterway have disrupted shipping routes and increased freight rates.The Drewry World Container Index, which monitors the freight market, reported that on July 18, shipping prices for a 40-foot (12-meter) standard container rose to $5,937, nearly four times more than the $1,488 quoted in July last year.Expanding marketsKriengsak Chareonwongsak, president of the Institute of Future Studies for Development in Thailand, said the ASEAN cargo express has given both China and ASEAN chances to expand their markets. But this service can only be sustained if the benefits are distributed among participating countries, he said. "Laos and Thailand can't just be a way to pass through."The ASEAN cargo express is just the latest of the China-ASEAN railway partnership.Another significant component of this partnership is the China-Laos Railway, which was launched in December 2021, linking Vientiane, the capital of Laos, with Kunming in Yunnan province.It has become a key logistics route in the region, facilitating the transportation of 4.18 million metric tons of cargo from the Yexianggu station in Yunnan as of May, said Chen Haican, the station's railway freight duty officer.Anongdeth Phetkaysone, deputy managing director of the Lao Ministry of Public Works and Transport and deputy general manager of the Laos-China Railway Company, said the railway is "very important and crucial" to Laos' socioeconomic development.He emphasized Laos' agricultural focus and its geographical proximity to major agricultural nations such as Thailand and Vietnam."If the Vientiane South Station can be a hub that can transit not just domestic goods ... our main vision is that we try to connect China and ASEAN so that products from ASEAN can be linked to the Chinese mainland," Anongdeth told a media group led by China Daily and the Chinese mission to ASEAN in June."If we can reach this, it would mean huge benefit not only to Laos but also other ASEAN countries."Yang Han in Hong Kong contributed to this story.Thailand will boost the country's digital security and competitiveness, increase investment and empower human capital to promote the kingdom as a digital economy hub for Southeast Asia, a senior official revealed on Wednesday.Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Techsauce Global Summit in Bangkok, Thai Minister of Digital Economy and Society Prasert Jantararuangtong said the country will continue to move ahead in its "Thailand Vision" and build itself into a regional digital hub."We will enhance our digital security and competitiveness by investing more in infrastructure to ensure data security. The ministry will also give more support to technology research and development," Prasert said.He noted that artificial intelligence will play an important role in the map of the country's technology growth, as well as confirming that Thailand will build open data centers to support AI solutions and data sharing.Earlier this year, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin unveiled the "Thailand Vision", which laid out ambitious plans for the country to become a regional hub for tourism, medical treatment, food, aviation, logistics, electric vehicles, digital economy and finance.Srettha said his government would support the development of technology innovations and AI and would provide investment privileges for high-tech firms to open semiconductor factories or open data centers in Thailand to facilitate cloud computing.Thailand's data center market has been ranked the third largest among member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.It continues to post significant growth, thanks to the investment requirements among global and local providers operating in the industry, according to a recent report by Thailand's Kasikorn Research Center.It is estimated that investment in data centers in Thailand will reach $7.8 billion between 2024 and 2027.The predicted industry demand for digital talent means Thailand will also face a shortage of about 600,000 highly skilled digital experts by 2027."We will offer digital literacy courses suitable for laborers in the digital economy, as well as create awareness of digital skills among people. And we will further support knowledge exchange and training to increase Thailand's digital workforce," Prasert said.As Southeast Asia's leading tech event, Techsauce Global Summit aims to position Thailand as the digital gateway to the region. It is a pivotal gathering for tech and startup enthusiasts, driving innovation and digital advancement across the region."Southeast Asia is a market with great future potential where the digital economy will see a promising surge in a wide range of fields from people's daily life to the public application scenarios, such as in the government or the enterprises," said Zhou Chuanfu, vice-president of iFlytek Open Platform.As a Chinese AI company focusing on speech recognition technology, iFlytek entered the Thai market last year.At the summit, it demonstrated models and services including a multilingual translation model that supports real-time translation on a dual-sided screen. Its transparency enhances communication by allowing users to see information and each other's facial expressions through the screen."Now we are collaborating with local companies in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, using our innovation and successful experiences to speed up the region's step toward the AI trend," Zhou said.Zhou said AI can be well employed in tourism and service industries, which are among the major supporting sectors of the economy in many Southeast Asian countries."For example, our digital human customer service model can provide answers to user inquiries. The round-the-clock service that offers a variety of digital avatars and voices will be very efficient and labor-saving," he added.Amid calls for greater cooperation between the two countries, latest analysis shows that Australia's trade with China has significantly benefited Australian households.Addressing a news briefing on Friday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said that "China's development is an opportunity, not a challenge for Australia," as Beijing called for increased cooperation with Australia.Highlighting a report jointly published by the Australia China Business Council and Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre, an independent economic and social research organization, Lin said facts and statistics mentioned in the report reveal the enormous benefits that trade with China has brought for Australians and the win-win nature of China-Australia trade ties.The report, titled Australia's Trade and Economic Relationship with China, estimated that Australia's trade with China increased the average Australian household's disposable income by an average of AU$2,600 ($1,706) in the financial year 2022-23, which equals 4.6 percent of the average household's disposable income. It noted that the two-way trade with China in 2022-23 created about 595,600 jobs, accounting for 4.2 percent of the total employment in Australia.Lin said that strong economic ties will also help keep global industrial and supply chains stable and fully functional, with the links contributing to the sustained economic recovery of the two countries, the region and the wider world."China stands ready to work with Australia to take the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries as a new beginning, implement the important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries and the deliverables of Premier Li Qiang's June visit to Australia, explore new cooperation areas, make the pie of mutually beneficial cooperation bigger, and deliver more benefits to the two peoples," Lin added.The trading relationship also provides affordable goods and services to Australians, according to the report, with imports from China ranging from electronics to everyday consumer items. This accessibility has helped maintain a lower cost of living for Australians. Households in the country would be paying 4.2 percent more for the same consumption items without China as a major import partner.Chen Xiaochen, executive deputy director of the Centre for Asia Pacific Studies at East China Normal University, said the latest findings come at a time of warming relations but it is also important to recognize the undercurrents of skepticism driven by ideological concerns."Some people believe that the China-Australia economic and trade relationship is not important and have security anxieties. This report addresses these concerns," Chen said."The Australian business community uses this report to visually and quantitatively demonstrate the importance of China-Australia trade to the Australian public. Sometimes, China-Australia trade is like air and water, unnoticed but deeply integrated in Australia's economic development and improvement of living standards. This report brings these unnoticed aspects to the forefront, which is its value," he said.There is also no "security-economy dichotomy" as some Australians think, Chen added. He urged Australian policymakers to reflect on the country's culture of security anxiety and ideology-first mentality, pointing out that Australia has excessively adopted a United States-first mindset, which needs to be reconsidered.Stock markets in Asia, Europe and the United States stabilized on Tuesday and Wednesday, after massive earlier volatility over fears that the US was heading for a recession.The sell-off began on Friday, after US employment figures were down on what was expected.The data followed several other releases of bad news, including poor returns from some technology companies, and the US Federal Reserve leaving interest rates at 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent, instead of cutting them.Asian markets were also shaken by last week's surprise Bank of Japan interest rate rise.However, after the sharp falls, stocks rallied, particularly in Japan on Wednesday, after Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida said in a speech that there had been volatility in domestic and overseas financial markets, but that "it is necessary to maintain current levels of monetary easing for the time being".Markets interpreted this as a signal there will not be additional rate hikes this year, and that there will not be a risk of overtightening.The yen shifted from 144.7 against the US dollar to 146.82 and the Topix index closed 2.3 percent higher. The rally included the Nikkei 225 index, which features technology and retail companies, closing 1.2 percent higher.The rebound followed Japanese stocks falling a combined 20 percent over three sessions between Thursday and Monday, the biggest drop on record and equal to a $1.1-trillion loss.Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi index rose almost 2 percent in Wednesday trading, and Taiwan's benchmark index closed almost 4 percent up. India's benchmark Nifty 50 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng were also up by more than 1 percent.A similar story also emerged in European and US markets, with the S&P 500 rising by 0.7 percent and the technology-focused Nasdaq up 0.5 percent.London's FTSE 100 futures was up 1 percent and Europe's Stoxx 50 saw a rise of 0.8 percent.Sho Nakazawa, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley MUFG, told the Financial Times that volatility had calmed, but was likely not over."The biggest concern among market participants is whether pessimism over the US economic outlook has gone too far," Nakazawa said. "The markets will remain highly sensitive to US inflation and job statistics for the foreseeable future."And economist Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens' College at the University of Cambridge, told the BBC: "What happens in the US, economically and financially, does not stay in the US. The US has been the major driver of global economic growth, the US consumer is a very important engine of economic activity, so the world as a whole would suffer if the US were to go into recession."Thailand Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the Move Forward Party (MFP) on Wednesday, with the top party officials banned from politics for 10 years for undermining the monarchy.The verdict to dissolve the party, which came close to taking power in last year's general election but ultimately failed, is over their efforts to reform the lese majeste law, also known as Section 112 of the Criminal Law.Announcing their unanimous ruling at 3 pm on Wednesday, the nine judges said the party posed a threat to the constitutional monarchy and national security by continuously and seriously campaigning for the amendment of Section 112 of the Criminal Code.During last year's general election, the party proposed to amend the law through many political activities and channels.In April, the Election Commission of Thailand requested that the Constitutional Court should consider dissolving the party as they posed a threat to both the monarchy and the democratic form of government with the king as head of state.According to the court, such attempts diminished the value of the royal institution, showed intention to abuse the royal institution for political gain in the general election, hurt people' s faith in the institution and affected national security, local media Bangkok Post reported."Expressions of opinion toward legal amendments and the vote campaigns posed significant threats to national security," it said.In addition to the dissolution, the court imposed a 10-year ban on 11 members of the party's executives who held positions between March 25, 2021, and July 31 last year. The list includes the party leader Pita Limjaroenrat and the first Secretary-General of the party Chaithawat Tulathon, who is also the deputy leader.KATHMANDU -- Four Chinese nationals were killed when a helicopter crashed in Nuwakot district of Nepal's Bagmati province on Wednesday afternoon, the Chinese Embassy in Nepal confirmed."The helicopter belonging to Air Dynasty has crashed. We have found four dead bodies," Tilak Bharati, spokesperson for the district police, told Xinhua.He said the helicopter was flying from Kathmandu to Syafrubesi in Rasuwa district when it went down in Nuwakot's Shivapuri. The Chinese embassy confirmed that the four passengers onboard are Chinese nationals.The helicopter with four Chinese nationals aboard lost contact with the control tower in Kathmandu three minutes after taking off, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said in a statement, noting it crashed at 13:54 local time.Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has expressed his sadness over the incident.KATHMANDU -- A helicopter crashed in Nuwakot district of Nepal's Bagmati province on Wednesday afternoon, with four bodies having been found, local police said."The helicopter belonging to Air Dynasty has crashed. We have found four dead bodies," Tilak Bharati, spokesperson for the district police, told Xinhua.DHAKA -- Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus will serve as the head of Bangladesh's interim government, local media reported early Wednesday.The decision was taken at a meeting of President Mohammed Shahabuddin with chiefs of the three services and the coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement to finalize the outline of the interim government on Tuesday night, Bangladesh's state-run news agency BSS reported.The head of state gave consent to the proposal of the meeting, the president's Press Secretary Md. Joynal Abedin told the news agency.Shahabuddin said other members of the interim government would be finalized in consultation with other political parties of the country.According to the report, Shahabuddin said during the meeting that as Bangladesh is passing through a deep crisis and in order to resolve the problem, an interim government must be formed as soon as possible. He urged everyone to work together to resolve the crisis.Earlier Tuesday, Shahabuddin dissolved the parliament, paving the way for the formation of an interim government following the fall of the government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Bangladesh is facing uncertainty after the resignation and fleeing of Hasina on Monday.Sri Lanka's new national industry policy and five-year strategic plan should help the island nation boost its manufacturing sector and exports, aiding broader economic recovery and enhancing the country's presence in the global markets, experts said.Sri Lanka's Ministry of Industries has prepared a new national industry policy in a bid to boost manufacturing output, as part of wider efforts to shore up the national economy.Sirimal Abeyratne, a professor of economics at the University of Colombo, said the manufacturing sector has no limits to expansion, unlike agriculture."It is essentially a 'tradable sector' that (will) help the country to expand its presence in the global markets and integrate with global value chains," he told China Daily.Strengthening manufacturing will have a positive knock-on effect on other sectors, including agriculture and service sectors, he said."The Ministry of Industries has played a crucial role in reviving the country's economy amid past economic crises. Our goals for 2030 include increasing the manufacturing sector's contribution to gross domestic product from 16 percent to 20 percent, raising the role of entrepreneurship in the workforce from 2.8 percent to 7 percent, and boosting industrial exports' contribution to GDP from 14 percent to 20 percent," Secretary to the Ministry of Industries Shantha Weerasinghe said during a news briefing on July 31.To achieve these objectives and build a globally competitive national industry base in Sri Lanka, a five-year strategic plan for 2023-27 has been prepared and submitted to the Department of National Planning, the official said."The new national industry policy and the five-year strategic plan of Sri Lanka will be the cornerstone of progress in its ongoing economic development," said Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at National University of Singapore Business School.Urgency of recoveryThe expert noted that Sri Lanka is in urgent need of economic recovery after recent downturns."The policy and plan will set the direction for a whole-of-country approach to harness resources and investments to attain a strong economic growth momentum," Loh said.The Ministry of Industries has introduced a registration system for manufacturing industries, Weerasinghe said on July 31.Also, the government has allocated funds for a loan scheme to enhance leadership and entrepreneurship in small and medium enterprises. "The manufacturing sector will be particularly critical for Sri Lanka as it can tap into human capital more rapidly than the services sector," said Loh from Singapore."The country will have a better comparative advantage in the manufacturing sector as the costs can be lower at the onset."However, to boost the expansion of manufacturing industries, Sri Lanka will need to lean on globalizing countries such as China for technical expertise and business opportunities, he said.James Chin, professor of Asian Studies at the University of Tasmania in Australia, said the Sri Lankan economy is picking up again, which will boost trade prospects for the island nation."It is highly expected that trade in Sri Lanka will pick up for the rest of this year and next year, as the world trade recovers," he added.Xinhua contributed to this story.The Philippine authorities need to support small and medium enterprises, streamline business processing systems, and invest in infrastructure and human resources so that the country can attract more investments and create more jobs, a forum in Manila has heard."Ease of doing business is the key," Cecilio Pedro, president of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said during the hybrid forum it organized on Monday.Pedro said that starting a business in the Philippines can be a long and tedious process as investors need to secure many permits from different agencies and wait for weeks before the papers can be processed. This is why, he said, it is difficult for the Philippines to compete with other Southeast Asian countries when it comes to attracting more investments.According to a World Bank report on ease of doing business, the Philippines ranked 95th out of the 190 economies with a score of 62.8.Investors need 33 days and go through 13 procedures before they can set up a business in the Philippines. This is higher than the average 25.6 days and 6.6 procedures in East Asia and the Pacific region.Pedro said enforcing energy reforms, such as the adoption of nuclear energy that can lower high electric power rates, can also attract more investors.Pedro said a lot of Filipinos go abroad owing to a lack of opportunities in their home country. The Philippines is one of the world's biggest labor exporters, with more than 10 million Filipinos living overseas."Filipino workers are good, world-class, that's why companies abroad hire them," he said. But the problem is the Philippines is not benefiting from this brain drain, Pedro said, and that is why it is important to make the Philippines "a beautiful place to invest in and a beautiful place to do business".Fiscal incentivesPhilippine Senator Imee Marcos said other Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam provide better fiscal incentives compared with the Philippines. She said it also does not help that a lot of highly skilled Filipinos migrate to greener pastures, and that the country has high electricity rates.Marcos said the government needs to help micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the rural areas. The government can offer idle lands for free and capital loans to budding entrepreneurs, and provide skills training to workers, she said, adding that authorities can also help these enterprises in conducting research and seizing market opportunities.Marcos called for the promotion of local manufacturers to reduce reliance on business process outsourcing and remittances from overseas Filipino workers. The outsourcing industry accounts for roughly 8 percent of the Philippines' GDP and employs about 1.7 million people.Marcos, who serves as chairwoman of the foreign relations committee in the Philippines' Senate, also addressed questions on foreign policy. She urged the government to uphold an independent and balanced approach similar to other Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia, which prioritize trade and economic cooperation. China expressed on Tuesday its sincere hope for Bangladesh to restore its social stability at an early date.Bangladesh's President Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved parliament on Tuesday, paving the way for the formation of an interim government following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina amid protests in the South Asian country.China is closely following the developments in Bangladesh, a foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement."As a friendly neighbor and comprehensive strategic cooperative partner of Bangladesh, China sincerely hopes that social stability will be restored soon in the country," the statement said.DHAKA -- Bangladesh's President Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved parliament on Tuesday, paving the way for the formation of an interim government following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.The president also ordered the release of jailed former Prime Minister and key opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia, said a press release from Bangabhaban, the official residence of the president of Bangladesh."The decision to dissolve the parliament was taken following the president's discussions with the three chief of staffs of armed forces, leaders of different political parties, representatives of civil society and leaders of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement," said the press release.Shamsuddin Dider, member of the media wing of Bangladesh Nationalist Party, told Xinhua that the party's chief Khaleda Zia has already been released.The release order came a day after her archrival Hasina resigned and military took power. Hasina fled the country on Monday amid violent protests in the South Asian country.An interim government will be set up to run Bangladesh after Hasina's resignation, according to army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman.Zaman made the remarks in a broadcast to the nation on state television on Monday afternoon. He confirmed earlier media reports on Hasina's resignation."We would now go to the president to form an interim government," said Zaman.Hasina, 76, took office for her fourth straight five-year term as the country's prime minister in January this year after her ruling Bangladesh Awami League (AL) party won a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections.The chief minister of the southern Indian state of Kerala has expressed appreciation toward the Chinese ambassador to India and the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing for their messages of solidarity following last week's devastating landslides in the state that are believed to have claimed more than 350 lives.In a post on social media platform X, the chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said, "We sincerely appreciate the solidarity shown by @China_Amb_India towards the people of Wayanad during this challenging time. Also, the compassionate words of @SpoxCHN_LinJian, extending sympathies to those affected by the landslide, are truly valued.""Your encouragement further motivates us to continue our tireless efforts to rebuild and restore the affected areas," Vijayan wrote.Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian both expressed deep condolences last week over the lives lost in the massive landslides, and expressed heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured.Expressing gratitude to China, Randhir Jaiswal, a spokesperson for India's Ministry of External Affairs, posted on X on Aug 2: "Thank you @MFA_China. We appreciate your message of support and solidarity."Chinese Premier Li Qiang also sent a message to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveying condolences, on behalf of the Chinese government, following the landslide disaster, which hit hilly areas in Kerala's Wayanad district in the early hours of July 30.Search efforts in Wayanad's Mundakkai and Chooralmala continued for the seventh day on Aug 6, and authorities have intensified efforts to recover bodies. As many as 221 bodies and 166 body parts have been recovered from the landslide-hit areas, while 206 persons are still missing.Various unofficial reports, however, say that 351 people have been confirmed dead so far in the catastrophic landslides. The toll could rise further as more people are missing, and rescue workers were retrieving more bodies.Vijayan said the repercussions of the landslide, triggered by heavy rain, were yet to subside. Kerala is still in a state of shock.More personnel and equipment were deployed on Aug 4 to recover bodies, and the work resumed in the morning on Aug 5. Hundreds of personnel from various forces, including the Indian army, Navy, National Disaster Response Force, Coast Guard, and Madras Engineer Group, an engineering unit of the Indian Army, and forest department officials have been deployed in the search and rescue operation.More than 1,000 government employees are currently engaged in the disaster management and relief operations in the landslide-ravaged regions in Wayanad district, Vijayan's office said on Aug 4.At least 9,000 persons displaced by the disaster have sought refuge in government-run relief camps.The Kerala government is planning a township for the survivors "to ensure exemplary rehabilitation for those left homeless in the tragedy, Vijayan said on Aug 3 after a review meeting.The Kerala state government has requested the federal government in New Delhi to declare the catastrophic event as a national disaster.Meanwhile, a political blame game has started between the federal government and the Kerala government, which is governed by the Left Democratic Front, an alliance of left-wing political parties.Kerala government did not gauge the severity of the situation accurately despite the federal government dispatching nine National Disaster Response Force teams to the state on July 23, India's Home Minister Amit Shah said in the national parliament last week."Had those blaming the (union) government read the warnings, the situation would have been different," he declared. The Kerala government has denied that they had been warned beforehand of the potential disaster.The first landslide occurred at 2 am local time on July 30 (04:30 am Beijing Time) when people were asleep, followed by another two hours later.People in Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala villages ran to save their lives. Many of those who stayed were buried by landslides that followed one after the other destroying vital infrastructure like roads, bridges and power lines, along with homes and crops.Kerala, which is flanked by Arabian Sea to its west and the Western Ghats mountain range to the east, is accustomed to intense monsoon rainfall, given its geography.The state was ravaged by Cyclone Ockhi in 2017, and was hit again by massive floods in 2018 which claimed 483 lives and affected millions of people, among the worst in its history.A 2021 study revealed that 59 percent of Kerala's landslides occur in plantation areas, highlighting the impact of land-use changes.Wayanad lost 62 percent of its forest cover between 1950 and 2018, according to a study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. The study also warned that changing climate, stronger monsoon in the past two decades and land cover changes have contributed to increased frequency of the "heavy rainfall events".The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.DHAKA — Bangladesh Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced on Monday that an interim government, with the participation of all parties, will be formed, a local media outlet reported."After holding a fruitful discussion with all political parties, we have decided to form an interim government. We will speak with President Mohammed Shahabuddin now to resolve the situation," he was quoted by Dhaka Tribune as saying.It is reported that Waker-Uz-Zaman called for stopping all violence in the name of protest.This happened soon after Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned amid protests on the same day.Hasina, 76, took office for her fourth straight five-year term as the country's prime minister in January after her ruling Bangladesh Awami League, or AL, party won a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections.According to CNN-News18, Hasina landed in India's northeastern city of Agartala later on Monday after leaving Dhaka.Following weeks of violent demonstrations and clashes with security forces, thousands appeared to have entered Hasina's official residence in Dhaka on Monday.The protests began peacefully as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs, but the demonstrations have since morphed into an unprecedented challenge and uprising against Hasina and her ruling AL party.The government attempted to quell the violence, leaving nearly 300 people dead.At least 95 people, including at least 14 police officers, died in clashes in the capital on Sunday, the country's leading Bengali language daily newspaper Prothom Alo reported. Hundreds more were injured in the violence.At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks. The unrest has also resulted in the closure of schools and universities across the country, and authorities at one point imposed a curfew.Over the weekend, protesters called for a "noncooperation "effort, urging people not to pay taxes or utility bills and not to show up for work on Sunday, a working day in Bangladesh. Offices, banks and factories opened, but commuters in Dhaka and other cities faced challenges getting to their jobs.Hasina offered to talk with student leaders on Saturday, but a coordinator refused and announced a one-point demand for her resignation. Hasina had repeated her pledges to investigate the deaths and punish those responsible for the violence. She said she was ready to sit down whenever the protesters wanted.Xu Weiwei in Hong Kong contributed to this story.Agencies via XinhuaCambodia hosted on Monday a groundbreaking ceremony for Funan Techo Canal, a $1.7 billion project that will link the country's capital Phnom Penh to the sea.The 180-kilometer waterway will be a catalyst for economic growth and trade development when it is completed in 2028, said Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet at the groundbreaking ceremony held in Kandal Province."The Funan Techo Canal … will help enhance Cambodia's economic autonomy through strengthening national independence and ownership in transporting cargoes by waterway," Hun Manet said, as cited by Xinhua News Agency.The project will also facilitate Cambodia's trade exchange with the world, he said.Beginning from the Mekong River's Preak Takeo tributary in Kandal Province, which surrounds Phnom Penh, the project will run through Takeo and Kampot provinces before reaching the coast in southern Kep Province.Initial planning shows the two-lane waterway will be 100 meters wide and 5.4 meters deep, and capable of accommodating cargo vessels of up to 3,000 deadweight tons.It is set to play a key role in the kingdom's aspiration to transform itself into a new logistics and economic hub in the Mekong subregion.Hun Manet said the project will help attract investments in industry, agriculture, logistics, real estate, and other sectors on both sides of the canal.Environmentally friendlySun Chanthol, Cambodian deputy prime minister and first vice-president of the Council for the Development of Cambodia, said the canal will not have any adverse environmental impact.Instead, he said, it will help maintain a stable environment, ecology, and natural habitat for biodiversity.More than 10,000 people attended the groundbreaking ceremony.Different celebrations were held across Cambodia, with concerts and traditional performances commemorating the event.Mey Kalyan, an adviser to the Cambodian government and senior adviser to the Supreme National Economic Council of Cambodia, told China Daily that the canal project will contribute greatly to Cambodia's water management.With most of Cambodia's land area lying within the Mekong River basin, Mey said water management is extremely important to control flooding as well as to make sure water is available for use in the dry season.Floods have posed a recurrent threat to Cambodia as seasonal rains push the levels of the Mekong higher.In 2011, flooding caused more than $625 million in economic losses and catastrophic damage to rural infrastructure, according to the Asian Development Bank.Mey said the canal project will help Cambodia enhance flood control and improve transport, which will eventually create favorable conditions for agriculture, investment, trade and other economic activities."It will open up a new horizon for the development of Cambodia," said Mey.In a commentary published in the Khmer Times newspaper website on Monday, Yen Samnang, a research fellow at the Phnom Penh-based Asian Vision Institute think tank, said the canal project is deemed to foster regional connectivity and economic integration."The project is truly in line with Cambodia's values of sustainability, innovation, and global cooperation," he wrote.kelly@chinadailyapac.comThe first batch of Laotian drivers on the China-Laos Railway has received the license allowing them to drive the bullet train independently, opening a new chapter for Laos' railway industry."This is a major event in the history of Lao transport development and a milestone of the joint efforts between Laos and China to cultivate railway talents for Laos," said Lao Deputy Minister of Public Works and Transport Saysongkham Manodham.His comments came when presenting the licenses to the 14 drivers during a ceremony on Aug 5 at Vientiane Station in the Laotian capital. Under the close cooperation between the governments of Laos and China, the railway — a landmark project of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and bilateral friendship — was inaugurated on Dec 3, 2021, and has been safely operated for 976 days as of Aug 5, said Saysongkham.The 1,035-kilometer railway connects Vientiane with Kunming, the capital of Southwest China's Yunnan province.The electrified passenger and cargo railway is built with the full application of Chinese management and technical standards.Saysongkham said the project has helped Laos to build a modern standard-gauge railway management system from scratch.Lao Deputy Prime Minister Saleumxay Kommasith, Minister of Education and Sports Phout Simmalavong, Secretary General of the Lao People's Revolutionary Youth Union Monxay Laomuaxong, and Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Phongsaisack Inthalath also attended the ceremony.In June 2020, the Laos-China Railway Co (LCRC), a joint venture based in Vientiane responsible for the operation of the Laotian section of the railway, recruited the first batch of local locomotive driver trainees.After theoretical study, practical training, mentorship, and on-site training, a total of 66 assistant drivers were selected.By the end of 2023, about 30 assistant drivers crossed the mileage requirement of 100,000 km. The company then selected 12 assistant drivers of electric locomotives and two assistant drivers of internal combustion locomotives.After eight months of training, all 14 young Laotians have passed the relevant qualification examinations.Upon receiving their licenses, they vowed to be the engine of national railway development and practitioners of the China-Laos community with a shared future.Somxay Laolion, 24, is among the young Laotian drivers who can now drive independently on the China-Laos Railway.In 2021, he was assigned to report to the top leaders of both countries at the opening ceremony about the readiness of the train and rode the inaugural train with his Chinese mentor.At Saleumxay's order, the Aug 5 ceremony ended with a fully loaded train, independently driven by a Laotian driver, leaving the station headed for Kunming.The Chinese railway department also provided Laos with various systems for advanced railway technical standards, talent training, and vocational skills appraisal.It also dispatched long-term experts to Laos to help the Southeast Asian country build its own railway network and talent."In the next step, we will make full use of the teaching resources in Chinese railway colleges and the Lao Railway Vocational and Technical College to build a world-class Lao railway talent team, promoting the high-quality development of the China-Laos railway," said Liu Hong, general manager of the LCRC.kelly@chinadailyapac.comThe China Coast Guard took action over the weekend against Philippine ships that approached a Philippine patrol vessel staying illegally near China's Xianbin Reef in the South China Sea, according to a Chinese spokesman.In a statement released on Sunday night, Coast Guard spokesman Gan Yu said that Chinese ships monitored and warned off vessels from the Philippines' Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. These vessels had gathered around the Philippine Coast Guard ship BRP Teresa Magbanua, the largest and most advanced ship in the PCG's fleet.The Teresa Magbanua has been staying illegally near the Xianbin Reef of China's Nansha Islands since mid-April."China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their adjacent waters," Gan said. He added that the Philippine ships had infringed on China's sovereignty and maritime rights, violated the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and jeopardized regional peace and stability."The China Coast Guard will, as always, conduct rights protection and law enforcement activities in the waters under Chinese jurisdiction, firmly safeguarding national sovereignty and maritime interests," Gan stated.DHAKA -- An interim government will be set up to run Bangladesh after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned Monday amid protests in the South Asian country, according to army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman.Zaman made the remarks in a broadcast to the nation on state television on Monday afternoon. He said Hasina has resigned, which confirmed media reports earlier about her step-down."We would now go to the president to form an interim government," said Zaman.There will be no need to declare a state of emergency if the situation gets better, said Zaman while calling for maintaining peace and order in the country.He expressed hope that after his speech, the situation will improve.Hasina, 76, took office for her fourth straight five-year term as the country's prime minister in January this year after her ruling Bangladesh Awami League (AL) party won a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections."Tussau Kesuu" with Ding Liren, world chess champion from China conducts Kazakh ceremony for young Kazakhstani, DKnews.kz reports.The World Rapid and Blitz Team Championships continue with the celebration of good Kazakh traditions. The famous Chinese chess player, the 17th World Champion Ding Liren, performed the "tussau kesuu" ceremony for a young Kazakhstani.On Sunday, at the Hilton hotel in the capital, the grandmaster and reigning world champion cut the ties for little Chingiz, who is about to turn one year old."Our family was fortunate that the first cautious steps of our son coincided with the time when such a major championship, gathering stars of the chess world, is being held in Astana. It is an honor for us that the current champion Ding Liren, known for his calm character, courtesy, and great talent, conducted this important ceremony for the Kazakh people. May our Chingiz have a bright path and become a renowned champion and a valiant citizen of his country," Chingiz's father Asylkhan Karaev noted.Asylkhan himself is a chess player and a FIDE arbiter. He admits that even if his son does not follow in his footsteps, the skill of playing chess will always help him think strategically and make the right moves in life.The chess player cut the ties for the boy and, together with the child's mother, led him along the "aq jol" (white path). After the ceremony, 31-year-old Ding Liren gave the child some words of encouragement."I am honored today to participate in this symbolic ceremony. This is my first experience in such ceremonies. I hope the child will have a happy life and a bright path, whichever direction he chooses," Ding Liren said.From the items symbolizing different professions, the young Kazakhstani, walking along the white path, chose the chess queen piece. As a sign of gratitude and in Kazakh tradition, the parents presented Ding with a gift.The event was also attended by participants of a business breakfast for businesswomen, held in Astana as part of the championship. FIDE Deputy Chairperson, Latvian politician and grandmaster Dana Reizniece-Ozola, spoke on the important topic of women's leadership and overcoming barriers faced by women on the path to success.As China forges ahead with its path toward high-quality development and sci-tech self-reliance, Pakistan stands ready to deepen the "ironclad" partnership through enhanced economic cooperation and technological collaboration, said Khalil Hashmi, the nation's top envoy to Beijing.In an exclusive interview with China Daily during his recent trip to Shanghai, Hashmi welcomed the comprehensive decision adopted at the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China that laid out an effective road map for shaping China's more resilient economy over the next five years and beyond. （Video）There is an emphasis on innovation, giving full play to new quality productive forces like digital and green development, as well as people-centered philosophies, Hashmi noted."We can pursue joint ventures, research and development and promote educational exchanges in these cutting-edge fields," he said.This augurs a new phase in the time-tested friendship, often described as a bond between "iron brothers" and "all-weather strategic partners".The two nations established diplomatic ties in 1951."This relationship is unique — it has withstood many tests of times and changes and has no precedent in modern times," Hashmi affirmed.Whether it was the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the 2010 and 2022 floods in Pakistan, or the COVID-19 pandemic, each nation has rushed to the other's aid, demonstrating the spirit of solidarity as the most trusted and most reliable friend, Hashmi recalled.It is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor — the flagship project of China's transcontinental Belt and Road Initiative — that has become the modern lodestar of bilateral cooperation. According to the ambassador, CPEC has brought more than $25 billion in investments across nearly 50 projects in just a decade. CPEC is also seen as a gateway for wider regional integration."We have also agreed to extend this corridor to the region, and make it more inclusive by bringing in other interested nations to create an economically interconnected region for the ultimate welfare of people of this region," the envoy added.The corridor has helped Pakistan substantially improve infrastructure like transportation and the energy sector. "Having achieved that, we are now moving into industry and manufacturing, with a lot of focus on joint ventures."During Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's visit to China in June, more than 30 memorandums of understanding were signed between 250 Chinese and 105 Pakistani companies across 13 sectors. "The idea is to benefit from Chinese capital, technology, management practices, and efficiency to enhance our productive capabilities — I see it as a win-win."The 13 sectors, encompassing information technology, mines and minerals, pharmacy, agriculture and electric vehicles, among others, represent areas where China's technologies can be transferred to foster growth in Pakistan.Hashmi considers green technologies as one of the key areas — producing electric vehicles, solar panels, wind turbines and ion batteries, as China has developed these technologies at a large scale and at very affordable prices, enabling developing countries to benefit from these new technologies.Complementing economic ties, Pakistan is also an eager partner in China's other leaps."China has established an international space center and has launched missions to the moon and Mars, demonstrating its capabilities in space technology," Hashmi said, highlighting the recent inclusion of Pakistan's ICUBE-Q satellite in China's Chang'e 6 lunar mission.China has played a constructive regional and global role as a force for peace, development and conflict resolution, the ambassador said, citing its support for the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia and the recently inked Beijing Declaration on Ending Division and Strengthening Palestinian National Unity.China has demonstrated it is a force for positive change globally and Pakistan looks forward to working closely with China at the UN Security Council and multilateral platforms to voice developing nations' economic and security interests, Hashmi stated.While strategic priorities have evolved over decades, an abiding people-to-people connection remains the bedrock of China-Pakistan ties.Hashmi also spoke of encouraging and attracting Chinese investments in Pakistan and promoting joint ventures. "My aspiration is to see our bilateral trade, currently around $23 billion, enhanced significantly in the next two years."TOKYO -- The intense heat wave in Japan shows no signs of abating with the mercury in Kyushu nearing 40 degrees Celsius on Sunday, weather forecasts showed.Wide areas of western and eastern Japan are expected to experience temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius during the day, triggering heatstroke alerts in 37 prefectures.With the heat persisting through the night, daytime temperatures on Sunday were forecast to reach dangerously high levels, with Kurume in Fukuoka expecting a maximum of 39 degrees Celcius and Saga and Kumamoto predicting highs of 38.Tokyo is set to experience 35 degrees Celcius, marking its first extreme heat day in four days, while Nagoya is bracing for its 11th consecutive day of temperatures at 37.As of 11 am local time on Sunday, the heat stress index, or Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), reached the red level in most parts of the country, representing the highest level of heatstroke risk on the country's five-tier system, official data showed.The WBGT, which measures heatstroke risk, takes into account temperature, humidity, and sunlight intensity as one of the empirical indices representing the heat stress to which an individual is exposed.Authorities have advised residents to stay indoors in cool environments and plan summer activities that minimize exposure to the heat.Residents are urged to take heatstroke precautions seriously and adjust their plans accordingly to ensure safety during this severe heat wave.HANOI - Vietnamese President To Lam has been elected as general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee, according to a press conference here on Saturday.Lam was unanimously supported at a meeting of the 13th CPV Central Committee held in the Vietnamese capital on Saturday morning.Speaking at the press conference, Lam said he will inherit and uphold the revolutionary achievements made by late Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and previous generations of leaders.He vowed to resolutely lead and direct the entire Party, people and army, together with the CPV Central Committee, the Political Bureau, and the Party Central Committee's Secretariat, to accomplish the goals and tasks set forth by the 13th National Party Congress and successfully organize the 14th National Party Congress.On July 18, a notice issued by the Political Bureau said that due to Trong's need to focus on receiving health treatment, To Lam, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPV Central Committee and the Vietnamese president, took charge of supervising the work of the CPV Central Committee, the Political Bureau of the CPV Central Committee, and the Secretariat of the CPV Central Committee.Trong died on July 19 at the age of 80, according to the board of health protection and care for central officials.Lam, born on July 10, 1957, in Vietnam's northern Hung Yen province, has served at the Ministry of Public Security for a long time.On May 22, 2024, the 15th National Assembly elected Lam as Vietnam's president for a tenure till 2026.Lam is a member of the 11th, 12th and 13th CPV Central Committee, a member of the 12th and 13th Party Central Committee Political Bureau, and a deputy to the 14th and 15th National Assembly of Vietnam.The business community in Hong Kong has hailed President Xi Jinping's warm encouragement for its entrepreneurs, saying that the local business sector will continue to leverage its strengths actively to serve the needs of the country.The president recently replied to a letter from Hong Kong businesspeople with ancestral roots in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, including representatives such as Chao Kee-young and Pao Pui-hing, daughter of late shipping mogul Pao Yue-kong.They recently wrote to Xi to highlight the efforts they are making to support national development, and expressed their resolve to serve the nation's modernization.In his reply, Xi praised the contributions they are making to the development of their hometown and the country through their active engagement in innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as through their donations to education.Agnes Chan Sui-kuen, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce — the oldest and largest business chamber representing multinational companies operating in the city — said Xi's words reflect his sincere care and appreciation."From innovation to philanthropy, the contributions of their pioneering ancestors are a source of immense pride to Ningbo and the country. The Hong Kong business community should work to promote this entrepreneurial spirit and unite the forces of patriotism," Chan said."President Xi's cordial encouragement is very encouraging to all Hong Kong entrepreneurs of different origins and from different places," said Jonathan Choi Koon-shum, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and Hong Kong-based conglomerate Sunwah Group."Hong Kong's industrial and commercial community will continue to actively leverage its strengths to serve the needs of the country, comprehensively deepen reforms in the new era, promote Chinese modernization and contribute the strength of Hong Kong entrepreneurs," added Choi, who is a Standing Committee member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference — the nation's top political advisory body.Steve Chuang, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, told China Daily: "Hong Kong's industrial sector has actively participated in the country's reform since the 1980s. President Xi's reply reflects his high recognition of Hong Kong's business community and private enterprises, and strengthens our confidence in continuing to actively integrate into the overall development of the country."NANNING -- Police personnel from China and Vietnam concluded joint counter-terrorism training in south China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region on Friday.The training was aimed at jointly addressing the threat of terrorism and focused on combating violent terrorist activities.During the two-week program, police personnel from both sides conducted exchanges, discussions and various exercises covering subjects such as command, skills and tactics.This joint training exercise marked the first of its kind between the Chinese People's Armed Police Force and the mobile police forces of the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security. It aimed to cement friendship between the two countries, strengthen mutual trust and cooperation, and enhance joint counter-terrorism capabilities.Malaysian student Lim Jia Le has been studying at Tsinghua University for five years. Reflecting on her choice to study in China after high school, the 23-year-old said it was the best decision she made."Among the countries I received offers from, I chose China mainly because Tsinghua University ranks high internationally for majors in life sciences and chemical engineering, which are my fields of interest," Lim said.Lim said that students from her high school had been opting for China for their higher education since 2016. "They would come back home to Malaysia and share their experiences in China. I felt that China could offer more opportunities for future development, more recreational activities and a safer social environment. These factors helped me make up my mind," she said.After studying in China for five years, Lim describes her experience as overwhelmingly positive. "Compared to universities in Malaysia or Singapore, Tsinghua offers a wealth of student activities and various forums with distinguished guests, which are particularly attractive to Malaysian students. Living in China is also very convenient with its efficient food delivery and transportation services."As Malaysia and China celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations, educational exchanges between the two nations have become a new highlight, with more and more Malaysian students opting for higher education in China.Data from the Association of Graduates from Universities and Colleges of China in Malaysia show that about 1,800 Malaysian students studied in China in 2007. By 2019, this number had grown to approximately 9,500, and the number of Malaysian students enrolled in Chinese universities exceeded 10,000 in 2023. Notably, the number of postgraduate students has increased significantly in the post-pandemic era.Lim Kok Yan, president of the Association of Graduates from Universities and Colleges of China-Malaysia, said that China's economic development and growing international influence are key factors attracting Malaysian students."Many Malaysian parents believe that studying in China offers their children broader networks and perspectives. Chinese companies expanding globally often prefer to hire Malaysians with Chinese educational backgrounds. The Belt and Road Initiative has further deepened economic and trade cooperation between Malaysia and China, making it easier for Malaysian graduates to find related jobs," he said.Professor Su Yingying, dean of the School of Asian Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, or BFSU, attributed the growing popularity of China as an overseas study destination among Malaysian students to strong bilateral relations.Deepened trust"The close cooperation between China and Malaysia in various fields has deepened bilateral political trust and economic ties. Over the past decade, the Belt and Road Initiative has further strengthened this trust and therefore fostered flourishing educational and cultural exchanges," she said.In April, the Chinese Service Center for Scholarly Exchange and Malaysian Qualifications Agency signed a memorandum about degree recognition, which explored establishing a coordination mechanism and jointly addressing issues in degree recognition. "Such close cooperation between the two countries' education departments has boosted educational exchanges from both institutional and policy perspectives," Su said."More importantly, higher education is also advancing rapidly in China, with many majors now becoming internationally competitive. At the same time, China provides a safe study environment and relatively lower tuition fees, compared to other countries. These factors make China an attractive destination for Malaysian students," she said.During his visit to Shanghai in May, Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister I and Minister of Rural and Regional Development Dato' Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid bin Hamidi emphasized China's advantage in high technology and urged Malaysian youths to seize the opportunity to pursue higher education in China to gain knowledge in various fields, especially technology, Malaysian media reported."As China-Malaysia economic collaboration expands and Chinese investment in Malaysia grows, I think more Malaysian students will choose China for higher education, covering an increasing range of majors," said Su of BFSU.yangran1@chinadaily.com.cnA human rights exchange delegation, led by Jiang Jinguo, executive vice president of the China Society for Human Rights Studies, concluded its visit to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan for bilateral exchanges on Thursday.During the eight-day visit, the delegation introduced the significant deployment regarding upholding the correct view of human rights and strengthening law enforcement and judicial protection of human rights, as outlined by the third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee.The delegation provided insights into China's contemporary perspective on human rights, its achievements and experiences, reaffirming the country's commitment to promoting the comprehensive advancement of human rights endeavors.They actively coordinated with Tajik and Uzbek counterparts, maintaining converging positions and actions with China in the international human rights struggle.Various sectors in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan highly praised the remarkable achievements of China in putting people at the center, deepening comprehensive reforms, and achieving high-quality development.Both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan highly praised China's path and experience in human rights development, noting many similarities in human rights principles between their countries and China.China and India have agreed to accelerate the negotiation process and accommodate each other's legitimate concerns to find a solution to the border issue that is mutually accepted by both sides.The pledge was made as the two sides held on Wednesday the 30th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on China-India Border Affairs in New Delhi.The talks followed a recent meeting between Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in Vientiane where they agreed to work for new progress in consultations on border affairs.During Wednesday's meeting, both sides agreed to actively implement the important consensus reached in the latest meeting between the two foreign ministers. They also agreed to focus on specific border-related issues and consider each other's legitimate concerns, and to reach an early solution acceptable to both countries.They agreed to maintain diplomatic and military communication channels and strengthen negotiation mechanisms to promote the sound and stable development of China-India relations.Both sides also committed to strictly adhering to existing agreements as well as upholding peace and tranquility in the border areas.In another development, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian expressed heartfelt thanks on Thursday to relevant Indian departments and personnel as they provided humanitarian rescue work to a Chinese crew member.Recently, a Chinese crew member was accidentally injured while conducting maritime operations off Mumbai's coast. He received prompt assistance and treatment from the Indian side. The crew member is now in a stable condition and has returned to China for further recovery, Lin told a daily news briefing.CANBERRA -- The Australian government has denounced Japan's decision to expand its commercial whaling.Tanya Plibersek, minister for the environment and water, on Thursday condemned Japan's move to add fin whales to its list of commercial whalers will target."Australia is deeply disappointed by Japan's decision to expand its commercial whaling program by adding fin whales," she said in a statement.Fin whales are the second-largest whale species in the world and are listed as vulnerable to extinction on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.Japan's Fisheries Agency in May proposed expanding commercial whaling in the country's territorial waters and exclusive economic zone to include fin whales. In June the agency announced that it has authorized the hunting of up to 59 fin whales in the North Pacific in 2024.Plibersek said on Thursday that Australia is opposed to all commercial whaling and called for all countries to end the practice."Australia's efforts through the International Whaling Commission have contributed to a whaling-free Southern Ocean and a decline in commercial whaling around the world. Australia will continue to advocate for the protection and conservation of whales and the health of our ocean for future generations," she said.As China and Thailand have benefited from cultural exchange since ancient times, people-to-people exchanges between the two countries are increasingly close, showing unprecedented vitality over the past years with the all-round development of bilateral relations, said Fu Zengyou, former dean of the Confucius Institute at Chulalongkorn University.Recalling his first trip to Thailand in 1980, Fu said many people from the two countries barely knew each other then, partially due to poor transportation and a lack of communication. The condition had not changed until 1975, when China and Thailand officially established diplomatic relations.Invited by the Thai government for an exchange program, Fu and two other Chinese scholars who studied the Thai language traveled to Bangkok from Beijing by plane. Back then, there was no direct flight between the two cities and they had to transfer twice at Kunming in Southwest China's Yunnan province and Vientiane, the capital of Laos."It was an old flight. When it flew above the mountainous region at the border, we were told to wear life jackets. No one asked the cabin crew for a reason, leaving only an unearthly silence," he recalled.The plane eventually flew back to Vientiane and took off again after a two-hour repair. Fu's Chinese friends had to bid farewell to the group twice in a day, as the plane returned even before they left the airport."It was really an unforgettable and arduous journey," Fu said, making a special mention of four apples given by his neighbor as a farewell gift before he left Beijing. "I should thank her for the wishes of peace and safety for the trip," he said.During their stay in Thailand, Fu said many Thai people asked him lots of questions about China. Apart from ordinary ones such as whether China had banks or photo studios, many Thai people asked questions that came from bizarre rumors that went far beyond Fu's imagination."They asked me if we would kill elderly people aged more than 70 years old and used their bodies as fertilizer. Also, they were curious about my marriage and ask whether my wife was picked from a group of women that were 'arranged' by the government," Fu recalled with laughter."Those questions with bias mostly resulted from a lack of mutual understanding for a long time. It exactly indicated the importance of communication. Friendship only forms when you know each other well," he said, adding that language learning played a crucial role in promoting exchanges and deepening understanding between people from different countries.As co-founder of Thailand's first department of Chinese language that was launched in 1996 at Srinakharinwirot University and vice-chairman of the Thai Chinese teachers' union, Fu said Chinese language learning has been booming among Thai people over the past decades."Since Thailand and China built diplomatic relations in 1975, the Thai government has encouraged learning Mandarin thanks to the efforts from Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, who had a leading role in particular," Fu said.Having been to China more than 50 times, the Thai princess learned Mandarin well and even translated several Chinese novels into Thai. She also made great efforts to deepen the exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the fields of education, traditional medicine, science and technology, and even aerospace."More than building bridges of friendship, Princess Sirindhorn embodies the solid bond that unites China and Thailand," Fu said. Different from the 1980s when few people could speak Mandarin, he said now all Thai schools have Mandarin classes.Over the past 20 years, about 20,000 volunteer teachers from China have given language classes in Thai schools and helped to train Mandarin teachers for the kingdom.Tens of thousands of Thai students head to China annually, studying a wide range of subjects, including Mandarin, medicine, IT, science and technology. In China, the number of colleges providing Thai language classes has also increased, from seven in the 1990s to more than 50 now."Historically, cultural exchange between China and Thailand has been rich and multifaceted," Fu said."As the two countries see closer ties now, people-to-people exchanges will keep upgrading to a higher level and their long-standing friendship will also reach a new stage." In the newly opened Emsphere shopping mall, a fashion landmark in Bangkok, long lines form in front of a Thai dessert shop during the weekend.The crowd consists mainly of excited tourists, many of them obsessed not with the cakes or cookies on sale but with a 30-second opportunity to take selfies with a furry doll known as Butterbear.Fans of the bear, mostly young travelers from China and South Korea, come from afar with a must-do list and photos with the mascot, whose popularity is likened to a pop star."Butterbear is one of the Thai top streamers on Chinese social media. She is super cute. A selfie with her will definitely attract comments and likes on the internet," said Wu Qian from Chongqing in Southwest China. She visited Bangkok with her boyfriend in early July.The couple planned their trip to Thailand to coincide with the bear's "picture time", which is limited to weekend afternoons. Every customer is allowed to have just 30 seconds for a photo with the character and the lines usually stretch about two hours.The major Thai confectionery brand is also reaping the rewards of the bear's popularity, with brisk sales of its products in Bangkok and upcoming shops in China set to offer various items extending to merchandise such as bags and cups with the mascot's image.Butterbear began drawing attention in May and has about 430,000 followers on Instagram. On Chinese lifestyle app Xiaohongshu and short video platform TikTok, it has attracted nearly 1 million followers in total.The "cute factor" behind the brand's bear is just one part of its ability to become a viral hit on social media and captivate wide audiences.Editor's note: In this weekly feature China Daily gives voice to Asia and its people. The stories presented come mainly from the Asia News Network (ANN), of which China Daily is among its 20 leading titles.The South Korean economy is poised to continue its recovery in the latter half of this year but the country must address its "existential issue", which stems from problems such as low productivity and a declining population, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said on July 11."We publish surveys every two years, but this one is about an existential issue for (South) Korea," said Vincent Koen, the OECD's country studies division chief in the economics department, during a press briefing at the Ministry of Economy and Finance building in the city of Sejong.One urgent issue South Korea must address is the population decline and its notoriously low fertility rate, according to the OECD Economic Surveys: Korea 2024 report released that day."Supporting people to have the number of children they desire would dampen the projected population decline, while lengthening working lives and welcoming more foreign workers would counteract the adverse effects of aging," the report noted.For this, Koen also called for structural reforms in the labor market, improvements in labor and family policies, and changes in societal norms to counter population decline.The report also called for a "decisive upgrade" in South Korea's export-oriented growth model to bolster declining productivity.Citing the gap between large and small companies as a key reason for falling productivity, the OECD urged reforms to create a level playing field for competition. Stricter management of subsidies and benefits for small and medium-sized companies as well as streamlined regulations to enhance market competition are recommended, the report said.Meanwhile, the OECD survey report forecast a 2.6 percent growth outlook for the South Korean economy this year, driven by improved exports and strengthening domestic demand in the second half."With inflation falling back and renewed demand for computer chips powering a wave of investment in AI across the world, exports are again driving growth," Koen said.For 2025, the OECD expected that South Korea's economic growth would slow to 2.2 percent.Unlike exports, private consumption in South Korea has been weak in the first half of the year, pulled down by high interest rates and weak real wage growth. The OECD anticipates the domestic market to rebound in the latter half." (South Korea's) elevated debt servicing burdens and accumulated inflation will continue to weigh on private consumption and investment in the short term, but domestic demand should strengthen from the second half of 2024," the report stated.The Korea HeraldExposing illicit wildlife trade that thrives on e-commerce platforms is like a game of whack-a-mole, even with the use of artificial intelligence tools.Illicit online listings of the likes of ivory, pangolin scales or even live animals are often disguised using emoji, other languages and code words such as "rare collectibles" that make them difficult to detect, said Jayasri Srikantan, who spearheads a volunteer effort under wildlife conservation group World Wildlife Fund to flag illegal trade to the authorities.But an AI model is being developed to assist WWF's volunteers — called cyber spotters — to evaluate flagged listings on e-commerce platforms with greater accuracy.The system, trained on thousands of wildlife product samples and their estimated black market prices, helps to prevent false positives, ensuring the group's credibility with law enforcement partners.The program's accuracy rate is about 90 percent for now, said Jayasri, adding that new code words and trends are regularly added to the system to keep it up to date with current trends.Deployed in 2023, the WWF's Cyber Spotter AI model is part of an initiative to fund and kick-start AI projects in Singapore to spur AI adoption, led by national AI program AI Singapore.The AI system, which has been in the works since 2022, is designed to help improve the accuracy of reports compiled quarterly by the WWF and by its pool of more than 400 volunteers in Singapore, who trawl local e-commerce platforms for hours each month for signs of illegal wildlife trade, said Jayasri, WWF Singapore's head of education and outreach.Images and text from postings flagged by the cyber spotters are uploaded to an AI model, which analyzes text and photos for clues of illegally traded wildlife and their products.The team needs to avoid flagging replicas by mistake and must look out for clues in each listing's images, text and prices to ascertain if it truly involves an exploited animal. Listings that have a high mix of these elements could be flagged by the software as genuinely illegal."It's trickier than it sounds," Jayasri said. Spotting ivory, for instance, is not as easy as it seems, as Schreger lines — unique patterns found within an elephant's bones that guarantee its authenticity — are tough to discern through often blurry images online.Some sellers brazenly list protected wildlife products online, but others employ tactics to conceal their illicit offerings, Jayasri said. These tactics include using emoji or code words that hint at the creature being sold, or employing emoji representing the animal, which all "make it challenging for our team to identify genuine listings accurately".Ivory replicas can be sold at low prices while real elephant ivory is more likely to be listed in the hundreds of dollars, Jayasri said."But sellers can play all sorts of tricks to slip under the radar, like lowering the prices or using other code words so that they aren't suspected. The AI needs to consider all of this."The system does not replace the work of volunteers, who conduct final checks on the reports before they are submitted.Jayasri said the team here flags tens of thousands of listings each year in an effort to prevent the illegal trade — the second leading cause of wildlife loss after deforestation worldwide, and among the world's most profitable crime sectors.The end goal, Jayasri said, is to fully automate the system so that an AI model is able to trawl websites for illegal listings and compile a report on its own, but the technology has some way to go before achieving this level of autonomy.The international agency aims to introduce the system to its other branches soon, she said.The Straits TimesAn increasing number of foreign nationals are seeking permits to work in Bangladesh because of a lack of skilled managers and an education system not tailored to meet industrialization in the country.A total of 16,303 applications from nationals of 101 countries were approved by the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority in the fiscal year of 2022-23, up about 8 percent year-on-year.Of the cases, 6,256 are for new work permits while 10,047 are renewals, according to the annual report of the state-run investment promotion agency.In 2021-22, 15,128 applicants from 106 countries received the permits, which is a staggering 87 percent increase from that in the fiscal year preceding it. Of the figure, 7,790 were for new work permits and 7,338 renewals.Government agencies such as the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority, the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority, the NGO Affairs Bureau and some ministries grant permits to foreign nationals to work on projects.For example, as of June 2024, over 1,800 permits were issued for foreign nationals to work inside export processing zones.Nationals from India secured the highest number of work permits at 3,159 in the fiscal year of 2022-23, followed by those from China (2,339), Sri Lanka (759) and Belarus (727).Industry insiders said foreigners were hired based on their skills and on their past records of being industrious as they can contribute to outstanding outcomes for industrial development.Mohsina Yasmin, executive member of the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority, said the professionals were meeting the skills gap in the national workforce of the industrial sector, abiding by the laws of Bangladesh and paying taxes.The authority provides work permits according to the guidelines for skilled technicians and managerial level positions as they can help generate skills for manpower, Mohsina said.She pointed out that the agency issued work permits solely to those foreign nationals who were engaged in registered industrial projects, commercial offices and other organizations.The agency does not maintain data relating to the total number of foreign workers in Bangladesh, she said.Abdul Matlub Ahmad, president of the India and Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Bangladeshi investors, especially in the garment and automobile sectors, usually hire highly skilled Indian engineers and managers."Besides, there are a lot of Indian entrepreneurs of small and medium enterprises who avail long-term work permits instead of short-term visas for having to regularly travel to Bangladesh."Ahmad said he had also hired six highly skilled Indian engineers for his Nitol Niloy Group to develop the skills of local engineers and managers.He acknowledged that the investors prefer to hire such skilled professionals as they contribute to business growth and expansion."On the other hand, industries are expanding through foreign direct investments and joint ventures with local investors, all of which require skilled manpower."Mohammed Amirul Haque, managing director of Premier Cement Mills, said investors hire foreign professionals to train local managers and engineers but at the end of the day, this was not always realized."So, investors have continued to depend on foreign professionals. However, in some cases, it is better to hire local professionals than foreigners."If investors get skilled professionals locally, the outflow of funds in the form of remittances will reduce, which will help the economy.Foreigners working in Bangladesh sent home $137 million in 2022, World Bank data showed, although analysts believe the exact figure would be much higher since many people from other nations are employed in the country without valid permits.In 2020, the Transparency International Bangladesh group said an estimated $3.1 billion was channeled away every year by foreign nationals employed in the country.Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said the yearly increase in the number of foreign nationals indicate that the labor market of Bangladesh offered flexibility and satisfaction."However, a continuous rise of foreign nationals in the industrial sector was a clear indication that the local graduates and professionals are not as skilled as the foreigners."Even though local professionals can be hired at a lower pay, investors recruit foreign professionals offering high remunerations due to their professionalism and skills."The economist also said this trend raises questions and sends a negative impression about the knowledge being imparted by the educational institutions in the country.Moazzem suggested building skilled manpower by ensuring quality education to reduce dependency on foreign nationals and to reduce pressure on the forex reserve.Ferdaus Ara Begum, chief executive officer of think tank Business Initiative Leading Development, blamed the skills gap in the local workforce and a lack of quality education at the tertiary level.Besides, public university graduates tend to leave the country after gaining skills as they do not get the facilities that meet their expectations although the government spends a large amount of money on their education, she alleged.Ferdaus Ara also said there were allegations that some foreign nationals come to Bangladesh without job visas and work on a temporary basis."It is really tough to identify these temporary workers who come under tourist visas."The Daily StarThe renewed inflow of Chinese foreign direct investment will be very positive for India, said experts after senior officials expressed recently that they welcomed fresh Chinese investments, given China's key role in the global supply chains and the benefits such investments can bring to both neighbors."India should invite Chinese investment; it will be a win-win for both India and China," said Sudheendra Kulkarni, who founded the Forum for a New South Asia, which promotes cooperation between India, Pakistan and China.After imposing curbs on Chinese investment for years, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week backed her chief economic adviser's suggestion to reopen India's door for Chinese investment.The adviser, V. Anantha Nageswaran, said earlier in a media address that India should focus on getting more FDI from China, as it can help boost India's export sector and also keep the trade deficit with China under manageable levels.An economic survey report for 2023-24 tabled in the Indian Parliament on July 22, a day before the finance minister presented the Union Budget for fiscal 2024-25, also advocated attracting investments from Chinese companies to boost exports.During her budget speech in parliament, Sitharaman proposed to simplify the norms surrounding FDI and overseas investments in a bid to boost capital inflows from foreign shores."Both China and India understand the nature of an interconnected, interdependent and globalized world wherein the flow of capital, goods and people is mutually beneficial," said Karori Singh, former director and an emeritus fellow of the South Asia Studies Centre at the University of Rajasthan in India.India is focusing on improving the ease of doing business to attract more FDI and boost exports, he said.India tightened its scrutiny of investments from Chinese companies, and halted major projects from China since May 2020.Projects haltedThe curbs disrupted billions of dollars of investment from China and halted some investment projects, including those of Chinese automakers BYD and Great Wall Motor. Also affected were Chinese smartphone makers Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi. India, meanwhile, also banned more than 300 Chinese apps."To boost Indian manufacturing and plug India into the global supply chain, it is inevitable that India plugs itself into China's supply chain. Whether we do so by relying solely on imports or partially through Chinese investments is a choice that India has to make," the economic survey report said."Even though India is the fastest-growing G20 country and is now recording growth rates that outpace China's, India's economy is still a fraction of China's," it noted.The report makes a case for removing restrictions on Chinese FDI in order to turn India into an export hub that can export to the Western economies, analysts say.Biswajit Dhar, a former professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, said the tacit assumption behind the above argument is that China's technological prowess can improve the competitiveness of the Indian manufacturing sector.He noted that China was able to leverage the strengths of foreign investors to increase the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector. But the question is whether India can develop an effective strategy to benefit from Chinese companies, similar to what China did vis-a-vis Western multinationals, Dhar said.Sebastian Morris, a former professor at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, said that FDI from China will help India's manufacturing sector to be more competitive in the international market, giving a boost to its exports. But he added that it will only happen when India's currency exchange rate is more competitive.Kulkarni said there is a great scope for joint ventures between China and India in renewable energy, semiconductors and heavy engineering, as well as in digital technologies.Wang Shida, deputy director of the Institute of South Asian Studies at the Beijing-based China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said strengthening economic and trade cooperation with China is not only in line with the interests of India's industry, but also important for the government in New Delhi to realize its "Made in India" vision and help the nation achieve the developed country status by 2047.He said the Indian government and ordinary people in India are increasingly aware that restricting economic and trade cooperation with China not only hinders the growth of India's trade, but also has a negative impact on India's achievement of broader economic goals.APARAJIT CHAKRABORTY is a freelance journalist for China Daily.CHOORALMALA, India — Soldiers and rescuers worked through slush and rocks under steady rain, looking for survivors and searching for bodies in the hills of India's Kerala state on Wednesday, a day after more than 167 people were killed in monsoon landslides.Nearly 1,600 people had been rescued from the hillside villages and tea and cardamom estates in Wayanad district, and 225 were still missing, authorities said on Wednesday. They said at least 167 people died and 195 were injured, while the local Asianet news TV channel put the death toll at 230.Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said his thoughts are with the bereaved families."Deeply saddened to hear about the tragic landslides in #Wayanad, #Kerala. Our thoughts and hearts are with the people there and bereaved families," he wrote on X.Heavy rain in Kerala, one of India's most attractive tourist destinations, led to the landslides early on Tuesday, sending torrents of mud, water and tumbling boulders downhill and burying or sweeping people away to their deaths as they slept.Experts said the area had been receiving heavy rain in the past two weeks that had softened the soil and that extremely heavy rainfall on Monday triggered the landslides.The Indian Army said it rescued 1,600 people and has begun the process of constructing an alternative bridge after the main bridge linking the worst affected area of Mundakkai to the nearest town of Chooralmala was destroyed.Near the site where the bridge was washed away, a land excavator was slowly removing trees and boulders from a mound of debris."We are quite sure there are multiple bodies here," said Hamsa T. A., a fire and rescue worker, pointing to the debris. "There were many houses here, people living inside have been missing."Aparajit Chakraborty in New Delhi contributed to this story.Agencies via XinhuaBeijing has slammed Tokyo for the negative comments it made during its recent meetings with Washington, urging it to maintain the political foundation of China-Japan relations.Liu Jinsong, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's department of Asian affairs, summoned Akira Yokochi, chief minister of the Japanese embassy in China, on Tuesday, shortly after Japan and the United States held a series of meetings in Tokyo.Japan and the US held the"2+2"meeting and a ministerial meeting on "extended deterrence" on Sunday. On Monday, the two countries participated in the foreign ministers' meeting of the Quad, a grouping that also includes Australia and India.In addition, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry expressed strong opposition on Tuesday to interference from Japan and the US in China's internal affairs as well as their smearing of China.Liu, the director-general, expressed China's grave concerns and strong disapproval over the negative words and deeds against it by the Japanese side during the meetings, as well as the many fallacies, dangerous moves and false narratives in the meetings' documents, according to a statement issued by the ministry.The Japanese side's smearing and attacks on China are contradictory to its statements on promoting a strategic relationship of mutual benefit between the two countries, Liu said, calling on Tokyo to meet Beijing halfway and truly work toward such a relationship.Liu urged Japan to adopt an objective and rational perception of China, stop making unwarranted comments on China's internal affairs, and cease forming "small cliques" with certain countries to create confrontation.Yokochi said that Japan's position on handling the Taiwan question in accordance with the 1972 Japan-China joint communique remains unchanged.Japan is willing to advance the strategic relationship of mutual benefit between the two countries, he added.In another development, the Foreign Ministry announced on Wednesday China's countermeasures against US Representative Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, for his frequent words and deeds in recent years that have interfered in China's internal affairs and undermined its sovereignty, security and development interests.The countermeasures, including prohibiting all organizations and individuals within China from engaging in transactions, cooperation or other activities with McGovern and denying the lawmaker and his family entry into China, took effect on Wednesday.The countermeasures are pursuant to articles of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Countering Foreign Sanctions, the ministry said in a statement released on its website.Mo Jingxi contributed to this story.China's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, expressed condolences over the devastating landslides in the Indian state of Kerala that have claimed 159 lives so far, saying his thoughts were with the families of the victims.Sharing a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Chinese envoy wrote, "Deeply saddened to hear about the tragic landslides in #Wayanad, #Kerala. Our thoughts and hearts are with the people there and bereaved families."At least 159 people have been killed and over 200 injured after massive landslides struck the hilly areas near Meppadi in Wayanad district in South India's Kerala state. As around 200 people are still missing, the death toll may rise further, Kerala chief minister's spokesperson, PM Manoj, told this correspondent.According to government data, more than 180 people are feared trapped under debris.The search and rescue operations, which were suspended on late Tuesday night after 20 hours of operations, resumed on Wednesday morning. Wayanad district authorities started collecting data on Wednesday to determine the number of people missing following the tragedy. As many as 45 relief camps have been established in the district, accommodating 3,069 people.The Indian Army said it rescued 1,000 people and has begun the process of constructing an alternate bridge after the main bridge connecting the worst-hit Mundakkai area with the nearest town of Chooralmala was washed away.The landslides struck while people were asleep, causing widespread devastation. Many homes have been flattened, rivers are swollen, and many trees have been uprooted.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday he was "distressed by the landslides" and announced a compensation of $2,388 to the victims' families and assured Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a phone call of extending all possible assistance from the federal government.Vijayan has decided to intensify the ongoing search and rescue mission in the landslide-ravaged Wayanad district by deploying more personnel and equipment, the spokesperson said, adding that Vijayan will visit the landslide-ravaged area to take stock of the situation. Rescue teams from the Indian Army, Navy, and the National Disaster Response Force, state disaster team and local district administration are working on war footing to save the lives amid adverse weather conditions, spokesperson Manoj said. The first landslide occurred at 2 am on Tuesday (04:30 am Beijing Time on Monday), followed by another two hours later. Television footage showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach those who had been stranded. Vehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river.At least 572 mm of rain fell in the two days leading up to the landslide, Vijayan said in a statement released by his office.Several areas, including Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala, were isolated, and roads were washed away causing immense damage to homes, added Vijayan."Efforts to locate missing persons continue with all available resources," the statement said, adding that more than 3,000 people have been moved to relief camps and the government is ensuring the delivery of food and essential items there.The national flag will be flown at half-mast as the Kerala government has declared an official state mourning. All public functions and celebratory programss scheduled by the government, have been postponed."This is a colossal tragedy. Whatever is possible to be done is being done by the agencies... the state agencies, defense forces, Army, Navy, Air Force, all agencies are involved. Our heart goes out to the people," Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said."So many bodies have been found and a lot of people are missing. We need to put maximum strength from the federal government's side, state government's side and all other state governments who can help, then only the situation can be addressed. The nation is weeping," senior Indian National Congress leader KC Venugopal said, adding India needs to find out long-term and short-term strategies to stop these types of calamities in future. India Meteorological Department or IMD has predicted "heavy to very heavy rainfall" at isolated places; the "heavy to very heavy rainfall' warning is in place for Aug 1 as well, while on the following day, Kerala is likely to witness "heavy" showers."Strong surface winds with speeds reaching 30-40 gusting to 50 km/h are likely to prevail occasionally over Kerala on July 31," the IMD said in a statement today. All educational institutions will remain closed on Wednesday and holiday has been declared in 11 districts of the state, as a result of the disaster.The IMD has issued a red alert for the Wayanad district and an orange alert was issued for four nearby districts of Wayanad. A red alert indicates heavy-to-extremely heavy rain of over 20 cm in 24 hours. An orange alert means very heavy rain of 11 cm to 20 cm.The Army has started constructing a Bailey bridge to connect Mundakkai and Chooralmala. The rescue team will be able to transport ambulances, food, and water to Mundakkai, the worst hit area, once the bridge is completed.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.  The Singapore and the US' landmark deal on civil nuclear cooperation is expected to support not only the climate goals of the city-state but also the Southeast Asian region as well, analysts said.Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken signed the 123 Agreement on Wednesday. The 30-year pact, which is likely to be enforced by end-2024 following a review by the US Congress, was signed during Blinken's official visit to Singapore as part of his six-country tour of Asia.The 123 Agreement refers to section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act that requires the signing of a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement for significant transfers of US nuclear material or equipment to its partner countries.US and Singapore officials said in a joint statement that signing the agreement and joining capacity-building initiatives such as the Foundational Infrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology will lead to a better understanding of how advanced nuclear energy technologies, including small modular reactors, can potentially support climate goals, while balancing critical energy needs.The US has signed such agreement with 48 countries. Apart from Singapore, other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam have signed 123 Agreement.David Broadstock, a senior research fellow and energy transition research lead with the Sustainable and Green Finance Institute at the National University of Singapore, said by being the latest ASEAN country to sign the 123 Agreement, Singapore could have a "transparent discussion" on regional power sector development with other signatories in ASEAN.Broadstock said there has been a lot of discussion in recent years to build regional grid for clean energy. But he said this can only be done if ASEAN countries can discuss the technology and infrastructure that need to be installed to help clean electricity flow around."Signing the agreement is consistent with (Singapore) keeping the domestic pathways open, but it's also consistent with being able to increase regional dialogue on regional power solutions," Broadstock said.Singapore is exploring renewable energy resources to meet its net zero emissions goal by 2050. A report commissioned by Singapore's Energy Market Authority in 2022 revealed that geothermal energy or nuclear energy can supply about 10 percent of the city-state's energy needs by 2050.Singapore officials said they have not made any decision on the deployment of nuclear energy in the country. The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a fact sheet issued after the signing that it will conduct detailed studies of the safety, reliability, affordability, and environmental sustainability of nuclear energy before making such a decision.Rohan Gunaratna, professor of security studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said the city-state has "very rightly taken a cautious approach" before embarking on nuclear technology.Gunaratna said Singapore is aware that designs of advanced nuclear reactors are still undergoing research and development and have not begun commercial operation."Singapore has a firm commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. To prevent the spread of nuclear missile and fissile technologies is essential to international peace and security," he said.Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Balakrishnan said at the signing ceremony that current conventional nuclear technologies are not suitable for the city-state, according to local media reports."But given advances in civil nuclear technology, we need to stay abreast of breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field," Balakrishnan said.The US-Singapore joint statement said the 123 agreement builds on the long-standing civil nuclear collaboration between the two countries. For instance, since 2017, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Singapore's National Environment Agency have had arrangements to collaborate on nuclear safety matters.YANGON -- Myanmar's National Defense and Security Council (NDSC) on Wednesday extended the state of emergency in the country for six more months, the state-run Myanmar Radio and Television (MRTV) reported.TOKYO -- Japan's central bank on Wednesday decided to raise its short-term interest rates to 0.25 percent from the range of zero and 0.1 percent, local media reported.The second policy rate hike this year, which was announced after a two-day monetary policy meeting, marked the first "additional rate hike" since February 2007, national broadcaster NHK reported.The Bank of Japan also decided to halve its monthly government bond purchases to 3 trillion yen (about 20 billion US dollars) from around 6 trillion yen by March 2026, signaling steps toward normalizing its monetary policy.The US government has pledged an additional $500 million in foreign military financing to the Philippines, a move that experts say aims to "provoke" China amid tensions in the South China Sea.The commitment came during the Fourth Philippines-United States 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue held in Manila on Tuesday. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr and Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo. This marked the first 2+2 meeting held in the Philippines as previous meetings were held in Washington.Following the dialogue, Blinken said the "once-in-a-generation investment" will help modernize the Philippine Armed Forces and Coast Guard and raise US investments in the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement. The US' long-standing alliance with the Philippines is a "defensive" one, Blinken said.Teodoro said the funding will boost the Philippines' abilities to "defend itself and to deter unlawful aggression", while also aiding humanitarian assistance and disaster response.Bilveer Singh, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said that while the meeting represents a peak in bilateral relations, the US has taken advantage of the Philippines' sense of vulnerability, especially concerning tensions in the South China Sea and its relations within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.Preferring diplomacy"ASEAN is not very keen to confront China" and prefers to be more diplomatic and cautious, he said, characterizing the additional military funding as "provocative".Jaime Naval, an assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines, described the 2+2 meeting as a "natural progression" for the two long-standing treaty allies. They signed the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1951, years before the South China Sea tensions arose, Naval said.The Philippines is the only former US colony in Asia and the 1951 treaty is a continuation of a colonial-era relationship, he said. "But then, that's an agreement that countries bilaterally involved would have to tap to their own advantage."During Blinken and Austin's visit, Philippine fishers and environmental groups voiced opposition to the US-led "proxy war" and expressed concerns over expanded military access to their country.Veronica Cabe, coordinator of the Nuclear and Coal-Free Bataan Movement, highlighted the broader implications of militarization on national security and environmental sustainability, and the importance of resisting involvement in a "proxy conflict".Austin said US President Joe Biden's budget request this year includes more than $128 million to fund important infrastructure projects of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement.US government investment in EDCA locations extends beyond the Department of Defense, he said. For example, the US Agency for International Development plans to pre-position disaster relief supplies at an EDCA location later this year. "That will allow the department to work alongside our Philippine allies to rapidly provide humanitarian assistance in times of need," he said.UNITED NATIONS -- A Chinese envoy on Wednesday urged the Afghan interim government to address the legitimate concerns of the international community and take steps to effectively protect the basic rights of women and girls.Amid the mess left by the hasty withdrawal of foreign troops, the Afghan authorities have worked hard to stabilize the security situation, improve the economy and people's livelihoods, and strengthen regional and international dialogue and cooperation, said Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the UN, at the Security Council briefing on the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan."This momentum is not easy to come by," said the ambassador, noting that Afghanistan continues to face multiple challenges.Underscoring that Afghanistan's recent vice and virtue law has raised international concerns, Fu said "We must realize that women's rights and interests cannot be realized in a vacuum and that microphone diplomacy will not help solve the problem," urging the international community to take a comprehensive and objective view of the situation in Afghanistan.He said the international community should support Afghan peaceful reconstruction and economic recovery, help it eliminate the root causes of instability and underdevelopment, and create conditions conducive to safeguarding the rights and interests of all its people, including women.He called for maintaining the interactions with the Afghan authorities, and scaling up efforts to help Afghanistan overcome its difficulties. "Overseas assets of Afghanistan are Afghan people's life-saving money," Fu stressed, noting that the United States should "unconditionally unfreeze and return them all to the Afghan authorities."The ambassador also called for supporting the Afghan interim government in its fight against terrorism, urging it to take vigorous actions to resolutely combat the various terrorist forces in its territory and to prevent Afghanistan from becoming an enclave for terrorist organizations again.He added that the international community should support Afghanistan in launching alternative cultivation and drug rehabilitation programs and in combating narcotics smuggling to further consolidate achievements in the fight against narcotics.Fu said that China, as a friendly neighbor of Afghanistan, "is ready to work with regional countries and the international community to continue to provide assistance to the Afghan people to the best of its ability and to promote lasting peace, security, development, and prosperity of Afghanistan."An awards ceremony recognizing the top 50 Asian Americans in business took place in New York on Wednesday, advocating Asian American economic and business contributions and a celebration of business excellence.Outstanding 50 Asian Americans in Business award, founded by the Asian American Business Development Center (AABDC), now in its 23rd year, recognizes the achievements of Asian American corporate professionals and entrepreneurs across a wide range of industries.The individuals who received the 2024 award represent a broad spectrum of industries, including finance, technology, healthcare, marketing, and corporate leadership.Among the recipients of the Pinnacle Award are John T.C. Lee, President and CEO of MKS Instruments, Inc., a company that provides technologies and products for measuring, controlling, powering, and analyzing processes in advanced manufacturing. Another recipient is Karthik Narain, Group Chief Executive of Technology and Chief Technology Officer at Accenture, a global IT services company.The Pinnacle Award has previously been awarded to top leaders, including Raj Subramaniam, CEO of FedEx Corporation, who received the honor in 2023.The event hosted over 600 guests, including business, political, and civic leaders from the Asian American business community across the United States.AABDC is also celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. The organization has recognized more than 1,200 Asian American corporate executives and entrepreneurs.“Every year, we look forward to this prestigious event with great excitement as it exemplifies the key role that AABDC plays in society and to the AAPI community – as a champion and advocate of Asian American economic and business contributions and as a celebration of business excellence,” said John Wang, president and founder of AABDC.minluzhang@chinadailyusa.comUNITED NATIONS -- UN General Assembly on Wednesday adopted a non-binding resolution demanding that Israel leave occupied Palestinian territory within one year.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on Tuesday called on world leaders to increase global spending on addressing childhood malnutrition, an issue escalated by climate change.They made the appeal in its eighth annual Goalkeepers report published on Tuesday. Each year, the foundation releases a report to track progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.According to this year's report, climate change is projected to condemn an additional 40 million children to stunting and 28 million more to wasting from this year to 2050 for lack of immediate global action.In 2023, the World Health Organization estimated that 148 million experienced stunting and 45 million experienced wasting — the two most severe forms of chronic and acute malnutrition.Scaling up solutions now can avoid this outcome while also building resilience to climate change and spurring much-needed economic growth, said the report.The report added that the total share of foreign aid aimed at Africa has decreased in the past two decades despite intensifying challenges."This trend leaves hundreds of millions of children at serious risk of dying or suffering from preventable diseases and threatens the unprecedented progress the world made in global health across Africa between 2000 and 2020," it said.Bill Gates, report author and co-chair of the foundation, said in the report that malnutrition is "the world's worst child health crisis," and climate change is only making it worse.He called for maintaining global health funding, immediately addressing the growing threat of child malnutrition by supporting the Child Nutrition Fund, a new platform that coordinates donor financing for nutrition, as well as governments fully funding the established institutions that have proved effective at protecting millions of lives each year."If we do these three things, we won't just usher in a new global health boom and save millions of lives—we'll also prove that humanity can still rise to meet our greatest challenges," he said.Although TikTok faces a potential ban in the United States, that prospect hasn't stopped an increasing number of Americans from turning to the platform for news.About 4 in 10 young adults in the US now regularly get news on TikTok, according to a Pew Research Center analysis published on Tuesday.In four years, the share of adults who say they regularly get news from the short-form video-sharing platform has grown about fivefold, from 3 percent in 2020 to 17 percent in 2024, Pew found.Since 2020, "no social media platform we've studied has seen faster growth in the share of Americans who regularly turn to it for news", said the press release by Pew.The Pew Research Center, based in Washington DC, is "a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world", according to its website.TikTok is popular among teenagers — 63 percent of whom report using the platform — and young adults.Earlier this year, Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation, signed in April by US President Joe Biden, to force a TikTok sale or ownership divestiture by January.TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance Ltd, based in Beijing.Washington politicians have argued that TikTok shares user data with the Chinese government.TikTok has repeatedly denied the accusation and has maintained that it stores user data on servers based in the US.Today, 39 percent of adults under 30 say they regularly get news on TikTok, compared with shares of adults ages 30 to 49 (19 percent), 50 to 64 (9 percent) and 65 and older (3 percent), according to the survey conducted from July 15 to Aug 4 of more than 10,650 US adults.Around half of TikTok users (52 percent) now say they regularly get news there, up from 43 percent last year and 22 percent in 2020.TikTok users are now more likely to get news from TikTok than Facebook users are to get news from Facebook. TikTok users are less likely than users of X (formerly Twitter) to get news on the site, the survey found.Pew published another survey earlier this month that found support for a TikTok ban in the US was declining.The share of Americans who support the US government banning TikTok stood at 32 percent in that survey, down from 38 percent in the fall of 2023 and 50 percent in March 2023.Meanwhile, 28 percent of Americans oppose a ban, up from 22 percent in March 2023. The share who say they are uncertain whether the government should ban TikTok also has risen, from 28 percent in March 2023 to 39 percent now.On Monday, a lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance looked to convince a federal appeals court to block the law — which would ban the app used by 170 million Americans as soon as Jan 19 — arguing that it violates free speech rights.A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia heard two hours of arguments in the lawsuit, which was filed by TikTok and ByteDance in May, seeking an injunction, Reuters reported.US Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny contended that TikTok poses a national security threat because of its access to personal data, asserting that China can covertly manipulate information that Americans consume.Andrew Pincus, the lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance, told the judges that the US government had not demonstrated that TikTok poses national security risks. Pincus also argued that the law violates the US Constitution on numerous grounds, including running afoul of First Amendment protections against government abridgment of speech."The law before this court is unprecedented, and its effect would be staggering," Pincus said, adding that "for the first time in history, Congress has expressly targeted a specific US speaker banning its speech and the speech of 170 million Americans".The law gives ByteDance until Jan 19 to sell or divest TikTok's US assets.TikTok and ByteDance have argued that if the statute is upheld, it would show that Congress can circumvent the First Amendment "by invoking national security and ordering the publisher of any individual newspaper or website to sell to avoid being shut down".The law also prohibits app stores like Apple and Google from offering TikTok and bars internet hosting services from supporting it unless ByteDance divests TikTok by the deadline. The president could extend the deadline by three months if he certifies ByteDance is making significant progress toward a sale.TikTok and the Justice Department have asked for a ruling by Dec 6, which could allow the US Supreme Court to consider any appeal before a ban takes effect.During negotiations with the Biden administration more than two years ago, TikTok presented the government with a draft 90-page agreement that allows a third party to monitor the platform's algorithm, content moderation practices and other programming, The Associated Press reported. But it said a deal was not reached because government officials essentially walked away from the negotiating table in August 2022.The case is playing out less than two months before the Nov 5 US presidential election.Republican candidate Donald Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, are active on TikTok. The Trump administration previously sought a sale of TikTok but Trump now opposes a ban.Agencies contributed to this story.Mei Lanfang is a legendary figure in Peking Opera, and the University of Southern California is marking the 130th anniversary of his birth and whirlwind tour of the US with an exhibition.The exhibition, Reunion: Mei Lan-Fang and the United States, at USC's East Asian Library also commemorates the 94th anniversary of Mei's historic visit to America. It explores a romantic narrative of connection, legacy and reunion — honoring Mei's lasting influence and the cultural ties that continue to bridge nations.In early 1930, Mei embarked on a tour of the US, performing in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington DC, and New York.Few moments in history had brought the United States and China closer than the six months Mei spent captivating American audiences with his Peking Opera performances, according to media reports.Thousands filled theaters across the country to witness his art, and many more had the chance to meet him personally at receptions, banquets and public gatherings.The visit played a "groundbreaking" role in fostering cultural exchanges between China and the US, according to Li Shufeng, vice-president of the Chinese National Academy of Arts (CNAA), the co-organizer of the exhibition with USC."This art exhibition is an effort to follow the path paved by our predecessors," Li said during the opening ceremony of the exhibition on Sept 13 at USC East Asian Library. "It introduced American audiences to the beauty of Chinese opera and the richness of China's ancient cultural heritage, offering them a window into China's long history."Los Angeles was the most significant stop during Mei's US visit. It was in LA that he was welcomed by Hollywood and opera enthusiasts, receiving recognition from both the performing arts and academic communities. Notably, USC awarded Mei an honorary doctorate."In honor of this recognition that has spanned a century, we followed in the footsteps of President Mei Lanfang and brought his life and art back to this campus, which once held deep affection for him, continuing this beautiful and romantic story," Li said.The exhibition, which will run to Dec 20, has four sections — Children of Liyuan, Master of Danjiao, Envoy to the US, and Reunion Today — that feature oil paintings and traditional Chinese artworks centered on Mei.The exhibition also has a range of significant academic publications on Mei and the Mei school of art, along with historical artifacts such as vintage photos, playbills, and maps from Mei's 1930 visit to the US."Through these multifaceted exhibits, the exhibition brings to life Mei's personal journey, stagecraft and his historic tour of the US, offering audiences a deep and captivating glimpse into the aesthetics and spiritual essence of traditional Chinese opera, as embodied by Mei," Li explained.Melissa Just, dean of the USC Libraries, told the audience that the connection between Mei and USC makes the East Asian Library the perfect venue for this exhibition."Today with Mei's (exhibition) return to USC, this beautiful reunion allows us to step back in time and explore Mei's remarkable life. This is a true cross-cultural collaboration," Just said.The exhibition marks the beginning of cooperation between the CNAA and USC. The two sides have signed a memorandum of understanding for exchanges in the next five years. All the exhibits have been donated by the CNAA to USC.Mei and the traditional Chinese culture represented by Peking Opera also have been subjects of continuous research by scholars in the US. One notable scholar is Joshua Goldstein, a professor of history and East Asian languages and cultures at USC. Goldstein has spent decades researching the evolution and dissemination of Peking Opera. His book, Drama Kings: Players and Publics in the Re-creation of Peking Opera, 1870-1937, specifically mentions Mei's visit to the US, highlighting its significance in Peking Opera's development and international impact.Mei's historic visit to the US in the 1930s represents a significant moment in cultural exchange amid a turbulent time, Goldstein said. During his visit, Mei forged friendships with Western contemporaries, including silent film actor Charlie Chaplin."Mei was an innovative figure in Peking Opera," Goldstein noted. "He skillfully blended traditional elements with modern phenomena such as film and visual displays. His approach to character types was also innovative, moving beyond the strict limitations of previous eras."Mei has been hailed as a "creator of beauty". He inherited traditions while also pioneering innovation, organizing and producing many classic operas. Those performances continue to captivate audiences today.Two young talents from the LA Youth Peking Opera Troupe performed selections from Mei school's classics The Drunken Concubine and Mu Guiying Takes the Command, earning enthusiastic applause on Sept 13.Mei's family members, including his grandson Mei Weidong and great-grandson Mei Ruiqi, also attended the exhibition, reliving the legacy and dreams of their esteemed ancestor."As descendants of the Mei Lanfang family, we not only inherit the spirit and cultural traditions of our ancestors, but also have a responsibility to continue promoting cultural exchange and understanding," Weidong told China Daily.In fact, the Mei family has longstanding ties with USC beyond Mei Lanfang's honorary doctorate. Mei's great-grandson, Mei Ruiqi, graduated with a master's degree from USC's business school, while his great-granddaughter earned a degree from USC's medical school."This deep connection between the Mei family and USC has a rich history," Weidong said. "Moving forward, we are committed to continuing our efforts to foster cultural exchange between China and the US."American consumers could soon be stung with rising costs for buying imported goods, warn economists and retail trade organizations, after the Biden administration finalized tariff increases on certain products made in China."Lower-income US consumers will face the biggest consequences from the new tariff hikes," Thomas Fullerton, an American economist and economics professor at the University of Texas at El Paso, told China Daily."That is because they purchase more merchandise goods than services, and many of those goods are produced in China or contain components that are produced in China."The Biden administration first proposed the higher tariffs in May on more than $18 billion worth of products from China. The tariffs are scheduled to start on Sept 27.The tariffs will rise to 100 percent on electric vehicles (EVs), 50 percent on solar cells, and 25 percent on EV batteries, steel, lithium-ion batteries, aluminum and key minerals. Increased tariffs on semiconductor chips will take effect over the next two years, the Office of the US Trade Representative said. But the spike is likely to not only drive up costs for Chinese brands that ship to the US, but also for American companies and consumers who buy low-cost goods, say experts."A substantial portion, but not all, of the higher costs will be paid by US consumers," Fullerton said. "Chinese companies and US importers will also see reduced profit margins because not all the tariffs will be completely passed on in the form of higher prices."The National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), a trade association based in Washington, also has expressed concern about the impact that the tariffs will have on cash-strapped US households and importers."There is no question that tariffs raise costs for consumers, and adding new and expanded tariffs will harm working families and imperil America's national and economic security," NFTC Vice-President of Global Trade Policy Tiffany Smith told China Daily. "Tariffs are paid by US importers, not the Chinese government, and represent dollars that are no longer available for these companies to reinvest in innovation, employees, or expanding their businesses," she said. "The reality is that tariffs are blunt instruments that have not and will not resolve the complex economic challenges that exist between the United States and China."She said that an analysis by the Tax Foundation found that the new tariffs proposed by the Biden administration in May would create an additional tax burden of $3.6 billion on US businesses and consumers. The updated tariffs came after a four-year review aimed at "strengthening protections for strategic industries", the US trade representative said on Sept 13.In 2018, former president Donald Trump began the original tariffs that eventually covered more than $300 billion in imports from China, which later responded with its own tariffs. Biden not only kept Trump's tariffs in place but has increased the rate.Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, hasn't detailed her tariff policy. Trump, however, has been clear.He recently branded himself a "tariff president" and the US a "tariff nation" at a campaign rally in Wisconsin. Harris criticized his policy as a "sales tax" on American households and a "Trump tax". Trump said that it's "not going to be a cost to you. It's going to be a cost to another country." Numerous economists and retail organizations disagree. They have projected that if Trump enacts proposed tariffs of 10 to 20 percent on all goods and 60 percent on goods from China, it will ultimately hurt US consumers' wallets.In the study, "Why Trump's tariff proposals would harm working Americans", by the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely argue that the tariffs could end up hurting Americans families, farmers and exporters the most.The PIIE study said that "in contrast to Trump's frequent, and mistaken, claims that foreigners bear the impact of tariffs, economists have long understood that tariffs burden domestic purchasers of imported goods because imports are the difference between domestic demand and domestic supply a tariff affects both sides of the market".Lovely is professor emeritus of economics at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs of Syracuse University and a senior fellow of the Peterson Institute.She told China Daily: "We look at the effect of these proposals on American households as consumers of imported goods. The new taxes are economically significant — a household with median income is projected to pay $1,700 more each year in import taxes. "The new taxes are also regressive in the sense that they take a larger share of income from poorer households than richer households.''The Center for American Action Forum, a liberal think tank, estimated that tariffs proposed by Trump could amount to a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family."Model simulations conducted by S&P Global Intelligence, Moody's Analytics, and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania all confirm that tariffs are primarily paid by consumers within the United States," Fullerton said.UNITED NATIONS -- Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, on Tuesday urged Israel to heed the strong call of the international community by immediately ending its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory.In remarks at the UN General Assembly emergency special session on the Palestinian question, Fu said decades of occupation and oppression have inflicted untold sufferings on the Palestinian people, and made the long-cherished dream of independent statehood ever more elusive."Ending the occupation is not an option, but a legal obligation for Israel," he stressed.The International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its advisory opinion issued on July 19, unequivocally concluded that Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is a violation of international law, and that Israel is under an obligation to immediately bring to an end its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territories, the ambassador said, adding that the ICJ's advisory opinion affirms the long-standing consensus of the international community and pinpoints the crux of the Palestinian question."We urge Israel to heed the strong call of the international community by immediately ending its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory," he said.Fu noted that ending the occupation is to redress historical injustice and, more importantly, lay the foundation for peace.Underscoring that independent statehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people as a nation, the ambassador said the prolonged illegal occupation has hindered the realization of self-determination of the Palestinian people and given Israel an exclusive veto over Palestine. "This is unacceptable."Only a complete end to the occupation and the establishment of the Independent State of Palestine will truly make it possible for Palestine and Israel to live side by side in peace, for the two peoples to live together in peace and tranquility, and for lasting peace to be achieved in the Middle East, he said.Fu emphasized that the implementation of the two-State solution is the only viable way to resolve the question of Palestine, and is the broad consensus of the international community.He called on the international community to make greater efforts and demand that Israel implement the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, cease its military operations in Gaza, and stop its illegal settlement activities in the West Bank."China advocates the convening of a more broad-based and effective international peace conference to revitalize the political prospects of the two-State solution and to work out a timetable and a roadmap for its implementation," he said."Today is a historic moment," Fu said, noting that the State of Palestine has taken a seat among UN member states and introduced a draft resolution to the General Assembly that focuses on the implementation of the advisory opinion of the ICJ.He said China will vote in favor of the draft resolution, and hopes the resolution will give new impetus to ending the occupation, implementing the two-State solution, and advancing the Middle East peace process.In the diverse culinary landscape of the United States, there are nearly 100,000 Asian restaurants in the US, where Chinese cuisine is prominent.Yet, despite the popularity of Chinese food — which is featured on 39 percent of the menus at Asian restaurants — leaders in the Chinese catering industry are calling for a shift in focus.At a recent industry meeting, experts emphasized that while taste remains crucial, the future success of Chinese restaurants in America hinges on enhancing the overall dining experience.Amy Duan, founder of Chihuo and initiator of the Taste of Asia event, stressed that thriving in the competitive American market requires more than just flavor; it demands an investment in ambience, service and cultural storytelling."Food is the language that (means) you like people, so there's no politics, no barriers … everyone will enjoy the beauty of good food," Duan told China Daily at a recent North America Asian food industry conference and exhibition in Los Angeles.Hundreds of people in the catering industry attended the conference to discuss franchise models, marketing and brands, localization strategies and supply chains.As American consumers increasingly seek authentic, globally influenced culinary experiences, Chinese restaurant owners are encouraged to adapt and innovate, learning from the successful models of American chains like McDonald's and Burger King, to build a loyal and diverse customer base, Duan said.Chinese cuisine is renowned for its rich and diverse flavors, yet Westerners might not fully appreciate the intricate techniques and cultural significance behind its preparation.Many Chinese dishes in the US have been adapted to suit American tastes, often resulting in a sweeter, less-complex flavor profile. That has led to Americanized Chinese food becoming the primary representation of the cuisine."Most of the Chinese restaurants are feeling lonely. They don't know if it's the best way to do the business in America and how to promote the Asian food culture in America," Duan said.While discussing expanding a restaurant chain globally, the industry leaders emphasized the importance of understanding local markets, adapting to customer preferences and overcoming cultural barriers.Zhao Yong, president of the Asian American Hospitality Alliance, highlighted the challenges facing Chinese cuisine in the US, describing the industry as being in a "red ocean" state — saturated with competition but lacking in cohesive strategy.He said there are three main problems: low prices leading to a decline in quality, a lack of standardization, and the use of cheap labor, which hinders the industry's growth and potential for public recognition."For example, if there is a small restaurant in a small US town with a population of 20,000, soon there will be 10 Chinese restaurants in that town, more than McDonald's, but everyone is undercutting prices, and prices can't go any lower. This has been the traditional expansion method for Chinese restaurants in the US —competing against each other," Zhao said.To address those issues, Zhao suggested creating national Chinese food festivals, such as Hot Pot Day or Soup Dumpling Day, to promote culinary brands and encourage investment in the Chinese food supply chain.Such efforts would raise the profile of Chinese cuisine, he said.However, some experts expressed doubts about introducing too much of the original culture into the US market.Cervantes Lee, professor of hospitality business at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said that while authenticity is important, it's crucial to respect local customs and culture."The business should be managed by a team familiar with the local market, and the food's flavor must be adapted to suit local tastes," Lee said."It's important not to assume that Americans will immediately appreciate our authentic dishes," Duan said.For Asian restaurants in the US, the focus is often on delivering the best flavors and tastes. However, American customers seek more than just good food; they are drawn to the overall atmosphere — whether classic, upscale or casual — and the story behind the restaurant.Service is also crucial, as dining out is about enjoying a complete experience, a point emphasized at the gathering."Unfortunately, many Asian or Chinese restaurateurs tend to overlook the importance of environment, vibe and service, concentrating solely on taste, which isn't enough to satisfy American diners," Duan said.Still, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Thai restaurants are increasingly being included on Michelin's list in recent years. They become popular in the US partly due to adapting their offerings to local palates."This approach contrasts with simply copying menus from their home countries and trying to sell them directly to non-native audiences," Duan added.If the greatest challenge for a Chinese restaurant is to preserve the traditional flavors and cultural heritage of Chinese cuisine while adapting to local American tastes and building a loyal customer base, then Lao Sze Chuan in Chicago has achieved both.Former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel is a loyal customer, often bringing his wife and son to dine there. Emanuel's favorite dish is the dry chili chicken, recognized by the Chicago Tribune as a landmark dish of the city.His wife favors the sweet lemon crispy shrimp, a contrast to her husband's spicy preference, while their son enjoys the dry-fried string beans with tofu. Meanwhile, at the Lao Sze Chuan branch in Washington DC, former Cabinet secretary Elaine Chao could be savoring the Peking duck at the same time.Founded in Chicago in 1998 by Tony Hu, also known as Chef Tony, the upscale Chinese restaurant has become more than just another pepper steak spot."We develop the menu into four sections to cater to different tastes and preferences," Hu told China Daily.He said the menus are divided into four sections: traditional hometown dishes for older Chinese immigrants; popular spicy hot pot dishes for young people and international students; American Chinese cuisine like sesame chicken, with a unique twist; and innovative creations such as lemon crispy shrimp."Eighty percent of our customers are local Americans; many of them discover flavors and enjoy for a lifetime," Hu said.Lao Sze Chuan has 16 branches across the US, with eight more in planning stages, turning into destination dining experiences in cities such as Chicago, Washington and Houston, and in the states of Minnesota, Connecticut and Ohio."We offer over 20 brand-specific dishes and are continuously developing more," Chef Tony added. "We welcome local partners to join us."Lao Sze Chuan has received numerous accolades over the years. It was named the No 1 Chinese restaurant and the top takeout restaurant by The Daily Meal. The restaurant also has been featured as one of the best Chinese restaurants by Thrillist and Time Out magazine and has earned the Michelin Bib Gourmand Award seven times in a row.By sharing the stories behind Chinese cuisine with local communities and universities, the chef and his restaurant have attracted significant mainstream media attention."Chinese restaurants need to learn to speak up — it's not enough to just do things well," said Duan. "Chinese cuisine has so many good ingredients and stories to tell, and we are telling the story of the entire Asian community, not just about food." A man suspected in an apparent attempt to assassinate former US president Donald Trump at his Florida golf course hid out for nearly 12 hours beforehand, according to a court complaint.The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was charged with two federal gun crimes on Monday.The incident Sunday afternoon raised questions about how an armed person was able to get so close to Trump, the Republican presidential candidate in the Nov 5 election, two months after a gunman fired at Trump during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, cutting his ear with a bullet.Trump's visit to his golf course in West Palm Beach was not on his public schedule, US Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe said Monday.A Secret Service agent who was "walking the perimeter" of the course, according to the criminal complaint, opened fire after seeing a rifle barrel poking out of bushes a few hundred yards away from Trump, who was on the fifth hole fairway.The gunman fled in a Nissan sport utility vehicle "at a high rate of speed", according to the complaint filed in US District Court in West Palm Beach. Officers found a loaded SKS assault-style rifle with a scope, a digital camera and a plastic bag of food.Records show a phone associated with Routh was located at the golf course starting at 1:59 am on Sunday EDT, according to the complaint. Federal agents had requested Routh's location data from his wireless provider.The suspect was on the public side of a fence along the course's boundary, Rowe said.Routh was arrested about 40 minutes after the incident, driving north on Interstate 95. The license plate on his vehicle had been reported stolen from a Ford truck. Bodycam footage of Routh's arrest was released by the Martin County Sheriff's Office."There have been previous individuals who have taken pictures of the former president while he's golfing," Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for the district that covers Palm Beach County, told Fox News. "They've gone through the shrubs and been able to poke a camera through the fencing. You would think that perhaps maybe they would consider someone scoping the perimeter."A 2019 tip to the FBI alleged that Routh was a convicted felon who illegally possessed a firearm, Jeffrey Veltri, the agent in charge of the FBI's Miami field office, told reporters.In court on Monday, Routh was charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. He is expected back in court for a bond hearing on Sept 23 and an arraignment on Sept 30.In 2002, Routh pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered fully automatic gun, which in North Carolina is defined as a weapon of mass destruction, according to the county district attorney's office. He was sentenced to probation.Routh is a staunch supporter of Ukraine and has traveled there, seeking to recruit foreign fighters in the country's military conflict with Russia.Social media accounts linked to Routh's name showed posts on  Ukraine as well as claims that Trump is a threat to American democracy.On April 21, Routh directed a post on X to Elon Musk, owner of X and founder of SpaceX: "I would like to buy a rocket from you. I wish to load it with a warhead for Putins Black sea mansion bunker to end him. Can you give me a price please."In another X post, Routh wrote to US President Joe Biden: "@POTUS Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA ...make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose."Public access to the Facebook and X profiles has been removed.Trump has questioned the amount of aid the United States has provided to Ukraine and has vowed to end the war immediately if elected.Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has promised continued support for Ukraine.Trump claimed that Routh was acting on Democrats' "highly inflammatory language"."Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out," he said, according to Fox.Biden and Trump had a "cordial conversation" on Monday, White House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons posted on X.The Secret Service has been under scrutiny since the July shooting. The agency needs more help, including possibly more personnel, Biden told reporters on Monday, adding: "Thank God the president's OK."Agencies contributed to this story.Wildfires in Bolivia are on track to set a record for the number of blazes this year, fueled by the destructive agricultural practice of land clearing through burning, and compounded by irregular rainfall patterns.So far, the fires have destroyed more than 3 million hectares of rainforest, surpassing the devastation witnessed during the record-breaking fire season of 2010. They are not only decimating vast areas of rainforest but also shrouding cities such as Cochabamba and Santa Cruz in thick smoke, darkening the skies and raising concerns about respiratory health.The fight against the fires is putting a strain on Bolivia's limited resources, including a shortage of both firefighters and equipment.Ludy Rudon, a firefighter working along a 100-kilometer fire line in the central region, emphasized the need for more manpower to control and extinguish the major blazes."The workdays are tough considering the length of the fire line, the heat, the wind and especially the type of fuel, which is very dense and tall," Rudon said. "The rain helped very little because the density of the trees prevented the rain from reaching the ground — it was almost superficial."South America is currently at the peak of its fire season, but Bolivia has experienced an earlier outbreak because of drought. The country's Defense Minister Edmundo Novillo announced emergency measures on Sept 7 to secure international support, adding to the 2,500 firefighters and 20 aircraft already deployed.Wildfires across Latin America have grown increasingly severe in recent years."Farmers tend to clear and burn the vegetation to enrich the soil with nutrients," said Erick Sossa Sanchez, an engineer and departmental director for Cochabamba at the National Meteorology and Hydrology Service. "Then, they plant ... and harvest. Due to changes in the agricultural frontier, this (practice) has been increasing."Addressing this practice, known as chaqueo, may require legislative changes. Chaqueo involves burning vegetation before the rainy season to clear land for planting, with the ash enriching the soil. However, these fires frequently get out of control, causing massive destruction."Despite regulations prohibiting burning, many people ignored the warnings," said Oswaldo Maillard, head of the Chiquitano Dry Forest Observatory. Wildfires have ravaged the Chiquitano forest in eastern Bolivia, destroying thousands of hectares.John Zambrana Nogales, an agricultural engineer, said about 40 percent of forest fires occur on farmland, about one-fourth on public land or protected areas and 15 percent on indigenous lands.Sanchez said the Bolivian Parliament should repeal lenient regulations on chaqueo to help curb the issue.US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was the target of "what appears to be an attempted assassination" on Sunday afternoon at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, the FBI said — just two months after he survived a previous attempt on his life.Both incidents highlight the challenges of keeping presidential candidates safe in a hotly contested and polarized campaign with just more than seven weeks to go before the Nov 5 election.Trump sent an email to supporters soon after the incident saying he was "safe and well".Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Secret Service agents fired at the suspect, who was pointing an AK-47-style rifle with a scope as Trump was on the golf course.Bradshaw said the gunman also had two backpacks and a GoPro camera and was about 365 to 460 meters away, hiding in shrubbery — with the muzzle of the weapon visible — while Trump played on a nearby hole. The suspect dropped the weapon and fled in an SUV.The golf course was partially closed for Trump as he played, and agents were a few holes ahead of him when they noticed a man with the firearm, Bradshaw said.CNN, Fox News and The New York Times identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, from Hawaii, citing unidentified law enforcement officials. The FBI declined to comment.It was not clear if or how the suspect knew Trump was playing golf at the time, or what his motive was, but the attempted attack is sure to raise new questions about the level of protection he is given.CNN and CBS reported Routh was a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii who had an arrest record spanning decades and regularly posted on politics and current events, including sometimes criticizing Trump.Apprehending suspectIn neighboring Martin County, Sheriff William Snyder said the suspect was apprehended within minutes of the FBI, Secret Service and Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office putting out an urgent alert.Snyder told WPTV that the suspect "was not armed when we took him out of the car". The man had a calm, flat demeanor and showed little emotion when he was stopped by police, Snyder said, adding he did not question why he was being pulled over."He never asked, 'What is this about?' Obviously, law enforcement with long rifles, blue lights, a lot going on. He never questioned it," Snyder said.Fox News host Sean Hannity said on the air that he spoke with Trump and the former president's golf partner, Steve Witkoff, after the incident.They told Hannity they had been on the fifth hole and about to go to putt when they heard "pop pop, pop pop". Within seconds, Secret Service agents "pounced on" Trump and "covered him", Witkoff said.Trump returned to Florida on the weekend after a West Coast campaign trip. His Sunday schedule had not been made public by the campaign. Trump often spends the morning golfing before having lunch at the club.He has had increased security since the assassination attempt in July in Butler, Pennsylvania. When he has stayed at Trump Tower in New York, a line of dump trucks have been parked outside the building. At outdoor rallies now, he speaks behind bulletproof glass.The White House said President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, were briefed and would be kept updated on the investigation. It said the president was "relieved" that Trump is safe.In a statement, Harris said she was "glad" Trump was safe, adding, "Violence has no place in America."The leaders of the bipartisan task force in Congress, which has been investigating the earlier assassination attempt, said on Sunday it is monitoring the situation and has requested a briefing by the Secret Service.During the July 13 rally in Pennsylvania, Trump was fired upon, with a bullet grazing his ear. A rallygoer was killed.The shooting forced Kimberly Cheatle to resign as Secret Service director under bipartisan pressure from Congress.The gunman, identified as Thomas Crooks, 20, was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper.Agencies contributed to this story. NEW YORK --The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) "is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination" of former US President and current Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, the agency said on Sunday, just two months after an attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally.Trump was safe after shots were fired at Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. A Secret Service agent, who was ahead of the former president, spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence and "engaged" with the suspect. Trump was moving between holes five and six at his golf course with donor Steve Witkoff when gunshots went off. The course was immediately locked down.Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder said at a press conference later in the day that his agency "flooded" Interstate 95 and closed a large swath of the highway before eventually safely stopping the suspect's vehicle and detaining him.The suspect was not armed when law enforcement officials took him out of the car. He has not made any statement so far.After the incident, Trump said in a fundraising email that he is "safe and well," adding that "my resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life! ... I will never slow down. I will never give up. I WILL NEVER SURRENDER!"Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, said that he spoke with Trump after the security incident. "I'm glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits," Vance wrote on X.President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were both "relieved to know" that Trump was safe and had been briefed on the security incident.In her statement posted on X Sunday, Harris said, "I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America."Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that he had been briefed by acting Secret Service Director Ronald L. Rowe Jr over the incident."I applaud the Secret Service for their quick response to ensure former President Trump's safety," Schumer said. "There is no place in this country for political violence of any kind. The perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."Meanwhile, the leaders of the bipartisan task force in the US Congress that has been investigating the earlier assassination attempt on Trump said they are monitoring the situation and have requested a briefing from the Secret Service.Golf courses, and in particular Trump's properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds while he plays, CNN quoted people familiar with the matter as saying."A golf course is often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design -- often abutting public roads and containing elements like trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins -- make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure," the report said.The incident raises new questions about how to keep Trump safe -- not only while he is campaigning across the country, but while he spends time at his own clubs and properties, said the AP news agency."Unlike typical VIPs, who live in private residences with tall fences, Trump, while in Florida, resides in a club open to dues-paying members, and often spends his downtime at his golf courses," it said.Not too long ago, Trump was the target of an assassination attempt during a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a staccato of shots rang out in the middle of his speech, killing one attendee and severely injuring two others. According to the FBI, either a bullet or a bullet fragment struck Trump, wounding him in the ear. LOS ANGELES -- The crew of the US Polaris Dawn mission returned to Earth early Sunday, completing the commercial human spaceflight mission.SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft carrying four civilian astronauts splashed down off the coast of Dry Tortugas, Florida at 3:36 am Eastern Time Sunday (0736 GMT), according to SpaceX.The four-member crew consists of mission commander Jared Isaacman, pilot Kidd Poteet, and specialists Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon.The crew lifted off aboard the Dragon spacecraft on Tuesday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. During their five-day space journey, they traveled as high as 1,400 km above Earth, the highest humans have traveled since the Apollo program over 50 years ago, according to SpaceX.Two astronauts of the four-member crew, wearing SpaceX's newly-designed extravehicular activity suits, completed a spacewalk on Thursday, marking the first time astronauts have space-walked from a commercial spacecraft.The crew conducted scientific experiments during their multi-day mission, including essential health and human performance research for NASA's Human Research Program.

He also called on the international community to pave the way to this end by providing tangible assistance and facilitation, and urged all parties concerned to put peace and humanity first and re-channel their resources and energy to ending hostilities through diplomacy.In response to remarks by the US representative that "spread a false narrative in his earlier statement, distorting and vilifying China's position on the Ukraine issue once again," Geng emphasized that "China did not create the Ukraine crisis, much less are we a party to the conflict.""China has not supplied weapons to either party, and we have consistent and rigorous controls over dual-use items. We maintain normal trade and economic cooperation with all countries around the world, including Russia and Ukraine," he added.Underscoring that China's position on the Ukraine issue "is objective and impartial," the ambassador said that for over two years, China has been working hard to promote peace and encourage and facilitate peace talks.He elaborated the efforts made by China and other countries on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, including the six-point consensus jointly issued by China and Brazil in May this year. "This fully demonstrates that diplomatic negotiations and a political settlement meet the common expectations of the majority of countries and represent the will of the international community.""We hope that the United States will not continue to turn a deaf ear to these calls for peace, that it will desist from discrediting and obstructing the diplomatic efforts of China and other countries concerned, undermining international solidarity, creating division and antagonism, and provoking bloc confrontations, and that it will truly play a constructive role in bringing an early end to the war and achieving peace," Geng said.Finding the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other is what both nations and the international community need the most, a top Chinese envoy said on Thursday.Chinese Ambassador to the US Xie Feng, speaking at the Vision China forum at the Asia Society in New York, said that for the past 50 years, the reopening and development of China-US relations was the most important event in international relations and the biggest contributor to global peace and prosperity."History provides us inspirations to look ahead to the future," Xie said in a keynote speech.He said that in the next 50 years, charting that proper course will be critical to international relations.The forum, co-hosted by China Daily and Bank of China to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the establishment of China-US diplomatic relations, brought together more than 200 witnesses, participants and contributors to those relations to discuss "inspiration from the past" and "vision for the future".The envoy noted that the best way to commemorate the anniversary is to explore the right way to get along in the new era and usher in a brighter future."The history of the China-US relationship in the past 45 years, especially the ups and downs in recent years, tell us that pressure, sanctions, isolation, containment and blockade don't serve the purpose."Rather, they bring self-inflicted trouble and require extra work to offset the unwanted results," Xie said.He said that the two countries share ever-broader common interests, as the global significance of their relationship is increasing."The idea of 'decoupling' is illusive; viewing each other as new Cold War adversaries will prove to be the biggest strategic misjudgment in the 21st century," Xie said, adding that a conflict between China and the US would be unbearable for both and the world.The envoy underscored that among the four red lines China has drawn — Taiwan, democracy and human rights, path and system, and development rights, the Taiwan question is paramount in China-US relations and must not be crossed."For China-US relations to have a 'stable floor', it is critical to avoid touching these 'high-voltage wires'," Xie said.In his speech, Xie said that more than 10,000 American youths have visited China since President Xi Jinping proposed during his summit with US President Joe Biden last November to invite 50,000 American young people to China for exchanges and study programs over five years."The growth of China-US relations has primarily come from the joint efforts of our peoples," he said. "We will build more bridges of dialogue and communication between our peoples to sustain the tradition of friendship."Also speaking at the forum, Qu Yingpu, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily, said the country's only English-language newspaper has chronicled the development of Sino-US relations and "faithfully recorded the bonds forged between the two peoples"."China-US relations are the most important bilateral relations in the world, and they must be managed well, despite the risks and challenges," Qu said.Qu said the newspaper "has never been absent" when important moments unfolded in and between the two countries.Most recently, it covered stories including American families who once lived in the Fujian resort of Kuliang, US youth visiting China, the 80th anniversary commemoration of the "Flying Tigers", and the August debut of the giant pandas "Yun Chuan" and "Xin Bao" at San Diego Zoo."Just as President Xi Jinping pointed out 'the hope of the China-US relationship lies in the people, its foundation is in grassroots connections, its future depends on the youth, and its vitality comes from subnational exchanges' — those are the key aspects we should constantly work to strengthen," Qu said.The veteran journalist said he is a firm believer that "mutual understanding is the foundation of friendly cooperation" and that "a modernized China represents an opportunity, rather than a challenge, to the United States".Given that China and the US have accumulated remarkable "cognitive deficits" amid profound changes taking place in the world, it is crucial that the two peoples reacquaint themselves with a real, multidimensional and comprehensive view of each other's country, he said.For five years in a row, the newspaper has worked with the Chinese embassy in the US to stage an annual story-sharing event titled "My China Album", presenting photo albums that show a unique pathway to understanding, while acting as a lens through which one can appreciate the richness of another culture, Qu said.The Vision China morning session featured presentations from six Americans. They came to tell stories of friendship with China in a time wrought with uncertainty. They are people who have remained steadfast in their support of China while trade and political tensions persist, particularly in a US presidential election year.American policy for China has veered off course because the assumptions have changed, in many ways radically, David Firestein, CEO and president of the George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations said during his speech at the event."They have changed in a way that they have become less accurate than they were before," he said.He outlined six wrong assumptions: China is no longer a partner but an enemy; building a constructive relationship with China does not serve the long-term interests of the US; China no longer accepts the existing world order and seeks to reshape it; China is trying to replace the US as the sole superpower; excessive engagement with China harms the US and makes it vulnerable; China-US relations are a "zero-sum game"."They're all wrong, every one of them," Firestein said of the assumptions.In 1979, teenagers Kelly Van Dries and her elder sister Kitty were working at a rodeo in Simonton, Texas, owned by their parents. Kelly had the honor of presenting a cowboy hat to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.Sarah Lande of Iowa recalled the friendly exchanges of the city of Muscatine with Hebei province.Their presentations were followed by a Gen Z debate and exchange in the afternoon, when American and Chinese youths debated "The impact of artificial intelligence on human life" and discussed how to avoid the Thucydides Trap, while overcoming "information bubbles" for better China-US communication.Ge Haijiao, chairman of Bank of China, said it is the longest continuously operating and most globalized bank in China. The bank has been a witness, participant and contributor to the ever-deepening and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the US."Bank of China is firmly committed to promoting trade and commerce between China and the United States, to the benefit of both societies," Ge said in a message read in New York by Hu Wei, president and CEO of Bank of China USA and chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce-USA.Steve Blake, chief representative for the environmental group WildAid in Beijing, said his experience in China "has really shaped my entire life for the most part"."Study Chinese, go check out China. Don't pay so much attention to the high level — a lot of negativity around China these days. On the ground, it's still an absolutely amazing place," he said.Angela Chen, co-chair of the New York Philharmonic's International Advisory Board and the founder and president of the China Arts Foundation International, said: "I'm really touched by these stories. You should share them with US audiences. I encourage your team to make a documentary featuring all the stories shared today — US audiences should know that there are still many people building connections between the US and China," she said.John W. Allen, chairman and CEO of Greater China Corp, said:"Vision China brought us together beautifully, and the young people are our hope for all of us. I was so impressed with all of the members of the panel. I've been a friend of China Daily for decades."Belinda Robinson, Minlu Zhang and Heng Weili in New York contributed to this story.LIMA - Former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori died Wednesday at the age of 86 in Lima, "after a long battle against cancer", confirmed his daughter and political leader Keiko Fujimori."Our father, Alberto Fujimori, has just departed to meet the Lord," Keiko wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Hours before his death, the spokesperson for the Fuerza Popular party, Miguel Torres, said that the former president was in a "delicate" state and going through "a difficult time".Fujimori, who served as Peru's president from 1990 to 2000, was released from prison last December, where he was serving a 25-year sentence for crimes against humanity.The World Laureates Association Prize (WLA Prize) has unveiled its laureates for 2024, with Jon Kleinberg, a professor of Computer Science & Information Science at Cornell University, and Professor Jeremy Nathans at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine recognized for their contributions, announced the WLA Prize management committee on Thursday during a press conference in Shanghai.Unveiled at the 4th WLA Forum on Nov 1, 2021, the WLA Prize is an international science prize initiated by the World Laureates Association (WLA), managed by the WLA Foundation, and exclusively funded by HongShan.The prize is awarded annually and features two categories: "Computer Science or Mathematics" and "Life Science or Medicine." The total award for each prize, which may be divided among up to four laureates, is 10 million yuan ($1.39 million).This year, the WLA Prize in Computer Science or Mathematics is bestowed on Kleinberg "for seminal contributions at the interface of computer science and social science, including intellectual leadership in the fields of social networks and algorithmic fairness.".The selection committee, chaired by Michael I. Jordan, lauds Kleinberg's pioneering work that bridges computer science, mathematics, and social economics. Kleinberg's research not only addresses fundamental challenges within these disciplines but also fosters collaboration to tackle complex societal issues. His extensive contributions to algorithms, behavioral economics, game theory, law, and network science have reshaped the landscape of information technology and laid the groundwork for future advancements.Moreover, Kleinberg's groundbreaking studies on the structure of the World Wide Web in the 1990s have had a profound impact on search engine design, influencing the evolution of Internet search algorithms. His leadership in the study of social networks and machine learning has further enriched the field, particularly in enhancing algorithmic fairness and understanding the interaction between machine learning and human decision-making.Professor Nathans was awarded the 2024 WLA Prize in Life Science and Medicine "for discovering the genes, regulation, and plasticity underlying human color vision and elucidating disease mechanisms that lead to blindness".Chair of the Life Science or Medicine selection committee, Randy Schekman, praises Nathans for his groundbreaking research on the molecular basis of color vision. Nathan's early achievements in cloning the opsin genes responsible for color vision in cows and humans laid the foundation for understanding sensory receptors. His subsequent work on color blindness and inherited retinal degeneration revolutionized the field, unveiling crucial insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying these conditions.Nathan's discoveries, including identifying the gene for Stargardt disease and demonstrating the remarkable plasticity of the visual system in mice, have significantly advanced our comprehension of human vision. Schekman commends Nathans for his insatiable curiosity, profound knowledge of vision science, and innovative approaches, positioning him as "one of the best neuroscientists in the world".The 2024 WLA Prize Award Ceremony is set to take place in Shanghai on Oct 25, where both winners will be present to receive their accolades.The WLA Prize, which has been presented annually since 2022, is committed to celebrating groundbreaking research and innovation on a global scale, recognizing exceptional individuals who have made significant contributions to the scientific community to ensure their groundbreaking work receives the recognition it deserves.Although it's been 23 years, the commemoration of Sept 11 remains uniquely somber, even in election years.The morning after their heated presidential debate in Philadelphia, US Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, and former president Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, stood in the same row in a Manhattan ceremony Wednesday morning along with current President Joe Biden. They listened to the annual reading of the names of the victims of the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.Biden and Trump shook hands, as did the vice-president and Trump, whose running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, also was there. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg stood in the middle of the politicians.In describing the scene, The New York Times wrote that "it is a mark of the singular nature of Sept. 11 as a traumatic national touchstone that the combatants in today's scathing political wars would feel compelled to share a tent even for an hour"."Both sides knew that whoever did not show would pay a political price, so they swallowed any reservations and made the appearance."There were no formal remarks at the Ground Zero site, where on Sept 11, 2001, al-Qaida hijackers intentionally crashed two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, both of which eventually collapsed.Hijackers also crashed another jet into the Pentagon, and a fourth plane went down in a Pennsylvania field after passengers heroically stormed the cockpit and confronted the hijackers.The attacks at the three sites claimed nearly 3,000 lives.In New York, which took the brunt of the 9/11 toll, family members, including wives, husbands, sisters, brothers and now, more than two decades later, an increasing number of grandchildren, read out the names of the deceased.As the years passed, scores of people who were at Ground Zero and lucky enough to survive that fateful day ended up succumbing to cancers and other diseases due to the toxic burning at the site. Many of them were volunteers who helped clear "the pile" of debris.More than 45,000 people are living with physical ailments resulting from that day, the New York Post reported.At least 45,200 civilians and officers from the Fire Department of New York (FDNY), the New York Police Department (NYPD) and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have at least one cancer or disease that has been directly linked to 9/11.The FDNY lost 343 members on 9/11, many of whom headed into the building while others were fleeing. Now, the FDNY says that more firefighters have died from illnesses stemming from rescue and recovery efforts at Ground Zero.Last week, the names of 32 FDNY members were added to the department's World Trade Center Memorial Wall in Brooklyn, putting the deaths from illnesses to more than 360, Axios reported."As we do every year, we will reflect on the 343 members who died that day, and we will be sobered in knowing that those insurmountable losses did not end at the World Trade Center site," Fire Commissioner Robert Tucker said during the Sept 4 ceremony. "Instead, we have seen our members become sick because of time they spent working in the rescue and recovery."The NYPD lost 23 members on 9/11, but subsequent illnesses have claimed many more lives. In May, the Police Benevolent Association recognized 377 total members on its NYPD Memorial Wall as those who died from Sept 11-related illnesses, but said the number has already risen to more than 400, the New York Post reported.Many financial industry workers at Wall Street firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald were killed, as the World Trade Center was located in the Financial District, a short walk from the New York Stock Exchange.Biden, Harris and Trump also visited Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, where Flight 93 went down. The president called for a return to bipartisan unity and gave a hat to a Trump supporter, who gave him a Trump hat in return, according to spokesperson Andrew Bates.The president put on the hat, making for a viral photograph. "Thanks for the support, Joe," the Trump campaign wrote on social media.Biden and Harris later headed to a memorial at the Pentagon outside Washington."On this day 23 years ago, terrorists believed they could break our will and bring us to our knees. They were wrong. They will always be wrong. In the darkest of hours, we found light. And in the face of fear, we came together -- to defend our country, and to help one another," Biden said in a statement.Trump told Fox News of Sept 11: "It was a very, very sad, horrible day. There's never been anything like it."Agencies contributed to this story.LOS ANGELES - Bridge Fire, the largest wildfire in California as of Wednesday, exponentially exploded from 4,000 acres (16.2 square km) early Tuesday to nearly 48,000 acres (194.2 square km) with zero containment.According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), the blaze, jumping in size over ten times in 24 hours, has expanded from Los Angeles County into neighboring San Bernardino County.In an update Wednesday afternoon, officials said about 40 homes and cabins were destroyed in fire. There have been no reports of significant injuries or deaths.Bridge Fire is one of three major fires in southern California, along with Line Fire and Airport Fire, which all sparked amid an intense heatwave that brought triple digit temperatures and dry conditions to the region.Officials said a 34-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday. He was accused of sparking the Line Fire burning in the foothills of the San Bernardino National Forest, east of Los Angeles, which spanned over 34,600 acres (140.1 square km) at 14 percent containment as of Wednesday.Justin Wayne Halstenberg, a Fedex delivery driver, was allegedly started Bridge Fire intentionally on Sept. 5, but local authorities did not disclose how he did it.Meanwhile, Airport Fire, started Monday afternoon in Orange County, now stands at over 22,000 acres (89.1 square km) with zero containment, according to the latest Cal Fire data.PHILADELPHIA — US Vice-President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump faced off for the first time on Tuesday night in a 2024 US presidential debate in the city of Philadelphia.The debate, hosted by ABC News, started at the National Constitution Center.Harris shook hands with Trump after they were introduced on stage. During their over 90-minute debate, they clashed over key issues, including the economy, abortion, immigration, and US foreign policies, aiming to appeal to voters across the country.With less than eight weeks to go before the election, and days until early voting starts in some states, the debate, the only one scheduled, offered a rare opportunity for both candidates to make their case for a television audience of tens of millions of voters.Both Harris and Trump touted plans to strengthen the economy and bring down the cost of living. Harris vowed to build an "opportunity economy", citing plans to make housing more affordable and expand the child tax credit. Trump repeated his claim that he would impose tariffs on imports from other countries and also criticized the high inflation rates under the Biden-Harris administration.Abortion was a vital issue for both candidates in the debate. Trump emphasized his position that abortion should be a state issue.Harris criticized what she referred to as the "Trump abortion bans" since Roe versus Wade was overturned. She also highlighted cases where women have been unable to get abortions after being raped or struggled to get miscarriage care.They also sparred over US foreign policies regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.Trump repeatedly mentioned US President Joe Biden during the debate, and Harris reminded him, "You're not running against Joe Biden; you're running against me."The fiery debate also included personal attacks."The back-and-forth at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia was riddled with false and misleading comments, including on job growth and a baseless claim about Haitian immigrants," NBC News reported.The debate was the second presidential debate of the 2024 election, following the first one between Biden and Trump in June.Biden bowed out of the race in July due to concerns over his age, health, and debate performance. He passed the torch to Harris, who secured the Democratic presidential nomination in August.Tuesday's debate was critical as polls show a tight race with election day less than two months away.The science and technology relationship between the United States and China has entered a new era of complexity and uncertainty after a 45-year-old agreement, long considered a cornerstone of cooperation, expired on Aug 27.The US-China Science and Technology Agreement, the first official agreement signed after the normalization of US-China relations in the 1970s, ended despite the scientific community's efforts to have it renewed.Originally signed by then US president Jimmy Carter and then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979, the symbolically significant pact had been renewed every five years since it took effect, with the most recent renewal in 2018.However, the agreement's fate had been hanging in the balance since August 2023, when it was on the verge of lapsing. In an attempt to salvage the agreement, the two countries extended it twice, for six months each time, to negotiate renewal terms. Those efforts proved unsuccessful, and the most recent six-month extension expired last month.Many disappointedThe demise of the STA has sparked concern and disappointment among experts in the field.Richard Dasher, director of the US-Asia Technology Management Center at Stanford University, supports maintaining international cooperation."I think we should stay internationally focused. And I think that cooperation is good whenever we can do it. So, in principle, I would be in favor of continuing the US-China Science and Technology Agreement," Dasher told China Daily.The frustration surrounding the obstacles to renewing the STA is palpable within the scientific community.Denis Simon, a former professor at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, and Marcus Stanley, director of studies at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, voiced their exasperation by asking, "Why can't we just let American and Chinese scientists get along?"In an article published in the Quincy Institute's online magazine Responsible Statecraft the day after the agreement expired, the authors emphasized the critical role of the STA in fostering scientific collaboration."The STA provided an overarching framework for facilitating scientific exchanges, joint research projects, and the sharing of knowledge and technical expertise," they wrote.Simon and Stanley warned of the potential consequences of allowing the STA to lapse."It would be a mistake for agreements to facilitate basic scientific research cooperation such as the STA to become irretrievably damaged by the increase in US-China tensions. The decision on whether to extend, amend, or terminate the STA has profound implications for the global scientific community," they cautioned.The authors also highlighted the broader context of growing distrust between the two countries, which has contributed to the current impasse. Besides Congress, the US government has increasingly scrutinized Chinese scientists and researchers over "national security" concerns, which has hampered academic exchanges."This climate of growing distrust not only has made renewal of the STA more contentious, but it has also made the rekindling of overall science and technology cooperation more difficult," they said.Roger Pielke Jr, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank, expressed his support for continuing the STA "in the most robust form that can be negotiated between the two nations".He argued that the very existence of such an agreement is more important than its specific details, adding he viewed "decoupling" to be "a bad idea and it is also a bad idea in science and technology".Crucial supportFor decades, the STA has been instrumental in fostering scientific collaboration in areas of basic science such as agriculture, clean energy, public health and the environment. It has provided US and Chinese researchers with crucial financial, legal and political support, enabling them to work together on groundbreaking research and innovations.Dasher emphasized the interconnected nature of the global scientific community and the importance of collaboration."There's a continuum between basic research and actual commercialization, and certainly in the basic research area, there's always cooperation potential, just about everywhere," he said. "And you're seeing a lot of papers written jointly between people in China and in the United States."The agreement has contributed to a rapid increase in both the number and quality of joint papers by Chinese and US researchers. However, in recent years, research collaboration has declined, attributed to rising tensions and anti-China sentiment.A study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in June showed that scientific cooperation between the US and China had drastically decreased since 2016 when the former US president, Donald Trump, took office.The study analyzed data in three key areas: STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) trainee mobility, use of scientific works between scientists in each country, and scientist productivity in each country as measured by the production of peer-reviewed papers.Between 2016 and 2019, ethnically Chinese graduate students were 16 percent less likely to attend a US-based PhD program. Moreover, those who did attend such programs were 4 percent less likely to stay in the US after graduation, the study found.Output dropsThe researchers also documented a sharp decline in Chinese use of US science as measured by citations, although they found no such decline in the propensity of US scientists to cite Chinese research.The trends are corroborated by the State of the Science address delivered by US National Academy of Sciences President Marcia McNutt in June.McNutt presented data showing that the US is dropping in research output as measured by articles published, while China is experiencing a triple-digit percentage increase. In terms of research quality, measured by the percentage of articles in the top 1 percent cited, the US is losing ground while China has moved ahead of the European Union.The shifting landscape of scientific productivity is also reflected in the pharmaceutical industry. China's share of drugs in phase one to three trials has risen dramatically from about 3 percent in 2013 to 28 percent in 2021, while the US share is in decline, according to McNutt.China's number of patents per year surpassed the US around 2015 and is now leading by a ratio of 2 to 1 as of 2021.In the corporate world, China has emerged as a dominant force, leading the Global Fortune 500 list with 142 out of 500 companies in 2023, a stark contrast to its nonplayer status in 2000.Those statistics underscore McNutt's conclusion that advancing the frontiers of basic research now requires international partnerships to benefit all researchers.Saving livesThe importance of such partnerships is illustrated by an example provided by Dasher, involving a medical technology company. He described a collaboration between a senior electrical engineer in Silicon Valley — with innovative ideas for medical image analysis — and a professor in China."China has eight times as many medical images as the United States does. So, he cooperated with a professor in China, and the two of them have created a company about medical image analysis to detect cancer," Dasher said."That's a very good use, where China has data that is useful for everyone, and we have a technology idea. I think that kind of thing will continue."The benefits of international cooperation extend to the overall strength of the US technology sector. Dasher said one of the key strengths of Silicon Valley has been its diversity, with 13 percent of the technical workforce born in China."We've benefited from foreign people who come to the United States as students and continue to work here. I think that it's also the case where some Americans may want to go to China and work in China. So we need to maintain a very good, safe environment for people to cooperate," he emphasized.With dwindling government investment, the US industry began taking the lead around 1981 and now dominates US research investment with a 75 percent share, compared with the federal government's 20 percent.The strengths of the private sector in advancing scientific and technological development, however, have been challenged by the US government's "national security" measures aimed at containing China's development in science and technology.The biotech industry provides a stark example of the potential consequences of decoupling. Many achievements under the STA, such as US-China collaborations on gene editing research that have created disease-resistant crops and improved yields, are at risk of being reduced to historical footnotes.Patrick Beyrer, a researcher at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, said a potential US-China biotech decoupling is being expedited while everyday Americans aren't adequately prepared for the consequences.He cited the example of WuXi AppTec as a "research superstore" for its US partners, and WuXi Biologics, the second-largest biologic outsourcer in the world.Recent policy recommendations from the US House of Representatives' select committee on China have described US dependence on Chinese pharmaceutical supply chains as a "distinct national security risk", with some lawmakers proposing to block Chinese companies, such as BGI Group and WuXi AppTec, from future US federal contracting and government technology procurement.Impact on treatmentBeyrer warned that the elimination of those companies from US supply chains would have an impact on developing treatments for critical medical conditions, including hearing loss, cystic fibrosis and leukemia."In addition to China representing the largest and most cost-effective exporter of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the US market, jointly developed drugs, agricultural technologies, and other biotech-enabled solutions have improved countless American lives," he wrote in an article."The collapse of US-China biotech partnerships would spell the end of such jointly developed innovations that harbor the potential to deliver sorely needed global public goods, including saving American lives suffering from diseases such as cancer," Beyrer cautioned.Talent crunchThe challenges faced by the biotech industry are symptomatic of a broader issue affecting US-China relations in science and technology. Export controls and other measures to restrict technology transfer have moved to the heart of the relationship, increasing tensions between the two countries and posing significant challenges for US tech companies.Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, criticized the US export controls for causing an "intensely difficult problem" for US tech companies, particularly those that are in Silicon Valley."There's a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety. And I think that's true across the board in tech," Allen observed during an event at Stanford while visiting his organization's members in Silicon Valley.The semiconductor industry, in particular, has been hit hard by these restrictions. Allen said that several US chip companies have recently been banned from selling to an "ill-defined" range of Chinese customers."It's becoming more and more difficult to avoid that conflict of law, and thereby the consequences would be terminating or severely restricting what had been a very profitable enterprise for decades," he said.He emphasized the importance of China for many technology companies, both as a market and as a source of talent."China's extremely important for the tech companies; many of them have a large percentage share of their total sales in China, and many of them draw on that enormous Chinese talent pool in China, and that is not something that they can easily walk away from," he said.An April report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated that in a small subset of tech companies studied, $130 billion of market capital was lost due to export controls. When new export controls were announced, employment in affected companies declined by 7 percent."It is especially detrimental for American companies when export controls are unilateral, enforced by the American government only on American companies in such cases, and there are many unilateral export controls (that) asymmetrically hurt American firms and long-term American competitiveness," said Allen.These restrictions are disrupting long-established partnerships and hindering access to crucial talent. Allen cited the case of a US multinational company whose lead scientist in China was denied a visa to visit his own laboratories in the US."American companies need to access Chinese talent if they are to remain globally competitive. If American companies are barred from hiring Chinese talent, then other companies will be given a long-term structural advantage that probably over a very short period of time will impact American competitiveness," he argued.This talent crunch is exacerbated by the US' dependence on international students to meet its STEM workforce requirements, as noted by McNutt in her June address. The narrowing channel for data flows between R&D teams in China and the US is making this challenge more acute every day.Looking ahead, Allen acknowledged the complex political landscape that companies must navigate."We live in a political world; companies have to recognize that a potential future conflict between the United States and China would make it impossible for most international trade and investment to continue," he said."While conflict is certainly not inevitable, tensions need to be managed carefully, as we try to nudge our way to a more sustainable rules-based multipolar order."PHILADELPHIA, the United States - US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off for the first time Tuesday night in a 2024 US presidential debate in the city of Philadelphia.The debate, hosted by ABC News, started at 9 pm Eastern Time Tuesday (0100 GMT Wednesday) at the National Constitution Center.Harris shook hands with Trump after they were introduced on stage.

Surveys of the key battleground states show that Trump and Harris are within a few points of each other and the polls' margins of error.China has consistently upheld a people-centered perspective on human rights, respecting the principal position of the people, according to Baimachilin, vice-chairman of the 13th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and president of the China Society for Human Rights Studies.Baimachilin spoke at the inaugural China-Latin America and Caribbeans States (LAC) Roundtable on Human Rights in Brazil on Tuesday, which marked the first such institutional exchange and seminar between China and Latin America and the Caribbean.The roundtable, themed "Diversity of Civilizations and Pathways to Realize Human Rights", drew senior officials and experts from 17 countries — China, Brazil, Argentina, the Bahamas, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Dominica, Ecuador, Grenada, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela.He outlined China's commitment to advancing human rights through development, citing the country's large-scale education, healthcare and social security systems."Guided by the people's aspirations for a better life, China's human rights development aims to achieve common prosperity for all and advancing higher levels of human rights protection through high-quality development," said Baimachilin.With improvements in environmental quality and an increase in life expectancy to 78.6 years, the quality of life for the Chinese people has significantly improved. Additionally, China is advancing whole-process people's democracy, turning democratic values into effective institutional arrangements and concrete practices.Baimachilin said China's goal is to "ensure that people feel fairness and justice in every law enforcement decision and judicial case".He stressed China's commitment to ensuring equal rights for all, with a particular focus on the protection and support of vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities, women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities.He cited China's success at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, where Chinese athletes won 220 medals, including 94 gold, as a reflection of the nation's dedication to providing its 85 million citizens with disabilities equal opportunities for a fulfilling life.Baimachilin, however, also warned that the world is facing growing instability, with rising antiglobalization sentiments, increasing unilateralism and protectionism, and more frequent local conflicts."Global human rights deficits are deepening, and the international human rights movement is facing severe challenges, with global human rights governance still a formidable task," he noted.Baimachilin stressed the longstanding cooperation between China and Latin America, dating to the 16th century, which he said was a key avenue for mutual learning between civilizations.Marking 50 years of diplomatic ties between China and Brazil, and similar long-standing relations with other Latin American countries, Baimachilin said that the partnership has yielded significant results."We have every reason to believe that as China-LAC relations continue to grow, our human rights exchanges and cooperation will become even more profound and fruitful," he added.Officials and academics from China and Latin America underscored the importance of partnerships in addressing inequalities. They called on governments, organizations and individuals to engage in dialogue, build consensus, tackle global human rights challenges, and advance the progress of human rights worldwide.Charles Peter David, former foreign minister of Grenada, detailed the benefits of China's investments in the Caribbean, particularly in Grenada, as catalysts for economic and social progress.The partnership between China and the Caribbean is a compelling testament to how cooperative global efforts can profoundly enhance human rights and improve the lives of millions across the nations, according to David, who is also former agriculture minister of Grenada and deputy general secretary of the New National Party Grenada."It symbolizes mutual respect for the rule of law and a shared commitment to fostering economic, social and cultural development — ultimately, people-to-people development," David told the gathering.He said that China's significant investments in Grenada and the wider Caribbean have played a crucial role in driving both economic and social progress. One key example is the Grenada National Stadium, built with a generous Chinese grant, which has become a vital hub for community engagement, sports and cultural activities."This facility reflects our shared commitment to improving quality of life through infrastructure," David said, noting that joint diplomatic efforts have amplified Caribbean voices on the global stage.Zhu Qingqiao, the Chinese ambassador to Brazil, said that the promotion of human rights and exchanges between China and Latin America is entering a phase of significant opportunity.China aims to drive high-quality development through new productive forces while improving human rights protections.Similarly, Brazil and other Latin American nations are focused on eradicating hunger and poverty, with social fairness and justice as key governance goals. With more than 50 years of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, both countries have worked together to benefit their people, according to Zhu."We should oppose the politicization, weaponization and selective use of human rights issues and promote the global governance of human rights toward a fairer, just, reasonable and inclusive direction," Zhu asserted.Wang Yi, vice-president of Renmin University in China, one of the co-organizers of the event, emphasized that human rights development is a universal concern in human society, reflecting humanity's ongoing attempt to answer the philosophical question, ‘Who are we?'He said that different countries and cultures should respect and appreciate one another and engage in meaningful dialogue to build consensus on human rights.CARACAS - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday accused his Dominican counterpart Luis Abinader of being a "thief" and "bandit", after the seizure of his plane in the Dominican Republic.Speaking at an event broadcast by the state-run television channel, Maduro claimed that Abinader, with the cooperation of local officials, facilitated US authorities in seizing the aircraft.Maduro warned that the Dominican people would eventually hold Abinader accountable.The plane, a Dassault Falcon 900EX, was impounded by the US Department of Justice earlier this month for violating US sanctions against Venezuela and flown to Florida.Maduro said that Venezuela reserves its right to take legal action to address the situation and reiterated his opposition to US sanctions.When United States astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams blasted into space aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule in early June, they expected their trip to last only a week.However, three months down the line, Starliner undocked from the International Space Station and landed in New Mexico on Saturday minus the two astronauts, who remain stranded in space, because NASA deemed the Starliner's problems with its thrusters too fraught with risk for a crewed return.Despite Starliner's safe return, NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said the decision not to have the astronauts on board during the craft's journey back to earth was the right one."The Starliner's successful return seems like pure luck, as the issues it encountered could not be replicated on earth for a solution," said Lin Luzhou, assistant professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University's Academy of Regional and Global Governance."It points to problems in quality management, an area where Boeing used to excel," he added.Despite the successful docking in early June and its uneventful return, Starliner has faced persistent issues, including a failed unmanned test trip to the ISS in 2019. A do-over mission in 2022 went ahead but some thruster malfunctions remained."Boeing is shifting away from being the crown jewel of US manufacturing. In recent years, it has prioritized profit over quality," Ding Yifan, a senior fellow at Taihe Institute, a think tank in Beijing, said."Cost-cutting measures, like outsourcing key components, have further compromised standards," he said.The crashes of two Boeing 737 Max jets in 2018 and 2019, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killed 346. The company faced another blow when a door plug blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight in January."It shows a broader decline in US manufacturing capabilities," he added.Following its launch, Starliner reported helium leaks and thruster problems, extending the space mission multiple times, before NASA announced in August that the astronauts will only come back in February on a SpaceX Dragon capsule."NASA's decision to ultimately rely on the Dragon spacecraft must have come after extensive technical evaluations. However, the issues won't be resolved in just a couple of months," Lin of the Academy of Regional and Global Governance said."Space missions, particularly those involving the International Space Station, require meticulous planning and multilateral coordination," he added."It is an image issue. SpaceX's space program has indirectly benefited from NASA's budget cuts over the years, which led to the outsourcing of projects and the lay-offs of NASA engineers — many of whom ended up working for Elon Musk," Ding of Taihe Institute said.Boeing has a long history of working with NASA. Apollo 11, which was propelled by a Boeing-built rocket, landed on the moon in 1969. "Previously, ample funding supported US technological advancements. However, the focus has now turned to more profitable ventures and space exploration receives less support," Ding said."Additionally, military-industrial complexes have shifted federal budget priorities, further reducing NASA's funding and diminishing its role."Boeing incurred about $1.6 billion in cost overruns while developing the Starliner, facing repeated delays and price increases due to supply chain issues, Agence France-Presse reported."The current model for commercial space exploration undoubtedly starts with significant investment in research, which is no longer sustainable under incumbent financing mode," Lin said.According to Ding, US public finances have become increasingly strained, with growing debt leaving less room for discretionary spending. The gross federal debt of the US has surpassed $35.3 trillion, US Treasury Department data showed.NASA's budget peaked during the Apollo program in the 1960s, at more than 4.4 percent of the US federal budget, according to the Space Report website. It fell below 1 percent after 1993 and has hovered around 0.5 percent in recent years."When the government budget is primarily allocated to debt repayment and military expenses, public funding for space exploration — an area that isn't immediately profitable — diminishes," Ding said.However, despite the constraints, Lin said we are witnessing a second major wave of human space exploration since the Apollo program, with commercial space ventures booming globally."Both established players, as well as newcomers, are undergoing significant transformations, which will bring both opportunities and challenges," he said, adding that the key question is whether they can secure a competitive edge in the evolving space industry.Beijing condemned on Tuesday the so-called Biosecure Act passed by the United States House of Representatives, urging Washington to stop unwarranted oppression against Chinese enterprises.The bill, passed by 306 to 81 votes on Monday, would prohibit the US government from contracting with, or providing grants to, companies that do business with a "biotechnology company of concern".It names five Chinese companies — BGI, MGI and its subsidiary Complete Genomics, WuXi AppTec, and WuXi Biologics.China firmly opposes such discriminatory measures against its companies, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a daily news conference.Mao urged the US to abandon ideological bias, earnestly respect market principles and trade rules, stop pushing forward the legislation and provide a fair, just and nondiscriminatory business environment for companies from all countries.China will continue to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of its companies, she said, adding that the country also supports its companies in safeguarding their rights and interests in accordance with the law.The legislation needs to pass the US Senate before it can be sent to US President Joe Biden to be signed into law.The targeted companies have all said the measure is based on false and misleading allegations and would limit competition. They denied posing any threat to US national security and stressed that they do not have access to the personal data of US citizens in their operations.The act is the latest move by US lawmakers who have already succeeded this year in requiring Chinese-based parent company ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a US ban.The Biosecure Act is part of a string of China-related bills that the US lawmakers are pushing ahead this week.In what has been dubbed "China Week", the US House of Representatives is aiming to introduce dozens of bills touching on trade, technology, farm ownership and electric vehicles, in moves to counter China's political, economic and technological influence.OTTAWA - Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said Tuesday that Ottawa has suspended about 30 existing permits for arms sales to Israel, local media reported.According to the reports, Joly said Ottawa's policy is that Canadian-made arms and components cannot be used in the Gaza Strip, regardless of how they are sent to Israel.Ottawa stopped approving new arms permits for Israel in January though permits approved in the prior months were still active."We will not have any form of arms, or parts of arms, be sent to Gaza. Period. How they're being sent and where they're being sent is irrelevant," Joly was quoted as saying.According to the reports, Canada is also blocking a contract with the US government to send Quebec-made ammunition to the Israeli Defence Forces, which was announced by Washington weeks ago.Made-in-China electric vehicles are winning over car buyers across Latin America and reshaping views about Chinese products.The advanced technology and competitive pricing of Chinese vehicles — EVs as well as traditional cars — are rapidly translating into rising market share for China's automakers in the Latin American market.In 2019, Chinese carmakers sold about $2.2 billion worth of vehicles across Latin America, according to the International Trade Center. By last year, the value of Chinese vehicles sold in the region almost quadrupled to $8.56 billion, accounting for roughly 20 percent of the region's car market.The quality of the cars and their price caught the attention of buyers like Florencio Perez Romero, a pilot in Mexico. Romero recently bought a Chinese-made MG RX5 because of the features it includes, like a large touchscreen console, myriad sensors and LED lighting, as well as an appealing panoramic sunroof."These are cool features. Compared to similar SUVs in the market like Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford and Chevrolet, it seemed like a good deal," said Romero.The price tag was another big factor for Romero, who noted that when all is said and done, Chinese vehicles end up being cheaper than similar offerings from other brands.Making stridesChinese EV makers have been making strides in global markets. BYD, for example, has topped Tesla, which also makes many of its cars in China, as the top EV seller globally.But they are facing significant headwinds in North American and European markets, which have increased their scrutiny and tariffs, Oxford Economics noted in a report.The US increased the import tariffs on China-made vehicles from 27.5 percent to 100 percent in May, and Canada followed suit in late August. In June, the EU Commission announced plans to impose tariffs on imported Chinese cars, and adjusted them in August. For example, tariffs on Tesla EVs manufactured in China were cut from 20.8 percent to 9 percent while tariffs on BYD vehicles were reduced marginally from 17.4 percent to 17 percent.In Latin America, meanwhile, sales are flourishing, from Mexico all the way down to Argentina's Ushuaia, the world's southernmost city. In many markets across the region, including Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and more, where buyers are very price-conscious, the savings attached to buying a Chinese car make a big difference.In Chile, in particular, Chinese automakers have been particularly successful both in selling cars to private buyers and providing vehicles to support infrastructure development, like public transit. Chileans are increasingly willing to buy Chinese traditional cars and EVs."Brands like MG, Maxus, Great Wall and Chery have dominated the streets with the highest sales numbers among Chinese brands, suggesting considerable popularity (among) Chilean customers when buying a new vehicle," said Renzo Burotto, a historian at the University of Chile.According to the National Automotive Association of Chile, 111,108 China-made cars were imported to the country in 2023, reaching a market share of 39.4 percent.Burotto attributed the growth of Chinese EVs in Chile partly to a free trade agreement and strong commercial ties between the two nations.Chinese EVs are also increasingly visible in public transportation. Burotto pointed out that Santiago, the Chilean capital, uses more than 2,000 electric buses imported from China. Santiago, which has the second-largest fleet of such buses in the world outside of China, has replaced more than 1,000 diesel combustion buses.And there is little reason to think that buyers across Latin America will not continue scooping up Chinese cars and EVs. Any concerns about the quality, technology or safety of made-in-China products are fading quickly."China no longer just makes irons and blenders," said Burotto. "It is now not only manufacturing but also leading in innovation, with a view to sustainable development, and putting China's unparalleled production capacity at the service of Global South countries that so desperately need to emerge from their chronic infrastructure deficit."The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.LOS ANGELES - Three fast-moving wildfires continued to burn in Southern California Tuesday as millions of residents in the region are still under an excessive heat warning.The largest one, dubbed the Line Fire, had scorched at least 26,000 acres (about 105 square km) with only 5 percent containment as of Tuesday morning in San Bernardino County, forcing mandatory evacuation orders for thousands of people.There are currently 65,600 structures threatened, including 9,200 structures under evacuation orders and 56,400 structures under evacuation warnings, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire)."The north and east sides of the Line Fire continue to burn with the greatest intensity. Today will be mostly sunny over the fire area, and the smoke impacts are expected to grow as the day progresses," said Cal Fire in an update, adding that firefighters are creating control lines, protecting structures and the community, making contingency plans, and maximizing the use of aircraft when conditions are not too smoky.The fire, which broke out on Thursday, grew exponentially in size over the weekend due to soaring temperatures and critically dry vegetation amid a record-setting heat wave in Southern California.California Governor Gavin Newsom declared on Saturday a state of emergency in San Bernardino County to help ensure the availability of vital resources to suppress the fire. He announced on Monday the activation of the California National Guard to assist nearly 2,000 firefighters in battling the massive wildfire.Another wildfire, called the Bridge Fire, broke out on Sunday in the Angeles National Forest in Los Angeles County, nearly 100 km west of the Line Fire. The blaze grew to nearly 3,000 acres (about 12.1 square km) with zero containment as of Tuesday morning.A new blaze, dubbed the Airport fire, started Monday afternoon in Trabuco Canyon in Orange County. The fire charred more than 8,500 acres (about 34.4 square km) overnight with zero percent containment, prompting evacuations.The fire spread quickly in hazardous weather conditions, leading to the evacuation of more than 1,400 homes and triggering responses by more than 1,000 firefighters, reported local KABC television station, adding that two firefighters were treated for heat-related injuries and one civilian was hospitalized for smoke inhalation.Southern California is still facing dangerously hot conditions on Tuesday, and an excessive heat warning will stay in effect until Tuesday night, according to US National Weather Service Los Angeles.The massive wildfires have generated unhealthy levels of smoke in Southern California. The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a wildfire smoke advisory, valid until Tuesday night, for a large part of the region."Smoke from the Line, Bridge, and Airport fires is expected to cause PM2.5 levels to reach at least the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups," said the agency.LOS ANGELES - California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Monday the activation of the California National Guard to assist nearly 2,000 firefighters in battling a massive wildfire in Southern California's San Bernardino County.The fast-moving wildfire dubbed the Line Fire has scorched at least 23,600 acres (about 95.5 square km) with only 3 percent containment as of Monday afternoon, forcing mandatory evacuation orders for over 11,000 people and putting more than 36,000 structures at risk."As the Line Fire continues to pose a threat to San Bernardino communities, we're pouring resources into this incident aggressively by deploying more air and ground support through the California National Guard," said Newsom in a news release."This is on top of nearly 2,000 firefighters, nearly 200 engines, and air assets we already have tackling this fire," he added. "California stands with these communities and has their backs."The California National Guard will deploy four UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters for water bucket-dropping operations, and two C-130 aircraft with Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems -- a portable fire retardant delivery system, according to the news release.The fire, which broke out on Thursday, has grown exponentially in size over the weekend due to soaring temperatures and critically dry vegetation amid a record-setting heat wave in Southern California.Newsom declared on Saturday a state of emergency in San Bernardino County to help ensure the availability of vital resources to suppress the fire."Fire activity on the Line Fire was moderated in the upper elevations in the overnight hours but remained active in the thermal belts. The fire made short, intense runs in the slopes and the lighter fuels which allowed for growth," said the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.At least five school and college districts in the region were closed for students and staff on Monday due to the impacts of the ongoing Line Fire, with more school districts being closed based on the assessment of conditions within their areas, said the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools.The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a wildfire smoke advisory for a large part of Southern California."Based on satellite and webcam imagery, widespread smoke is over San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, and Los Angeles Counties," said the agency.PM 2.5 levels may reach the "Very Unhealthy" level or higher on Sunday night and Monday morning in southern Orange County, the Inland Empire, the San Bernardino Mountains, and surrounding areas, the agency warned.Another wildfire called the Bridge Fire broke out on Sunday in the Angeles National Forest in Los Angeles County, nearly 100 km west of the Line Fire. The blaze has scorched over 1,250 acres (about 5 square km) with zero containment in the past 24 hours.The Roblar Fire, which started on Saturday in San Diego County, has charred 950 acres (about 4 square km) with 25 percent containment so far.In the first four months of this presidential election year, nearly 5.5 million legal firearms were purchased in the US, according to FBI data, while the candidates from both major parties have starkly different positions on gun control.Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, advocates stricter regulations, while Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump is pro-gun rights. These contrasting stances are already resonating differently with likely voters.David Liu, owner of Arcadia Firearm & Safety in Arcadia, California, serves a predominantly Asian community 30 minutes from Monterey Park, where a tragic mass shooting during a Chinese New Year Festival left 11 dead and nine injured last year."I'm a Trump supporter. And it's not because (Republicans) support guns that I vote for them. Because I look overall on the candidates. I prefer Trump's overall policy," Liu said. "I will not vote for a guy just because he said he supports guns. That's not the point of voting for the president."Liu said that over the past two months, his sales have been slow, attributing it to a new 11 percent tax on gun sales and ammunition imposed in July by California's Democrat-controlled legislature to fund violence prevention. This is in addition to the existing federal tax of 10 or 11 percent on firearms.About 16.7 million firearms were sold in the United States last year, a 4 percent decline from 2022, according to SafeHome.org, which analyzed the FBI's national instant background-check data.The National Shooting Sports Foundation found that firearm sales to Asian Americans rose by 43 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, a response to a rise in hate crimes against the community during the pandemic.The US has more guns than people, with estimates ranging from 425 million to 475 million in a country of 333 million people as of 2022.A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in June found that only 4 percent of likely voters considered gun violence the most important issue in choosing a president, with the economy taking precedence.Nearly half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents own a gun, compared with 20 percent of Democrats and those who lean liberal, Pew Research Center found.Carl Bogus, a law professor at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, told China Daily that the Republican Party considers the gun lobby to be an "essential" part of its political coalition.Trump has called himself "the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House". He told an audience in February at the National Rifle Association's Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that "no one will lay a finger on your firearms" if he wins.In his administration, Trump reversed a law that restricted people with mental illness to purchase a gun, and banned bump stocks that can convert semiautomatic weapons into a machine gun-like weapon. In June, the Supreme Court lifted the ban, citing the Second Amendment of the Constitution.belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.comThe China Institute honored three people for promoting mutual understanding between China and the United States during the annual Blue Cloud Gala on Thursday in New York.The awards were presented to Ronald Diamond, vice-chairman of Conair LLC and chief executive of Cuisinart Outdoor; Henry Fernandez, chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley Capital International; and Sheldon Pang, vice-chairman of Freepoint Commodities and chairman of Freepoint Solar, at The Plaza Hotel."We are thrilled to have the opportunity to salute these three honorees for their outstanding leadership and contribution to our society as well as in the social exchange between the American and Chinese people," said George S. Geh, CEO of the China Institute in America. "This is aligned with our mission to promote bridge-building and cultural understanding between the US and China."Chinese Consul General in New York Huang Ping attended the gala and expressed his appreciation for the China Institute and the awardees' efforts in "making a positive impact on China-US cultural exchanges"."I have been inspired by the vision and commitment of the people and organizations that believe China and the US ... should work together," Huang said. He expressed appreciation for the China Institute's commitment to introducing China to US friends, including its history, culture, values and lifestyle."I know we were different, we are different, and we are going to be different. But we share a lot of things in common. The only problem is we just don't know each other as we need to know, so that sometimes causes problems," he said."But if we would enhance people-to-people communication, if we could have more contacts, more people flow across the Pacific, having more face-to-face chatting, we will get to know each other better."The three-time Chinese diplomat to the US hosted and took part in more than 400 events each year during his six-year term and received a special award from the China Institute."The road for China and the US is always bumpy," Huang said. "We started reengagement 50 years ago; we had our relationship mobilized 45 years ago. We believe in the power of the youth, strength, the power of unity and solidarity. We can always find a way to get along."The China Institute is a nonprofit founded in New York in 1926 by US educators John Dewey and Paul Monroe, along with Chinese scholars Hu Shi and Kuo Ping-wen."Our mission is to deepen the world's understanding of China's 5,000-year history and its rich and diverse culture," Geh said.mingmeili@chinadailyusa.com SACRAMENTO, the United States - Fueled by excessive heat and drought, several large wildfires raged across the western United States on Sunday, forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes and worrying climate experts about more fires in the coming days.In Northern California, a wildfire called the Boyles Fire erupted Sunday afternoon in the town of Clearlake, located in Lake County north of the Bay Area.The fire has rapidly consumed 76 acres (about 0.3 square km) in just three hours, with 10 percent containment achieved so far, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) said.The agency has declared the fire "an immediate threat to life", urging residents in affected areas to evacuate immediately. Approximately 30 structures are "involved" in the blaze, and around 4,000 residents in the town have been displaced from evacuation zones, said the agency in a fire update.A live video from a local news channel showed the fire was burning through thick brush that had become highly flammable due to the hot weather and dry conditions, making it particularly challenging for firefighters to control.In Southern California, the situation was even more dire. A wildfire called the Line Fire, which broke out on Thursday in San Bernardino County, has grown exponentially, quadrupling in size on Saturday.This massive wildfire already injured three people and threatens thousands of homes and businesses. As of Sunday afternoon, the fire has scorched 17,459 acres (about 71 square km) with zero percent containment, forcing mandatory evacuation orders for over 11,000 people and putting more than 35,000 structures at risk.Soaring temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 degrees Celsius) and "critically dry" vegetation contributed to its rapid expansion toward the San Bernardino Mountains.California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in San Bernardino County Saturday. The area was under a red flag warning for wildfires on Sunday.More than 600 firefighters have been dispatched to contain the Line Fire, but steep terrain and limited access have impaired their ability to reach some areas."Thunderstorm outflow winds are causing very erratic fire behavior," while "smoke is limiting aircraft access to parts of the fire," said CalFire."Hot and dry conditions mixed with thunderstorms are expected to challenge firefighters for the next few days," said the agency.In Idaho, the Lava Fire, first reported on Sept. 2, has burned 2,493 acres (about 10 square km) as of Sunday. This lightning-caused fire was burning through heavy timber, brush, and grass, prompting evacuation orders for nearby residents, the US Forest Service said.Climate scientists are particularly concerned about the formation of pyrocumulonimbus, or fire-generated storms. In photos posted on social media Sunday, pyrocumulonimbus clouds were clearly visible on top of the Lava Fire.These large plumes of smoke, generated during massive fires, can create their own weather systems. The intense heat from the fires rises into the air, and if enough moisture is present, it can generate thunderstorms.Above-normal temperatures will continue across the western United States into the High Plains, with highs from Arizona to the Central Valley from 105 to 110 degrees (about 40-43 degrees Celsius), with 95 to 100 degrees (about 35-38 degrees Celsius) expected in the Inland Northwest, according to the National Interagency Fire Center's update on Sunday.LOS ANGELES - A group of representatives of US travel agents, organized by Air China and China National Tourist Office (CNTO), departed from Los Angeles Sunday on a FAM (short for "familiarization") trip for China."It will be good to experience it ourselves, so that we can tell our clients that China would be safe to go," Joey Sy, a personal travel manager from Los Angeles-based Hyssop Travel, told Xinhua at Los Angeles International Airport.Since China introduced a series of measures in 2023 to facilitate inbound tourism, including simplifying visa processes, expanding the list of visa-free countries, and expanding international flights, the country's inbound tourism market has seen continuous growth, Wu Dawei, CNTO Los Angeles director said.Wu added that this group is aimed at further increasing the travel from the United States to China and solidifying the outcomes of the 14th China-US Tourism Leadership Summit held in Xi'an in May.The group will explore classic itinerary including Beijing, Xi'an, the Yangtze River cruises and Shanghai on this FAM trip that encompasses site inspections of accommodations, dining and tourist attractions.The first China-Latin America and Caribbean States Roundtable on Human Rights is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Sept 10.This event is co-hosted by the China Society for Human Rights Studies, Renmin University of China, and Universidade Federal Fluminense, marking a significant effort to implement the Global Civilization Initiative. It aims to foster dialogue, promote mutual learning among Chinese, Latin American, and Caribbean civilizations, and advance the diversified development of human rights in the context of modernization.This year's roundtable will also commemorate two significant milestones: the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, and the 10th anniversary of the China-CELAC Forum.The event's theme, "The Diversity of Civilizations and the Path to Achieving Human Rights," will be addressed in three parallel sessions focusing on the contributions of China and Latin America to global human rights civilization, the realization of the right to development and fundamental human rights, and current challenges and solutions for global human rights governance.Over 100 participants, including high-level officials, senators, dignitaries from China, Latin American and Caribbean nations, representatives from international organizations, academic experts, think tank analysts, legal professionals, business leaders, and media figures, will attend the event to share insights and discuss human rights issues in a global context.Douglas Dueno, a visitor from the United States, was mysteriously drawn to Jinsha Academy in Xiamen's Haicang district in Fujian province. There, he discovered the deep historical ties across the Strait, along with the captivating charm of the ancient Maritime Silk Road that connects cultures across time.Watch the video to join his journey and experience the vibrant historical and cultural energy of Haicang.Hunter Biden, 54, son of US President Joe Biden, made a surprise guilty plea to federal tax charges on Thursday, the first day of his scheduled trial.He was to stand trial in a Los Angeles federal courthouse on criminal charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes while spending heavily on drugs, sex workers and luxury items. He pleaded guilty to all nine counts he faced.Judge Mark Scarsi said he faces up to 17 years in prison and up to $450,000 in penalties and set sentencing for Dec 16.Earlier Thursday, Hunter Biden had offered to plead guilty but not admit any wrongdoing, a legal maneuver called an "Alford plea". Prosecutors opposed the move.His lawyer Abbe Lowell told the judge his client would plead guilty, despite having no prior agreement with prosecutors.In a statement after the hearing, Hunter Biden said he pleaded guilty to spare his family from having to sit through a trial that would have aired details of a period when he was addicted to drugs."For all I have put them through over the years, I can spare them this," he said, adding that he had paid back his taxes.Lowell told reporters afterward that Hunter Biden might appeal his sentence. Leo Wise, the lead prosecutor in the case, said he was stunned by the plea and took offense when Lowell suggested that the government had subjected Hunter Biden to an unfair prosecution as a result of political pressure, The New York Times reported."This idea that he's a victim of this process, it's offensive," Wise said. "We have not exacted a pound of flesh or a drop of blood. We have afforded him the same right as any American."A plea deal that Hunter Biden's defense had reached with David Weiss, the special counsel in the case, unraveled when it was reviewed by a federal judge in Delaware in July.US Representative Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, one of three congressional committees investigating President Biden via an impeachment inquiry, said,"Hunter Biden's decision to plead guilty once again affirms the integrity of the IRS whistleblowers who recommended these exact charges over two years ago before being stonewalled by the Biden-Harris Justice Department," Fox News reported.Voters will choose on Nov 5 between Vice-President Kamala Harris, a Democrat and Republican former president Donald Trump. President Biden dropped his reelection bid in July under pressure from his fellow Democrats.The trial could also have shed light on Hunter Biden's work with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma and other business dealings while his father was vice-president.He has denied any improper business dealings and the White House said that President Biden has not benefited from his son's business connections.The White House has said the president has ruled out pardoning his son, but that did not stop Republicans from claiming otherwise."Hunter Biden's bait-and-switch stunt is a clear effort to avoid a messy trial that would reveal his father's role in the family's corrupt business dealings," said Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, Fox News reported.Agencies contributed to this story.SACRAMENTO, the United States - Valley Fever, a fungal disease, has been spreading in California, with warnings from state health authorities about an increased risk through the fall, local news outlets reported Thursday.Valley Fever is caused by breathing in dust from outdoor air that contains spores of the Coccidioides fungus. It usually affects the lungs and can cause prolonged symptoms, including cough, fever, chest pain and fatigue.It can also lead to severe diseases, such as meningitis, and even death, according to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).People living in or traveling to the state's Central Valley and Central Coast regions face higher risks, warned the CDPH last week. The department said it was preparing for "another possible increase in Valley fever cases in the coming months"."If you have a lingering cough and fatigue, please talk to a doctor about Valley fever, especially if you've been outdoors in dusty air in the Central Valley or Central Coast regions," said CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer Tomas Aragon in a news release.A recent valley fever outbreak has been traced to the Lightning in a Bottle music festival held in May near Bakersfield, California, local KGET news channel said Thursday, adding that as of Aug 21, health officials had confirmed at least 19 cases of the fungal infection among festival attendees and workers, with eight individuals requiring hospitalization.The CDPH is investigating the outbreak. The electronic dance music festival at Buena Vista Lake in Kern County of California drew approximately 20,000 attendees from May 22 to 27.The surge in cases was believed to be linked to the festival's dusty conditions, exacerbated by high winds during the event. Festival organizers had implemented dust control measures, including watering the ground and providing free masks, but these efforts appeared to have been insufficient in preventing the outbreak.Valley fever has been on the rise in California in recent years, with over 9,000 cases reported last year and over 5,000 preliminary cases reported as of July 1, according to the CDPH.The department said possible causes of this recent increase include winter rains after several years of drought, an increase in soil disturbance activities in high-risk areas, and increased disease recognition.Though most cases of Valley fever in California are reported from the Central Valley and Central Coast regions, the state health department has seen increasing cases outside of these regions, including in the northern Central Valley and in Southern California.LOS ANGELES -- US President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden pleaded guilty Thursday to all nine counts in his criminal tax case in a Los Angeles federal court.Hunter Biden, 54, was indicted in California in December on nine counts related to a Justice Department investigation into his taxes. Federal prosecutors charged him with evading at least 1.4 million US dollars in tax payments.The only surviving son of President Biden had previously pleaded not guilty in the case. But a lawyer for him announced in court Thursday that Hunter Biden planned to change his not guilty plea before the start of his trial.Hunter Biden's stunning decision to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges without the benefits of a deal with prosecutors came hours after jury selection was supposed to begin in the case, according to NBC Los Angeles television station.Hunter Biden quickly responded "guilty" as the judge read out each of the nine counts, reported the television station, adding that the charges carry up to 17 years behind bars, but federal sentencing guidelines are likely to call for a much shorter sentence.His sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 16, shortly after the 2024 US presidential election set to be held on Nov. 5.Hunter Biden was convicted of three felony gun charges in a separate case in June. His conviction is related to purchasing a firearm in 2018 while addicted to crack cocaine, which is the first time in US history that a sitting president's child has been convicted of a crime.Some 1,600 years ago, long before modern globalization, a vibrant cultural melting pot existed in a region of Northeast China known as "Dragon City" — present-day Chaoyang in Liaoning province.People from different corners of the Asian continent converged on the region from the years 337 to 436.The fascinating details are part of an exhibition at the China Institute Gallery in New York City titled Gold from Dragon City: Masterpieces of Three Yan from Liaoning, 337-436, which opened on Thursday.The story of the civilization established by the nomadic Murong Xianbei people is being presented in the United States for the first time.Among the artifacts on display are glass cups, inkstones and tiger-shaped vessels from Han Chinese culture. There are long swords used by the Xianbei people.Jointly organized by the China Institute Gallery and the Liaoning Provincial Museum, the exhibition illustrates the history of ethnic integration and cultural exchange along the Silk Road, which transformed North China.Gold from Dragon City, which will run through Jan 5, 2025, also features treasures from nearly 70 years of archaeological excavations in China, including sculptures, bronze mirrors, imperial seals, equestrian objects, ceramics and jewelry, many made of gold."Gold holds the greatest significance and value in Chinese culture. Within the broader historical framework of diversity and inclusiveness in Chinese culture, the Three Yan civilization is also an important and valuable part," Liu Ning, deputy director of Liaoning Provincial Museum, told China Daily."This extraordinary exhibition illustrates the remarkable achievements of the Three Yan civilization, which is now no longer lost to history," said Willow Weilan Hai, director and chief curator of China Institute Gallery. "We have gained a deeper understanding of how ethnic integration and the cultural exchange of East and West inspired and enriched cultures along the Silk Road."Upon entering the gallery, viewers will first see two sculptures of the heads of men who are not Han Chinese, with high nose bridges and deep-set eyes. Hai explained that the entrance highlights the diversity of the society then in that region."To understand the globalization that occurred in the ancient world, you see that it's not that different from what's happening today. What's important is how understanding different people and their cultures — where they came from — helps us communicate better," Hai told China Daily.The highlight of the exhibition — a series of golden headdress ornaments worn by the Murong Xianbei people — features shimmering, swaying leaves, known as buyao, which literally means "swaying with steps".Described by Hai as "an Asian fashion of the time", the metal leaf design came from Western Asia and was introduced to North China through the Silk Road. Over time, the design became a key feature of the Three Yan culture.Revolutionary inventionAlso featured are the earliest known stirrups in human history, a revolutionary invention that transformed cavalry and warfare.With the stirrups, early warriors were able to free both hands for combat. Made from finely crafted mulberry wood and gilt bronze, the stirrups are considered masterpieces of gilded craftsmanship of the Northern Yan during the Sixteen Kingdoms period (304-439)."It was the Chinese invention of the stirrup that made Western medieval knights possible and gave us the age of chivalry," historian Robert Temple wrote in his book The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention.On Oct 19, an international symposium, "Along the Steppe-Silk Road: Studies on Mysterious Nomad Murong Xianbei", will be held at the China Institute Gallery.SACRAMENTO, the United States - As summer draws to a close, cities across the western United States are still reeling from unprecedented heatwaves that have shattered long-standing temperature records and pushed communities to their limits.From Phoenix, Arizona, to Las Vegas, Nevada, to Death Valley in California, the relentless heat has challenged daily life, strained infrastructure, and raised alarm bells about the intensifying impacts of climate change.With the high temperature exceeding 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 degrees Celsius) at Phoenix Sky Harbor Wednesday afternoon, the number of days showing 110 degrees Fahrenheit or above for the year ties last year's record at 55 days, said the National Weather Service (NWS) Phoenix in a social media post on Wednesday."Expect a new record to be set tomorrow," said the agency on Wednesday, while forecasting that temperatures over the next three days will be "well above normal".On Tuesday, Phoenix residents marked a grim milestone as the city endured its 100th consecutive day of temperatures reaching at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).According to local media, this streak has far surpassed the previous record of 76 days set in 1993. "The streak is expected to continue, with no end currently in sight," the agency said.The extreme temperatures have taken a deadly toll, and in Arizona's Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, public health officials reported 150 confirmed heat-related deaths as of Aug 24, with another 443 under investigation. Last year, the county recorded 645 heat-related deaths.Las Vegas also experienced its hottest summer on record.The city's average daily high temperature for June, July, and August reached a scorching 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius), surpassing the previous record set in 1940. On July 7, Las Vegas hit an all-time high of 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 degrees Celsius).The heat has been particularly deadly in Nevada's Clark county, which includes Las Vegas. Officials have confirmed 181 heat-related deaths so far this year, with the actual toll likely much higher due to ongoing investigations.Death Valley National Park, known for its extreme temperatures, recorded the hottest month ever measured on Earth in July, with an average temperature of 108.5 degrees Fahrenheit (42.5 degrees Celsius). The park reached at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 degrees Celsius) on 37 days during this summer.As September begins, there seems to be little relief in sight. The NWS Climate Prediction Center forecasts a 60-percent to 70-percent chance of above-normal temperatures for Las Vegas through at least mid-month.High temperatures are expected this week across the western United States, with excessive heat warnings issued for parts of southern California, Arizona, and Nevada, where temperatures are expected to peak from Wednesday through the weekend.In Los Angeles, temperatures could approach 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius), with inland areas potentially reaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 degrees Celsius) or higher this week. Palm Springs and other desert cities in California are bracing for multiple days of temperatures exceeding 43.3 degrees Celsius.Scientists attributed these extreme heatwaves to human-caused climate change, which elevates the risk of dangerously high temperatures across the globe.The US West has been hit hard by an unprecedented heat wave this year, with the prolonged heat straining energy grids, disrupting daily routines, and posing significant challenges for vulnerable populations.In cities like Las Vegas and Los Angeles, cooling centers have been opened to provide refuge for those without air conditioning, particularly the homeless. Residents are advised to drink plenty of water and limit their time outdoors, especially during the afternoons. Local authorities also urged residents to check on neighbors, especially seniors and at-risk individuals during the heat wave.The extreme temperatures heightened wildfire risks across the region as well. Oregon has seen more than 6,000 square kilometers burned by mid-August, the most of any state this year. California has been battling the park fire, the fourth-largest wildfire in state history, since mid-July.From the vast, fertile fields of Iowa and Illinois and several other farming states, US farmers used 30 million hectares of farmland to generate more than 48 million metric tons of soybean exports last year, worth $27.8 billion worldwide, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA.The US is behind Brazil, second in the world in soybean production, creating 29 percent of the total global output, according to the USDA. China ranks fourth. The No 1 soybean export market for the US is China, which, in 2023 bought $15.06 billion worth of the versatile bean.In the run-up to the 2024 US general election, the $124 billion soybean industry, which accounts for 0.6 percent of the country's GDP, is closely watching any talk on trade policies by both presidential candidates, Vice-President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, especially on tariffs.Harris hasn't revealed whether she will enact any new trade tariffs or keep the existing ones in place as President Joe Biden has done.The Biden administration has kept most of his predecessor's levies in place, and in May, raised some others on an additional $18 billion in Chinese imports, such as electric vehicles and semiconductors.Trump proposed earlier this year a new set of trade tariffs of 10 percent across the board on foreign goods and 60 percent on goods from China if he wins reelection in November.Soybean farmers are worried that any new tariffs could spark another trade war and further strain relations between the world's two largest economies.Josh Gackle, a third-generation farmer from Kulm, North Dakota, is president of the American Soybean Association. He farms 1,130 hectares of soybeans along with corn, wheat and barley."China is a very important trading partner, and we want to try and keep that happening," Gackle told China Daily. "On new tariffs, free trade is probably always better."In 2018, the Trump administration enacted import tariffs ranging between 10 percent and 50 percent on approximately $283 billion of US imports. As a countermeasure, China imposed a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of US goods in 2018, including pork and soybeans. This cost US agricultural producers around $27 billion in lost export revenue from 2018 to 2019, the USDA found. Around 95 percent was due to the trade war with China.US farmers were given $61 billion worth of bailouts to offset the losses after US agricultural exports fell dramatically between 2018 and 2020, the Financial Times reported.By 2019, a trade agreement was reached between the US and China steadying the industry.Gackle said the trade war had "a big impact on US soybean producers, but we came back in phase one, and the administration and China worked together to try and build back some of that trade relationship and it happened".In a study about why tariffs hurt working people in the US by the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, or PIIE, the authors Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely argue that tariffs could actually end up stinging US families, farmers and exporters the most."Economists have long understood that tariffs burden domestic purchasers of imported goods because imports are the difference between domestic demand and domestic supply, a tariff affects both sides of the market," according to the study.'Real distress'Lovely is a professor emeritus of economics at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs of Syracuse University and a senior fellow of PIIE. She told China Daily: "During the 2017 to 2018 trade war, agriculture was negatively affected by China's retaliatory tariffs. Former president Trump used tariff revenues to compensate farmers hurt by retaliation because the damage was big enough to cause real distress in some areas of the US."The 60 percent tariffs on Chinese goods proposed by Trump could increase household costs by $1,950, the conservative-leaning American Action Forum estimated.The PIIE study also warned that import tariffs risk a loss of business as trade partners like China set up new contracts with other countries.The billion-dollar US soybean industry relies on 500,000 people employed in some capacity, with total wages in the sector averaging $10 billion, according to a 2023 study called The Economic Impact of the US Soybeans and End Products on the US Economy, by the National Oilseed Processors Association and the United Soybean Board.After the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, producers are weary of anything that could destabilize things.The US Soybean Export Council, or USSEC, represents the entire soy supply chain, including farmers, processors, commodity shippers, merchandisers, allied agribusinesses and agricultural organizations. It works to attain market access for the use of US soy for human consumption, aquaculture and livestock feed in more than 80 countries worldwide."China is so big, they take 60 percent of the soy that goes into global trade," Jim Sutter, CEO of USSEC, told China Daily. "They're a huge market. If you don't have them, it's a problem."We went through a lot of pain as a soy industry and as a country in the last trade war. Let's learn from that."belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.com John Podesta, senior advisor to the United States president for international climate policy, will visit China from Wednesday to Friday, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced on Tuesday.During the visit, Podesta and Liu Zhenmin, China's special envoy for climate change, will co-chair the second meeting of the two countries' working group on enhancing climate action in the 2020s, as agreed by the two countries, the ministry said in a media release.It was highlighted that the two sides will engage in thorough discussions regarding practical cooperation within the Sino-US working group, domestic climate policy initiatives in each country, and the multilateral climate change process.China and US reached a consensus to establish the working group during the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, aka COP26, in Glasgow, United Kingdom, in 2021.According to a joint declaration of the two countries released during the conference, the two sides will meet regularly to address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade.WASHINGTON -- Four people were fatally shot on a commuter train in the Chicago area early Monday, and it appears the victims were attacked while sleeping in their seats, police reported Monday afternoon.According to the Forest Park Police Department, a review of security footage showed that the victims seemed to be asleep, seated separately, and did not resist the attack. The shooting occurred in two separate train cars.A suspect has been taken into custody, and a weapon was recovered. The motive is still unknown.Forest Park is a village in Cook County, Illinois, and a suburb of Chicago.Also on Labor Day, five people were shot in the afternoon when a suspect discharged a weapon into a crowd along the New York Caribbean Carnival parade route, according to police. Two people were critically wounded.In Nashville, Tennessee, six people were hurt during a shooting at a bar parking lot early Monday morning.Over 380 mass shootings have occurred in the United States in 2024 so far, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more victims are shot or killed.CARACAS - Venezuela on Monday denounced Washington's seizure of a plane used by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as part of a "repeated criminal practice".The United States has seized the plane in the Dominican Republic, claiming that its acquisition violated US sanctions."Venezuela denounces to the international community that once again, the authorities of the United States of America, in a repeated criminal practice that cannot be classified as anything other than piracy, have illegally confiscated an aircraft that has been used by the President of the Republic, justifying themselves on the coercive measures (sanctions) that they unilaterally and illegally impose around the world," Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil said on Telegram.Venezuela made it clear that "it reserves the right to take any legal action to repair this damage to the nation, as well as all other damage caused by the criminal policy of unilateral coercive measures," Gil added.In February, the United States seized a plane belonging to Venezuelan airline Emtrasur Cargo that landed in Argentina in June 2022 and was then detained for an alleged investigation.WASHINGTON -- The United States has seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's airplane in the Dominican Republic, citing sanctions laws, the Justice Department announced Monday."This morning, the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolás Maduro and his cronies," said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland."The Department will continue to pursue those who violate our sanctions and export controls to prevent them from using American resources to undermine the national security of the United States," said the attorney general.The aircraft, which is a Dassault Falcon 900EX, was seized in the Dominican Republic and transferred to the Southern District of Florida at the request of the United States "based on violations of US export control and sanctions laws", according to the statement.This incident, which came a little over a month after Maduro's re-election, represents the latest chapter in the longstanding tense relations between the United States and Venezuela.The United States has been pursuing a policy of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation against the Maduro government in support of opposition leaders.An Executive Order issued in August 2019 prohibits US persons from engaging in transactions "with persons who have acted or purported to act directly or indirectly for or on behalf of, the Government of Venezuela", according to the Justice Department statement.In March 2020, the Justice Department indicted Maduro and his aides on narco-terrorism charges, accusing Maduro and other Venezuelan officials of conspiring "with the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), causing tons of cocaine to enter and devastate American communities".Meanwhile, the US State Department offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Maduro.Also on Monday, Venezuela ordered the arrest of presidential candidate Edmundo González, who is accused of crimes including forging a public document, incitement to disobedience of laws, conspiracy and sabotage, according to a report by Bloomberg.US manufacturers, businesses and retailers are stockpiling some imported products and parts, especially those from China, because of uncertainty over tariffs heading into the US presidential election in November.Between June and July, the peak season for retailers to build inventory for the holiday season, the volume of ocean shipments to the United States from China increased by more than 4 percent over last year, according to a report by Project44, a company that provides a digital supply chain platform for businesses.The analysis suggests retailers are somewhat nervous over the tariff policy.US President Joe Biden announced in May an increase in tariffs on more than $18 billion worth of goods from China. The duties were scheduled to start on Aug 1 but have been delayed until this month.Manufacturers have asked for the higher tariffs to be reduced, delayed or abandoned, Reuters reported.Biden raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100 percent, and on semiconductors and solar cells to 50 percent. A 25 percent tariff was put on lithium-ion batteries and cranes, while steel, aluminum and solar cells imports will also cost more.Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has not said if she will keep the existing tariffs in place if she wins in November.Charles Lutvak, a spokesperson for the Harris-Tim Walz campaign, told The New York Times that she will "employ targeted and strategic tariffs to support American workers, strengthen our economy and hold our adversaries accountable".Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has floated the idea of tariffs of 60 percent or higher on imports from China. In 2018, the Trump administration enacted tariffs between 10 percent and 50 percent on $283 billion of goods from China.China responded with tariffs of its own. A trade agreement was reached in 2019, but Biden has kept the tariffs in place and also extended them.Trump said tariffs will bring back US jobs. "We are going to have 10 to 20 percent tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years," he said in a speech in North Carolina on Aug 14.Mary Lovely, a professor emeritus of economics at Syracuse University, told China Daily, "Tariffs may create jobs in directly protected sectors, but they cause job loss in sectors that use imported intermediate and capital goods."Businesses are also aware of potential strikes at East Coast and Gulf Coast ports this fall that could affect imported goods before November, the National Retail Federation found.Most recent imports into the US arrived at ports on the West Coast rather than the East Coast as the contract between the International Longshoremen's Association and the US Maritime Alliance covering East Coast and Gulf Coast ports is due to expire on Sept 30. A breakdown in negotiations could cause strikes, the NRF said.The Port of Long Beach in California has seen a 5 percent year-on-year increase in imports and has handled 22 percent of the peak season volume so far this year, Project44 found.The California ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Oakland and Seattle-Tacoma in Washington state received more than 44 percent of all imports in June and July. The ports of New York, Baltimore and Savannah, Georgia, saw a drop.Ben Hackett, founder of Hackett Associates, a consultancy for the maritime industry, said in a statement, "Importers are continuing to grow their inventories and are shifting cargo to the West Coast as a precaution against potential labor disruptions."Freight rates are rising, too.The ports of New York and New Jersey have ordered eight cranes from China's ZPMC, costing $18 million each. A 25 percent tariff — as proposed by Biden — could push up the price by $4.5 million.Production shiftBoth the Biden administration and former Trump administration have said tariffs create more production jobs in the US and lessen the country's reliance on Chinese imports. However, some production has shifted to Mexico, Vietnam and India.Lovely, who is also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, added, "In some sectors, tariffs create no new jobs in the US, as trade is diverted to third countries rather than inducing new domestic production."Other challenges include tensions in the Red Sea region, which have caused delays and rerouting from the important global shipping route.And a drought in Central America made water levels fall in the Panama Canal, affecting shipments on that route.Jonathan Gold, vice-president for supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, told China Daily, "Retailers are consistently working to mitigate any risk to the supply chain to ensure cargo arrives in a timely manner."Monthly inbound cargo volume at major US container ports last month was expected to see a record surge, according to the NRF's port tracker. Most of the goods will likely come from China.Agencies contributed to this story.belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.comThe 22nd Washington Chinese Culture Festival began on Saturday, fostering new opportunities for diverse cultures to connect and learn from each other.The crowd often erupted in cheers during the lion dance performances, particularly when Anaje Kilpatrick, an African American, performed. Many attendees were surprised to see a non-Chinese person participating in the traditional dance.Kilpatrick has been practicing Chinese kung fu for six years. "I started with tai chi. Then I joined Wong People at the Chinese Cultural Center in Chinatown, where I began learning kung fu. Since lion dance incorporates many kung fu stances, that's how I got into it, and I love it," Kilpatrick told China Daily.Meanwhile, as China seeks to boost foreign tourism, the southwestern province of Guizhou is taking it one step further by participating in Saturday's event to promote its tourismAt the festival, Nafisa Rustan, a volunteer at Guizhou's ethnic groups workshop, told China Daily: "We are showing the different minorities of Guizhou. There's Miao (people), and there's Dong (people).And there's all the drawings and the figurines, and they all represent one of the 17 minorities in Guizhou."Rustan, who is also from an ethnic group, expressed her enthusiasm: "I just like learning about other minorities ... And I think it's also really awesome sharing the culture of the Chinese."Five workshops at the event showcased Guizhou's rich cultural heritage, including traditional batik, ethnic clothing and a photo exhibition of its scenic beauty."The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive," volunteer Zou Ying told China Daily. "Everyone is saying that if they visit China, they must go to Guizhou."Attendee Nicole He shared her surprise at seeing Guizhou's traditional batik art in person."I had seen a documentary about Guizhou's batik on TV, but I never expected to encounter it here. The colors in batik aren't always easy to get right on the first try. You need to understand the process and work on it for a long time. These materials are rare, so I was amazed to see them here in DC," she told China Daily.The most common feedback from visitors about the Guizhou workshops was that they were "very unique", volunteer Maggie Wu told China Daily. The opportunity to witness authentic culture brought to Washington had many foreign guests excited, Wu said.It was a great platform for showcasing Chinese culture, she said.LOS ANGELES -- Four people, including the suspect, were dead, with another two getting injured in a shooting Saturday night in Honolulu county in the US state of Hawaii, authorities said on Sunday.Shortly after 11:15 pm Saturday local time (0915 GMT on Sunday), police officers responded to a residence in the Waianae Valley area, according to the Honolulu Police Department.Multiple 911 calls coming from the Waianae residence reported that their neighbor was operating a front loader and using it to ram multiple cars into the home. Multiple individuals were in the carport and fled or tried to flee when the suspect opened fire, striking the victims, said the department in a press release, adding that at some point, a 42-year-old male resident of the home fatally shot the suspect with a handgun.The resident who shot the suspect has been arrested for murder in the second degree, according to the press release."Three individuals, including the suspect, were pronounced dead at the scene. Additional people were taken to the hospital," said the department earlier in a Facebook post.Hours later, the department confirmed in an update that one of the wounded died at a hospital and the other two remain hospitalized.Honolulu police held a news conference on Sunday to discuss the incident. "There have been several incidents in the previous months and weeks, but this incident is not related to those. This incident happened as a result of neighbors," Honolulu Police Chief Joe Logan was quoted as saying by local news outlet HawaiiNewsNow, adding that the shooting "is not a random act, but a targeted one".Waianae Valley area is located on the west coast of the island of Oahu, which is home to the state capital, Honolulu.The shooting is the latest in a spate of violent crimes in West Oahu.Local residents said they are "frustrated and fed up about the recent string of violence that's causing chaos in the community" after multiple shootings and homicides -- many involving teens, reported local KITV television station weeks ago, adding that "the recent tragedies are forcing state leaders to get involved, increasing law enforcement here".As China expands its visa policies to attract foreign visitors and foster people-to-people exchanges, a Chinese culture festival kicked off in Washington on Saturday, providing an opportunity to learn more about Chinese culture and connect with the local community."The Chinese culture is deep in the heart of every Chinese, and we are glad to see it attracting more and more American friends with its inspiration and charm," Xie Feng, China's ambassador to the United States, said at the opening ceremony of the event."What belongs to a nation also belongs to the world. Culture is a bond of heart and emotion, transcending time and space. It connects China with the rest of the world."The 22nd Washington Chinese Culture Festival is now an annual event, a "friendship rendezvous" between the Chinese and US people, Xie said. Without the need to travel afar, US friends can have a taste of Chinese culture and its cuisine, he said."For kids, a must do is, of course, taking a picture with the giant panda mascot. On my way here, I met several American friends who traveled from various states for this festival. I could see their curiosity about Chinese culture, its history and profoundness."Regarding Chinese pop culture, Xie highlighted a Chinese AAA game that has gained widespread popularity, Black Myth: Wukong, based on the classic novel Journey to the West.The game's success is attributed to three key elements: the appealing character of Wukong, the timeless charm of Chinese culture and the "universal human desire for communication, cooperation and mutual learning", he said.Xie said he noticed that many players are drawn to the Chinese version for its "authentic voice acting", and some are even inspired to explore the original novel or visit locations featured in the game."After a journey to the West in the video game, why not take a journey to the East through travel in China? With open arms, China welcomes friends from across the world," he said, emphasizing a new rule that allows travelers from 54 countries, including the US, to have a 72-hour or 144-hour visa-free transit.US President Joe Biden sent a letter to the event and said "events like these represent America at its best"."By encouraging us to reflect on the ways our country's character has been shaped by the Chinese American community, you remind us of the importance of honoring and celebrating our roots no matter where they are," Biden said in his letter.The festival came on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US. Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, said that since the establishment of ties, "we have experienced peace and prosperity throughout all of Asia"."Perhaps most importantly, effective ties and constant diplomacy have led to an unprecedented half-century of peace in the Asia-Pacific region, and this is not something we should take for granted," he said.Positive dialogue and interaction is seen as necessary between the US and China on finance, trade and economics, instead of resorting to tariffs, said one observer."Such dialogue leads to positive trade interactions. It increases the potential for foreign-owned businesses in both nations. It carries with it the potential for good jobs for thousands of people," Anthony Moretti, department head and an associate professor of the Communication and Organizational Leadership Department at Robert Morris University in Pennsylvania, said to China Daily.Moretti referred to the US-China dialogue of the Financial Working Group (FWG) held in Shanghai Aug 15-16."There exist two parallel tracks when you think of the US and China. The political track is filled with all kinds of negativity from the US," he said. "Whether it be tariffs, other forms of sanctions, dubious legislative items, or the daily negative rhetoric, not much in the way of positive news comes out of that," Moretti said."But the business community understands how essential it is for the US and China to find ways to keep as many doors open as possible and to ensure that optimistic dialogue exists," he said."Together, we account for some 40 percent of global banking assets, and we are the home authority to 12 of the world's 30 global systemically important banks," Nicholas Tabor, assistant secretary for international financial markets at the US Department of the Treasury, said in a speech in June."The domestic financial stability of the US and China has significant implications for global financial stability, and our policies have an outsized effect on how financial risks evolve globally," he said."Working directly with our Chinese counterparts can help advance many of Treasury's priorities, including our financial stability objective, our climate goals, and the effectiveness of our global efforts to combat money laundering and illicit finance," Tabor said.He said the process of establishing channels of communication has progressed, but "much remains to be done".Moretti said that green technology is good for China, the US and the world, so it is meaningful to make efforts to "assist companies — large or small, new or enjoying a long history — that create products that are cost-effective and good for the environment"."No matter how much the politicians criticize China, they know that cooperation in areas such as pandemic research, overcoming food insecurity, and creating good-for-the-climate products brings positive results when China and the US are working together," he said.US President Joe Biden has touted green initiatives but also announced new tariffs on Chinese imports, including on products such as electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, amid US officials' accusations about Chinese manufacturing "overcapacity" and their concerns about "national security"."If you say you believe in something, then demonstrate a real commitment to it," Moretti said, adding that the tariffs imposed by the Biden administration on Chinese EVs "make no sense"."Washington wants a healthier climate, and yet it is deliberately blocking cars that are affordable, of good quality, and good for the globe from US consumers. It defies common sense to preach a message of being climate-friendly and then slam the door on one such opportunity," he said."The West is ready to criticize whatever it is that China does," he said."If the US showed a commitment to long-term strategic thinking, as China has when it comes to the most modern technologies, then it would enjoy strong market share for such products," he said. "They did not. So the criticism of China for doing so is weak."Moretti said hat more governors and mayors are leading business delegations to China."Those local and state leaders understand that American jobs created by Chinese-based companies are as good as those from US-based companies. That is another example of win-win cooperation. We need to see more of that."For Harmon Barlow, executive director of the Kentucky Dairy Development Council, his participation in the Fourth Annual US-China Agriculture Roundtable in multiple cities in China in June "was nothing like what I was kind of expecting"."I had a lot of preconceived ideas about what to expect," he told the audience on Thursday at an online event to share his experiences. "There were times I was a little bit even apprehensive about making the trip. But it turned out to be a great experience."According to Min Fan, executive director of the US Heartland China Association (USHCA), which organized the roundtable with several Chinese agencies, the delegation visited universities, farms and agricultural-experiment stations in China. They enjoyed talking with their counterparts and also sightseeing."We had a wonderful, enlightened trip," Fan said.Barlow has been to Europe, South America and Africa and knows well the international dairy markets, including China's. The trip, his first to China, opened his eyes to other facets of the country."And China, it's amazing how they have developed their own industry in the dairy world and are using much less exports than they ever have before," Barlow said.He was amazed to see the work ethic in China."Everybody is working, everybody has something to do," he said. "There's no waste."One thing he noticed is how land is used in China. "When we were on those bullet trains, and you looked across, you saw every inch of available land was in food production. I thought that was fascinating."Barlow was also struck by other aspects of China. "I found it was obviously the cleanest and probably safest place I've ever been," he said.He said it was "fascinating" to see "practically zero obesity" in China, and "the citizens were very healthy and weren't facing a lot of the issues that is really epidemic in our country today with obesity and things like that".The trip led Barlow to realize that it is important to keep the dialogue going: "It's better to talk than to yell at each other and go through what the TVs say."For Olga Bolden-Tiller, dean of agriculture at Tuskegee University, it was also her first time in China."I think what was most enlightening for me was the conversation around how the US can partner with China to really address global food security and do so from an educational standpoint," she said."I like the model that China has with a few other organizations where they are partnering with developing countries to do work on the ground in China to really uplift a lot of their producers and some of the agricultural practices," Bolden-Tiller said.Lou Swanson, professor emeritus from Colorado State University, said he enjoyed the aspect of global citizenship from the trip. "At Colorado State University, we really think that people-to-people, student-to-student, faculty-to-faculty relationships are the core for having any kind of global citizenship," said Swanson."What this trip did — and I've taken many delegations of students and faculty to China over the years — is the people-to-people dimension."Swanson said that trade and cultural exchanges are important to avoid misunderstandings that can lead to conflict. Trips like this help people "to understand the importance, but also the precariousness, of not attending to this global citizenship", he said.LOS ANGELES - A heat wave brought record-high temperatures to US Midwest states this week, with more than 60 million people included in alerts over the conditions.A late-season high-pressure system over cities in the Midwest regions such as Chicago, Des Moines and Topeka has left them experiencing rare "extreme heat" for a long period of time, according to the US National Weather Service (NWS).Chicago is in the center of an excessive heat warning that stretches north to Madison, Wisconsin, and south to Springfield, Illinois.The dangerous late August heat wave will expand over the Midwest early this week before building into the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast by mid-week, according to the NWS Weather Prediction Center."Heat indices of 105-115 and lows in the mid/upper 70s will bring a heightened risk of heat-related illness," NWS posted.The NWS warned the public of the combined dangers of heat and humidity associated with heat waves.US midwest states have set up several public cooling centers in preparation for the dangerous heat. The extreme heat prompted early dismissals and canceled classes for several school districts across the US Upper Midwest and Northeast.A new research published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that heat-related deaths in the United States rose 117 percent between 1999 and 2023.The study examined trends in heat-related mortality rates in the US population from 1999 to 2023, and found a total of 21,518 deaths were recorded as heat-related underlying or contributing cause of death during those years in the country."As temperatures continue to rise because of climate change, the recent increasing trend is likely to continue," the researchers wrote. "Local authorities in high-risk areas should consider investing in the expansion of access to hydration centers and public cooling centers or other buildings with air conditioning."Extreme heat together with humidity is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States. Approximately 1,220 people in the country are killed by extreme heat every year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The frequency and intensity of extreme heat and heat waves will continue to rise in the 21st century because of climate change, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Extended periods of high day and nighttime temperature conditions create cumulative stress on the human body, increasing the risk of illness and death from heat exposure. Heatwaves can acutely impact large populations for short periods of time, often trigger public health emergencies, and result in excess mortality and cascading socioeconomic impacts. They can also cause loss of health service delivery capacity, when power shortages accompany heatwaves and disrupt health facilities, transport and water infrastructure, according to WHO.China has made major technological advancements in the energy storage and electric vehicle sectors, and US companies could be at a disadvantage if US policies preclude them from cooperating strategically with Chinese companies, an expert said.In an online discussion about cooperation between the United States and China on climate change, Joanna Lewis, director of the Science, Technology and International Affairs Program at Georgetown University, said the two countries need to expand cooperation.The event on Tuesday was presented by the Center for American Progress.Lewis said political and economic tensions between the US and China are high, and that "is exactly when engagement on climate change is of the utmost importance" to avoid "derailing all the progress that we've made in our engagement with China" over the last 30-plus years.She said US engagement with China on climate change and clean energy has helped to build up China's own capacity to track and reduce its emissions, as well as its ability to promote "a low-carbon energy transition"."And today, we see that China has leapfrogged many other countries in these areas, and our bilateral exchanges have become much more of a two-way street," Lewis said. "I also see that engagement has led to increased ambition, transparency and trust between our two countries."She said US President Joe Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, which she said moved the US in the right direction of making clean energy industries more competitive globally, "may have gone too far in terms of completely excluding Chinese entities from participating in the US clean energy sector"."I think there has to be a conversation about our respective roles in global clean energy supply chains without just letting it devolve into a global trade war that will slow the low-carbon transition globally," she said.Lewis visited China this summer for the first time since the pandemic, meeting with Chinese officials and touring China's new clean energy manufacturing facilities. She said she witnessed how China is leading the world in some aspects of green technologies.She said there are ways that are smart and protect national security, but also allow "us to leapfrog and take advantage of a lot of the real impressive innovation that we're seeing coming out of China", Lewis said.She said the US should also have conversations with China on tough issues such as trade and research or it could risk derailing cooperation on climate change."We need to hit that head-on. I think it's silly to make engagement on basic science a political issue," Lewis said.Aug 22 marked the 120th anniversary of the birth of Deng Xiaoping, the late Chinese leader widely regarded as a pioneer of China's economic reforms. But his legacy extends far beyond China's borders.Deng's historic visit to the United States in 1979 stands out as a pivotal moment that reshaped China-US relations and set the stage for decades of collaboration between the two countries.In January 1979, just weeks after China and the US formally established diplomatic relations, Deng embarked on a groundbreaking visit. At that time, Deng was the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the US since 1949, so the trip carried enormous symbolic and practical significance."Deng's 1979 trip was extremely successful as he charismatically wooed Congress, the media and the American people," said the US Department of State's Office of the Historian, which has included Deng's visit in the "Milestones in the History of US Foreign Relations".Deng, then vice-premier of China and a pragmatic reformer, arrived in the US with clear objectives."Deng fully understood the importance of a conducive international environment for China's modernization, and the United States held the key for regional and global stability," said Zhu Zhiqun, a professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania."The purpose of the visit was to present to the United States a new and reforming China in the post-Mao era and to seek US support for China's modernization," he told China Daily.While high-level meetings were a key part of the agenda, the Chinese leader visited Atlanta, Houston and Seattle. In Atlanta, Deng toured the headquarters of Coca-Cola, signaling China's openness to US business. His visit to Boeing in Seattle underscored an interest in aviation technology.Perhaps most memorably, Deng donned a cowboy hat at a rodeo near Houston, creating an iconic image that humanized the Chinese leader for many people in the US. The famous photograph of Deng in a cowboy hat, which appeared in newspapers across the country, became a symbol of China's willingness to engage with the West."The visit was quite successful. The cities he went to were carefully chosen to highlight the goal of his visit," Zhu said. "During his visits to Coca-Cola and Boeing, Deng extended invitations to the US business community and welcomed them to invest in China."Ezra Vogel, the late socialist and renowned scholar on modern China, highlighted in his book Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China how Deng's visit fostered long-term US-China ties through business-oriented agreements and networking."American businesspeople who had heard Deng speak in the various cities immediately began to prepare for trips to China to explore business opportunities. Many of the 17 governors who met him in Atlanta planned delegations to China with local businesspeople," Vogel wrote.The then US secretaries of commerce, agriculture and energy also prepared to lead delegations in the months ahead to expand relations in their respective areas, Vogel said. "Members of Congress, even many who had complained about China in the past, vied to join these and other trips to China," he said.By visiting NASA and other institutions, Deng also helped establish the link between the scientific communities and encouraged scientific cooperation between the two countries, Zhu said.Deng's visit yielded immediate tangible results. On Jan 31, 1979, China signed a science and technology agreement with the US to accelerate scientific exchanges. That laid the foundation for extensive research cooperation that would benefit both countries and the rest of the world in the years to come.The 1980s, following Deng's visit, was a "golden period" or "honeymoon" in US-China relations, with "intensive cooperation between the two countries and growing US investment in China", Zhu said.The era saw rapid growth in trade, cultural exchanges and diplomatic cooperation. US companies began to view China as a promising market and manufacturing base, while Chinese students and researchers gained access to cutting-edge knowledge and technology in US institutions.The fundamental shift toward engagement and cooperation that Deng's visit represented has remained a significant factor in China-US relations, even as the relationship has experienced ups and downs over the decades.Despite the challenges, the importance of China-US cooperation in addressing global issues remains clear. As Deng himself stated during his visit, "Amicable cooperation between two major countries, situated on opposite shores of the Pacific, is undoubtedly an important factor working for peace in this area and in the world as a whole."Universities and colleges across the United States have revised their codes of conduct for students as they reopen in the wake of nationwide protests on campuses over the Palestine-Israel conflict.Officials at Columbia University in New York, where the protests began earlier this year with an encampment on the campus, said changes, updates and revisions to rules are in the works, but the university has not yet released all the details.New rule changes are also being implemented by the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California, the University of Denver, Indiana University and Harvard University, among others.University and college presidents and administrators have issued the stricter guidelines ahead of the one-year anniversary of Hamas' Oct 7 attack in Israel, in which more than 1,100 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage, according to Israel's Foreign Ministry.The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Wednesday at least 40,534 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory assault.Many educational institutions spent the summer talking to lawyers and staff members and revising their policies. Some now require undergraduates to attend classes on free speech, antisemitism and hatred. Most schools have not been explicit about the consequences students face if they break the rules.Kendall Easley, a spokeswoman for Columbia University, told China Daily, "University leadership takes its responsibility for the safety and well-being of the entire university community seriously", and over the summer, the university had "learned lessons" and was planning for the next academic year.She added that they "seek to strengthen the skills and training in de-escalation techniques, expand the ability to manage a range of incidents while taking into account that Columbia does not have its own police force, as many other institutions have, and potentially reducing our reliance on the New York Police Department".Katrina Armstrong, who was named Columbia's interim president after Minouche Shafik resigned on Aug 14, said in a letter that security changes will be released soon to provide guidance. The newly created Office of Institutional Equity will handle any complaints of discrimination.The school's new term starts on Sept 3. Over the summer, Columbia students organized courthouse demonstrations to support those facing criminal charges from the protests.Of the 40 students arrested or disciplined when the university called police to the campus on April 18, only two remain suspended, according to a US congressional panel, Reuters reported.Of the 80 students arrested between April 29 and May 1, only five face interim suspension without access to the campus.Activism to go onMahmoud Khalil, a student negotiator for the main protest movement, Columbia University's Apartheid Divest, said students "will continue their activism and actions until Columbia divests from Israeli apartheid".Amid the rule changes, the American Association of University Professors said colleges have "hastily enacted overly restrictive policies", arguing they "impose severe limits on speech and assembly that discourage or shut down freedom of expression".The updated guidelines for students come after three Ivy League presidents resigned over their disastrous congressional hearings on antisemitism on campus, where they were roundly criticized by Republican lawmakers. Two others also left their posts.The University of Pennsylvania, whose president, Liz Magill, resigned in December, installed temporary standards that require students to get approval two weeks before holding any event in a public space and banned encampments and demonstrations.At the University of Denver, any encampments are banned, while Indiana University students must gain permission before they hang signs from buildings and flagpoles. Protesters are not allowed to use semipermanent or permanent paint, markers or stickers on lampposts and signs.Michael Drake, president of the University of California, asked chancellors at all 10 campuses to strictly enforce rules against protests and encampments.Agencies contributed to this story.China's ambassador to the United States said that "China's journey of reform and opening-up will never stop", which means "opportunity, opportunity and opportunity" for the US and the world.Ambassador Xie Feng also said that "cooperation is the only right choice" for China and the US."Not long ago, the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its third plenary session, which made systematic planning for further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization," Xie said."A new milestone in China's reform and opening-up, the meeting is also a gateway for the world to understand China," Xie said in the keynote speech via video at the sixth US-China Business Forum held by Forbes China on Tuesday in New York."It will both shape China's future trajectory and influence the world in a significant way," he said.Xie said that with greater depth of reform will come new opportunities for growth; with higher-standard opening-up will come new market opportunities; and with higher-quality development will come new opportunities for cooperation.He said that in the first half of this year, China's GDP grew 5 percent compared with last year, outperforming many other major economies. "This shows its resilience.""Opening-up is a defining feature of Chinese modernization," Xie said, and China is aiming "to make the pie bigger and the list of cooperation longer, so as to deliver win-win outcomes for all", which means "we will open up more doors" and "we will break down more barriers".Xie said that high-quality development is the "primary task" in building China into a modern socialist country.The newly launched Chinese video game Black Myth: Wukong is an example, he said, saying it "has recently become a global hit"."Within just one hour of its launch, its concurrent player count hit 1 million, and its collaboration merch quickly sold out," he said. "So you can see the huge consumption potential in the debut economy and also the magic of integrating traditional culture with modern technology."More than 120 people attended the forum, including US-China Business Council President Craig Allen; National Committee on US-China Relations President Stephen Orlins; the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, Sean Stein; and Hu Wei, the chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce.In his remarks, Xie also said that "scapegoating solves no problem, and trade war, industrial war or tech war produces no winner" when there are new circumstances and challenges."A major inspiration we can get from China-US relations over the past 45 years is that when we work together, both countries and peoples will fare well; but when we turn against each other, both sides and the world will suffer. Cooperation is the only right choice," he said.Xie said that China and the US need to "both expand cooperation in traditional areas including economy, trade and agriculture, and nurture cooperation in new areas such as climate change and AI, so that both our countries and the world will come out as winners".He said that "there is simply no reason" why the China-US relationship should be a zero-sum game."Tesla's Gigafactory Shanghai can now produce more than 950,000 vehicles per year, and its megapack factory there is nearly half complete just three months after construction started. Apple is ramping up its investment in China, expanding its applied research center in Shanghai and opening a new lab in Shenzhen," Xie said. "All these are evidence of the vigor of China-US business cooperation.""Our two countries can help each other succeed in a race to the top, and both develop ourselves and prosper together on this vast planet," Xie said.The ambassador noted that President Xi Jinping outlined three principles for the bilateral relationship: mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation."We are ready to work with the United States in that spirit, enhance dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, and expand mutually beneficial cooperation, so as to stabilize and improve the relationship and take it forward," Xie concluded.Over recent months, a seemingly surprising trend has emerged on the global financial landscape — foreign investors are flocking to Chinese renminbi bonds, even as US bonds boast higher yields.As of July, overseas institutions' holdings in China's interbank bond market had risen for 11 consecutive months, an increase in foreign holdings of as much as 1.28 trillion yuan ($179.78 billion), according to data from the Shanghai head office of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank.At first glance, the inflow looks counterintuitive — why would investors opt for lower-yielding bonds? As of late August, the 10-year US Treasury bonds still yielded around 1.67 percentage points more than their Chinese counterparts, according to market tracker Wind Info.The answer, analysts suggest, partially lies in the anticipated interest rate cuts by the United States.The US Federal Reserve is expected to lower rates from the current 5.25 to 5.5 percent range, to avoid a recession. With China's monetary policy to remain stable, the renminbi is poised to rebound against the dollar. This has set the stage for profitable exchange rate plays, with the possibilities of investors converting dollars to renminbi, investing in Chinese bonds, and locking in a profit by selling renminbi forward at a higher rate.From October 2023 to January 2024, Chinese bonds yielded 107 basis points higher on average than US bond yields of the same maturity after taking into account foreign exchange hedging, according to calculations by BOC International.Resilience of assetsA more fundamental reason for the inflow, financial experts from home and abroad said, is something beyond technical trading strategies — the growing appeal of renminbi-denominated assets among international investors, a trend that has withstood the headwinds of US rate hikes.Since the US Fed started a drastic rate hike cycle in March 2022 to combat inflation, foreign holdings in China's interbank bond market have risen. They reached 470 billion yuan as of July, with the 1.28-trillion-yuan inflow since September last year surpassing the outflow of 810 billion yuan between March 2022 and August 2023, according to the PBOC's Shanghai head office.The allure of renminbi-denominated assets has been underpinned by a global shift away from over-reliance on the US dollar, China's expansive economic ties, and the country's ongoing financial opening-up, the experts said.These factors, they said, will continue to help the renminbi's ascent as an international currency, strengthening its reserve, payment, financing and pricing functions, and offering a win-win for the global economy."Demand for diversification of reserves away from the US dollar remains strong globally, driven by geopolitical, economic and financial dynamics," said Massimiliano Castelli, head of strategy for official institutions at UBS Asset Management."We believe the dollar is and will remain for the foreseeable future the main store of value for global investors, including reserve managers. However, currency diversification is set to continue in the future as the world gradually moves toward a multipolar system."The renminbi looks set to continue its steady rise in global foreign exchange reserves, in particular if it is supported by an improvement in the Chinese economy, the ongoing rise in the use of the renminbi in cross-border payments and the more widespread use of the digital yuan," said Castelli.Zhu Min, former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said, "The world sees that a dominant US dollar is not necessarily a good thing for the whole world, because US monetary policy and fiscal policy may have a big impact on the dollar's value and capital movements.""Having a more balanced force against the dollar is good for the whole world. So I think the renminbi will continue to internationalize to serve that role, not only for China, but for the whole world, and particularly for international financial architecture," Zhu said.The world's pursuit of alternative international currencies to the greenback, including the renminbi, has accelerated after the US froze the Russian central bank's foreign exchange reserves and removed several Russian financial institutions from the Swift messaging system in 2022, in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.'Shaky' greenbackZhang Ming, deputy director of the Institute of Finance and Banking, which is part of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the "weaponization" of the dollar has presented an important opportunity for renminbi internationalization.Many countries have realized that it is dangerous to rely solely on the greenback, said Zhang, who is also deputy director of the National Institution for Finance and Development.In July, the renminbi's share in global payments, measured by value, hit a record 4.74 percent, Swift data showed. It remained the fourth most active currency for global payments by value for the ninth consecutive month.The Chinese currency was the second-largest global currency in the trade finance market for the second consecutive month, with a market share of 6 percent in July.As the world has sought systems other than Swift, the Cross-border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS, which specializes in renminbi cross-border payment and clearing, has grown in popularity. In July, two direct and six indirect participants were added to CIPS. By the end of July, there were 150 direct participants and 1,401 indirect participants in the system.An increasing number of economies are also experimenting with central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, in cross-border payments, which can not only bypass the Swift system, but enjoy a faster settlement speed than the traditional agent bank system, as a third party intermediary is no longer required.Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia joined Project mBridge, a cross-border platform for experimenting with CBDCs — including the digital yuan — for international trade, as the sixth full participant.Project mBridge resulted from collaboration starting in 2021 between the Bank for International Settlements' innovation arm, the Bank of Thailand, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, the Digital Currency Institute of the PBOC, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.Global, domestic challengesGeopolitical dynamics, however, can be a double-edged sword, experts said, with The Wall Street Journal reporting in April that the US was drafting sanctions that threaten to cut some Chinese banks off from the global financial system.A survey by UBS Asset Management of 40 central banks, which manage about half of the global foreign exchange reserves, showed that 47 percent of them believed that US-China tensions had not yet affected the internationalization trend of the renminbi. Thirty-nine percent said it had slowed it down and 14 percent said the tensions had accelerated the trend.Zhang, from CASS, identified the US' suppression of China as a key challenge facing the renminbi's internationalization. This is in addition to domestic challenges such as economic growth slowing, the yields of financial products declining, and domestic financial risks becoming more apparent.While ramping up efforts to boost economic growth, China can further internationalize the renminbi through three main tasks, Zhang said. They are: improving the currency's function in commodity pricing, providing more high-quality renminbi financial assets to overseas investors via both onshore and offshore markets, and stepping up the development of CIPS.He said: "Since the PBOC began promoting renminbi internationalization in 2009, it has made significant progress over the past 15 years — the renminbi now holds about a 5 percent share in international transactions and 2 to 3 percent in global reserves. The area that remains relatively weak is pricing."To further strengthen the renminbi's pricing function, China — as a major buyer and seller of commodities — can promote renminbi pricing in the trade of commodities such as iron ore, copper and natural gas, Zhang said. He cited the example of Shanghai's launch of an international crude oil futures market denominated in renminbi in 2018, which has grown rapidly into the third largest of its kind in the world.The resolution adopted at the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in July said that efforts should be made to steadily and prudently advance the internationalization of the renminbi and develop offshore renminbi markets.It also said the country would push forward the development of a homegrown, controllable cross-border payment system and make steady progress in the R&D and application of the digital renminbi.Zhang said CIPS would serve as a "backup option" for China and the world, particularly if geopolitical conflicts continue to escalate and the US imposes further financial sanctions. "Not only China, but also the European Union, India and Saudi Arabia are looking for new payment and settlement systems. We are providing these countries with a second or third option as well," he said.Attracting participantsEfforts are needed to boost the number of banks directly participating in CIPS. The more direct participants there are, the stronger the network will become and the faster payment and settlement will be, Zhang said.Project mBridge may assume greater importance going forward as an alternative and more efficient option for global payment and settlement, he added.Xiong Aizong, a senior research fellow at CASS' Institute of World Economics and Politics, said there is room for development concerning offshore renminbi clearing, which can increase the cross-border trade and use of the yuan."Last year, renminbi clearing banks or arrangements were established in Brazil, Pakistan, Serbia, Cambodia and other economies, which greatly promoted the use of renminbi by enterprises and financial institutions in these economies for cross-border transactions," Xiong said.Deepening high-level financial opening-up to expand the channels for foreign investment in renminbi assets is also key to internationalizing the currency, he said. The Bond Connect program launched in 2017, the improved qualified foreign institutional investor mechanisms, and the Swap Connect market access scheme launched last year, have all added to the currency's appeal to international investors, Xiong added.Pan Gongsheng, governor of the PBOC, said in an interview with People's Daily in August that the central bank will promote renminbi internationalization by adhering to market-driven and voluntary principles, continue to improve cross-border renminbi policies, optimize the global layout of renminbi clearing banks, and promote the healthy development of the offshore renminbi markets.In line with Pan's remarks, the PBOC in August inked a memorandum of understanding with Vietnam's central bank for bilateral local currency swaps, which can facilitate cross-border trade and investment in the renminbi. By the end of 2023, the PBOC had entered into agreements with over 40 central banks for bilateral local currency swaps totaling 4.16 trillion yuan.Pan added that the central bank will keep the renminbi exchange rate generally stable at a reasonable, balanced level.Huang Yiping, dean of Peking University's National School of Development, said China should also consider providing commercialized investments, low-cost funding and government aid to developing economies to help them bridge the funding gap in achieving a green transition.Such a scheme would be comparable to the US-sponsored Marshall Plan to rebuild post-World War II Europe, but with a focus on green development. The scheme would be a "win-win" as it would facilitate the global pursuit of carbon neutrality, while helping bolster China's new energy exports and promoting the internationalization of both Chinese financial institutions and the renminbi, Huang said.Li Zitong contributed to this story.Contact the writers at zhoulanxv@chinadaily.com.cn NEW YORK -- Production at an electric vehicle battery cell plant jointly run by General Motors and Samsung SDI has been delayed as EV sales have slowed in the United States, reported The Associated Press (AP) on Wednesday.The companies finalized their agreement on Tuesday to jointly run the new factory in New Carlisle, Indiana, near South Bend, but said production would not start until 2027, according to the report. Previously the plant was expected to start making cells in 2026.The delay will be less than a year, due to market conditions and working out contract details, GM said. Construction of the factory is already under way."Electric vehicle sales in the US are still growing but have slowed as more practical consumers worry about range and the ability to recharge while traveling," said AP. "Market leader Tesla Inc. has cut prices, forcing others to follow."US electric vehicle sales overall rose about 7 percent during the first half of the year to 599,134, according to Motorintelligence.com. EVs accounted for 7.6 percent of the US new vehicle market, about the same as it was for all of last year. Lease deals, which include federal tax credits, helped to boost sales.WASHINGTON - US Special Counsel Jack Smith on Tuesday filed a new indictment in the federal criminal case against former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, following a Supreme Court decision that granted Trump sweeping immunity from prosecution for his "official" conduct as president.The new indictment dropped certain specific allegations against Trump but retains the same four criminal charges, including conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding.The indictment accused the former president of orchestrating a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election and disenfranchise millions of voters, a plan that allegedly led to a series of violent attacks on police at the US Capitol on Jan 6, 2021.The defendant used his campaign to "repeat and widely disseminate" false claims of election fraud, "to make his knowingly false claims appear legitimate, create an intense of national atmosphere of mistrust and anger, and erode public faith in the administration of the election," the court filing showed.Trump has repeatedly denied all charges. Trump's lawyers have argued that the former president's words and actions on and before Jan 6, 2021 amounted to legitimate inquiry about possible election fraud.Trump's team previously dismissed the indictment based on presidential immunity, arguing that a president has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution.On July 1, the US Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, ruled that Trump is immune for actions taken in his "official" capacity as president. The court also directed the lower courts to reassess the case and determine which allegations cannot be prosecuted."In an apparent bid to downplay any connection between Trump's conduct and his official duties, the new charging document repeatedly emphasizes the political and personal nature of many of the actions Trump took during the post-election period and on Jan 6, 2021," according to a report by Politico.Despite the latest efforts, it's unlikely that this case will go to trial before the Nov 5 presidential election. If Trump wins, he could instruct his appointees at the Justice Department to dismiss the case. The recent massive downward revision of jobs created in the United States in a one-year period prompted political reaction and also raised questions on whether the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates.The US government reported on Aug 21 that the economy created 818,000 fewer jobs from April 2023 through March 2024. It was the largest revision to federal jobs data in 15 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).The revision represented a total downward change of about 0.5 percent, meaning that  monthly job gains during the period averaged roughly 174,000, compared with the previously reported figure of 242,000.If the number remains in place through a final revision in February, it would be the largest downward revision since the 902,000 downgrade to employment in March 2009."What you're seeing is an echo of the large (pandemic-era) shocks that we're just working our way through," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, The Washington Post reported. "We're trying to ascertain the size of the labor force and its flows."The Biden administration has maintained that the job market is still robust in the United States, with unemployment from April 2023 through March 2024 averaging under 4 percent."This preliminary estimate doesn't change the fact that the jobs recovery has been and remains historically strong, delivering solid job and wage gains, strong consumer spending, and record small business creation," Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement.Biden has often mentioned jobs creation in his public comments and did so again in his speech on Aug 19 at the Democratic National Convention. He said that he had helped create "a record 16 million new jobs".Former US president Donald Trump, however, the 2024 Republican presidential candidate, seized on the revised BLS number at a campaign rally in North Carolina on Aug 21.He accused his Democratic opponent in the November election, Vice-President Kamala Harris, and Biden of "fraudulently manipulating job statistics to hide the true extent of the economic ruin that they've inflicted on America"."They said they existed and they never did exist," Trump said. "They built them up so that they could say what a wonderful job they're doing." Trump also unleashed repeated criticism of the revision that day on his Truth Social platform.Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican and the chair of the GOP-controlled House Budget Committee, said in an Aug 21 statement: "The economy is the top issue in this presidential race and the recent downwardly revised job numbers taken together with persistently high prices and interest rates (belies) a much weaker Biden-Harris economy than we were led to believe."The tax, spend, and regulate economic agenda of Biden-Harris has failed and no one knows that better than working Americans."The revision also could change the Fed's rate-cutting timetable."This is a noticeably larger than … normal revision ... it wouldn't be a stretch for the Fed to assume that recent job growth is also being overstated, strengthening its decision to shift attention from inflation toward the labor market," said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, Reuters reported."This doesn't challenge the idea we're still in an expansion, but it does signal we should expect monthly job growth to be more muted and put extra pressure on the Fed to cut rates,'' said Robert Frick, economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, to The Associated Press.Fed policymakers could consider a weaker job market as they mull future rate reductions after the initial cuts expected at their Sept 17-18 meeting.In July, payrolls were weaker than expected, eliciting talk that the Fed may have waited too long to begin cutting rates, as the unemployment rate rose to a post-pandemic high of 4.3 percent.The central bank has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25-5.50 percent range for more than a year, having raised it by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023 to tackle high inflation.The jobs-creation revision also generated responses on social media."This more than any other data has given the illusion of a strong economy this year, in stark contrast with other jobs data — e.g. household employment," posted economist Albert Edwards on X.Journalist John Carney wrote on X, "Contrary to what you might have heard from GOP officials, the revision to jobs numbers wasn't evidence of the BLS cooking the books." But he speculated that there was "a huge number of jobs created during the Biden administration" that went to people in the United States illegally.Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, defended the BLS in a series of posts on X on Aug 21."Is the Bureau of Labor Statistics a massive pro-Biden Admin shill? And are today's revisions to labor statistics evidence of (a) huge conspiracy to inflate the economic data? The answer is a declarative NO."She also wrote that she has "consistently been surprised and impressed by (BLS') professionalism, non-partisanship, and transparency. It is a pretty unique gem that accomplishes a great deal with modest funding, and helps us all make better-informed decisions."Pollak qualified her praise by saying she is someone who is "deeply skeptical of government, is shocked at how rampant corruption is in the US, and is by no means naive about the political leanings of most DC residents or govt employees".Agencies contributed to this story.Whether it's welcoming pandas back to San Diego or exploring the wilds of China for a Disney documentary, Paul Baribault has had good experiences working with the country.The most recent example was when Panda Ridge, home to giant pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, officially opened at the San Diego Zoo on Aug 8, in a much-anticipated return of the beloved giant pandas to the city after a five-year absence. It also marked the first arrival of pandas in the US in two decades.The milestone reflects the collaborative efforts between China and the United States, with Baribault, president and CEO of the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, or SDZWA, playing a pivotal role in the successful launch.In an interview with China Daily during the opening ceremony, Baribault highlighted the zoo's 30-year partnership with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, or CWCA, and the dual commitment to collaboration over the next decade."We are very proud of our relationship with CWCA. They have been incredible partners for the past 30 years and we eagerly anticipate what we will accomplish together in the next 10 years and beyond," Baribault said."My first experience working in China was in 2012, when I was with Disneynature. I worked on the nature film Born in China, where we had the opportunity to showcase the beauty of China and work with the China Wildlife Conservation Association during that time," Baribault recalled.Bringing the pandas back to San Diego was a challenge. It required hard work, meticulous planning and a healthy dose of optimism. Baribault led a dedicated task force from the SDZWA, assembling a team focused on identifying every potential obstacle.Together, they worked tirelessly to turn obstacles into opportunities, ultimately reaching their goal after a six-month sprint.Baribault, who has a bachelor's degree from Stanford University and an MBA from the University of Southern California, has a distinguished history as a leader in wildlife healthcare, conservation, science and education.His leadership since becoming SDZWA CEO in 2019 helped facilitate the return of the pandas and strengthened the zoo's ties with China."Giant pandas are emblematic of the collaborative efforts between China and the US in conservation. I hope this marks the beginning of a new era of continued global collaboration for the protection of ecosystems," Baribault said.He emphasized the unifying power of giant pandas in fostering collaboration."We are dedicated to saving wildlife worldwide by working with our Chinese partners, combining their skills with our expertise in wildlife care and conservation science," Baribault said.Before joining the SDZWA, Baribault had a significant impact on nature conservation through his work in the film industry, joining The Walt Disney Studios in 1997. He served as vice-president of animation marketing operations and strategy and general manager of the Disneynature film label, committed to continuing Walt Disney's legacy of conservation and fostering a deeper understanding of the natural world.Nature filmsWalt Disney's series True-Life Adventures began as an experiment with the documentary Seal Island (1948). The series went on to win eight Academy Awards, inspiring generations of nature filmmakers and conservationists.Under Baribault's stewardship, Disneynature films — Earth (2009), Oceans (2010), African Cats (2011), Chimpanzee (2012), Bears (2014), Monkey Kingdom (2015), and Born in China (2016) — produced seven of the top eight highest-grossing feature-length nature films in industry history.Born in China, a coproduction by Disneynature and Shanghai Media Group, took audiences on an epic journey into the wilds of China, exploring places where few have ventured.The film follows the stories of three animal families — giant pandas, golden monkeys and snow leopards — transporting viewers to some of the most extreme environments in China — from frigid mountains to the heart of bamboo forests — capturing some of the most intimate moments seen in a nature film.Based on the opening-week attendance in the US in April 2017, the film made a significant contribution to the World Wildlife Fund's efforts to protect wild pandas and snow leopards."Our filmmakers spent nearly three years battling tough terrain, freezing temperatures and the near-impossible task of finding snow leopards. China and its captivating wildlife left an incredible impression on all of us," said Baribault."When I joined the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in 2019, I made an early trip to China to underscore the importance of continuing our conservation projects together," he said.This year marks the 30th anniversary of the partnership between the CWCA and SDZWA.Si Ping, deputy secretary-general of the CWCA, who attended the opening ceremony for Panda Ridge in San Diego, stressed building an international exchange and cooperation platform that can support the conservation of the wild giant panda population in China and contribute to global biodiversity."One of the main priorities of this conservation project was not just to focus on breeding in our managed care facilities, both here and in China, but also to support access to the species in the wild and to help repopulate their natural habitats in China," she added.Productivity dropping and climate change are presenting significant challenges for the economic development in Latin America, according to a recent UN report.The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, or ECLAC, downgraded this year's regional growth forecast to 1.8 percent, significantly lower than its previous projection of 2.1 percent, indicating the challenges and potential risks the region faces.The ECLAC also reported a record-low growth rate of 0.9 percent last year, which is "lower than the 2.0 percent recorded in the 'lost decade' of the 1980s", it said. It attributed the slowdown to high inflation, limited room for monetary policy to have an effect, an uncertain economic environment and relatively low employment rates."The ECLAC report discusses some significant challenges," said Luis Ignacio Roman Morales, an economics professor at the Autonomous University of Nayarit in Mexico. "Not only are there productivity issues, but there are also implications from climate change. Export prices for Latin American products may also change too. As a result, the employment growth rate has been low."The report said Latin America and the Caribbean could face additional economic challenges because of weaker growth forecasts from its main trading partners.Export sectorSantiago Bustelo, who holds a PhD in international politics from Fudan University in China, said one of the keys to demonstrating successful development and economic growth is having a strong export sector.Asian countries such as China, Japan and South Korea "saw a big boost in growth that went hand in hand with building up a strong, competitive sector for exporting goods", Bustelo told China Daily.Chile and Israel, on the other hand, are examples of smaller countries with lower overall economic growth compared with China and South Korea, but which demonstrate highly competitive export sectors in industrial goods, commodities and technology, he said."South American countries can also develop strong export industries in these areas, which are fundamental for driving economic growth," he said.Despite the gloomy economic outlook, the ECLAC projected improved growth of 2.3 percent for Latin America and the Caribbean in 2025.Bustelo emphasized the need for targeted policies to develop strong export sectors."The development of an export sector through targeted policies, both industrial and technological, as well as complementary macroeconomic policies that encourage private sector investment, along with public investment, is critical to ensuring satisfactory economic performance and sustained high growth over the medium and long run," he said.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.LOS ANGELES - SpaceX is targeting Tuesday to launch a new mission featuring first-ever commercial spacewalk.Four civilians are set to launch on the mission, dubbed Polaris Dawn, which is scheduled to lift off at 3:38 am Eastern Time Tuesday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.This will be the first human spaceflight for the crew, consisting of Mission Pilot Kidd Poteet, Mission Specialist Sarah Gillis, and Mission Specialist and Medical Officer Anna Menon.During their multi-day mission to orbit, the crew and Dragon spacecraft will endeavor to reach the highest Earth orbit ever flown since the Apollo program and participate in the first-ever commercial spacewalk, according to SpaceX.They will also conduct 36 research studies and experiments from 31 partner institutions designed to advance both human health on Earth and during long-duration spaceflight, and test Starlink laser-based communications in space, according to SpaceX.NEW YORK - As the fall term gets underway at many US colleges, administrators are preparing for another possible surge in campus activism, reported USA Today on Monday, noting that the last school year ended acrimoniously as anti-war protests persisted on many school grounds, disrupting graduation ceremonies and jeopardizing some students' academic standing."Though on-campus demonstrations lulled this summer as students dispersed, the conditions that motivated the recent wave of activism haven't changed dramatically since the spring," said the report.While several high-profile college presidents have left their roles, many schools haven't substantively changed their investing strategies -- a demand made by the lion's share of protesters but a complicated ask in practice.International negotiations over a potential cease-fire in Gaza are tenuous. And members of Congress continue to see political opportunity in inserting themselves into the debate over how campuses should go about quelling unrest.As young activists prepare to ramp up the momentum again, harsher rules await them on some campuses. The punishments for anti-war protests have differed significantly across campuses, according to the report. SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple will unveil its iPhone 16 lineup on Sept 9, the company said on Monday.Apple is using the tagline "It's Glowtime" for the event, which will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park at 10:00 am Pacific Time.The phones are expected to support Apple's suite of AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, which were announced earlier this year.It's possible that the event could also include the unveiling of the Apple Watch Series 10, which is said to have a bigger screen and new chip, according to a report by TechCrunch.SAO PAULO - The Brazilian government announced Sunday that it is sending military aircraft to combat wildfires ravaging Brazil's southeastern state of Sao Paulo."We have asked the Defense Ministry to mobilize aircraft to combat the areas reached by the fire," said Waldez Goes, Minister of Integration and Regional Development.Goes attributed the fires to the "complicated climate emergency situation," adding that the Air Force is set to assist Sao Paulo in fighting the fires, including deploying a KC-390 cargo aircraft.The governor of Sao Paulo decreed a state of emergency in 45 municipalities on Sunday.The country's wealthiest and most populous state has been affected by a combination of high temperatures and low humidity. However, authorities suspect that some of the fires in sugar cane fields were caused by arson.On the bustling streets of San Francisco's Chinatown, campaign posters adorned with Chinese characters vie for attention alongside colorful shop signs and fruit stands. As the November elections draw near, candidates are intensifying their efforts to win over Chinese American voters, a crucial demographic in the city's political landscape.San Francisco has the highest percentage of Chinese Americans among major US cities, with 22 percent of its population identifying as such. When considering the broader Asian American community, the figure rises to 37 percent, according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau."The candidates, whether for mayor or supervisors, all hope to get Chinese American voters' support because we have become an important voting bloc that they could not afford to ignore," Louis Lam, chairman of the American Teo Chew Business Association and a board member of the Chinatown nonprofit Chinese Newcomers' Center, told China Daily.The current mayoral race exemplifies the heightened focus on Chinese American voters. Incumbent Mayor London Breed, facing a challenging reelection bid, has seen her approval rate shift dramatically among this demographic, which played an important role in her previous election.A poll conducted by the San Francisco Chronicle in February revealed that 80 percent of potential Asian voters disapprove of Breed's performance, and only 10 percent support her.Recognizing the need to regain favor with Chinese American voters, the mayor has taken actions such as increasing the police budget, granting law enforcement more authority, addressing homeless encampments, and even embarking on a trip to China.During her April visit to China, Breed signed an agreement to bring a pair of pandas to the San Francisco Zoo, a move that resonated strongly with Chinese American advocates. She also lobbied for the restoration of direct flights between China and San Francisco International Airport, which had been disrupted during the pandemic.Those efforts appear to be paying dividends. A recent Chronicle poll indicated that Breed's approval rating among Asian voters doubled over the past six months. The resurgence in support from the Asian and Chinese American communities has bolstered her standing in the mayoral race.However, Breed's challengers are not ceding ground in the battle for Chinese American votes.Former San Francisco supervisor Mark Farrell, one of Breed's main rivals, recently secured a crucial endorsement from the San Francisco Chinese American Democratic Club — an organization that had previously backed Breed in her last mayoral campaign.Farrell has been a frequent presence at community events in Chinatown, distributing Chinese-language flyers and engaging with potential voters. His campaign platform emphasizes cracking down on street homelessness and drug use, issues that resonate strongly with many Chinese American residents.Another prominent challenger, Daniel Lurie, founder of an anti-poverty nonprofit and heir to the Levi Strauss fortune, has taken a strategic approach to courting Chinese American voters.Lurie has hired a Chinese American campaign manager and enlisted Chinese American activists to bolster his outreach efforts. His campaign has been marked by personal interactions with Chinese American residents, visiting them in their homes and attending community banquets. Like his rivals, Lurie has prioritized addressing public safety concerns and combating drug use in his campaign promises.The race also features San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, who entered the contest later than his competitors but brings a strong base of support from Chinatown.As the longtime supervisor representing the district, Peskin has cultivated deep ties within the Chinese American community. His implementation of Cantonese-speaking workers during his tenure as board president has particularly endeared him to Chinatown residents.Supervisor Ahsha Safaí, another mayoral hopeful, is leveraging his existing relationships with the Chinese community to garner support. Safaí pointed to his track record of addressing issues important to Chinese American voters, such as securing funding for nonprofits supporting single-room occupancy units and sponsoring legislation to increase police foot patrols. Safaí also has hired a Chinese American campaign manager to strengthen ties with the city's Chinese community.The intense focus on Chinese American voters in this election cycle is no coincidence. Political consultant Jim Ross emphasized the critical nature of the demographic, saying to San Francisco news website Mission Local, "It will be very challenging for any candidate to win without getting the most votes from that coalition."The political engagement of San Francisco's Chinese American community has reached new heights, driven by several factors, said Lam, who attributed the surge to the community's increasing education levels and a growing awareness of their voting power."All the people I know have realized the importance of casting ballots. Even those who do not read or speak English, their children, who are well educated, can help them," he said.The successful recall elections in 2022, which replaced several progressive school board members in the city and the liberal district attorney Chesa Boudin, served as a watershed moment, demonstrating the community's ability to effect change through the ballot box, he said.Economic concerns and public safety issues remain at the forefront for many Chinese American voters. As Lam pointed out, a significant portion of the community consists of small- and medium-sized business owners or working-class individuals who are acutely affected by the city's economic challenges and crime rate."It's tragic that many businesses in Fisherman's Wharf remain closed, and an office tower downtown was sold nearly 80 percent less than the price about a decade ago," said Lam, adding that it was why he switched his support from Breed five years ago to Farrell and Lurie for the upcoming election.An increasing number of Chinese students and tech professionals are expressing their alarm on social media about being harassed in what they described as a "small dark room" at the secondary inspection areas of immigration and border authorities in the United States. (Video)The trend has sparked heightened concerns among international students about traveling to the US, in turn fueling calls for the US to halt the revocation of legally obtained visas and stemming the disruption to people-to-people exchanges.Chinese student Chen Guo (not his real name) began his journey to Boston, Massachusetts, in 2022 after he was accepted by Harvard Medical School. However, his academic dream quickly turned into a nightmare when, on arrival in the US city, he was subjected to an 18-hour secondary inspection by US Customs and Border Protection officers.Sharing his harrowing experience on Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu earlier this year, Chen described how the officers scrutinized his emails and online browsing history and chat records.The ordeal reached its climax when they discovered a screenshot of a news photo celebrating a successful Chinese satellite launch in his digital album. Despite his legally obtained visa, Chen's entry was denied and he was unceremoniously deported."They made me stand against a wall with a measuring scale for a photo; isn't that how criminals are photographed?" Chen said. "I never thought I would face such mental humiliation."Two weeks after Chen was deported, he received a collect parcel from the US, which charged him $50 in postal fees and contained his electronic devices seized by US Customs.A Chinese employee surnamed Liu, from an international Internet company specializing in short video services, shared a similar ordeal through his WeChat public account.Liu had thought he was on a routine business trip, departing from Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on March 14, 2023.He wrote in his WeChat social media account, "Life has become increasingly simple in middle age, and a single backpack is enough for a five-day business trip across continents."However, his experience at the border in Houston, Texas, shattered his relaxed and cheerful mood after getting off the plane.A CBP officer subjected him to the secondary inspection area at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Liu's electronic devices were seized and he was interrogated for over 10 hours."They asked me if I and my company were engaged in data theft, spreading sensitive information and connected to Chinese governments," Liu said.Liu's valid visa was eventually revoked despite his role in company logistics strategy, leading to his deportation from the US and a severe blow to his career. Liu later learned from a CBP officer that his sufferings arose because his name was similar to that of a Chinese scientist.The secondary inspection area is referred to as the "small dark room" on Chinese social media, although interviewees clarify it is not literally small or dark, but labeled so due to the harassment and oppressive atmosphere.More than 30 Chinese students from computer-related fields have been subjected to unwarranted harassment, scrutiny and deportation by US authorities, according to latest accounts.Most were graduate students whose research areas included artificial intelligence, information science, cybersecurity, electrical engineering, software engineering and electronic information engineering."When the students applied for their visas, the US side would have done the necessary security background checks. That is to say, they passed the security risk screening to get the visa," said Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University's Institute of International Studies and director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University."But now even if you get a visa, it is highly possible that you can be refused entry and deported when you enter the US, which is not reasonable."Shi Yinhong, director of the Center on American Studies at Renmin University of China, said that these "absurd incidents" have been on the rise amid the escalating "China threat" rhetoric, with the US increasingly viewing China as its main competitor.Shi said that the focus on "national security" signals a rise in protectionism and underscores US insecurity about advancements in science and technology.Wu from Fudan University said the political motivation behind the phenomenon is clear — it aims to control and restrict cultural exchanges between the two countries for "national security", directly leading to a decline in people-to-people interactions.Many online discussion forums have been organized through Chinese social media platforms to address the concerns, with students sharing their educational backgrounds and internship experiences and asking whether their academic credentials might affect their visa applications and entry."For students majoring in business and data at my university, will there be issues with visa approvals? I believe my major isn't sensitive, but I'm worried that pursuing this degree might be futile," asked one forum participant."Depends on your luck," replied another forum user.Chen, the student who was heading to Harvard Medical School, advised through his social media account that Chinese students from universities identified as "sensitive "by the US should consider refraining from pursuing studies or postdoctoral positions in the country.A student surnamed Chou who graduated in 2022 from the University of California, San Diego, said the US has long claimed to be a "lighthouse of openness and inclusiveness", but its actions "run into the opposite direction"."Compared to the risk of being inspected and deported during each trip to and from the US, it is a wiser choice to pursue higher education outside the US," Chou said."We have already witnessed a significant decrease in the number of Chinese students studying in the US over the past two years, and this downward trend is expected to persist," Fudan University's Wu said.According to the Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange, while China remains the largest source of international students in the US, the total number has dropped from 372,532 to 289,526 in the past four years. India surpassed China to become the largest source of international graduate students in 2023. The proportion of Chinese students in engineering fields is also decreasing annually.A source from an overseas study consultancy firm in Shanghai said that US visa rejection rates for doctoral students in high-tech fields are notably high. Even when they are not rejected, the students face rigorous scrutiny, prompting many to seek study opportunities in other countries like Britain, Singapore and Australia or at European universities.Experts said that under the pretext of safeguarding national security, US law enforcement authorities have overstretched the concept of national security and arbitrarily interrogated and repatriated Chinese students, which has caused a "chilling effect "and seriously affected the atmosphere of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries."The US attitude toward cultural and educational exchanges might be influenced by the US election and political situation," said Wu from Fudan University, adding that the US should act responsibly and be more open and inclusive in people-to-people exchanges.The Chinese e-commerce platform Dewu has emerged to shake up the global luxury goods market by offering steep discounts of up to 40 percent on luxury fashion goods and sneakers.Dewu, or its English name Poizon, was originally a platform for purchasing, reselling and discussing sneakers. But since 2018, it has sold branded clothing, handbags, watches, electronics and toys that are purchased worldwide.The platform has more than 160 million active users who often have new, legitimate goods from abroad such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Gucci to sell on the site. It is especially appealing to price-conscious Generation Z Chinese shoppers.Jeff Unze, former general manager of the San Francisco office of Dewu, was brought on to roll out the company in the United States. He has since left to work for the startup CrossTerra."They're the first Chinese company that is taking branded goods globally," Unze told China Daily. "Every other Chinese company has done fast fashion like Temu."The vast majority of Dewu's customers are in China, he said. "It has been downloaded 350 million times in China, so it is a pretty large platform and has monthly active users over 160 million."Founded in July 2015 by CEO Yang Bing, the company's headquarters is in Shanghai. By 2021, the site offered more than 100,000 new products every month and expanded into Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Japan, Europe and the Americas. Its move into the US is to gain new products and customers." (Dewu) can draw products from retailers, wholesalers, even people to people, just like eBay," Unze said. "They can get luxury or sneakers from everyone because they're doing such great work on the authentication side."Booming tradeThe success of the site is partly being attributed to it repurposing China's $81 billion daigou market, which was booming before the pandemic but was halted because of pandemic-era travel restrictions.Daigou translates to "buying on behalf of" and refers to individual business entrepreneurs who used to travel from China to the US, Japan or Europe to buy cheaper goods because of fluctuating exchange rates, then ship them back to China for sale.Dewu has captured nearly three-fourths of China's daigou sellers' trade, according to the publication Inside Retail.As it focuses on selling more luxury goods, the value of sales of Louis Vuitton on Dewu grew 11 percent year-on-year to 2.6 billion yuan ($365 million) in the first half of this year, the publication Business of Fashion reported.LVMH, the Paris-based owner of Louis Vuitton, is said to be watching the rise of the site closely as Dewu accounted for more than 14 percent of Louis Vuitton's total estimated sales in China of 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion) for the same period.Luxury goods from Hermes, Chanel, Dior and Prada have also seen higher sales year-on-year on Dewu.While most of Dewu's merchandise is purchased from the official luxury stores, the platform is chipping away at the fashion houses' profit margins.Its primary customer base is Gen Z and Alpha shoppers. Of the 264 million Gen Z population in China, 70 percent claim to have a Dewu account, said a report by consultancy firm Re-Hub, which helps luxury and premium brands in China generate online growth.Chinese Gen Z consumers "have a higher-than-average per capita disposable income and along with Gen Alpha are projected to increase their spending on luxury three times faster than other cohorts", Re-Hub said.Unze said the US expansion was to ensure it could get "a really steady supply of some of the new hot goods, things that just aren't last season and they want to source them globally to make sure they always have the full array of supply and they always have the best prices".CHICAGO — US Vice-President Kamala Harris officially accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention, or DNC, held at the United Center in Chicago on Thursday night."I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America," said Harris, 59, the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket in the country, in a speech on the DNC's fourth and final day."With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans."Harris reflected on her upbringing as a person of Indian and African descent and her experience working as a prosecutor in the Bay Area and as California's attorney general.In her speech, Harris said building the middle class would be a defining goal of her presidency, emphasizing her own middle-class roots. She elaborated on abortion rights, immigration policy and foreign policy, among other topics.She told the crowd she would bring together labor, small business owners and US companies to create jobs, and that she would endeavor "to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like healthcare and housing and groceries".Harris also blasted former president Donald Trump's actions and policies, describing the consequences of putting Trump back in the White House as "extremely serious"."We know what a second Trump term would look like," she said, saying he wanted to "pull our country back to the past".In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, lashed out at Harris' speech, saying that she stands for "incompetence" and "weakness".He gave a play-by-play on the speech, accusing Harris of making the US a "failing nation" as part of President Joe Biden's administration.Earlier on Thursday, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched near the DNC venue to express their dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's Israel policy.In her acceptance speech, Harris attempted to address the Israel-Palestine conflict."President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination," she said.On Aug 6, the DNC announced that Harris had been officially certified as the party's presidential nominee following a five-day online balloting process.On Wednesday night, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz officially accepted the party's vice-presidential nomination at the convention.Tight raceHarris has raised a record-breaking $500 million in a month and narrowed the gap or taken the lead against Trump in many opinion polls of battleground states. Nationwide, she leads Trump 46.6 percent to 43.8 percent, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight.As Democrats gather for the convention, Trump has been holding campaign rallies in multiple states this week, including key swing states Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona.The race between the two remains tight in key swing states that could decide the election results.According to the latest poll data compiled by RealClearPolitics, Harris leads Trump by 1 percentage point in Wisconsin and by 2 percentage points in Michigan.In Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Arizona, Harris trails by 0.2 percentage points, 0.9 percentage points and 0.2 percentage points, respectively.Xinhua - AgenciesA new study found that anti-Asian hate incidents in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic correlated to the degree of local economic and health disparities, and FBI data on such incidents were different from those reported by the news media.The study, called Roots of Racism: Examining the Conditions for Anti-Asian Hate During COVID-19, was initiated by The Asian American Foundation, or TAAF. It analyzed anti-Asian hate incidents, or AAHIs, using data from January 2020 to December 2021 from media data compiled by TAAF and law enforcement data documented by the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program.The study examined the relationship between social factors and anti-Asian hate, and found that there is no correlation between AAHIs and political party affiliation. Such incidents happened in counties of both Republican and Democratic strongholds.The data suggested that AAHIs were correlated to economic conditions. Counties with more income inequality, lower median household income and more free lunch recipients tended to have more AAHIs incidents. Conversely, counties with higher homeownership saw fewer AAHIs.Poor health was also connected to AAHIs. Counties with more drug overdose deaths and less sleep time saw a higher number of AAHIs.TAAF said such results were consistent with previous research that has found that income inequality is a strong predictor of neighborhood turmoil and violent crime in general.The study noticed some discrepancies between the two data sets: for the same period, the media reported 1,288 AAHIs, while the FBI recorded 1,087.At the local level, the discrepancy is large for some counties, data showed. In San Francisco, the media reported 113 AAHIs, while the FBI recorded 70.In its news release, TAAF said the discrepancies can be attributed to a variety of factors, including news coverage of incidents that may not legally be categorized as crimes, and victims choosing not to report incidents.TAAF said there is a need for improved measures to encourage reporting, whether to law enforcement or community-based support organizations, in order to accurately capture the full scope of anti-Asian hate incidents.Unwilling to reportTAAF's New York City Safety Study released earlier this year also found that Asian Americans who experienced a hate crime are less likely to report incidents to police (56 percent) than those who witnessed it (69 percent).The most common barriers to reporting were a reluctance to bring additional attention to themselves, not feeling comfortable dealing with law enforcement, or not knowing how to report."These findings clearly show that there's work to be done when it comes to both tracking and reporting anti-Asian hate incidents and addressing the factors that contribute to incidents in the first place," said Norman Chen, CEO of TAAF, in the release.Anti-Asian hate incidents continue to be an issue in the US. TAAF recently released its 2024 Social Tracking of Asian Americans in the US, or STAATUS, Index, an annual survey of people's attitudes toward Asian Americans.The survey showed that about one-third of Asian Americans were called a slur in the past year, and 61 percent of Asian Americans think that hatred toward them has increased in the past year.mayzhou@chinadailyusa.comCHICAGO - US Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday night officially accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) held at the United Center in Chicago."I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America," said Harris, the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket in the country, in a speech on the fourth and the final day of the DNC."With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a New Way Forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans," she said.Harris reflected on her upbringing as a person of Indian and African descent, and her experience working as a prosecutor in the Bay Area and as California's attorney general.In her speech, Harris said that building middle class will be a defining goal of her presidency, and that middle class is where she comes from. She elaborated on abortion rights, immigration policy, foreign policy, among other topics.The Democratic presidential nominee also blasted former President Donald Trump's actions and policies, describing that the consequences of putting Trump back in the White House as "extremely serious".In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, lashed out at Harris' speech, saying that she stands for "incompetence" and "weakness".Earlier on Thursday, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched near the DNC venue to express their dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's Israel policy.In her acceptance speech, Harris attempted to address the Israel-Palestine conflict."President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination," said the Democratic nominee.On Aug 6, the DNC announced that Harris had been officially certified as the party's presidential nominee following a five-day online balloting process.On Aug 20, she was once again confirmed as the party's presidential nominee during the DNC.In a positive sign for air travel between China and the United States, Hainan Airlines has announced the launch of a new route connecting Haikou, capital of South China's Hainan province, and Seattle, starting next month.The once-weekly round-trip flight will start on Sept 26 and include a stopover in Chongqing, in Southwest China.Flight HU445 will depart Haikou every Thursday. Both the outbound and inbound flights will include a stopover in Southwest China's Chongqing municipality.The outbound flight from China will depart Haikou Meilan International Airport at 7 am Beijing time, arriving in Chongqing at 9:10 am. It will leave the Chongqing airport at 11:20 am and arrive at Seattle Tacoma International Airport in Washington state at 9 am Seattle time. The flight time is expected to be 17 hours.The return flight will leave Seattle at 11 am local time, arriving in Chongqing at 4 pm Beijing time the next day. It will depart Chongqing at 6:30 pm and arrive at the Haikou airport at 8:45 pm, for an expected flight time of 18 hours and 45 minutes.Hainan Airlines has been flying to Seattle, but via Beijing.The new route will be the first from Haikou to the US operated by Hainan Airlines. It is expected to also support the development of the Hainan Free Trade Port.In recent years, Hainan has increased efforts to resume and launch international air routes. As of May, the province had 46 overseas passenger routes, with the number expected to reach 62 by the end of this year.The flight also could contribute to Haikou's efforts to attract international talent.In June, the city issued the "Announcement on the Recruitment of Urgently Needed Talents from Foreign College Graduates for Enterprises and Institutions in 2024".The initiative aims to recruit 342 talents from among international college graduates for enterprises and institutions.Of the positions, 19 are designated for public institutions, 10 for statutory institutions, 61 for State-owned enterprises, and 252 for enterprises within the city's key industry parks.Hainan Airlines, which was established in 1993, and its subsidiaries operated nearly 1,800 domestic and international routes as of 2023.In February 2024, Hainan Airlines was awarded the "One Star Flight Safety Diamond Award" by the Civil Aviation Administration of China for achieving 10 million consecutive hours of safe flight.US-China air travel, however, is still far below pre-pandemic levels and also has been slowed due to political tensions.The number of international flights by international airlines from North America and Europe to China is down more than 60 percent this summer from the 2018 peak of more than 13,000, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing data from industry tracker OAG.Chinese airlines, however, have reduced their flights on such routes by only 30 percent since their 2019 peak, the FT reported. And they are providing twice as many flights to those routes this summer as their Western counterparts are.The US Department of Transportation approved increased frequency for US-China flights in February, allowing Chinese passenger airlines to boost their weekly round-trip US flights to 50 from 35, as of March 2024. Still, that number is only one-third of pre-pandemic levels, airlinegeeks.com reported.CHICAGO - US Minnesota Governor Tim Walz officially accepted the Democratic Party's vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) held here on Wednesday night."It's the honor of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States," Walz said in a speech on the third day of the party's national convention scheduled for Aug 19 to 22.Walz, a former public school teacher, high school football coach, veteran, and six-term US House Representative, was elected governor of Minnesota in 2018 and re-elected in 2022.Former US President Bill Clinton, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries gave prime-time speeches. Influential talk show host Oprah Winfrey made a surprise appearance at the convention and delivered a powerful speech.On Tuesday night, former President Barack Obama, former First Lady Michelle Obama, and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff gave prime-time speeches.On the opening day of the DNC, both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and United Auto Workers President Sean Fain gave prime-time speeches. President Joe Biden, greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of delegates, closed the night of the first day by delivering a nearly hourlong keynote speech.On Monday, thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched near the venue to express their dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's Israel policy, with at least four being arrested after breaching a security fence although the vast majority of the demonstration proceeded peacefully.On Tuesday night, dozens of people were arrested after clashing with police during an unauthorized protest outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Chicago.Vice President Kamala Harris, who has already won enough delegates to become the Democratic presidential nominee in a virtual roll call vote earlier this month, is expected to officially accept the Democratic Party's presidential nomination on Thursday night.As Democrats gather for the convention, former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has been holding campaign rallies in multiple states this week, including key swing states Michigan and North Carolina.In the key swing states that could decide the results of the election, the race between the two remains tight. According to the latest poll data compiled by Real Clear Politics, Harris leads Trump by 1.0 percentage points in Wisconsin and by 2.0 percentage points in Michigan. In Pennsylvania, Harris trails by 0.2 percentage points.When it comes to selling electric vehicles, US automakers face not only consumer reluctance but rising competition from China in the international market.For example, the Ford Motor Co is adjusting its electric vehicle strategy due to softer-than-expected demand, and canceling and postponing the production of certain models. It also expects to take $1.9 billion in related charges and write-downs.Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said that China's EV companies have the advantage of a lower-cost supply chain and that Ford needs to find ways to lower its own costs to compete."We believe that the fitness of the Chinese in EVs will eventually wash over our entire industry in all regions," Farley told analysts last month.In China, retail sales of new energy vehicles nationwide reached 878,000 units in July, accounting for 51.1 percent of the total market, according to data released by the China Automobile Dealers Association.The electric vehicle market is rapidly evolving as Chinese competitors leverage advantaged cost structures such as vertical integration, low-cost engineering, multi-energy advanced battery technology and digital experiences to expand their global market share, Ford said in a statement released Wednesday.The Dearborn, Michigan-based company noted that today's electric vehicle consumers are more cost conscious than early adopters, viewing EVs as a practical way to save money on fuel and maintenance, as well as time, by charging the vehicles at home.That shift, combined with a flood of new EV options entering the market over the next 12 months, along with increasing compliance requirements, has amplified price pressures.Ford's EV business is on pace to lose about $5 billion this year. In the three-month period ended in June, the company lost approximately $44,000 on each electric vehicle sold.Ford said it will cut capital spending on EVs; it will now spend 30 percent of its annual capital budget to develop them rather than the current 40 percent.Not only is Ford facing competition from China, but its American competitor in the EV market, Tesla, also has lowered its prices.Executives have stated that the company is working to reduce losses on its current EV lineup while ensuring that future models are profitable.The company announced Wednesday that it would cancel plans for a three-row electric SUV due to high battery costs. Instead, the company will focus on producing those vehicles as gas-electric hybrids, with more details to be revealed at a future event.The changes will force Ford to write down $400 million of its current assets due to big electric SUVs, and it is also expected to have additional expenses of up to $1.5 billion."With pricing and margin compression, we've made the decision to adjust our product and technology roadmap and industrial footprint to meet our goal of reaching positive EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) within the first 12 months of launch for all new models," Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said in the statement.The company stated that it will focus on hybrids in areas where it holds a competitive advantage — such as commercial vans, midsize and large pickup trucks, and long-range SUVs.It plans to offer a variety of electrification options aimed at accelerating customer adoption, including lower prices and extended ranges.Sales of gas-electric hybrids in the US jumped 35.3 percent from January through June to 715,768, eclipsing electric vehicle sales, according to The Associated Press."These dynamics underscore the necessity of a globally competitive cost structure while being selective about customer and product segments to ensure profitable growth and capital efficiency," the company said.In May, the Biden administration imposed 100 percent tariffs on EVs made in China, which went into effect on Aug 1.Agencies contributed to this story.A new study found that anti-Asian hate incidents (AAHIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic correlated to the degree of local economic and health disparities, and the FBI data on such incidents were different from that reported by the news media.The study, called "Roots of Racism: Examining the Conditions for Anti-Asian Hate During COVID-19", was initiated by The Asian American Foundation (TAAF).

For example, For San Francisco, the media reported 113 AAHIs while the FBI recorded 70. In Kings County (Brooklyn), New York, the media reported 56 hate incidents while the FBI recorded none.There were reverse discrepancies, too. In Los Angeles, the FBI reported 90 incidents while the media reported 79. In Indiana County, Pennsylvania, the FBI reported 27 incidents while the media reported none.In its news release, TAAF said the discrepancies can be attributed to a variety of factors, including news coverage of incidents that may not legally be categorized as crimes, and victims choosing not to report incidents.TAAF said there is a need for improved measures to encourage reporting, whether to law enforcement or to community-based support organizations, in order to accurately capture the full scope of anti-Asian hate incidents.TAAF's New York City Safety Study released earlier this year also found that Asian Americans who experienced a hate crime are less likely to report incidents to police (56 percent) than those who witnessed (69 percent) it.The most common barriers to reporting were a reluctance to bring additional attention to themselves, not feeling comfortable dealing with law enforcement, or not knowing how to report.   "These findings clearly show that there's work to be done when it comes to both tracking and reporting anti-Asian hate incidents and addressing the factors that contribute to incidents in the first place," said Norman Chen, president and CEO of TAAF, in the release. Anti-Asian hate incidents continue to be an issue in the United States.

Raised by university dean Li Liren and his wife, Rong's life takes a dramatic turn when he solves a complex problem posed by his professor, Hayes.The remarkable achievement catches the attention of the enigmatic 701 Bureau, led by director Zheng, thrusting Rong into the clandestine world of code breaking.Directed by Chinese filmmaker Chen Sicheng, Decoded features a stellar ensemble cast, including Liu Haoran, John Cusack, Chen Daoming, Daniel Wu and Yu Feihong. This film marks Chen Sicheng's latest bold venture following the remarkable success of his Detective Chinatown series and Sheep Without a Shepherd.The story unfolds in the high-stakes world of espionage, loaded with suspense and tension.Through the art of decoding, the film portrays the relationship between mentor and protégé as a poetic and fateful duel, where each becomes both the cause and the effect of the other, according to Bohan Gong, senior manager of International Distribution Department at CMC Pictures."In addition to its compelling story, Decoded showcases breathtaking visuals, immersive soundscapes, and meticulous production design, pushing sensory boundaries," Gong said. "This film sets a new benchmark for Chinese filmmaking, offering a fresh, innovative approach to the industry."Audiences have praised the film's visual effects, sound design and emotional depth, expressing admiration for its cinematography, acting and international collaboration. They highlighted the impressive work of the crew and actors from both China and America.Andrzej Bartkowiak, a Hollywood cinematographer and film director, commended the film for its universal appeal."The film is truly international. It tackles important subjects, but at its core, it's about geniuses — and geniuses are universal. It's a story about two geniuses from different countries," Bartkowiak told China Daily. "The film was beautifully executed in every aspect — scope, lighting, directing, acting — it was flawless. I loved it.""This film is absolutely spectacular — beautifully crafted with not only great cinematography but also amazing effects and stunning fantasy elements. It's truly a work of art," said Charles Herzfeld, a production manager and writer.Digital artist Hari Tahov praised the film, calling the visual effects incredible. "What I loved most were the sound effects — they truly deepened the entire experience for me. The actor delivered an incredible performance; I could really feel his emotions, and the story's development was very touching," he said. "It was also a collaborative effort, involving actors and crew from two different countries — China and America."The movie will be released globally starting Thursday. The initial wave of screenings will take place in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, with additional regions to be announced soon.CHICAGO - The US Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates at its September meeting if economic data continues to come in as expected, according to minutes of the Fed's July 30-31 meeting released Wednesday."Almost all participants remarked that while the incoming data regarding inflation were encouraging, additional information was needed to provide greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward the Committee's 2 percent objective before it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate," said the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-setting body."Nevertheless, participants viewed the incoming data as enhancing their confidence that inflation was moving toward the Committee's objective," said the minutes. "The vast majority observed that, if the data continued to come in about as expected, it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting."Factors such as a continued waning of pricing power, moderating economic growth, and the runoff in excess household savings accumulated during the pandemic -- which had contributed to recent disinflation -- would likely continue to put downward pressure on inflation in coming months, the minutes said.Participants also noted that real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was solid in the first half of the year, though slower than the robust pace seen in the second half of last year.The Fed's latest minutes were released a few hours after the US Labor Department reported that monthly payroll data had overestimated job growth by approximately 818,000 over the 12 months ending in March, signaling a weaker labor market than previously reported.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group's FedWatch Tool, which acts as a barometer for the market's expectation of the Fed funds target rate, showed that the probability of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points at the September meeting is 62 percent as of Wednesday night.Editor's note: As Chinese companies move their operations to Mexico, they are not just sidestepping tariffs but also sparking a surge in local investment and job creation. China Daily looks at how international politics and economics are intertwining to drive significant shifts in manufacturing and trade.When you buy drinks from McDonald's, Wendy's, or Dunkin', the straws and cups you use are likely from a Chinese company, while the drinks are either produced in Mexico or the United States and are a product of a complex trilateral trade relationship.After former US president Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports and restricted Chinese investments starting in March 2018, the company making the cups, Fuling Plastics, began to face tariffs on many of its products.As a result, Fuling moved a factory to Indonesia. Around 2019, it also moved some production to Monterrey, Mexico. And then, Fuling opened a factory in Pennsylvania.Fuling Plastics is not the only Chinese company moving factories to North America amid rising US-China geopolitical tensions.Monterrey is the capital of Nuevo Leon, a state in Northern Mexico. Chinese corporations last year were responsible for more than 30 percent of the foreign investment in the state, second only to the US at 47 percent, The New York Times reported."A lot of our customers that are close to the border of Mexico can take advantage of competitive pricing and shorter lead times. Not only do we avoid the tariffs coming out of China, but customers within a reasonable distance of Monterrey can enjoy the same type of products manufactured in Mexico at a fairly competitive price," Tom Melchiorre, president of Direct Link USA, a joint venture of Fuling Plastics, told China Daily.The company currently has about 120 employees in Mexico operating out of a facility of 80,000 square feet (7,432 square meters), but soon it will expand to more than 200,000 square feet and about 400 employees. Only the management is from China, while all other employees are Mexican.The Ministry of Economy of Nuevo Leon reported that the state received $13 billion in investments from October 2021 to April 2023, creating 88,000 new jobs.The Mexican Ministry of Economy recorded 378 foreign direct investment announcements in 2023, worth $110.7 billion. The US led with $42.1 billion, followed by China with $11.2 billion.In 2022, China's direct investment in Mexico rose 48 percent year-on-year. Chinese companies now represent the fastest-growing source of foreign investment in Mexico.The trend of Chinese investment in Mexico started around 2019 and will likely continue as the US imposes more tariffs on Chinese products and industries.The increasing tariffs from the US have been imposed on items from China such as solar panels, electric vehicles and EV batteries, which have led to shipping costs rising about six times, Melchiorre said."When you're producing commodity products, and shipping costs rise that much, your product is now 15 to 20 percent higher. So, I think it becomes more and more attractive to manufacture in Mexico as we continue to face these challenges," Melchiorre said.Mexico's exports to the US last year surpassed China's for the first time in two decades, a development linked to the political tensions between China and the US. However, the trade relationship between China and the US is resilient, even under strained conditions.Researchers analyzed the evolution of the trilateral trade relationship between Mexico, the US and China from 1993 to 2020, and found that, in general, for every 1 percent increase in Mexico's exports to the US, Mexico's imports from China increased by 1.06 percent.Xuedong Liu, professor of economics and engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, noted that since 1993, about half of the US trade surplus with Mexico has been offset by a growing deficit with China, making Mexico a key assembly hub for North America, and China an influential player in the region's trade.Cost-effective goodsMexico chose Chinese products, not for political reasons, but for their high cost-effectiveness and the lack of substitutes from other countries, Liu told China Daily."The primary reason is that Mexico's local supply chain is not robust enough to meet all its needs. To increase exports to the US, Mexico must also increase its imports. These imports don't necessarily have to come from China; they could come from other countries," he said."However, Mexico ultimately chooses Chinese products due to their competitive pricing. This choice isn't driven by any specific policy or political measure but by market economics."Chinese products offer better value for money compared to those from other countries. If this weren't the case, local manufacturers in Mexico would opt for imports from countries like Vietnam, Indonesia or Brazil. However, these countries either lack competitive pricing or a complete supply chain for certain products," Liu added.The Joe Biden administration in July announced new tariffs on imports of Mexican steel containing Chinese components. The US will now impose a 25 percent tariff on such steel, the same rate imposed on steel from China. Previously, Mexican steel with Chinese components was exempt from duty."These tariffs that the United States put in place specifically to try to prevent metals that come from China from entering their country represent a risk for Mexican exports, because part of the exports are produced in China and not in Mexico, and in the short term, it is very unlikely that Mexico will be able to change that so those commodities are produced here," Ana Azuara, commodity markets specialist at Grupo Financiero Base, told BNamericas, an online source of daily business information and intelligence on Latin America.The tariffs were costly for Mexico, and to compensate for the economic toll, the US and Mexico agreed that steel imported from Brazil that is processed in Mexico and then exported to the US will not be subject to tariffs, Liu said."But Brazilian steel is not as cost-effective as Chinese steel. It is currently very difficult to estimate the potential economic impact on Mexico," he said."Unlike Vietnam and Malaysia, Mexico has a stronger industrial base (to manufacture its own products), especially after joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the predecessor to the USMCA, in 1994."USMCA is a free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada, which replaced NAFTA in 2018.Still, Mexico faces challenges with its supply chain, lacking intermediate and capital goods, which limits its export capacity. So, to increase exports, Mexico needs to increase imports, Liu said.Mexico is now importing more products from China which used to come from North America. In 2019, 17.7 percent of Mexico's imports in electronics such as mobile phones, auto parts and motor vehicles came from China, sectors where the US was traditionally the main supplier, according to Americas Quarterly, a nonprofit publication.Some believe that in the contest between the two major powers, the US and China, Mexico has not yet found a strategy to address the increasingly complex trilateral trade relationship. Caught between US-China trade dynamics, Mexico's relationship with China has become more politically complicated.In January 2023, the US, Mexico and Canada established a committee to substitute imports from Asia with products manufactured in North America.Before 2021, trade between China and Mexico was primarily driven by mutual benefit and market principles, Liu said.Since 2023, bilateral trade between China and Mexico "has not only been influenced by economic and market factors but also political ones", Liu said. He said that it is a new characteristic of the trade relationship.Mexico welcomes Chinese investment. In 2019, ahead of his visit to China, former Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said the country wants to deepen economic ties with China by increasing its exports and attracting more Chinese investment.Ebrard told reporters via a video link from the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in 2019 that he would be prioritizing the expansion of business ties during his visit to China."What we're interested in is increasing Mexico's presence in China, Mexico's capacity to export to China, and China's investments in Mexico," he said, according to Reuters."The structural reasons that are bringing capital to Mexico are here to stay," said Juan Carlos Baker Pineda, Mexico's former vice-minister for external trade. "I have no indication that the trade war between China and the US is going to diminish any time soon."While the Chinese origin of the capital coming into Mexico may be uncomfortable for the policies of some countries, according to international trade legislation, those products are, to all intents and purposes, Mexican," the BBC quoted him as saying.Citing examplesAn example of such products is Mexico's auto manufacturing industry. In 2023, Tesla announced plans to establish a factory in Mexico, which attracted a large number of suppliers to the country.Many of those suppliers were already producing components or raw materials for Tesla in China. The Chinese auto parts makers are rapidly setting up plants on the outskirts of Monterrey, where Tesla plans its manufacturing plant.While "Made in Mexico" is gaining ground in the North American market, Chinese companies still hold an advantage due to their stronger technical and supply chain foundations, experts said."Mexico now aims to strengthen local supply chains and increase production value, but this has been a long-standing issue. While China has invested heavily in technology and research over the past 50 years, Mexico has not, making it difficult to achieve these goals quickly," Liu said."Most of the companies going to Mexico are bringing skills that we don't currently have in Mexico," Jose Luis Enciso, business intelligence director for Keno Consulting in Beijing, told China Daily. "This will benefit us by introducing new skills and creating new suppliers. It will also benefit the Chinese investors because they will gain access to a new market and become more efficient."Meanwhile, it is not easy for Chinese companies, capital and technology to enter the Mexican market.Going to Mexico "has helped reduce lead times, which is an advantage for our customers, not having such a long lead time coming from China. You're cutting your lead time from 100 days to 30 days to two weeks. So, there are a lot of advantages to producing in Mexico," Melchiorre said.There also are some disadvantages. Resin, the raw material for Melchiorre's company's products, is more expensive in Mexico, he said. Compared with China, the cost of labor also is higher in Mexico. And shipping is very expensive, especially when the company produces and ships throughout North America."The further north we go, the more expensive and less competitive we are out of Mexico," Melchiorre said.Cultural differences are another issue for Chinese companies operating in Mexico. There are not many Latin Americans who speak Chinese, and not many Chinese who have Spanish skills and industry experience.That can lead to misunderstandings and make it difficult for companies to understand the local context, said Enciso, whose company provides consulting services for Chinese businesses entering Mexico.While Mexican companies are accustomed to working with European and US firms, integrating Chinese companies can be challenging. That is due to the need for local expertise in engineering, legal and accounting services, which also must align with the practices of Chinese companies, Enciso added.Enciso, who also served as minister counselor for trade affairs at Mexico's embassy in China, remains positive about the future development of economic and trade relations between the two countries."While we don't have a free trade agreement in place, Mexico and China have developed a very good economic and policy dialogue over the past 10 years," he said.The recent efforts to strengthen ties between China and Mexico involve multiple sectors.China Southern Airlines announced a direct route from Shenzhen to Mexico City in May, and Hainan Airlines resumed direct flights between Beijing and Tijuana and Mexico City in July.The connectivity is really going to help enhance people-to-people exchanges, Enciso said.Several major ocean carriers have opened new China-to-Mexico trade routes in recent months. At the government level, Mexican Tourism Secretary Miguel Torruco visited China in July, which led to support from both governments to continue strengthening bilateral relationships."Certainly, the global policy environment will continue to evolve, unfortunately, with more protectionist measures and security concerns. However, I believe it's only a matter of time until common ground is found to recognize the positive aspects of increasing trade and investment," Enciso said.In the world of beauty, Yue-Sai Kan has dedicated decades of her life to bridging understanding between China and the world through the blending of Eastern and Western cultures.Called "the most famous woman in China" by People magazine, Kan launched her new book, The Most Famous Woman in China and How She Did It, after this notable moniker. More than 200 people attended the book signing and panel discussion co-hosted by the China Institute in New York City on Aug 13."Everything I have done in my life has never been done by others, but I have always been focused on cultural exchanges between the East and the West, and I am committed to bridging understanding between China and the world," Kan said.She said the book, her first autobiography in English, is more than just a chronicle of her life. It also offers a lens into the evolving relationship between the East and West, as seen through her eyes.An Emmy-winning television host, producer, successful entrepreneur, fashion icon, bestselling author and philanthropist, Kan describes herself as a "pioneer "having been the first to break new ground on TV and in the cosmetics industry, influenced by her childhood experiences and pursuit of beauty.Born in Guilin in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and raised in Hong Kong, Kan received little pampering from her parents.Caught speeding up the clock to shorten her piano practice as a little girl, Kan faced punishment from her mother with a feather duster. But she cleverly avoided it by affectionately rubbing her cheek against her mother's wrist.Despite the strict upbringing, her mother supported her early interest in beauty, especially when she found Kan playing with jewelry or experimenting with lipstick in front of a mirror.Her father, a painter who would start over if he found even a small detail unsatisfactory in his work, exposed her early to art. This cultivated her appreciation for beauty and instilled a strict attitude toward it.Kan said her parents' support had contributed a lot to her growth.At 16, Kan went to the United States to attend the Brigham Young University-Hawaii. Her experience studying in the US, coupled with her adventurous spirit, deepened her understanding of Westerners and people from diverse ethnicities and backgrounds. This experience then helped shape her commitment to represent Chinese culture through her own identity.After a brief return to Hong Kong, Kan moved back to the US.In January 1972, she arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York with just $150 in cash.She began her television career in New York, using her persistence and resilience to establish roots in the city.In 1978, Kan produced and hosted the TV show Looking East, which introduced Chinese topics to mainstream US media and brought China to the US audience for the first time.In her autobiography, Kan described how she launched the show amid skepticism from friends, quickly transitioning to a successful start.Lack of informationAt the book-signing event, Kan said the lack of information about China was why she felt compelled to create Looking East. She wanted the show to help people in the US better understand China, bridging a significant cultural gap.In 1984, Kan was invited by PBS to host a live broadcast in China for the 35th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.This event marked the first television collaboration between China and the US. In her book, she wrote that seeing Tian'anmen Square during the hour-long live broadcast filled her with pride.Not only did Kan captivate the US audience, but she was also invited by the Chinese government to produce the show One World, which reached an audience of 400 million people.This program helped Chinese viewers gain a global perspective through her eyes. The 1988 TV program introduced China's reform and opening-up process to the US audience, playing a key role in familiarizing the US with the New China.Kan also consistently held herself to high standards. As a host, she made a lasting impression on viewers in both China and the US with her iconic "Yue-Sai Cut", vibrant clothing and signature red lips. Those elements resonated deeply with viewers in both countries.Later, Kan founded Yue Sai Cosmetics, where she was personally involved in every step from sourcing to research and development, testing and mass production.She integrated traditional Chinese herbal formulas into her cosmetics, creating a color palette specifically suited for sensitive skin and the complexions of Chinese women.In her book, Kan detailed the journey of creating her cosmetics brand. Additionally, she introduced "Yue-Sai wawa" — dolls that feature black hair and yellow skin dressed in traditional Chinese attire, making a significant cultural impact.To this day, Kan remains dedicated to fostering exchanges and cultural understanding between China and the US. Kan has built a diverse network of friends ranging from high-profile politicians and business leaders to ordinary citizens across both China and the US."Art, culture, education, business and culinary, always connect people," she said.Trina Solar US has secured $235 million in financing for its planned 1.35 million-square-foot solar plant in Wilmer, a small city about 15 miles south of downtown Dallas in Texas.The company, a subsidiary of Trina Solar, which is based in China's Jiangsu province, will use the loan to construct and operate a solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing plant.Standard Chartered, the London bank that arranged the deal, announced the "green" loan in a news release on Aug 7.Trina Solar leased the space at Tradepoint 45 West to set up a factory to manufacture and assemble high-power solar panels and PV modules, a company statement said.The plant is expected to be operating by year-end and provide 1,500 local jobs when at full capacity."We were thrilled to bring together this group of leaders and community members to celebrate our commitment to the City of Wilmer and the clean energy industry," Steven Zhu, president of Trina Solar North America, said in the company's first announcement of the factory."This facility represents a significant investment in American manufacturing that will bolster the US solar market in addition to positioning Texas as a leader in the transition to a sustainable future," he said.Jerry Wu, CFO at Trina Solar, said in a statement that the project is "the first non-recourse syndicated project financing in the United States raised by a PV module manufacturer and renewable enterprise".The factory capacity is 5 gigawatts, the company said.A recent analysis by Reuters concluded that Chinese companies will have at least 20 gigawatts of annual solar panel-production capacity on American soil within the next year. Chinese companies account for about one-fifth of the solar factories announced since the United States adopted new climate subsidies under Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act program.There are a few major solar panel projects underway by Chinese companies. Illuminate USA, a joint venture between Chinese solar equipment maker Longi and US company Invenergy, began manufacturing at a 5-gigawatt plant in Pataskala, Ohio, in February. The project is expected to employ 1,000 workers at full capacity.China-based solar cell and module manufacturer JA Solar will establish a 2-gigawatt production facility in Phoenix, Arizona. Expected to be operational by year-end, the company said the $60 million investment will create 600 new jobs.Another Chinese company, Runergy, is building a 5-gigawatt solar module plant in Huntsville, Alabama, which is creating 800 jobs.Some experts say that China's presence in solar panel production on US soil will help the domestic solar manufacturing industry mature while creating jobs."They have a lot more experience building factories and setting up supply chains," David Feldman, a solar market researcher with the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told Reuters.Zhu told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that the US market needs Chinese solar manufacturers for their technological know-how, ability to bring suppliers from China, capital, and appetite for investment.China is a leading producer of solar energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that in 2023, 407-446 gigawatts direct current of photovoltaics was installed globally, and China represented 60 percent of 2023 global total installs.While the United States was the second-largest market in terms of cumulative and annual installations, it lags with 26.3 gigawatts installed in 2023, according to the IEA.The trouble seems to never end for Boeing.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday ordered inspections of Boeing 787 aircraft following a midair dive by a LATAM Airlines plane in March in which more than 50 of its 263 passengers were injured.The FAA had received a report saying that the dive happened when the captain's seat moved, causing the autopilot to disconnect. The plane rapidly descended until the first officer took control.Since then, the FAA has received four additional reports of similar issues, the most recent in June, according to numerous media reports.The FAA's inspection will affect 158 airplanes registered in the United States and 737 airplanes globally, the agency said in the statement, according to Reuters. It requires airlines to inspect the captain's and first officer's seats on 787-8, 787-9 and 787-10 models within 30 days to check for missing or cracked rocker switch caps or damaged switch covers.On March 11, the Chilean multinational airline LATAM's flight LA800 experienced a "sudden midair drop" about an hour before landing during its journey from Sydney to Santiago, Chile, with a stop in Auckland, New Zealand.During the plane's sudden descent, passengers were hurt as some were knocked into the cabin ceiling. A passenger said a pilot had told him he had lost control of the plane when "my gauges just kind of went blank on me'', CNN reported in March."The plane, unannounced, just dropped. I mean it dropped unlike anything I've ever experienced on any kind of minor turbulence, and people were thrown out of their seats, hit the top of the roof of the plane, thrown down the aisles," passenger Brian Jokat told the BBC in March."My neighbor who was in the seat two over from me, there was a gap in between us, as soon as I woke, I looked, and he was on the ceiling, and I thought I was dreaming," he said.Boeing's manufacturing reputation took another hit on Tuesday when it halted the launch of its 777X aircraft after the company found problems between the engine and the plane's wings during a test flight.In the first week of 2024, a Boeing 737 MAX 9 passenger jet lost a rear door plug in midflight, leading to rapid decompression and forcing an emergency landing.In February, a United 737 MAX 8 reported its rudder pedals stuck during landing.In March, a Boeing 777-200 lost a tire shortly after takeoff, and there was a fuel leak on a United 777-300.In April, the FAA investigated Boeing after the company admitted that it may have missed some inspections of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.LOS ANGELES - The KP.3.1.1 COVID-19 variant, now the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant circulating in the United States, has been causing increasing infections in the country, the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed.KP.3.1.1, of the Omicron family, is among many currently co-circulating JN.1-derived variants in the United States.For the two-week period ending Aug 17, KP.3.1.1 is predicted to account for between 31 percent and 43 percent of COVID-19 clinical specimens, compared to between 20 percent and 26 percent for the two-week period ending Aug 3, according to the CDC data released on Monday.The rise in prevalence of KP.3.1.1 comes as markers of COVID-19 activity, including test positivity, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, remain elevated, particularly among adults ages 65 years and older and children younger than 2 years.CDC recommends that the public get COVID-19 vaccines to protect against serious illness from COVID-19. Updated COVID-19 vaccines that can provide protection during the 2024 to 2025 respiratory virus season will be available in the fall, according to the agency.China's recent retrieval of the first-ever samples from the far side of the moon has renewed talks about the possibilities of the United States and China joining in space-based research programs aimed at addressing global challenges, particularly climate change."The US and China each have very innovative space programs, and one area, for example, where the US and China could work together today would be space-based solar," Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, and founding director of the university's Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory, told China Daily.Space-based solar power, a concept involving the collection of solar energy in outer space via satellites and its distribution to Earth, has been gaining traction globally. As countries worldwide invest in research and development for the technology, international organizations are simultaneously pushing for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.The decreasing costs associated with launching materials into space have made the idea of deploying large solar panels — which beam power back to Earth using microwaves — increasingly feasible.Kammen suggested that the US and China could challenge each other to collaborate on making space-based solar a reality.'No nighttime'He emphasized the continuous nature of this energy source: "Space-based solar is on 24/7. There is no nighttime in space."Both nations already have made significant strides in this field. In the US, Caltech's space solar power prototype, launched into orbit last year, has successfully demonstrated its ability to wirelessly transmit power in space and beam detectable power to Earth for the first time.China, for its part, has achieved a milestone in its efforts to build a space solar power station in 2022. The China Academy of Space Technology has plans for a space high-voltage transfer and wireless power transmission experiment to be conducted in low Earth orbit by 2028, as outlined in its 2022 publication in the journal China Space Science and Technology.Drawing inspiration from popular culture, Kammen referred to the movie The Martian, in which a stranded US astronaut is rescued through a joint effort between the US and China. He saw the fictional scenario as an example of how the two nations could work together in reality, combining their respective technological strengths to achieve common goals."There's an opportunity to work peacefully together in space, to show that no matter who's going to be on the moon next, we have a chance to do clean energy in space as a bridge," said Kammen."That's an exciting opportunity," he said, and stressed the urgency of doing so. "We're going to need those breakthroughs because both the US and China are behind schedule to meet their climate goals."The US has aimed to cut emissions in half by 2030, and the Chinese goal is to realize carbon neutrality before 2060.The increase in extreme weather events in recent years highlights the urgency for the world to tackle climate change together, Wang Zhen, a research professor of international politics at the Institute of International Relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told China Daily.China and the US, the two largest economies in the world, have great potential for cooperation, particularly in areas of climate change and clean energy, Wang said.China is a pioneer in clean energy development in terms of solar power and electric vehicles, while the US holds strengths in software development and artificial intelligence, reflecting strong complementarity, he said."Cooperation between the US and China will strengthen both countries and benefit the world," Wang said.CHICAGO - The 2024 Democratic National Convention (DNC) kicked off at the United Center in Chicago, the US state of Illinois on Monday, as thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched near the venue to express their dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The convention, where Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination, is scheduled for Aug 19-22. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will formally accept the party's vice presidential nomination.Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in a neighborhood park to voice their discontent and anger toward the Biden administration's Israel policy, as the Palestinian death toll from Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has surpassed 40,000 since the outbreak of the current conflict on Oct 7, 2023.Chicago police said that arrests were made but didn't specify the number.On the opening day of the DNC, both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and United Auto Workers president Sean Fain gave prime-time speeches.President Joe Biden, greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of delegates, delivered a nearly hourlong keynote speech in which he highlighted his accomplishments since taking office, lashed out at former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and urged voters to support Harris in her bid for the White House."She's tough, she's experienced and she has enormous integrity," Biden continued. "Her story represents the best American story. And like many of our best presidents, she was also vice president," Biden said.As Biden concluded his speech, he was joined on stage by his family, including Jill Biden, as well as Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff.As Democrats gathered for the convention, Trump took to social media to criticize his opponent."Kamala Harris can't answer how she'd pay for any of her new liberal spending schemes that will bankrupt our country!" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Harris unveiled a sweeping economic agenda on Friday, which includes measures to cut taxes for the middle class, reduce grocery costs, take on price gouging, and lower the costs of owning and renting a home, among others.In the key swing states that could decide the results of the election, the race between the two remains tight.According to the latest poll data compiled by Real Clear Politics, Harris leads Trump by 1.0 percentage points in Wisconsin and by 2.0 percentage points in Michigan. In Pennsylvania, Harris trails by 0.2 percentage points. NEW YORK -- Former US Representative George Santos, who was expelled from Congress last year, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft on Monday.The guilty plea came just weeks before the New York Republican was set to stand trial on 23 federal felony counts, including allegations of fraud related to COVID-19 unemployment benefits, misusing campaign funds and lying about his personal finances on House disclosure reports."I betrayed the trust of my constituents and supporters. I deeply regret my conduct," Santos said at a Long Island courtroom in New York.The former congressman's sentencing hearing is set for Feb 7, 2025.Santos, 36, faces more than six years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines and owes at least $370,000 in restitution, according to The Associated Press.In December 2023, the US House of Representatives voted 311-114 to expel Santos from Congress over his lies, scandals and alleged campaign finance crimes.Many Chinese students and tech professionals are increasingly expressing their alarm via social media about being harassed in what they described as a "small dark room" at the secondary inspection areas of US immigration and border authorities.The trend has sparked heightened concerns among international students about traveling to the United States, in turn fueling calls for the US to halt the revocation of legally obtained visas and stemming the disruption to people-to-people exchanges.Watch the video for more details.At one of the main entrances on the southern end of Central Park across from West 59th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, a police poster stapled to a pole reads:"UP TO $3,500 REWARD FOR INFORMATION REGARDING A ROBBERY." It shows photos of the alleged robbers around 10:25 pm inside the park near East 62nd Street.The poster says the "perpetrators" robbed a man at knifepoint on Aug 1 there and later used his credit cards.Early Sunday morning, some 30 feet from the poster was a long "Police Command" vehicle with blinking red lights. An officer knocked on its door to get in. All 14 police vans lined up in front, behind and next to the command post were empty."Too early for police and for the robbers," Mohammed, a pedicab driver who said he was from "somewhere in West Africa'' and has worked for nine years in the park, told China Daily. "They will be back tonight, but they won't stay long. It's all for the public — especially tourists — to see."In the two weeks since that Aug 1 robbery listed on the poster, police said there have been at least 10 other robberies inside or near the park's south end. Central Park is the city's most visited tourist site, with an estimated 42 million visitors annually, according to the private, nonprofit Nature Conservancy, which oversees maintenance of the park."This is a migrant robbery pattern," Chief of Patrol John Chell told reporters on Aug 14, from where those police vehicles were parked Sunday."We believe these groups are responsible for most, if not all, of them," he said. Chell said they work in groups of eight and 12, as well as in pairs of two.Where Chell spoke that day was a sea of blue as the NYPD showed how officers will be deployed to counter the spate of robberies — on foot, scooters, bicycles, horseback and in patrol cars.Up to 100 additional police officers will be in the park at all hours for an indefinite period, according to officials, who said the increased police presence will be most noticeable from 7 pm to midnight.About 135 officers currently work in the Central Park Precinct. The additional officers are being pulled from various police units."There's no secret being kept here," Chell said. "Crime is up in this park."Police statistics show crime has spiked dramatically this year compared with the same period last year. At least 30 robberies have been reported in Central Park this year, compared with just 10 during the same period in 2023, the ABC News affiliate reported.There also have been 10 felony assaults this year compared with seven last year, according to police data.The area of the park where the recent spate of robberies has occurred runs from Columbus Circle on the southwest to around The Plaza Hotel and Grand Army Plaza on the southeast side, areas teeming with tourists.Most of the victims have been tourists, police said. No one has been hurt during the robberies.Jen, who declined to give her last name, said she recently arrived from China for a short visit and had been warned about potential violence in the city before visiting but said, "I wanted to come anyway."It's daytime, the park is beautiful and safe now with all the runners and walkers. But I would never be here at night," she said.She was with her friend Liu, who said he also was from China, has worked in the city for more than 10 years in technology, and lives in downtown Manhattan."News reports didn't say whether the robbery victims included Asians, but that doesn't matter, because there's already enough hate crime against Asians in the city," he said.Starting at month's end, drones will be used to cover the park, officials said. They said the drones can respond to incidents in less than one minute and track suspects until police arrive."We're not going to tolerate crimes at one of the most iconic locations in the world," said Tarik Sheppard, deputy police commissioner of public information.Agencies contributed to this story.Decades of agricultural cooperation between China and Uruguay have greatly benefited Uruguayan farmers, with a strong desire to further this partnership into technological innovation, a Uruguayan agricultural expert says.Miguel Sierra, manager of innovation and communication at the National Agricultural Research Institute of Uruguay, recently concluded a 21-day visit to China. Reflecting on the trip, he stressed China's advanced status in scientific and technological innovation."In Uruguay, I work on agricultural cooperation projects with China, and my recent visit has reinforced my belief that China is at the first world level of scientific and technological innovation," he said."I visited various institutions showcasing cutting-edge research. Having visited many countries and being a member of numerous agricultural research networks in Latin America, I can confidently say that China's advancements are impressive."Sierra stressed China's technological prowess, such as using digital technology to monitor animal health. "These technological applications can be incredibly practical for commercial use," he said.While China already has high scientific capabilities, its current challenge is to integrate this capacity with the economy to generate greater economic returns, he said. "China has made strides here, with many institutions employing technological brokers to bridge the gap between research and the innovation sector."Building connections between science and the economy is crucial, Sierra said, expressing hope that Uruguay can learn from China's practices.Top export marketSierra said China and Uruguay have a long history of agricultural collaboration, starting with a 1993 agreement. Since 2013, China has become Uruguay's top export market, particularly for beef and soybeans."There are tens of thousands of farmers in Uruguay who depend on beef and soybean sales. When business opportunities in China arise, these farmers can earn more, bringing positive impacts to local society," he said.From a commercial perspective, the bilateral collaboration is strong, but there is room for improvement in science, technology and innovation. "Successive Uruguayan governments over the last 15 years have prioritized the development of a long-term agricultural collaboration strategy with China," Sierra said."Uruguay has strong scientific capabilities in life sciences but needs to generate more value and connect science with innovation and the global market. In this process, China is an ideal partner. For China, Uruguay offers a test platform for its scientific and technological innovation and a gateway to Mercosur (the Southern Common Market)."SANTO DOMINGO -- At the invitation of President of the Dominican Republic Luis Abinader, Chinese President Xi Jinping's Special Envoy and Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong attended Abinader's second-term inauguration here on Friday.Abinader met with Jin at the National Palace on Thursday.Jin conveyed cordial greetings and best wishes from President Xi to Abinader and congratulated him on his re-election as president of the Dominican Republic.He said since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries six years ago, the bilateral relations have achieved comprehensive and rapid development.China is willing to work with the Dominican Republic to continue to firmly support each other, enhance practical cooperation, promote cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, and push the bilateral relations to achieve more results, so as to better benefit the people of both sides, Jin said.He also elaborated on the guiding principles of the third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee to Abinader.For his part, Abinader asked Jin to convey his sincere greetings and best wishes to President Xi and expressed his heartfelt gratitude to President Xi for sending a special envoy to attend the inauguration ceremony of his new term.Abinader said that developing relations with China is of special importance to the Dominican Republic, and he looks forward to further deepening mutually beneficial cooperation with China in various fields and pushing for greater development of bilateral relations.Columbia University President Minouche Shafik has resigned after a brief tenure following criticisms over how she handled a series of raucous pro-Palestinian student protests on the Ivy League school's campus.Shafik's resignation on Wednesday came a few months after students created a makeshift tent community in mid-April on the Manhattan campus in solidarity with the people of Gaza over the Israel-Palestine conflict.When the tents were removed by police officers, the students returned the next day, setting off a wave of similar protests at universities nationwide.Shafik's surprise resignation letter sent by email to the Columbia community cited the ill effects of the protests and discord around it. She wrote that while the campus had made progress, it was "difficult to overcome divergent views across our community"."This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in the community. Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead," she wrote.Columbia's Board of Trustees announced that the new interim president will be Katrina Armstrong, a medical doctor who has been the CEO of Columbia's medical center and dean of its medical school since 2022."Challenging times present both the opportunity and the responsibility for serious leadership to emerge from every group and individual within a community," Armstrong said in a statement. "As I step into this role, I am acutely aware of the trials the University has faced over the past year."Shafik, who was appointed in July last year, was the first female leader of the school. Her tenure was one of the shortest in the school's 270-year history.She is the third leader of an Ivy League university to step down in eight months following highly charged testimonies at a congressional hearing on campus antisemitism. All were criticized by Republican lawmakers.After the testimonies, the University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill resigned in December. A month later, Harvard University President Claudine Gay resigned.Nationwide campus demonstrations began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct 7, killing more than 1,100 people.Israel's devastating retaliatory offensive has killed 40,005 Palestinians, Gaza's Health Ministry said on Thursday.Pro-Palestinian demonstrators called on the schools to cut financial ties with Israel and any companies that supported the Israeli fighting.Amid the protests, Shafik had denounced antisemitism on campus, but was criticized for not doing enough to reprimand some faculty members and students.A new round of college protests is expected in the fall, according to Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the main protest movement.belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.comScores of legal organizations and hundreds of lawyers from around the world have told US President Joe Biden that broad economic sanctions imposed by the United States amount to collective punishment and violate international law, and that it should end.In a letter addressed to Biden, the signers called for the US to "comply with the international law by ending the use of broad, unilateral coercive measures that extensively harm civilian populations".The letter said the unilateral application of certain economic sanctions by Washington constitutes collective punishment, "which is considered a war crime" and prohibited by the Geneva Conventions.Collective punishment has become a standard practice of US foreign policy through sanctions, and the US imposes them more than any other country, the letter said.While the use of sanctions is different from conventional warfare, "its collective impact on civilians can be just as indiscriminate, punitive, and deadly", the signatories said.Hundreds of millions of people currently live under the sanctions, and notable cases include Cuba, Iran, Syria and Venezuela.The sanctions "can spark and prolong economic crisis, hinder access to essential goods like food, fuel and medicine, and increase poverty, hunger, disease and even death rates, especially among the children", the letter said.Civilian suffering is not merely an incidental cost of sanction policies, but it is also the intent, the letter said. It cited comments by Mike Pompeo, former US secretary of state, about the effectiveness of the Donald Trump administration's sanctions against Iran. He said: "Things are much worse for the Iranian people, and we're convinced that will lead the Iranian people to rise up and change the behavior of the regime."US officials are aware that sanctions cause suffering.Conditions induced by sanctions often drive mass migration, as in Cuba and Venezuela recently.Human rights groups have said that more than 7 million people — about 25 percent of Venezuela's population — have fled the South American country in the past decade.The letter echoes a recent report by Michael Fakhri, a United Nations special rapporteur, who spent two weeks in Venezuela to assess the situation.Economic crisis"I saw firsthand how unilateral coercive measures in the form of economic sanctions have constrained the government's fiscal ability to implement their social protection programs and deliver basic public services," Fakhri wrote in his report.Nearly 82 percent of Venezuelans live in poverty based on income levels, and 53 percent are exposed to extreme poverty, with insufficient income to purchase a basic food basket.Fakhri also recommended lifting sanctions on Venezuela."The United States does not consider itself to be at war with these states that it's imposing sanctions on, and nevertheless is doing things that have effects that states have outlawed even in the context of war," Ntina Tzouvala, associate professor at the Australian National University College of Law, told Bloomberg.She said the US government's increased targeting of financial transactions and aggressive prosecutions by the Justice Department "creates a culture of overcompliance from private actors".Agencies contributed to this story.Scientists of Chinese descent in the United States have been leaving the country because of "pull factors" from China and the "push factor" of the China Initiative of 2018, according to a major research study published in an American scientific journal.The trend suggests a reverse brain drain, and the data used for the analysis is extensive.The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used Microsoft Academic Graph to analyze trends in the migration of US-based Chinese scientists between 2010 and 2021.The database tracks more than 200 million scientists from over 25,000 institutions worldwide.Also, a brief on the study, published in July by the Stanford Center on China's Economy and Institutions, concluded that the discontinued China Initiative "provided scientists of Chinese descent in the US with higher incentives to leave and lower incentives to apply for federal grants".The purported objective of the China Initiative — launched by the Justice Department under the Trump administration and halted in 2022 under the Biden administration — was to reduce economic espionage.The study identified the working countries of researchers through their academic affiliations in publications and tracked those with Chinese surnames who initially published in the US but later changed their affiliations to institutions abroad.The study identified 19,955 scientists of Chinese descent who began their careers in the US but left for other countries, including China, between 2010 and 2021.The researchers said that contributing to the trend were "pull factors" from China, including the country's large and rapidly growing investments in science, high social prestige, and attractive financial rewards connected to positions in Chinese institutions.But the analysis also showed a "push factor" in the US. Following the implementation of the China Initiative, departures of US-based, China-born scientists increased by 75 percent, the study found.The data showed that as of 2021, of those leaving the US, the percentage of scientists moving back to China increased to 67 percent, up from 48 percent in 2010. The life sciences field witnessed the most significant exodus abroad, with more than 1,000 life scientists leaving in 2021.The researchers also conducted an online survey of 1,304 US-based scientists of Chinese descent between December 2021 and March 2022 to find out why more were leaving.The survey results revealed the chilling effects of the China Initiative. About 35 percent of Chinese scientists in the US said that they felt unwelcome; 72 percent didn't feel safe as academic researchers; 42 percent were fearful of conducting research; and 65 percent were worried about collaborations with China.Of the five possible reasons for "not feeling safe as an academic researcher in the US", the foremost reason cited by the respondents-67 percent of them — was fear of "US government investigations into Chinese-origin researchers".About 45 percent of respondents said that they now avoid federal research grants, and 61 percent said that they had considered leaving the US.MIT professor Gang Chen, who had espionage charges slapped on him under the China Initiative only for them to be dismissed in 2022, said publicly that after undergoing the lengthy legal process that damaged his reputation and forced many of his students to adjust their career paths, he was avoiding federally funded research out of fear.Students from China have been an important source of US-based scientists for more than two decades. The study said that in 2020, of all US doctoral degrees in science and engineering, 17 percent — roughly 5,800 of 34,000 — went to foreign students from China, and the vast majority of those had chosen to stay in the US in previous years."It's unfortunate that the China Initiative has turned out to be a government-sanctioned persecution of people of Chinese heritage," a STEM(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) professor in Houston who spoke on condition of anonymity told China Daily. "The federal government was wrong to prosecute people primarily based on race. It is not a surprise that such a practice has created fear in the community."An analysis by Race, Racism and the Law, a civil rights group, concluded that of the 148 defendants across 77 cases collected in the FBI database, 130-approximately 90 percent — were of Chinese heritage.Only 25 percent of them were convicted, and few of the convictions were related to espionage. The conviction rate was dramatically lower than the Justice Department's 91 percent overall conviction rate.In June, Marcia McNutt, the president of the National Academy of Sciences, said that while the US still spends the most money among any country on research and development, China is set to soon outpace those investments.An aviation expert has cited severe icing as a potential cause of the recent plane crash in Brazil, which is the world's deadliest aviation disaster since January last year, as bereaved families wait for answers on the tragedy.The aircraft, operated by Brazilian airline Voepass, crashed in a residential neighborhood on Aug 9, killing all 62 people.The ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop was en route from Cascavel in southern Brazil to Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo. According to the Brazilian Air Force, the pilots did not report any emergency or adverse weather conditions. The plane was flying normally at 1:21 pm when radar contact was lost at 1:22 pm, and it crashed about eight minutes later.While the cause of the crash has not yet been determined, aviation expert Daniel Calazans, head of the Professor Kalazans Institute in Brazil, which trains pilots, suggested that severe icing might be a factor."There was a weather forecast for severe icing along the route and at cruising altitude," Calazans said."If deicing devices are not used, this could cause deformation in the wings and control surfaces (aileron, elevators, flaps), leading to the aircraft losing lift and possibly crashing."If the aircraft surfaces were to freeze and parts of the aircraft were to be deformed, the pilot could lose complete control and might no longer be able to keep the plane in flight."Marcel Moura, chief operations officer of Voepass, said at a news briefing that the plane was sensitive to ice. While some ice had been anticipated, it was predicted to be within an acceptable range, he said.Calazans said a thorough analysis of the contributing factors is needed to determine if the accident could have been avoided. "It is still too early to determine this," he said, adding that the black boxes are expected to be investigated in about a year.Voepass officials are working with Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center to investigate the crash.Voepass CEO Eduardo Busch said the plane had two black boxes that store flight data. However, the boxes, which have not yet been recovered, might have sustained damage during the crash. Authorities are expected to issue a preliminary report on their investigation in 30 days.Identifying bodiesOver the weekend, more than 40 families of the victims traveled to Sao Paulo to identify the bodies.Apart from the aircraft's pilot and co-pilot, other crash victims included eight doctors, four college professors from Unioeste university in Cascavel, a 3-year-old child, a lawyer who specialized in cases against airlines, and a Venezuelan family and their dog.This was the world's worst plane crash since January last year, when 72 people onboard a Yeti Airlines plane in Nepal died after the aircraft stalled and crashed while making its landing approach. The Yeti plane was an ATR 72, similar to the one used in the Voepass flight, but an investigation had attributed the Nepal tragedy to pilot error.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.People in the United States haven't revved up their enthusiasm for electric vehicles despite plenty of dealerships nationwide offering steep discounts. Meanwhile, in China, EV sales are soaring.The drop in demand for EVs in the US comes after international automakers bet big and invested billions of dollars over the past few years in EV fleets.In 2023, EV sales grew nearly 50 percent, according to data from Motor Intelligence, a vehicle sales data provider in the US. In the first six months of this year, growth increased by just 6.8 percent as consumer interest waned.Richard, who declined to give his surname, is a buyer for Major World, a large auto dealership in Long Island City, Queens, New York, which sells new and used cars, EVs, trucks and SUVs.He told China Daily: "We bought a lot of EVs that go toward the taxi and limousine people, but most people don't come in looking for (EVs); they prefer other non-EV cars."EVs at the dealership range in price from $14,000 to $17,000 for a small Chevrolet Bolt model to $19,000 to $22,000 for larger 2022 and 2023 models. Newer EV models range in sticker price from $40,000 to $50,000.Richard believes consumers will respond to lower-priced EVs when the automobiles have a longer battery life."If you don't have that battery that will give you the distance, customers will be slow to buy."Consumer interest in buying EVs and hybrids is vastly different in China, where sales sped past internal-combustion-engine cars for the first time last month.About 51 percent of all vehicle sales in July consisted of EVs and hybrids, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.At least 878,000 EVs and hybrids were sold in July, an increase of 37 percent over the same period last year. Conventional car sales fell by 26 percent to 840,000, the association said.China exported 376,000 cars worldwide in July, up 20 percent on 2023, according to the car association.In May, US President Joe Biden's administration imposed 100 percent tariffs on EVs and batteries made in China. The tariffs essentially cut off the imports of Chinese cars.Political considerationWhile the White House has advocated for clean energy, there also is a political consideration of importing cheaper vehicles.In the US, besides the cost of EVs, battery concerns and the tariffs, which went into effect on Aug 1, there is a lack of charging stations.There were approximately 61,000 such stations in the US as of February, according to the Pew Research Center.California has 43,780 charging stations, the highest number of individual public charging ports, for the 1.2 million electric vehicles registered by the state's residents.Nationwide, rural areas have even fewer charging stations. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act gave tax credits to incentivize the installation of EV-charging stations outside urban areas.In contrast, China has invested heavily in EV infrastructure. By the end of June, the total number of charging piles in China reached 10.24 million units, according to the National Energy Administration.The falling demand for battery-powered cars and trucks has left US car dealers with too much stock as they get ready to roll out the new 2025 models this fall.In June, dealerships had on average 125 days of supply of EVs, according to figures from Cox Automotive; they usually have around 60 days. The dealers are also selling many EVs at a loss and offering finance deals.Agencies contributed to this story.NEW YORK -- Perchlorate, a chemical found in rocket fuel, has contaminated water and food and is more likely to be found in food given to babies and children, according to a study from Consumer Reports.The chemical is naturally occurring and man-made, but it is being found more often in groundwater, according to the Department of Toxic Substances Control.Most of the food found to be contaminated with perchlorate was children's food, like cereal and chicken nuggets, James Rogers, a trained food and water microbiologist and director of Food Safety Research and Testing at Consumer Reports, was quoted by USA Today on Thursday as elaborating on this topic.According to the study, which was released last week, researchers analyzed 196 samples of 63 supermarket products and 10 fast food items, and found that about 67 percent of the samples had measurable levels of perchlorate.The top three product categories had the highest levels of perchlorate are baby/kid food, fruits and vegetables, and fast food. And according to Rogers, as reported by USA today, beef burritos, chicken sandwiches and French fries are the top three particular foods that contained the highest concentration of perchlorate.The food tested did not contain dangerous levels of perchlorate, but Rogers said that there is no strict definition of what is considered to be a "dangerous level."Rogers said consuming unsafe levels of the chemical can negatively affect a person's thyroid. "Thyroid hormones affect metabolism, and having bad thyroid function could lead, in this case, to type 2 diabetes."Thyroid problems can lead to type 2 diabetes for adults, but children and fetuses can face complications with neurodevelopment, which "can result in a lowering of IQ of the children."Exposure to high levels of perchlorate can affect the thyroid in multiple ways, according to the FDA. It can interfere with iodide uptake into the thyroid gland, disrupt thyroid functions, and possibly lead to a reduction in thyroid hormone production. WASHINGTON - US Vice Presidential nominees - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Ohio Senator J.D. Vance - on Thursday agreed to participate in a debate hosted by CBS News, which is scheduled for Oct 1.The debate will be moderated by "CBS Evening News" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and "Face the Nation" moderator and CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan, according to the network.On Wednesday, the network announced that Walz agreed to the Oct. 1 date, after proposing four dates for a debate between the two vice presidential nominees."See you on October 1, JD," Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said Wednesday in a post on "X", formerly known as Twitter.Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, said in a post on "X" Thursday that he has agreed to the debate."Not only do I accept the CBS debate on October 1st, I accept the CNN debate on September 18th as well. I look forward to seeing you at both!" said Vance.Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, picked Vance as his running mate on July 15, the first day of the Republican National Convention held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris quickly consolidated support within the party and won enough delegates to become the Democratic nominee after a five-day online balloting process in early August.On Aug. 6, Harris announced that she selected Walz as her running mate. On the same day, the two kicked off a five-day campaign tour in key swing states including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada.Last week, ABC announced that Trump and Harris agreed to a presidential debate to be hosted by the network on Sept. 10, setting up the first confrontation between the new opponents on stage prior to the November election.LOS ANGELES - Democratic lawmakers from the western US state of California are urging the Biden administration to halt its reported plans of imposing new restrictions on technology exports to China, arguing that a further round of controls "could send longstanding US companies into a death spiral," Reuters reported on Wednesday.According to the report, US Democratic lawmakers from California, the largest economy in the United States, said that "unilateral curbs benefit foreign rivals at the expense of US businesses.""We ask that you pause additional unilateral export controls until you have adequately justified that such controls will not damage US competitiveness in advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment," Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Zoe Lofgren were quoted as saying in a letter addressed to Alan Estevez, who oversees export controls at the US Commerce Department.In the letter, the lawmakers noted that US allies have not imposed similarly aggressive China export curbs on their own companies."The letter is a sign of growing pushback against Biden's semiconductor policy among Democrats from California, home to the US' top chipmaking equipment companies LAM, Applied Materials, and KLA," said the report.The Netherlands and Japan, home to chipmaking equipment producers ASML and Tokyo Electron, respectively, have also imposed restrictions on equipment exports to China, although they have not gone as far as implementing some of the strictest measures imposed by the United States, it added.NEW YORK - Columbia University President Minouche Shafik announced her resignation Wednesday amid continuous tensions arising over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Shafik's resignation took effect on Wednesday and Katrina Armstrong, CEO of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, will serve as interim president.It has been a period of turmoil where it has been difficult to overcome divergent views across the Columbia University community and "this period has taken a considerable toll on my family," said Shafik in her announcement.Shafik has been under pressure in recent months as her handling of the encampment at Columbia University drew criticism on and off campus.Together with three other officials from the university, Shafik testified before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on antisemitism on campus in April.Columbia University started to restrict campus access starting from Monday, only allowing Columbia-affiliated persons to visit its campus.As a British-American academic and economist, Shafik started to serve as the 20th president of Columbia University in July 2023.Following her counterparts at Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania, Shafik is the third president of an Ivy League university to step down in the wake of campus protests over Gaza.Shafik is expected to chair a review of the British government's approach to international development and how to improve capability, according to her announcement.NEW YORK - Paramount Global is restructuring its TV-production business as part of a cost-cutting effort and what the company said were significant changes in the TV and streaming marketplaces.Paramount on Tuesday said that Paramount Television Studios was shutting down at the end of the week, and that its sister TV unit -- CBS Studios -- would absorb the production of Paramount shows as a result of the move. CBS Studios produces content for the CBS network, Paramount+ and other platforms."For decades, Paramount has been one of the pre-eminent producers of television shows," said The Wall Street Journal in its report about the move. Paramount Television Studios recently produced several hits for streaming services including "13 Reasons Why" for Netflix, "Reacher" for Amazon Prime Video and "Defending Jacob" for Apple TV+."Over the past several years, however, the studio has shrunk in size and status -- a victim of industry consolidation and challenges facing its parent company," noted The Journal.The move is part of a shake-up at Paramount Global that will result in about 15 percent of its US workforce being eliminated, or a cut of approximately 2,000 jobs. Paramount Global parent National Amusements is in the process of being acquired by Skydance Media in a complex deal that would result in the combination of Paramount and Skydance.In a memo to staff, Paramount Global Co-Chief Executive George Cheeks said the decision isn't based on the performance of the studio, but rather is "the result of significant changes in the TV and streaming marketplace and the need to streamline our company."China's envoy to the United Nations on Tuesday "strongly condemned" Israel's attack on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza City.Three Israeli rockets struck the Al-Taba'een School on Saturday, where many displaced Palestinians were seeking shelter and participating in dawn prayers. More than 100 Palestinians were killed, and dozens were injured in the assault, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said.Israel said it targeted the school because Hamas fighters were sheltering there."China strongly condemns the assault," Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the UN, told a Security Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the attack."Civilians and civilian infrastructure should never be targets of military action — this is a red line defined by international humanitarian law. The repeated attacks on schools, where large numbers of civilians seek refuge, are appalling," said Fu.He said that over the past 10 months, millions of people in Gaza have had their homes destroyed, and families have been torn apart, forcing them to move from place to place in search of safety, only to face bombings and the constant threat of death."There is no longer any safe haven in Gaza," Fu said.Three schools in Gaza City were hit within 48 hours between Aug 3 and 4 and two schools hit on Aug 8, with Al-Taba'een on Saturday the latest such attack, according to Lisa Doughten, director of the Financing and Partnerships Division at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.At least 21 schools in Gaza, all serving as shelters, have been attacked, resulting in at least 274 fatalities, according to the UN Human Rights Office. Saturday's strike was one of the deadliest on a school sheltering displaced people since the conflict began, said Doughten.Fu urged the US to push Israel to halt its military operations in Gaza as Israel's "largest arms supplier"."An immediate and lasting cease-fire is the urgent hope of the people of Gaza and a strong consensus within the international community," he said, noting that the council two months ago passed its first cease-fire resolution, and the US said that Israel had accepted a cease-fire agreement."But the reality is quite the opposite. We have seen no credible signs of Israel committing to a cease-fire; instead, there is an escalation in military actions and rising civilian casualties," Fu said."We urge the US to act with sincerity and responsibility, pushing Israel to halt its military operations in Gaza and end the killing of civilians as soon as possible," he said.Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich last week said it might be "justified and moral" to starve 2 million people in Gaza in order to free Israeli hostages.Fu condemned the statement, calling it "horrifying" and "entirely unacceptable". "Hunger should never be used as a weapon; humanitarian issues should not be politicized; and civilian lives should not be bargaining chips," he said.He then urged Israel to fulfill "its international humanitarian obligations, open all border crossings, and ensure the rapid, large-scale, and safe delivery of humanitarian aid".Separately, last week, Israeli surveillance footage reportedly showed Israeli soldiers sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee inside the Sde Teiman prison.Fu said China is "seriously concerned" about the incident and called for an investigation and accountability."China urges Israel to immediately halt all settlement activities, effectively curb the escalating settler violence, and stop undermining the foundation of the two-state solution," Fu continued.He reiterated that the two-state solution "is the only viable path to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. China supports the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and advocates for convening a larger, more authoritative and more effective international conference," he said.UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Monday also condemned the school attacks in Gaza."The Secretary-General condemns the continued loss of life in Gaza, including women and children, as we witness yet another devastating strike by Israel on the Al-Taba'een school in Gaza City, sheltering hundreds of displaced Palestinians families, with scores of fatalities, amidst continued horror, displacement, and suffering in Gaza," said UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq.Violence in Gaza has killed almost 40,000 Palestinians and injured more than 90,000 others, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.Starbucks, which has struggled this year in its two largest coffee markets — the US and China — on Tuesday ousted its CEO, responding to pressure from an activist investor and its longtime former boss.The Seattle-based company, the world's largest coffee chain, named Brian Niccol, the CEO at Chipotle Mexican Grill since 2018, as its new chairman and CEO, to replace Laxman Narasimhan, effective Sept 9. Niccol will become the fourth Starbucks CEO in four and a half years."[Niccol] has my respect and full support," said Howard Schultz, who has become the company's biggest independent shareholder during his three stints as its leader, in a press release issued by Starbucks.Narasimhan was removed after approximately 16 months in the job. Starbucks had hired him from Reckitt, a UK-based consumer products company. He was the first external leader of the modern iteration of Starbucks and was personally chosen as the successor to Schultz, who transformed the company from a local coffee chain into a global icon. But during Narasimhan's short time as CEO, Starbucks in 2020 had its first decline in comparable store sales by more than 20 percent.With the leadership change, Starbucks' shares surged 24.5 percent, positioning the company for a record one-day percentage gain, while Chipotle shares fell by about 7.5 percent in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday.Starbucks has more than $36 billion in annual revenue and 38,000 stores across more than 80 countries.Chipotle has reported $10 billion in annual revenue at its 3,500 restaurants, largely in the United States.The Financial Times reported Tuesday that Starbucks' board made the decision to oust Narasimhan after its management strategy came under attack from activist investor Elliott Management, which controls a sizable minority stake.Elliott had been holding talks with the chain over a number of demands, including board representation, the FT reported. The 70-year-old Schultz, who built Starbucks into a global brand, privately expressed his opposition to a settlement with Elliott, according to the FT.In a statement, Elliott said it viewed the management change "as a transformational step forward for the company''.In April, Starbucks reduced its financial outlook for the second time this year due to a slowdown in cafe traffic, which affected sales and profits.In China, Starbucks' second-largest market by sales, the competition has become increasingly tougher in recent years.Under Narasimhan's tenure, Starbucks intended to accelerate drink-making and open thousands of additional locations in China as part of its "reinvention" strategy. The plan, initially developed by Schultz, emphasized increased automation and aggressive expansion.Starbucks has been working to establish a first-mover advantage in China since opening its first café in the country in 1999. Under Schultz's expansion plan, the company branched out from major cities into smaller ones, opening hundreds of new stores each year.Schultz spoke about his travels to China to promote the company and to help connect the US and China through shared values.But he also wrote in a LinkedIn post in May that Starbucks should start by improving its operations, which were "the primary reason for the company's fall from grace''. "The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience, through the eyes of a merchant. The answer does not lie in data, but in the stores," he wrote.In China, Starbucks faces increasing competition from Luckin Coffee, which has gradually occupied the country's coffee market with fast mobility services and innovative coffee-making.Luckin Coffee, which was founded in Beijing in 2017 and is now headquartered in Xiamen, East China's Fujian province, has surpassed Starbucks by sales and number of stores, according to its earnings reports in 2023.Luckin has focused its strategy on its mobile app and integrated delivery services from the beginning, a model that Starbucks later adopted for its Chinese operations.Luckin operates approximately 13,300 stores, nearly double Starbucks' 6,800 locations in China. To drive its growth, Luckin has leveraged rapid-delivery services, mobile-payment options and unique offerings like a cheese-flavored latte, which has resonated well with Chinese consumers. The company also has previously promoted a coffee infused with Maotai, a famous maker of baijiu liquor in China.Niccol will need to devise Starbucks' next strategy in China. At Chipotle, he has helped more than double sales from 2018 to 2023 by implementing new safety protocols, modernizing the chain's ordering systems, introducing new ingredients and opening new locations.Niccol is "a hall of fame restaurant CEO" who will use his savvy marketing lessons from Chipotle to "create brand buzz" at Starbucks, TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a research note, according to Axios. "He appreciates what makes a premium brand special."Deutsche Bank analyst Lauren Silberman cut her price target on Starbucks from $115 to $108 per share, while affirming a buy rating. "We believe efforts focused on innovation, targeted promotions and marketing should start to drive improving SSS (same-store sales)," she said.Silberman told TheStreet.com, a financial news website, that Starbucks launched Spicy Refreshers on April 16 and will launch Summer-Berry Refreshers on May 7, "both unique platforms that should resonate with younger consumers and in the afternoon".Agencies contributed to this story.Chinese autonomous driving company WeRide is looking for its shares to take a ride on the Nasdaq.WeRide, based in Guangzhou in South China's Guangdong province, plans to offer 6.45 million American depositary shares, or ADS, at a price range of $15.50 to $18.50 in its upcoming initial public offering, according to a filing by the company late on Friday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.The main underwriters of the offering are Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and China International Capital Corporation, a multinational investment management and financial services company based in Beijing.WeRide was founded in 2017 by Tony Han, who is also chairman and CEO. The company plans to trade under the symbol WRD on Nasdaq.The company reported its last year revenue of 401.8 million yuan ($55.3 million). For the first six months of this year, it had a revenue of 150.3 million yuan, according to the filing.It will be the largest IPO by a Chinese company on the US stock market since Zeekr, a luxury EV startup owned by Geely, began selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange in May, TechCrunch reported.WeRide also may have to contend with a US Commerce Department proposal that could bar Chinese software in autonomous and connected vehicles, Reuters reported last Monday, citing sources briefed on the matter.President Joe Biden's administration plans to issue a rule that would bar Chinese software in vehicles in the United States with Level 3 automation and above, which would in effect ban testing of autonomous vehicles produced by Chinese companies on US roads.WeRide generates most of its revenue from sales of its Level 4 autonomous driving vehicles "primarily including robobuses, robotaxis and robosweepers, and related sensor suites; and … the provision of L4 autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) services, including the provision of L4 operational and technical support services as well as ADAS research and development services", the SEC filing said.The White House also will propose barring vehicles with Chinese-developed advanced wireless communications abilities modules from US roads, sources told Reuters.Under the proposal, automakers and suppliers would need to verify that none of their connected vehicles or advanced autonomous vehicle software was developed in a "foreign entity of concern".A Commerce Department spokesperson said on Aug 4 that the department "is concerned about the national security risks associated with" such vehicles.In response, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said electric vehicles are a globalized industry."Only division of labor and cooperation can bring mutual benefits, and only fair competition can bring technological progress," the spokesperson said. "China urges the US to earnestly abide by market principles and international trade rules, and create a level playing field for companies from all countries. China will firmly defend its lawful rights and interests."Agencies contributed to this story.Data showing the national debt of the United States at a record high of $35 trillion and an unemployment rate that is surging have sparked worries about the health of the US economy. Experts said the large federal debt reflects inadequate policy responses and failure of governance, and carries wide ramifications for the world.The gross federal debt of the US surpassed $35 trillion at the end of July, Treasury Department data showed. This translates into a per capita debt of $104,000, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that focuses on addressing long-term fiscal challenges in the US.Chen Weidong, general manager of the Research Institute of the Bank of China, said the large US federal debt is the result of the continued accumulation of fiscal imbalances. Government spending has been rising rapidly to support social security and the economy, he said, noting that military spending has climbed, particularly after the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The gross national debt grew rapidly from $20 trillion in September 2017 to $30 trillion in early 2022 to $34 trillion in late 2023.According to Tian Lihui, dean of the Institute of Finance and Development at Nankai University, during the pandemic, the US government adopted large-scale fiscal stimulus measures and purchased securities from the market to boost liquidity, leading to soaring federal debt.In addition, US debts are globally deemed as a safe haven, which allows the US government to borrow more money at a lower cost, Tian said."The high debt level can cause significant problems if economic conditions worsen," Ke Jing, associate research professor at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of International Relations, said.The record debt figures were revealed as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics said in early August that unemployment rate had risen to 4.3 percent, the highest since October 2021, beating the projection of 4.1 percent. The nonfarm payrolls — a key employment index — increased only by 114,000 in July, a slowing from 179,000 jobs added in June.Financial news site MarketWatch reported that a closely tracked recession indicator, the Sahm rule, had been triggered. The rule says a recession is imminent when the unemployment rate, based on a three-month average, is half a percentage point above its lowest point over the previous 12 months.Economists from the Goldman Sachs Group have hiked the probability of a US recession in the next year to 25 percent from 15 percent, Bloomberg reported.Worries about an imminent recession in the US have led to stock price fluctuations in major stock markets around the world.The situation has prompted further speculations on whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.The Fed kept its benchmark policy interest rate unchanged in July at a two-decade high of 5.25 to 5.50 percent. The budget office predicts annual interest costs will rise to $1.7 trillion in 2034 from $892 billion this year, the New York Times reported."The interest spending is too high for the government to sustain," Ke from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of International Relations said.With high interest rates, the US national debt will continue to soar. This would increase borrowing costs for businesses, discouraging investment and consumption, Ke added.Chen of the Research Institute of the Bank of China said the Fed is likely to initiate a rate cut in September and perhaps another in the fourth quarter to better balance inflation and economic growth.The consumer price index rose 3 percent in June from a year earlier, according to the US Labor Department, below the 3.1 percent market expectation."There is not necessarily a need to cut interest rates at the moment, but the Fed might lower its rate to influence the financial market and balance politics," Tian of the Institute of Finance and Development at Nankai University said.Rating agency Moody's in November lowered its outlook on the US credit rating to "negative" from "stable", citing large fiscal deficits and a decline in debt affordability, several months after Fitch downgraded US credit rating to AA+ from AAA."There is a contradiction between the escalating US debt and its role as a global safe asset," Chen said. On one hand, to strengthen its reserve asset status, the US must continually increase fiscal deficits to produce these safe assets. On the other hand, expanding fiscal deficits heighten the risk of default, which undermines its status as "safe assets", he added.The US abuse of financial sanctions due to dollar hegemony and the high national debt are eroding the credibility of the dollar, diminishing international investors' confidence, Chen said.Tian attributed the downgrades to governance failure and the shortsightedness of bipartisan politics.Despite the considerable amount of federal debt, it is not getting much attention from the contenders for the White House, US media reported."National debt primarily functions as a financial tool rather than being shouldered directly by households, making it less of a focus for US voters," Tian said."Hardly can both parties find a solution as debt is not a problem that can be fixed in one or two administrations," Ke said. It is an "elephant in the room" as the two parties diverge on how to reduce debt, she added.According to her, the US political system, with its frequent changes in administration, makes it challenging to maintain a consistent long-term goal.Chen said to effectively address the debt problem, the US government could either raise taxes or cut social welfare spending. However, higher taxes might dampen business sentiments, while cutting welfare could result in social discontent, making both options difficult to implement.Tian warned of the potential risks brought by the surge in national debt as it could push up borrowing costs and increase risks to global financial stability, putting pressure on the economic growth of developing countries.If the US debt problem leads to a global reassessment of the dollar's status, it could profoundly impact the international trade system that relies on the dollar, Ke added.NEW YORK -- An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.0 jolted Southern California at 19:20:24 GMT on Monday, the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences said.The epicenter, with a depth of 10.0 km, was initially determined to be at 33.91 degrees north latitude and 118.30 degrees west longitude.United by musical instruments and shared melodies, over 700 young musicians from around the world participated in the World Orchestra Week in New York from Aug 1 to 7.Over seven consecutive days in Carnegie Hall, youth orchestras took turns performing on stage, collaborating with top conductors and soloists.Five youth orchestras from Africa, Asia, Europe and South America collaborated with US orchestras in New York City. Participants included the National Children's Symphony of Venezuela, Beijing Youth Orchestra and the National Youth Orchestra of the USA, or NYO-USA."Everyone is here for one thing, music. Hearing each other's pieces and stuff will definitely bring us closer," Jeremiah La Fayette, an 18-year-old from Tampa, Florida, who plays the viola in the NYOUSA, told China Daily."Since this is the place where I live, and people are coming from across the world, I'd like to help as much as possible to make them feel comfortable and make them new friends over here."Sydney Richardson, 17, from East Texas, told China Daily that even though there are some language barriers with friends from other countries, they still can read different lines of other orchestra's pieces and play music together."Music is the language of the world, and it's the only thing that no matter where you're from, you will understand the notes and staff, the rhythm and everything," she said.Richardson said she received a bookmark with a little panda on it from her new Chinese friends.Liu Fenghe, an 18-year-old cello player from Beijing, told China Daily that it was fun to discuss music with US musicians."Music and culture are closely linked. On the pentatonic scale, Chinese music places more emphasis on melody, while Western music, with its triadic harmonies, focuses more on the interplay between different parts. This is why we can observe both the similarities and differences in music brought about by culture," he said.The Beijing Youth Orchestra made its debut performance in the United States on Aug 4 at Carnegie Hall. The orchestra, established on June 23, is made up of 130 young musicians from schools such as the Central Conservatory of Music.They performed selections of masterpieces from both Chinese and Western music, such as Bao Yuankai's Chinese Sights and Sounds, Zhao Jiping's Pipa Concerto No 2 and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No 5 in E minor."For me, it was quite a challenge," Jin Zhicheng, a horn player of the Beijing Youth Orchestra, told China Daily. "Our orchestra was just established, and it was my first time performing such large pieces. Seeing the reaction from the New York audience gave me a great sense of accomplishment."Traditional instrument"I think the audience here is incredibly enthusiastic. I felt especially proud when I introduced the traditional Chinese instrument, the pipa, before the performance," Wang Fucan, 17, principal cellist of the Beijing Youth Orchestra, told China Daily.He explained to the audience the sounds of the pipa and its connection to the Silk Road."On the first day the orchestra was established, I told the students that we must showcase our passion for music, art and life," Lyu Jia, conductor of the Beijing Youth Orchestra, told China Daily."Through music, they gained a profound spiritual experience and felt the charm of both Chinese and Western cultures, confidently performing on a world-renowned stage. I believe this experience will be life-changing and incredibly beneficial for them."Sarah Johnson, chief education officer at Carnegie Hall, told China Daily that it was not only about music, but also cultural exchanges."In music, you don't need words. You don't need language. Music as a bridge builder, a safe collaborative space for people to share experiences, and now it's time for the younger generation," she said.Clive Gillinson, executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, told China Daily that it has been a dream for quite a long time to create a national youth orchestra week at Carnegie Hall.Zhang Yao, vice-president of the China National Centre for the Performing Arts, or NCPA, told China Daily that when the Philadelphia Orchestra made its groundbreaking tour 51 years ago, its performances significantly contributed to US-China relations."Symphony music can contribute to the friendship between China and the US," he said. "We especially hope that more foreign friends and young people will come to the NCPA to perform, watch performances and learn about Chinese culture."mingmeili@chinadailyusa.comThe Institute of High Energy Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) held a memorial service on Sunday for Tsung-Dao Lee, the renowned physicist and Nobel laureate. More than 330 academicians, experts, representatives from over 30 universities and research institutions, and individuals from various sectors gathered to honor Lee's legacy.Wei Zhixiang, deputy director of the CAS Bureau of Frontier Science and Basic Research, highlighted Lee's unwavering support for basic research in China. Lee played a pivotal role in advancing the nation's scientific talent and fostering international collaboration, particularly between China and the United States, through his active participation in China-US academic exchanges.Gao Yuanning, an academician and dean of the School of Physics at Peking University, acknowledged Lee's visionary contributions to the development of the physics discipline at the university. Lee was instrumental in promoting high-level talent cultivation, interdisciplinary research, and international cooperation in physics and related fields.Zhou Shangui, director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at CAS, noted that the institute's growth and success were significantly influenced by Lee's recommendations. His initiatives, such as the establishment of the China-US Physics Examination and Application and the National Natural Science Foundation, were particularly impactful.Wang Yifang, director of the Institute of High Energy Physics at CAS, reflected on Lee's six-decade academic career and his remarkable contributions to China's high-energy physics, science education, and talent development."Remembering Lee is our greatest motivation to continue striving. The best way to honor him is by carrying forward his scientific spirit and continuing his unfinished work," Wang said.Lee passed away at his home in San Francisco on Aug 4, 2024. He was 97.China called on the international community to guard against interference and sabotage attempts by the National Endowment for Democracy under the organization's pretext of "promoting democracy", so as to uphold world peace and development and international fairness and justice.In a document released on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced the United States for using the NED for infiltration, interference and subversion purposes against other countries under the guise of democracy, freedom and human rights."This has grossly violated other countries' sovereignty, security and development interests, blatantly breached international law and basic norms of international relations, and severely jeopardized world peace and stability," it said.The NED, acting as the US government's "white gloves", has long engaged in subverting state power in other countries, meddling in other countries' internal affairs, inciting division and confrontation, misleading public opinion and conducting ideological infiltration, the document said.Funded by the US government, the NED is the implementer of the Central Intelligence Agency's covert operations, it said."The idea was that the NED would do somewhat overtly what the CIA had been doing covertly for decades, and thus, hopefully, eliminate the stigma associated with CIA covert activities," the document quoted the late William Blum, a US scholar, as saying.According to a report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, almost all the NED's funds come from the US Congress.Kenneth Wollack, chairman of the NED board of directors, once told the US Congress that the NED's long-term goal was to empower the opponents of US enemies and their ability to change foreign governments.The document said the NED's attempts to overthrow the Iranian government through a human rights movement have been dubbed by Iranian media as "the NED Trojan Horse", disrupting order and inciting unrest in Iran.The NED has supported pro-US media outlets, cultivated "democracy activists" and financed groups for "democracy and freedom" in Arab countries, according to its 2021 Annual Report.The document also noted that the NED has long been infiltrating Europe, co-opting European Union officials and financing "independent media" outlets in Europe to tilt public opinion in favor of Washington.It criticized the NED for inciting division and confrontation to undermine the stability of other countries, saying the NED supports"Taiwan independence" separatist forces, colludes with anti-China destabilizing forces in Hong Kong, supports the anti-China organization "World Uyghur Congress" and shows support for "Tibet independence" activities.The NED has kept changing tactics and gone even further in acting against the historical trends of peace, development and win-win cooperation, it said, adding that its true nature and innumerable misdeeds have drawn strong condemnation from US individuals and global society.Former US Congressman Ron Paul once said that the NED wasted a lot of US taxpayers' money to support foreign politicians and parties favored by the US, and provided "soft money" to fund foreign election activities, but portrayed such manipulation of elections as "promoting democracy".The Russian Foreign Ministry in 2015 listed the NED as an "undesirable organization" and banned its activities in Russia."It is unpopular and despicable for Washington to use the NED as a means of foreign interference as every country has the right to pursue a development path suited to its national realities and the needs of its people," said Wang Congyue, an associate researcher at the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.SAO PAULO -- A passenger plane crashed in the interior of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo on Friday, killing all 61 aboard, the airline company Voepass confirmed.The airline said the number of death was 61, not 62 as initially reported.In a statement, Voepass said the plane that crashed in the city of Vinhedo was carrying 57 passengers and four crew members, and none of them survived the accident.The plane of the Brazilian regional airline was traveling from the city of Cascavel in the southern state of Parana to Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo.The aircraft, which has a capacity to carry 68 passengers, fell on houses in the neighborhood of Capela de Vinhedo.Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called for a minute of silence before starting his participation in an event in the port of Itajai in the southern state of Santa Catarina.The president expressed "total solidarity with families and friends of the victims" on the social platform X. LOS ANGELES -- Media conglomerate Paramount Global announced on Thursday that it will cut 15 percent of its US-based workforce, or about 2,000 jobs, as part of a broader cost-cutting plan.The cuts will focus on two areas, including redundant functions in marketing and communications and in finance, legal, technology and other support roles, said Chris McCarthy, co-chief executive officer of Paramount Global, during a second-quarter earnings conference call."These actions will take place in the coming weeks and will largely be completed by the end of the year," he said, adding that "these are difficult decisions to make."The second-quarter earnings report released on Thursday revealed significant financial challenges for Paramount, which owns CBS, Paramount Pictures and popular cable networks.The company reported a massive operating loss due to a 5.98-billion-US-dollar write-down on the value of its cable TV networks.This devaluation is linked to Paramount's pending acquisition by Skydance Media, which is expected to close by Sept. 30, 2025.The job cuts are part of a previously cost-saving plan announced by Paramount's three co-chief executive officers to reduce annual costs by 500 million dollars ahead of the Skydance merger.This restructuring came as Paramount faced declining revenues in its traditional media operations. Overall revenue for the second quarter fell 11 percent to 6.8 billion dollars, with the company's TV operations -- its largest business segment -- experiencing a 17 percent revenue drop.The decline in TV revenue was attributed to an 11 percent decrease in advertising revenue and a 5 percent reduction in affiliate and subscription fees. These figures reflected the challenges traditional media companies face in an increasingly digital landscape.However, amid the financial turbulence, Paramount's streaming business emerged as a bright spot after turning a profit for the first time, with second-quarter revenue increasing by 13 percent and subscription revenue growing 12 percent year-over-year, according to the report.BEIJING -- For Ramona Klein, a 77-year-old Native Indian woman in America, hunger, physical punishment and forced labor are all she can remember about a former North Dakota Native boarding school at which she stayed beginning at the age of seven.During her stay, Klein was frequently punished by kneeling on the broom handles and was beaten all over her body with a short paddle by the warden."It's a lifelong scar, it's a lifelong wound," she said.Klein's experience epitomizes the tragic history of Aboriginal Americans. The US Interior Department recently released an investigative report showing that at least 973 Native American children died between 1819 and 1969 while attending US government-run or supported boarding schools.Many of those children were abused in boarding schools, forced to convert their beliefs and punished for speaking their Native languages, leaving lasting damage to Aboriginal communities."A WAR ON ABORIGINAL CHILDREN"Since the enactment of the Civilization Fund Act in 1819, the United States has established Native boarding schools on a large scale across the country, forcing Native children to enroll and destroy their cultural roots.The conditions in these schools were deplorable, and many children were subjected to physical punishment and sexual abuse at school, some dying as a result.The US Interior Department's report showed that at least 74 cemeteries had been discovered at 65 former boarding school sites across the United States for the burial of children who died while at school.Native American boarding schools are a gruesome chapter in American history, said American scholar Barbara Landis, "I don't think there's any way to whitewash that."Similar scenarios played out in Canada as well. Native children were taken, most of the time by coerce, to Native residential schools characterized by poor hygiene, physical abuse and hard labor.According to a report released by Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, between the 1840s and the 1990s, the Canadian government established 139 residential schools to which at least 150,000 Aboriginal children were forcibly sent, and more than 4,000 were abused and killed at school. There are more than 1,700 unmarked graves near the former sites of Aboriginal residential schools in many parts of Canada."Those schools were a war on Aboriginal children," said survivor Doris Young.In Australia, to assimilate Aboriginal people, the Australian government instituted a series of policies in the early 20th century that allowed authorities in some federal states to take Aboriginal children from their parents at any time and for any reason and send them to Native boarding schools. In these places, Native children were forced to perform heavy physical labor and endure inhuman abuse.A report released by the Australian government in 1997 estimated that between 1900 and 1980, about one-third of Native children were sent to boarding schools in Australia, dubbed the "Stolen Generation.""DON'T TRY TO TELL ME THIS WASN'T GENOCIDE"From the moment European colonizers set foot on the American continent, they viewed Native peoples as an obstacle to their plundering and a threat to the colonies. To drive out these "savages," the colonists waged wars against the Native Indians, killing and displacing them. However, war proved costly for the colonists, so the first president of the United States, George Washington, and others suggested that bloodshed could be minimized by forcing the Native Americans to assimilate into white culture.In 1881, Carl Schurz, then US Secretary of the Interior, said that the cost of "educating" a Native Indian child was far less than killing a Native Indian in a war. Investing in establishing more boarding schools was not only "a philanthropic act, but also the truest and wisest economy."In the late 1800s, the US government opened the first boarding school for Native Indian children, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, whose founder, Richard Henry Pratt, was the original author of the infamous slogan, "Kill the Indian in him, and save the man." Over the next half-century, nearly 8,000 Aboriginal children attended the school.The Canadian government, "inspired" by the United States, followed suit in establishing residential schools throughout the country and prohibited Native children from entering other schools.The boarding schools in the United States and Canada committed cultural genocide against the "uncivilized" Aboriginal people under the guise of eradicating their "savage" Indigenous cultures and "rescuing them.""Don't try to tell me this wasn't genocide!" survivor Ben Sherman said, "They went after our language, our culture, our family ties, our land. They succeeded on almost every level."Data from the Statistics Canada 2021 Census shows that most of Canada's over 70 Aboriginal languages are on the verge of disappearing, with only 13.1 percent of Aboriginal people being able to speak their Native languages fluently.STOLEN LANDMany have noticed the sins of Aboriginal boarding schools but rarely discussed the motive behind the policy of cultural genocide.The report of the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered a clear answer -- the government "wished to divest itself of its legal and financial obligations to Aboriginal people and gain control over their land and resources."According to the statistics of American researchers, from 1887 to 1933, the US government plundered about 360,000 square kilometers of land from the Native Indians through unequal agreements, excessive expropriation or massacre.The period of the greatest expansion of the boarding school system coincided with the colossal theft of Indigenous land, said Brenda Child, a professor at the University of Minnesota in the United States.The land taken from the Native Indians, along with its underground resources, was allocated by the government to public institutions such as colleges and universities.Professor Child's University of Minnesota was one of the institutions built on the "stolen" land. According to a report released by the US news portal Grist in February, since its establishment in 1851, the University of Minnesota has taken more than 750 square kilometers of land from Aboriginal tribes through relevant legislation.The university reaps huge benefits by renting or selling land, grazing, mining and other activities. Between 2018 and 2022, those lands produced more than 17 million US dollars in revenue, primarily through leases for mining iron and taconite, the report said.Australia, which is vast and sparsely populated, has long been recognized by colonists as "terra nullius" -- meaning land belonging to no one. They deprived the Aborigines of their ownership of land through legislation and occupied their land by expulsion and confiscation.In the process of land looting by colonists, many Native Australians were killed, while those who survived lost their food sources as they were deprived of land for agricultural production.According to a study by Australian researchers, the First Nations population went from an estimated 1 to 1.5 million before the invasion in 1788 to less than 100,000 by the early 1900s.LINGERING TRAUMAThe traumatic experience at boarding schools not only caused lifelong trauma but also had a lasting impact on the next generation of Indigenous communities."Our people are still suffering, our youths are suffering, our children are still being born into very dysfunctional families that were created because of the IRS (Indian Residential School) system, so now we have a whole host of problems," said Dawn McIntyre, a descendant of a survivor of the former Beauval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan in central Canada.Residential schools have destroyed Indigenous cultures and family structures, and the experiences of abuse have left Indigenous people suffering from depression, violence and drug addiction.Canadian studies indicated that the lack of formal education in residential schools has resulted in lower literacy skills among the Indigenous people, which leads to lower income levels and higher rates of crime and suicide. Another Canadian study found that children of residential school survivors are at greater risk of sexual and alcohol abuse."It continues to go through generations, and it continues to snowball, and it takes a really great deal of effort for a person to lift themselves out of that," McIntyre said.Indigenous communities in the United States and Australia also suffered from the lingering effects of the boarding school system.Former boarding school attendees were more likely to have chronic physical health conditions, including diabetes, and they had nearly four times the risk of any type of cancer as those who were not subjected to boarding schools, according to a study by Ursula Bear, an assistant professor of Population Health at the University of North Dakota.Notably, Bear also found that someone whose father attended a Native boarding school had more possibilities of having chronic physical health problems than someone whose father did not attend.Australian government statistics showed that the average life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is over eight years lower than that of non-Indigenous Australians, with higher rates of infant mortality, obesity, unemployment and suicide.According to Australian researcher Patrick Wolfe, invasion is a structure, not an event. The suffering of the Indigenous communities is not only from the past but still being perpetuated today."Compulsory residential boarding school education has had profound consequences for several generations of American Indians," said Bear.August 2024IntroductionThe National Endowment for Democracy (NED) acts as the US government's "white gloves." It has long engaged in subverting state power in other countries, meddling in other countries' internal affairs, inciting division and confrontation, misleading public opinion, and conducting ideological infiltration, all under the pretext of promoting democracy. Its innumerable evil deeds have caused grave harm and drawn strong condemnation from the international community.In recent years, NED has kept changing tactics and gone even further in acting against the historical trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation. It has become more notorious for its infiltration, subversion and sabotage attempts against other countries. It is imperative to unmask NED and alert all countries to the need to see through its true colors, guard against and fight back its disruption and sabotage attempts, safeguard their national sovereignty, security and development interests, and uphold world peace and development and international fairness and justice.Ⅰ. NED—the US government's "white gloves"NED claims to be an NGO that provides support for democracy abroad. In fact, it acts as the US government's "white gloves" in carrying out subversion, infiltration and sabotage across the world.1. NED is the implementer of CIA covert operations. In the early days of the Cold War, CIA supported opposition activities in socialist countries in Eastern Europe via "private voluntary organizations" to advance "peaceful evolution." After such activities were exposed in the mid to late 1960s, the US government began contemplating cooperation with civil society organizations to conduct similar activities. Hence the idea of setting up an organization of this kind. As William Blum, an American scholar, wrote, "The idea was that the NED would do somewhat overtly what the CIA had been doing covertly for decades, and thus, hopefully, eliminate the stigma associated with CIA covert activities."Ⅰ2. NED was established under the auspices of the US government. In 1981, after he came into office, President Ronald Reagan intended to promote his "Project Democracy" abroad, and proposed a government-funded and privately-run foundation to openly support "democratic movements abroad." One of the purposes of NED, created in 1983, is to encourage the establishment and growth of democratic development in a manner consistent both with the broad concerns of US national interests and with the specific requirements of the democratic groups in other countries which are aided by programs funded by NED.3. NED is funded by US government. On November 22, 1983, the US Congress passed the NED Act which reiterated the purposes of NED and clarified such issues as congressional appropriations, financial audit by the government, and the requirement to report to the Congress and the President. In 1983, the year when NED was established, the Congress provided US$18 million to NED. Over the past 40-plus years, the volume of congressional appropriations has kept increasing in general. According to data from USAspending.gov, NED received an appropriation of US$315 million in FY2023. As a report of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace revealed, "Almost all the NED's funds come from the US Congress."II4. NED programs are run under the guidance of the US State Department and embassies abroad. As required by the enabling legislation for NED, NED should consult with the State Department on its program plans to seek foreign policy guidance. According to a USAID report "Democracy Promotion Programs Funded by the US Government," NED consults on an ongoing basis with the State Department, through the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, with USIA and with US embassies abroad on programmatic matters.5. NED reports to the US government on its work and accepts audit and oversight by the government. According to the NED Act, NED shall submit to the President an annual report for the preceding fiscal year no later than December 31 of each year. The report should include NED's operations, activities and accomplishments. Audit of NED is conducted annually by the US Government General Accounting Office. A report of each audit shall be made to the Congress, and a copy of each report shall be furnished to the President.6. The US government has access to information on all NED-funded programs. According to the NED Act, NED or any of its duly authorized representatives shall have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the recipient pertinent to assistance provided through NED. The US Comptroller General or any of his duly authorized representatives shall also have access thereto.7. NED's mandate is endorsed by the US government. Philip Agee, a former CIA officer, said on a 1995 TV show, "Nowadays, instead of having just the CIA going around behind the scenes and trying to manipulate the process secretly by inserting money here and instructions there and so forth, they have now a sidekick, which is this National Endowment for Democracy, NED." In a report entitled "The National Endowment for Democracy: A Prudent Investment in the Future," Kim Holmes, former Assistant Secretary of State, argues that "Funding the NED is a prudent investment because it is far less expensive to aid friendly democrats than it is to defend against hostile dictatorships."II. Instigating color revolutions to subvert state power in other countries1. Attempting to overthrow the Iranian government. In September 2022, protests against hijab rules broke out in Iran. Masih Alinejad, a reporter for the Voice of America Persian Service, released batches of unverified information and pictures to incite public sentiments. According to Al Mayadeen, a Lebanese news channel, between 2015 and 2022, Masih Alinejad received US$628,000 in funding from NED and some other American institutions. Iran Daily cited a document from Iran's Revolutionary Guards as saying that NED used its ties with Masih Alinejad to interfere in Iran's internal affairs during the hijab protests. In the meantime, NED also supported the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) and the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) in their fabrication of fake news, and supported dissidents in working with anti-government organizations and media outlets to stage smear campaigns. NED regularly published commentaries on its Journal of Democracy to call for a regime change in Iran through human rights movement. NED is dubbed by Iranian media as a "National Enemy for Democracy" and "the NED Trojan" disrupting order and inciting unrest in Iran.2. Using various tactics to infiltrate Arab countries. Since the start of the Arab Spring, NED has made extensive use of social media platforms and funded NGOs for releasing multimedia content and providing online training, in a bid to instigate color revolutions. NED has also run a talent reserve program for democratic transition in the region, funded NGOs to help "supporters of democracy," "human rights activists" and "dissidents" in exile, encouraged local trade unions to strengthen capacity building, and supported scholars and activists in plotting "constitutional reforms" in various countries.3. Playing a part in Ukraine's "color revolution." During the 2004 Orange Revolution, NED provided US$65 million to the Ukrainian opposition. Between 2007 and 2015, NED allocated more than US$30 million to support Ukrainian NGOs and promote "civic participation." During the 2013-2014 Euromaidan, NED financed the Mass Media Institute to spread inflammatory information. NED also spent tens of millions of dollars in the use of such social media platforms as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram to spread disinformation, heighten ethnic tensions in Ukraine, and stir up ethnic antagonism in eastern Ukraine.4. Attempting to overthrow the DPRK government. In July 2002, NED President Carl Gershman told the media that NED was working with the Congress to carry out activities through a number of NGOs and sway public opinion regarding the DPRK, with a view to undermining the DPRK system. In July 2021, Gershman told the media that thanks to NED-funded human rights programs, "The totalitarian system [in the DPRK] is beginning to erode, and eventually this will bring about the system's unraveling."Ⅲ. Colluding with all sorts of elements to meddle in other countries' internal affairs1. Cultivating pro-US forces in target countries◆According to its 2021 Annual Report, NED supported pro-US media outlets, cultivated "democracy activists," and financed groups for "democracy and freedom" in Arab countries.◆In May 2021, NED President Carl Gershman said that despite being prohibited from Russia, NED funded the operation of a large number of organizations in Russia and supported Russian opposition figures in exile in their struggle against the Russian government at important political junctures, such as the State Duma, presidential and local elections.Ⅲ◆NED has long been infiltrating Europe and co-opting EU officials. It has been encouraging voice for transatlanticism within EU institutions while suppressing voice for strategic autonomy, and financing "independent media" in Europe to tilt public opinion in favor of the US.◆ Taking Mexico as a major target country for infiltration, NED has supported organizations like the Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity (MCCI) and the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO), and obstructed the electricity reform in Mexico. In 2021, the Mexican government sent a note to the US government condemning NED's funding of anti-government organizations in Mexico as "an act of interventionism" "promoting a coup."◆ Since 2017, NED has funded 54 anti-Cuba organizations. In 2018, the Cuban Democratic Directorate, an anti-government organization, said that it had received "democracy funds" from the US and paid US$48,000 to its employees, agents and contractors in Cuba.◆Over the years, NED has been funding scholars and journalists to promote "democratization reforms" in Iran and carry out cultural infiltration against Iran.2. Misrepresenting the human rights situation in other countries◆The NED-sponsored Journal of Democracy habitually holds developing countries to the standard of American-style democracy and criticizes their presidential elections, economic policies, human rights situations, and democratic transitions.◆In July 2023, the Journal of Democracy published five articles on Indian democracy under the theme of "Is India Still a Democracy," claiming that since Prime Minister Narendra Modi rose to power, his government has engaged in what is, by some accounts, a wholesale dismantling of democratic institutions, norms, and practices. In April 2024, the Journal of Democracy published an article "Why This Election Is India's Most Important," claiming that democratic governance in India has been steadily eroding since Modi's second term began and that the future of India as a plural, secular democracy could be on the line if Prime Minister Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party win a third consecutive term.◆Having classified members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as "dictatorships," NED has continued to export its values to those countries through academic, cultural and media activities. According to the NED website and other sources, NED launched 11 programs in the GCC countries in 2021 with an investment of US$1.8 million, to support "democracy activists," slam the human rights record of those countries, and stoke social tensions in the name of promoting freedom of the press.3. Manipulating and interfering in other countries' elections◆ In April 2022 and December 2023, Serbia held its presidential, National Assembly and local elections. NED interfered in the entire election process, and went all out to root for pro-US opposition candidates in the run-up to the elections. In May 2023, after two consecutive shooting incidents in Serbia, NED-sponsored human rights groups and pro-US opposition organizations staged mass demonstrations to demand the resignation of the Serbian gov ernment.◆NED has long been financing the Philippines' Rappler news website. According to a report on the NED website, between 2017 and 2021, Rappler received a total of US$786,000 in funding from NED. During the 2022 general election, Rappler lobbied the Philippines' Commission on Elections for access to internal information including election trends and campaign spending of candidates, which raised questions from various quarters about the fairness and independence of the election. The authorized access was eventually revoked under intense public pressure.◆NED has long funded anti-Iran organizations such as the Foundation for Democracy in Iran (FDI) to sabotage elections. This has been admitted in an article by American social activist Kenneth R. Timmerman, the executive director of FDI.◆In January 2023, Damon Wilson, President of NED, publicly expressed concerns about democracy and fairness of the Nigerian general election during his interview with a Nigerian TV program.Ⅳ. Inciting division and confrontation to undermine the stability of other countriesKenneth Wollak, chairman of the NED board of directors, once told the US Congress NED's long-term efforts to empower the opponents of US enemies and their abilities to change foreign governments.Ⅳ1. Supporting "Taiwan independence" separatist forces. In 2022, NED and the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party authorities co-hosted a Global Assembly of the World Movement for Democracy and invited European parliamentarians and think tank representatives. They tried to mobilize "democratic forces" to open up the "frontline of democratic struggle in the East" and hype up the false narrative of "Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow." In July 2023, NED President Damon Wilson went to Taiwan for the 20th anniversary celebration of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, and presented a "Democracy Service Medal" to Tsai Ing-wen.2. Colluding with anti-China destabilizing forces in Hong Kong. NED has long been colluding with those who attempt to destabilize Hong Kong by providing funds and public support. In 2020, NED set up several projects under its Hong Kong-related program with a total amount of over US$310,000 to fund those attempting to destabilize Hong Kong. In 2023, NED colluded with organizations such as the Hong Kong Watch and Amnesty International, as well as anti-China lawmakers from the US, UK and Germany, and nominated Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, one of the elements bent on destabilizing Hong Kong, for the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize.3. NED has long supported the anti-China organization "World Uyghur Congress (WUC)," with average annual funding ranging from US$5 million to US$6 million. In March 2024, NED invited a "WUC" leader to speak at its event, smearing China's ethnic policies and the development of regions with large ethnic minority populations.NED provided financial support to Hidayet Oguzhan, leader of the "East Turkistan Education and Solidarity Association," and instructed Hidayet Oguzhan to ramp up anti-China rallies and sow discord between China and Türkiye. NED also funded Rushan Abbas, the head of an "East Turkistan" organization, so that she could frequently visit Türkiye and work with "East Turkistan" forces to stir up trouble.4. In March 2023, NED President Damon Wilson led a NED delegation to Dharamsala, India, to meet with "Tibet independence" leaders and show support for "Tibet independence" activities. In November 2023, NED gave the Democracy Award for Individual Courage to Jigme Gyatso, a "Tibet independence" activist. In April 2024, NED invited the "Kalon Tripa" of the "Tibetan government-in-exile" Penpa Tsering to its headquarters.5. NED funded the establishment of three local NGO groupings in Georgia at the beginning of the 21st century to organize demonstrations in capital Tbilisi. In May 2024, NED rallied support for and instigated protests in Georgia against the foreign agents bill.Ⅴ. Fabricating false information to mislead public opinion1. NED President Damon Wilson, in an interview with Asahi Shimbun, falsely alleged that China used technical means and AI to surveil citizens. On November 30, 2023, NED Vice President Christopher Walker made up lies about CPC monopolizing ideas when testifying before the US House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. Ⅴ2. NED-backed Serbian NGOs coordinated with CNN's Serbia branch to fabricate China-related fake news, slandering projects undertaken by the Chinese side and hyping up so-called environmental protection, labor and corruption issues.3. NED funded the International Republican Institute (IRI) to launch the second phase of the Bolstering Europe Against the Subversive Tactics of the CPC project, which fabricates and disseminates the so-called threat of CPC to democratic values and transatlantic solidarity.4. NED invested US$17.41 million to carry out 92 projects on "DPRK defectors." It funded ROK NGOs to run DPRK-themed radios, producing and broadcasting on a weekly basis stories about "DPRK defectors" from the perspective of "democracy and human rights." It created DPRK-themed online publications to spread negative news about the DPRK, trained "defectors" to become reporters, and encouraged them to defame the DPRK by writing online posts and attending video interviews.5. NED formed an information matrix against Iran together with Iran International, the Persian service of VOA and BBC, and other anti-Iran media. Negative information is provided to anti-Iran media by NED and its affiliated agencies to instigate intensive news coverage against Iran.Ⅵ. Using "academic activities" as a cloak for interference and infiltration1. NED funded the Governance Center for Public Policies (GCPP) in Iraq, which released the National Index for Democratic Transformation in Iraq report for six consecutive years, giving low scores every time to Iraq's democracy, and categorizing Iraq as a "partial authoritarian transitional" country. People from across the society in Iraq disapprove the report as it did not truthfully reflect Iraq's progress in government administration, social governance, democracy and legal system. They believe the purpose of keeping the scores low is to provide excuses for continued US interference in Iraq's internal affairs and postponement of its military withdrawal.2. In March 2024, NED's core grantee institution Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE), together with the Philippines Makati Business Club and other associations, jointly published the first State of Sustainability Reporting in the Philippines, unfairly imposing upon the Philippines carbon emission standards and obligations of the US and other industrialized countries in the West to pressure the government of the Philippines to change the country's economic structure.3. NED provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding to the European Values Center for Security Policy (EVC), Global Security Center (GSC) and other think tanks to organize various seminars and activities that incite the EU to follow suit with the US "small yard, high fence" policy.4. Since the beginning of the Ukraine crisis, the NED-funded Belgrade Center for Security Policy has supported protests by pro-Western demonstrations and criticized Serbia's foreign policy.5. From January 2022 to January 2023, NED funded, through Atlas Network, the Turkish digital media platform daktilo1984.com, and supported activities on this platform that spread discontent and incite ethnic tension, social conflict and political differences.6. NED has long funded NGOs in "Kosovo" to instigate tension between the Serbian government and the Pristina provisional self-governance institution. In December 2023, the NED-funded think tank Sbunker released a report saying that "Kosovo" is a relatively successful case of American support for nation building and promotion of democracy, an attempt to whitewash US' true intention to invade and split other countries.7. NED used social media to wage information warfare against Iran. During the protests against hijab rules, a large number of social media bots with a big following emerged, disguising as personal accounts or independent media to spread anti-Iran information and mislead the public.8. NED and USAID funded multiple Ukrainian organizations to serve as "fact-checkers" of Ukraine's social media. But such "fact-checking" is in fact an information filter created by the US on the Ukrainian Internet to deceive the Ukrainian people.Ⅶ. NED exposed and criticized by the US and the international community1. NED's true nature exposed by Americans◆Former federal congressman Ron Paul once posted that NED wasted a lot of American taxpayers' money to support foreign politicians and parties favored by the US, and such actions clearly violate the domestic law of the United States. NED provided "soft money" to fund foreign elections but portrayed such manipulation of election as "promoting democracy."◆Former federal congressman Barney Frank called for cutting the funding for NED in the 1980s. He argued that giving money to a French union for political purposes, rather than funding public transportation or research on cancer, is not reasonable.◆The New York Times published "Mixed US Signals Helped Tilt Haiti Toward Chaos" in January 29, 2006, which reveals how the US government subverted, through NED, Haiti's democratically elected government.◆In September 2021, Stephen Kinzer, a former reporter of The New York Times, published articles in the New York Review of Books website unveiling that NED collaborates with CIA and USAID to support insurgent forces in other countries in a bid to overthrow regimes that the US dislikes. According to the articles, early members of the NED board of directors were mostly warmongers, and among the current board members are former federal senators enthusiastic about regime change in Cuba and Nicaragua. The mission of NED is to overthrow unfriendly foreign governments and install regimes more in line with American interests.2. NED's misdeeds exposed and criticized by the international community◆On July 29, 2015, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement officially listing NED as an "undesirable organization" and banned its activities within Russian territory. The statement said the US Department of State had made a clearly hypocritical statement about being "deeply troubled" over the fate of Russian civic society. Most of NED's projects aimed to destabilize the domestic situation in countries trying to pursue an independent policy in line with its own national interests rather than following Washington's lead.◆In May 2022, the Russian news agency TASS reported that when interviewed by the magazine National Defense, Russia's Assistant Secretary of the Security Council Nail Mukhitov commented that NED mainly affects young people, attempting to erode their patriotism and downplay the role of Russia in the modern world order. Using "liberating the people" as an excuse, the West attempts to install negative views about Russia in its citizens.◆French journalist Frédéric Charpier published the book CIA in France: 60 Years of Interference in French Affairs in 2008, revealing NED activities in France, and stated that NED relies on disbursement from three agencies—US State Department, USIA, and USAID, and serves the US diplomatic and military policies.◆In 2010, the French website Voltaire Network published an article by its founder, Thierry Meyssan, titled "NED, the Legal Window of the CIA," exposing NED's direct involvement in French NGOs, its interference in French elections, among other misdeeds.◆In 2018, the Hungarian media Figyelo blacklisted the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a civil human rights organization funded by NED, as "Soros mercenaries," accusing it of colluding with foreign forces and undermining the stability of Hungary.◆In April 2023, NED opened funding applications to recruit non-partisan, independent media seeking to defend human rights and the rule of law, and support freedom of speech. Stephen Kinzer, former reporter of The New York Times, cautioned world governments that NED's sole purpose is training people to destabilize governments that Washington disapproves.◆The Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of Russia pointed out in its article "the National Endowment for Democracy at 40: Back to Basics?" that NED allows the US government to pursue a simultaneous two-level foreign policy with current dictatorial governments, in which the US government maintains relations, while NED works at the sub-state level over the long term to cultivate required political forces capable of replacing these governments in the future. NED can play a role in sensitive areas where government programs are inconvenient.◆In June 2023, Agencia Brasil quoted Camila Feix Vidal, professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, as saying that NED is strong evidence of democracy being used as a pretext for seeking gains and a moral excuse for meddling in other countries.◆In 2016, the Indian government put NED under watch list due to its donation to NGOs in contravention of the provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act.ConclusionUnder the guise of democracy, freedom, and human rights, the United States has used NED for infiltration, interference and subversion against other countries. This has grossly violated other countries' sovereignty, security and development interests, blatantly breached international law and basic norms of international relations, and severely jeopardized world peace and stability. Such unpopular and despicable acts are firmly opposed by the international community.The world is moving toward multipolarity, and there need to be greater democracy in international relations. Every country has the right to pursue a development path suited to its national realities and the needs of its people. No country is in a position to lecture others on democracy and human rights, still less using democracy and human rights as excuses to infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries, interfere in their internal affairs and incite ideological confrontation. Following humanity's common values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, members of the international community should engage in exchanges and dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and equality, and work together to contribute to the progress of humanity.NoteⅠ.William Henry Blum, Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower, Zed book, 2006II.Thomas Carothers, Benjamin Feldman, Examining U.S. Relations with Authoritarian Countries, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Dec.2023Ⅲ.RT, American 'Regime change' specialists NED claim credit for Belarus protests & boast of funding Russian opposition during prank call, 17th May, 2021Ⅳ.Edward Hunt, NED Pursues Regime Change by Playing the Long Game, Counterpunch, 6th July, 2018Ⅴ.U.S. House of Representatives Document Repository: docs.house.govLOS ANGELES -- Two US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts find themselves on an unexpectedly extended mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as technical issues plague their return spacecraft, Boeing's Starliner.The intended short test mission has stretched beyond 60 days, with no definite return date in prospect.During a press conference on Wednesday, Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, said that "we could take either path," either returning the astronauts on Starliner or seeking an alternative method of using SpaceX.On June 5, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams were launched to the ISS as part of Starliner's first crewed test flight, and multiple technical problems have since occurred.The issues plaguing Starliner include failures in the reaction control system (RCS) thrusters, which are crucial for the spacecraft's maneuverability and safe return to Earth, and helium leaks in the propulsion system. These problems have raised concerns about the capsule's safety and reliability.The space agency is seriously considering a backup plan involving a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule to bring the two back to Earth. This contingency could extend their stay in space to approximately eight months, with a potential return date around February 2025, according to Wednesday's briefing.Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program, revealed that planning for this backup option began last month. "We started in early July, doing some early planning with SpaceX for some of these contingencies," Stich explained. "Then, as we got closer and got a little bit more data, we started to put a few more things in place."The Starliner issues have broader implications for NASA's commercial crew program. The agency has long emphasized the importance of having multiple providers for crew transportation to ensure redundancy and continuous access to the ISS. SpaceX has been successfully ferrying astronauts to and from the station since 2020, while Boeing has faced repeated setbacks and delays with its Starliner program.These latest complications have resulted in additional financial strain for Boeing. The company has recently announced a 125-million-US-dollar write-off related to unplanned costs for the Starliner program, adding to 1.5 billion dollars in previous write-offs.NASA has pushed back the launch of the next SpaceX Crew Dragon mission, originally scheduled for Aug. 18, to no earlier than Sept. 24. This delay provides additional time for decision-making regarding Starliner and potential crew adjustments.If implemented, the contingency plan would involve sending only two astronauts instead of the usual four on the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight. Wilmore and Williams would join the space station crew as full-fledged members for a six-month stay and return on the Crew Dragon around February 2025.During their extended stay, Wilmore and Williams have been fully integrated into the ISS crew, participating in various scientific experiments and maintenance tasks.Their activities include conducting ultrasound scans to study how space affects human veins, working on manufacturing higher-quality optical fibers in microgravity experiments, and participating in fluid physics studies to understand how to manage liquids without gravity.Additionally, they have been involved in routine maintenance tasks, including some less glamorous chores like toilet maintenance. They also had to take emergency precautions when a defunct Russian satellite broke apart near the ISS, forcing them to prepare for a potential evacuation.A final decision on whether to proceed with the Starliner return or switch to the SpaceX backup plan is expected by mid-August. Until then, Wilmore and Williams will continue their extended stay aboard the ISS.Argentina's economic relationship with China has become increasingly important, with growing trade highlighted by increasing beef exports from the South American country."For Argentina, maintaining and strengthening ties with China is crucially important for its economy, as it provides market diversification, investments and financing benefits," Alejandro Marco del Pont, an international relations expert at Argentina's National University of La Plata, or UNLP, said.Between 2017 and 2022, Argentina's exports to China grew by 12.8 percent per year, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a data visualization tool for international trade. Although the value of exports fell last year, growth picked up again this year.In May, China imported $525 million worth of Argentine products, mostly made up of soybeans, other grains and meat.Argentina is one of the world's major beef exporters and China has emerged as one of the largest importers. China is Argentina's second-largest trading partner after neighbor Brazil and the top market for its beef exports.Argentina's beef exports to China reached 234,000 metric tons in the first five months of this year, representing 75.8 percent of Argentina's total beef exports.China has implemented measures to ensure food security and meet the increased appetite for high-quality protein sources. In 2017, China expanded bilateral and multilateral trade agreements and overseas agricultural activities under its Belt and Road Initiative, which includes Argentina.Major boostChina's projected rise in Argentine beef imports this year is set to provide a major economic boost for the Latin American country as it struggles to shake off a years-long economic crisis.This progression underscores Argentina's heavy reliance on China for its economic growth and export diversification.In 2003, China was Argentina's fourth-largest trading partner. By 2022, China had risen to second place, making up 21 percent of Argentina's imports and 9 percent of its exports."While the diplomatic relationship between China and Argentina dates back to their establishment of ties in 1972, their commercial relationship really picked up after the signing of a strategic cooperation agreement in 2004," Sebastian Schulz, a sociologist at UNLP, said.Argentina stands to benefit from China's economic opening-up and promotion of globalization by increasing its beef exports, said Schulz, an expert on Chinese studies.With the signing of recent trade deals, Schulz noted that both nations emphasized diversifying their trade baskets, presenting opportunities for Argentina's industrial businesses.Schulz said China and Argentina have complementary economies and there are opportunities to deepen the commercial relationship through synergies."Considering China's decision to deepen commercial opening to the rest of the world, Argentina could further increase export volumes to the Asian country," Schulz said."This could help Argentina balance trade and diversify exports, bringing in more foreign currency crucial for national development and boosting growth in medium- and high-tech industries."The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.NEW YORK -- Former US president Donald Trump and incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris have agreed to a Sept 10 debate on ABC, the network said on Thursday.Both Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and Harris, his Democratic counterpart, have confirmed their participation in the debate, said the network in a statement.The 90-minute debate is expected to be held in Philadelphia, and the ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis will serve as moderators, according to The New York Times. The debate will probably be held without a live audience, but the exact format and ground rules are still being determined, the report said, quoting two people with knowledge of the plans.The announcement followed a Trump news conference in Palm Beach, Florida, during which he proposed three debates with Harris. Trump had previously agreed to debate President Joe Biden on Sept. 10, but pulled out after Biden withdrew from the Democratic ticket.Trump also said that he would debate Harris on two other occasions, at events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. But the Harris campaign has not agreed to those debates, which were not part of the original debate schedule that Biden and Trump had agreed upon in May.At this year's previous debate in June, Biden's shaky and diminished performance set off a panic among Democrats that ultimately led to the president ceding his spot atop his party's ticket.It was another US-China exchange, only this one was not focused on weighty issues such as trade or politics but on literary scholarship.About a dozen literary scholars from China and the United States gathered at the University of Houston on Tuesday for a symposium on topics including literature and art criticism, translation, and artificial intelligence and human writing.Also featured was the book Essentials of Chinese Literature and Art Criticism Volume I. The collection of theoretical critiques penned by eminent contemporary Chinese literary and art critics offers a detailed analysis of China's view of literature and art theory, as well as critical practice from the ancient to the modern period. The book will be available to the public in November.Xu Yuechun, vice-chairman and secretary-general of the Chinese Literature and Art Critics Association, and director of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Literature and Art Criticism Center, is the book's co-editor."I hope this book will work as a bridge for the exchanges on literature critics between China and the world, and for deepening such dialogues," Xu said, adding that the book collected the best works in 2021 and 2022.The US already has a rich collection of Chinese traditional artworks, he said, and the two countries share a long history of cultural and art exchange and cooperation, with influences on both sides to inspire each other.Xu said Chinese tradition calls for "harmony in diversity" and that he hopes the book will help the world better understand Chinese scholars' literary thinking.Karen Thornber, professor of literature and East Asian languages and civilizations at Harvard University, said via video link that although she had only enough time to skim through the book, she deemed it "a wonderful opportunity for English-speaking scholars to have access to first-rate or more first-rate Chinese scholarship on a range of topics in the arts and humanities".Fundamental reasonZhang Qingmin, director of the Literature and Art Research Center at Henan University, who shared his thoughts on current Chinese literary and art criticism, said the Chinese scholars essentially presented the fundamental reason "why we view art and aesthetics 'this way, not that way'"."I believe that our American colleagues have received these messages," he said.Haun Saussy, a professor at the University of Chicago, using a 1687 Latin translation of Confucius' sayings, showed how translation does not actually reproduce an original. Instead, it produces an interpretation of an original — but in another language.Zhang said Janell Watson, a professor from Virginia Tech, "focused on the topic of whether AI brings unlimited possibilities to artistic creation or the 'death of the author', and explored how literature and art can … influence technology in the process of technological innovation and artistic development"."Many new ideas and new viewpoints presented by everyone are very inspiring for us to explore and build a Chinese literary theory and criticism discourse system from a global perspective," Zhang said.Alessandro Carrera, chair of the Department of Modern and Classical Languages at the University of Houston, shared his love of Chinese literature. Carrera said he has a collection of Chinese classics in translation, such as The Book of Changes, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The Dream of the Red Chamber.He said the first Chinese novel he read was The Chess Master by Ah Cheng, published in 1984, which he called "a short novel that really opened a world for me and made me want to read more and to look for other authors".Recalling Europe's interactions with Chinese literature, Carrera, a native of Italy, talked about Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit priest who was the first European man to enter the Forbidden City in Beijing, in 1601, and became "a great scholar of Chinese culture".California Governor Gavin Newsom declared "California Panda Day" to celebrate the first public appearance of two new giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo on Thursday."This week, California is proud to celebrate another iconic bear as a pair of giant pandas make their public debut at the San Diego Zoo," said the proclamation, which was released on Wednesday.Newsom, who traveled to China last year to discuss issues including economic development and ways to address climate change, said that the conservation collaboration exemplifies the long-standing history of California and China working together toward common goals."We hope that the newly arrived panda 'envoys of friendship' will lead to further exchanges and cooperation between California and China," he said in the statement.Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, who arrived at the end of June, are the first pandas to enter the United States in over two decades. After several weeks of acclimating to their new surroundings, they made their official debut at the Zoo's Panda Ridge on Thursday.Panda Ridge has been designed to replicate the pandas' native habitat as closely as possible, offering them a comfortable and engaging space in which to live and thrive. It features lush vegetation, bamboo groves and various items to stimulate the pandas' natural behavior.Yun Chuan prefers to rest lazily on the climbing frames, while Xin Bao, the smaller of the two, is smart and curious, making the most of her opportunities to explore everything around her.Together, the two pandas consume up to 18 kilograms of locally grown bamboo each day.At an exclusive media preview on Wednesday, hundreds of panda enthusiasts got a sneak peek at the pandas. Many expressed their excitement about the return of pandas to the zoo, noting that they are an integral part of San Diego's history."We felt really sad, the whole city was sad when the pandas left," said zoo visitor Sheron Natalie. "We waited and waited, and finally they came back. We are so happy."Jessica Chenoweth was likewise enthusiastic. "They're now coming back. It feels like this is their family's home, and I can't wait to bring my son later to see them firsthand," she said.Adriana Sanchez, a website operator from Mexico, said she will promote the pandas on her site, which has 13,000 followers who are mothers. "We have a song about pandas, and we all love to sing it in Mexico City," she said.A visitor identified only as Noreen said that the pandas "represent a real sense of peace. That panda right there is a signal of diplomacy between the United States and China. We hope it's a good beginning to bring them back together."San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, who visited China in June to participate in farewell ceremonies for the panda pair before they began their journey to the US, said that Yun Chuan and Xin Bao symbolize the enduring friendship between the two countries.Since the arrival of the pair, the San Diego Zoo has collaborated with Chinese experts to meet the pandas' dietary needs and preferences. Veterinary teams from both the US and China are closely monitoring various health factors, including weight and appetite, to ensure that the pandas thrive.Staff members have provided the pandas with a variety of fresh bamboo, along with a local adaptation of a traditional Chinese bun called "panda bread".Pandas are solitary animals in the wild and are housed separately in zoos, except during the brief breeding season. San Diego Zoo officials hope the pandas will eventually produce cubs, with the first opportunity likely to occur next spring or the following year.SAN DIEGO, the United States - To celebrate the highly anticipated public debut of two giant pandas -- Yun Chuan and Xin Bao -- at the San Diego Zoo on Thursday, California Governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday proclaimed Aug 8 as California Panda Day.The two iconic black and white bears landed in California from China on June 27 for 10-year international giant panda protection cooperation with San Diego Zoo, marking a new round of such collaboration between the two nations.Newsom called the newly arrived panda pair "envoys of friendship" in a statement, wishing the beloved bears would lead to further exchanges and cooperation between California and China.He pointed out that San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance was the first organization in the United States to establish a cooperative panda conservation program with China."Their innovative conservation science has advanced efforts to protect and care for giant pandas around the world," explained the governor, noting that as a testament to its success, Yun Chuan, the five-year-old male panda was the son of Zhen Zhen, a female panda born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007.Newsom said the conservation collaboration is part of California and China's long history of working together toward shared goals, adding that the Golden State, the largest economy and most populous state in the United States, and China have enjoyed "strong foundation of partnership and deep cultural and economic ties".The governor also pointed out that giant pandas are beloved around the world and their conservation story is an inspiring example of strong partnerships and innovative strategies to protect the world's natural heritage."As the San Diego Zoo welcomes visitors to Panda Ridge this week, I encourage Californians to take this unique opportunity to appreciate one of the most iconic wildlife species and recognize the important partnerships at work to help them thrive for generations to come," he concluded.San Diego Zoo is one of the most visited zoos in the United States. Located north of downtown San Diego in Balboa Park, it is home to more than 12,000 animals representing over 680 species and subspecies.China's leading electric vehicle maker BYD could bring lower-priced cars to the Canadian market, but will have to consider several factors, including the prospect of higher tariffs, an auto industry expert said.A report by Automotive News Canada said BYD is planning to enter the Canadian car market to expand its presence in North America.The company, based in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, already manufactures electric buses in North America.Public documents filed in Ottawa in late July showed that lobbyists representing BYD registered with the federal and Ontario governments to "advise on matters related to the expected market entry of BYD into Canada for the sale of passenger electric vehicles, and the establishment of a new business, and the application of tariffs on EVs".BYD also plans to build a plant in Mexico, which would take two to three years to open, its Americas head Stella Li told Reuters in May.Its competitive pricing could give it an advantage in Canada, said John Holmes, professor emeritus at Queen's University in Ontario, who specializes in the political economy of the North American automobile industry."Unlike the consumer tax credits built into the US Inflation Reduction Act to encourage EV purchases, consumer incentives in Canada are much more modest and vary across provinces. Thus, the relatively high price of EVs currently sold in Canada has slowed the growth of that segment of the automotive market," Holmes told China Daily."Canadian tariffs on imported vehicles from outside the USMCA bloc (vehicles that meet the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement rules of origin and content value) are relatively small. Therefore, imported Chinese-built EVs would enter at a significantly lower price point than EVs currently for sale in Canada."The USMCA increased the requirement for North American-produced components in automobile manufacturing from 62.5 percent over its predecessor, the North American Free Trade Agreement, to 75 percent.Public consultationOttawa opened a monthlong public consultation period on July 2 about possible increased tariffs on Chinese EVs, saying that allowing the vehicles "could lead to an exponential surge of imports that will adversely affect planned EV investments and the transformation of Canada's automotive sector".But the results of the 30-day consultation conducted by Canada's finance minister have not been released.Holmes said BYD would have to consider its prospects if a tariff or surtax similar to those imposed by the US on Chinese EVs, where they are 100 percent, was enacted.It may take BYD some time to satisfy Canadian regulators on safety standards, Holmes added.BYD will also face the challenge of establishing a dealership and service network in Canada, where the majority of the population resides close to the US border."There is also the challenge of range anxiety on the part of consumers, especially given the negative effect of very low winter temperatures on EV battery performance," Holmes said.Agencies contributed to this story.China's recent retrieval of the first-ever samples from the far side of the moon has renewed talks about the possibilities of the United States and China joining in space-based research programs aimed at addressing global challenges, particularly climate change."The US and China each have very innovative space programs, and one area, for example, where the US and China could work together today would be space-based solar," Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, and founding director of the university's Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory, told China Daily.Space-based solar power, a concept involving the collection of solar energy in outer space via satellites and its distribution to Earth, has been gaining traction globally. As countries worldwide invest in research and development for the technology, international organizations are simultaneously pushing for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.The decreasing costs associated with launching materials into space have made the idea of deploying large, kilometer-square, mylar solar panels — which beam power back to Earth using microwaves — increasingly feasible.Kammen, who was a coordinating lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Nobel Peace Prize-winning report in 2007, suggested that the US and China could challenge each other to collaborate on making space-based solar a reality.He emphasized the continuous nature of this energy source: "Space-based solar is on 24/7. There is no nighttime in space. And so, adding space-based solar could be beaming power to Los Angeles to Beijing, to Guangzhou to Shenzhen to San Francisco."Both nations already have made significant strides in this field. In the United States, Caltech's space solar power prototype, launched into orbit last year, has successfully demonstrated its ability to wirelessly transmit power in space and beam detectable power to Earth for the first time.Meanwhile, NASA is developing technologies that will indirectly benefit space-based solar power, including projects focused on autonomous systems, wireless power beaming and in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing, according to a NASA report early this year.China, for its part, has achieved a milestone in its efforts to build a space solar power station in 2022. The China Academy of Space Technology has plans for a space high-voltage transfer and wireless power transmission experiment to be conducted in low Earth orbit by 2028, as outlined in its 2022 publication in the journal China Space Science and Technology.Kammen acknowledged the political sensitivities surrounding such collaboration, particularly regarding data transfers and information-sharing. Despite those challenges, he saw opportunities for cooperation in other areas as well, such as fusion power.He cited the advanced research being conducted at Tsinghua University and China's fusion reactor as potential areas for joint efforts in deployment and new research.Drawing inspiration from popular culture, Kammen referred to the movie The Martian, in which a stranded American astronaut is rescued through a joint effort between the US and China. He saw the fictional scenario as an example of how the two nations could work together in reality, combining their respective technological strengths to achieve common goals."There's an opportunity to work peacefully together in space, to show that no matter who's going to be on the moon next, we have a chance to do clean energy in space as a bridge," said Kammen. Both countries have interests in lunar exploration, with the discovery of significant water ice on the moon opening up new possibilities. Potentially high-value materials on the moon, as well as resources on Mars and asteroids, present further opportunities for joint ventures that could benefit both nations while protecting their individual intellectual property, he said."That's an exciting opportunity," said Kammen, and stressed the urgency of doing so. "We're going to need those breakthroughs because both the US and China are behind schedule to meet their climate goals," he said.The US has aimed to cut emissions in half by 2030, and the Chinese goal is to realize carbon neutrality by 2060.US Vice-President Kamala Harris on Tuesday selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, 60, as her vice-presidential running mate, adding the folksy and popular Midwestern state executive to the Democratic ticket as the party seeks to hold onto key Northern battleground states this fall.Harris will hold her first rally with Walz on Tuesday in Philadelphia, the first stop in a four-day tour of battleground states that includes visits to Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and elsewhere.In picking Walz, she has selected a politician with executive governing experience, and signaled the importance of Midwestern battleground states such as Wisconsin and Michigan. A two-term governor and current chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, Walz is also a hunter and gun owner, which can often help candidates connect in rural areas.Walz wasn't widely known outside of Minnesota before his name appeared on Harris shortlists. But he gained some Democratic fans outside his state in recent weeks for television interviews that hit at former president Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Senator J.D. Vance without being overly nasty. He called the pair "weird'', a word that went viral among Democrats and on the internet.Walz now faces introducing himself to the country with about three months left before the election, including a potential debate against Vance.The choice of a running mate for Harris was among the most closely watched decisions of her fledgling campaign, as she sought to bolster the ticket's prospects for victory in November and rapidly find someone who could be a governing partner.In recent days, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania was perceived to be the front-runner over Walz and Arizona Senator John Kelly, but Walz was also seen by many as a safer choice for Harris because of his liberal stands and that Shapiro had come under fire from some progressives in the party and fellow Democrats. Shapiro especially received heavy scrutiny recently over his response to pro-Palestinian protests that emerged in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.It has been about two weeks since President Joe Biden announced he wouldn't seek reelection and Harris quickly moved to lead the Democratic ticket into the Nov 5 election against Trump, becoming the first black and South Asian American nominee for a major US party's White House campaign.The most recent poll from CBS News shows Harris, 59, and Trump, 78, in a tight race nationally, with the Democrat holding a one-point lead over Trump.Agencies contributed to this report.aiheping@chinadailyusa.comWASHINGTON - Kamala Harris, the US vice president and the daughter of immigrants, has officially clinched the Democratic nomination for the presidency, becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket in the country.Harris, previously unsuccessful in her presidential bid, has now secured the Democratic nomination, a significant moment for the party. This follows President Joe Biden's underwhelming debate performance in June, sparking internal conflicts within the party. The lead-up to Harris' nomination has been marked by intense discussions and turbulence among Democrats regarding their party's future and Biden's chances of reelection.Following a five-day online balloting process by delegates of the Democratic National Convention, Harris's nomination was officially confirmed on Monday night. The Democratic Party announced that 99 percent of the delegates had voted in favor of Harris in a statement released just before midnight. The party will now proceed to formally certify the vote and will hold a celebratory roll call during the upcoming party convention in Chicago later this month.Harris has indicated that she intends to stay aligned with the key themes and policies that defined Biden's campaign, including democracy, gun violence prevention, and abortion rights. However, her approach may be more impassioned, especially when she draws upon her prosecutorial experience to criticize Donald Trump and highlight his 34 felony convictions related to falsifying business records as part of a hush money scheme.Harris was born on Oct 20, 1964, in Oakland, California. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a breast cancer scientist from India, and her father, Donald Harris, was a Jamaican-born professor at Stanford University.Harris worked as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before becoming California's attorney general in 2010 and later a US senator in 2016.During her time in the Senate, she emerged as a vocal critic of Trump and gained attention for her role on the Judiciary Committee, particularly during the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Although Harris initially ran for president in 2020 with high expectations, she faced challenges with campaign organization and message consistency, leading to her withdrawal before the Iowa caucuses.However, she remained a top contender for the vice presidential nomination, given her close relationship with Biden and her experience as a prosecutor. After securing the nomination, Biden chose Harris as his running mate.As vice president, Harris faced criticism for her role in addressing migration issues at the US-Mexico border and her tie-breaking votes in the Senate. She also became a prominent advocate for abortion rights following the Supreme Court's ruling on Roe v. Wade.After Biden endorsed Harris following the end of his candidacy on July 21, her 2024 presidential bid saw a surge in enthusiasm among the Democratic base. Donations poured in, volunteers showed up at field offices, and supporters grew in numbers, leading to venue swaps for events.The Trump campaign has sought to define Harris negatively, criticizing her for border crossings and making derogatory comments about her heritage."I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black," stated Trump at the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago. "So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?"In her response, Harris aptly characterized it as "the same old show -- the divisiveness and the disrespect"."The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us. They are an essential source of our strength," Harris said.The granddaughter of US General Claire Lee Chennault, the founder of the World War II-era Flying Tigers, said he remained in China because he "heard the cries for help".When Chennault decided to stay behind and offer his services to China in July 1937, the US government threatened to revoke his citizenship if he did not return home and cease helping China.However, his compassion was unwavering and he accepted his new role as an adviser to the Chinese Air Force, said his granddaughter Nell Calloway, director of the Chennault Aviation and Military Museum in Monroe, Louisiana.Calloway recalled her grandfather's story at a recent gathering of the new generation of Flying Tigers, formerly known as the American Volunteer Group, during the 45th Anniversary of US-China Diplomatic Relations Forum hosted by Flying Tigers-friendly organizations.The celebration was held in Whittier, California, a city in Los Angeles County and the hometown of former US president Richard Nixon, as the Flying Tigers organizations aim to carry on the fighter pilots' spirit and their friendship between the two peoples.Chennault arrived in China on June 1, 1937, but it was not easy for him to stay in a foreign land as he was hard of hearing and did not understand the language."He stayed because he heard the cries for help from a people in desperate need," Calloway said. "He did not let cultural differences, political affiliation or ideology stand in the way of his humanity or serving his fellow man."When the war was over, Chennault wrote in his 1949 memoir Way of a Fighter, "It is my fondest hope that the sign of the Flying Tiger remains aloft just as long as it is needed and that it will always be remembered on both shores of the Pacific as the symbol of two great peoples working toward a common goal in war and peace."The legacy of the Flying Tigers shows how much the United States and China can accomplish together over the course of history, said US Representative Judy Chu of California.Risking lives for peace"I was so impressed that so many brave young men quit their jobs to volunteer to fight with the Chinese to protect China from her enemies," Chu told the audience. "And they weren't even an official part of the US military because the US was not yet at war with Japan, but these men were still willing to risk their lives for peace."The Flying Tigers produced 39 US aces during their brief combat history. The official tally of the American Volunteer Group at the time was 299 Japanese planes destroyed in seven months.In March 1943, Chennault, then a major general, was made the commander of the 14th Air Force, which was formed out of the China Air Task Force.When the US eventually entered World War II, thousands more went on to serve in both Asia and Europe, including another 20,000 Chinese Americans like Chu's father, who fought for the US despite facing racial discrimination at home because of the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882-1943)."For my father's whole life, he was so proud of his service to his country. Of course, I thought of him when Congress passed legislation in 2018 to finally award the 20,000 Chinese American veterans who fought in World War II with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor," Chu said.Reciprocal gratitudeAs the Flying Tigers fought alongside the Chinese people to resist Japanese aggression, the Chinese were deeply grateful for their contributions and went to great lengths to rescue and protect them.Hundreds of Flying Tigers were saved, at the cost of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians who sacrificed their lives."This is a glorious and honorable chapter written by the people of our two great nations with flesh and blood in defending world peace and justice," said Chinese Consul General in Los Angeles Guo Shaochun.In the 1970s, in a demonstration of political courage and strategic vision, Chinese and US leaders made the historic decision to reopen exchanges.In 1972, Nixon visited China, and a handshake extended to Premier Zhou Enlai crossed the Pacific, ending decades of disengagement. The two countries established formal diplomatic relations on Jan 1, 1979, which marked the beginning of a new chapter in friendly bilateral exchanges.Over the past 45 years, the China-US relationship has forged ahead despite twists and turns, growing into the most important bilateral relationship in the world, Guo said."There are so many lessons we may learn from the 45-year history. The most important one is that both China and the US gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, and working together is our only correct choice," he said. "The broadest consensus is that we should make the China-US relationship work rather than mess it up. The only right way to get along is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation."This year, efforts have increased on both sides to collect and promote the stories. Local schools, especially the alma maters of Flying Tigers veterans, have joined the Flying Tigers Friendship School program.More US teenagers are visiting China to attend Flying Tigers-themed summer camps, helping to build bridges of mutual understanding and friendship between China and the US, Guo said."This year marks the 45th anniversary of the China-US diplomatic relationship. We have every reason to carry on the friendship forged by the Flying Tigers, promote its spirit among the younger generation and inject youthful strength into China-US relations," he said.renali@chinadailyusa.com NEW YORK -- US stocks ended sharply lower on Monday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1,033.99 points, or 2.60 percent, to 38,703.27. The S&P 500 sank 160.23 points, or 3.00 percent, to 5,186.33. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 576.08 points, or 3.43 percent, to 16,200.08.All of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with technology and communication services leading the laggards by going down 3.78 percent and 3.35 percent, respectively. Industrials posted the weakest decline, down 1.72 percent. NEW YORK — Nearly everything on Wall Street is tumbling Monday as fear about a slowing US economy worsens and sets off another sell-off for financial markets around the world.The S&P 500 was down by 2.4% in midday trading and on track for its worst day since 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was reeling by 864 points, or 2.2%, as of 11:40 am Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.7%.The drops were just the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.It was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing US employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the US economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the US economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2% and bitcoin dropped below $55,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1%.That's in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.90%.APVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro is set to begin a third six-year term with a focus on maintaining the country's growth momentum of the past few years and overcoming the negative effect of sanctions imposed by the United States."People did not trust the opposition in the election and knew who was responsible for the sanctions," Maduro said on Thursday. "Venezuela has broken hyperinflation and managed to stabilize the dollar exchange rate for months."The National Electoral Council on Saturday reaffirmed Maduro as the winner of the presidential elections held on July 28, with about 97 percent of the votes tallied.Meanwhile, Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday the recent US position on Venezuela's elections was "reckless" and renewed his call for the international community to avoid interventionism.In a news conference, Lopez Obrador said statements such as the one made by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday do not help resolve electoral disputes. Blinken has claimed opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia received the most votes in the election.After a few difficult years, Venezuela shifted back to growth from 2021. In 2022, real GDP expanded by 8 percent and added another 4 percent in 2023, according to the International Monetary Fund. Maduro has predicted growth would hit 8 percent this year.Venezuela has the tools at its disposal to ramp up growth, including the largest oil reserves in the world, but US sanctions have curbed its ability to trade its oil in international markets, curbing production and causing underinvestment, experts said.Since 2015, Venezuela has had 932 sanctions and seven US executive orders leveled against it and "this does not rule out the possibility of more so-called sanctions", said Vladimir Adrianza Salas, a professor and researcher at Venezuela's National Centre for Historical Studies.Affected by blockadeFranco Vielma, a sociologist at think tank Mision Verdad in capital Caracas, said: "In Venezuela, the economy is fundamentally based on oil exports. Before 2016-17, 92 percent of the foreign currency income was from oil exports, and this inventory of foreign currency dramatically decreased due to the blockade since 2017."The country returned to growth at the beginning of this decade. "It is estimated that in 2024, the Venezuelan economy will be the fastest-growing in Latin America," Vielma said.Maduro has put forward a plan for the next five years, the Seven Transformations project, to diversify the economy beyond oil. It aims to "ensure that 95 percent of the food consumed is produced in Venezuela, making the country much less vulnerable to economic and commercial blockades", Vielma said.Looking abroad, Maduro has called for greater integration into the international system and has expressed an aspiration to join the BRICS.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.WASHINGTON -- US Vice-President Kamala Harris has won enough delegate votes to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Jaime Harrison announced on Friday, noting that the results are not yet official.The virtual voting process closes for delegates on Monday, and the DNC is expected to make official announcement of the results Monday evening. The Democratic National Convention, which is scheduled for Aug. 19-22, will formally nominate the party's presidential candidate.The virtual voting process for approximately 4,700 delegates started on Thursday morning. One and a half days into the voting, Harris's campaign reported that she has obtained more than the 2,350 votes required to secure the nomination.Harris, 59, would be the first Black woman and the first Indian American in US history to receive a major party's presidential nomination.Earlier, US media reports said that Harris is expected to reveal her running mate by Monday, and will hold their first rally together in Philadelphia on Tuesday.Top vice presidential picks include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.On July 21, US President Joe Biden announced that he was dropping out of the 2024 presidential race, under mounting pressure from within the Democratic Party due to concerns about his fitness for office. Biden immediately offered his full support for nominating Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate.Harris quickly consolidated support within the Democratic Party, and announced the next day that she had secured enough support from Democratic delegates to become the party's nominee.The latest data shows that Harris is narrowing gap with former President Donald Trump in the presidential race. According to polling data compiled by the US election information website Real Clear Politics, as of July 31, Trump led Harris by an average of 1.2 percentage points in national polls, compared with an advantage of 1.7 percentage points before Biden dropped out.In key swing states Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Trump led Harris by an average of 0.2 percentage points and 2.7 percentage points separately, while in Michigan, Harris flipped the situation and took the lead by an average of 2.0 percentage points.Kamala Harris is used to political attacks on her race and gender in the United States.The 59-year-old, who is both South Asian and black, faced a slew of questions and comments from the right wing in 2019 when she first ran for president.In the days after she became the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee, attacks on her racial identity and gender have increased.Harris was born in California; her parents immigrated from India and Jamaica and later became naturalized US citizens. She became the US' first woman vice-president in 2020 and would become the first woman president if she is elected in November.Political analysts suggest that the focus on Harris' race and gender has exposed how divisive US politics can be for women who seek the highest office, eight years after Hillary Clinton's failed presidential bid.Harris' Republican opponent, former president Donald Trump, drew gasps from an audience at the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago on Wednesday by questioning her racial identity."She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?" he told Rachel Scott, an ABC News correspondent.Harris quickly responded that Trump was putting on "the same old show, the divisiveness and the disrespect".Republican criticismShe has also faced criticism from several Republicans who branded her a "DEI hire". The phrase refers to diversity, equity and inclusion policies of recent years that stem from executive orders in the 1960s by presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.US Representative Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, said of Harris in an interview with CNN last month: "Biden said first off, he's going to hire a black female for vice-president. He just skipped over, what about white females, what about any other group, when you go down that route you take mediocrity and that's what they have right now. One hundred percent she is a DEI hire."In 2020, Trump questioned whether she met citizenship requirements, as he had previously questioned where Barack Obama, the country's first black president, was born. Trump said he had "heard" that Harris wasn't born in the US because her parents were born abroad, and so she "doesn't meet the requirements to be vice-president", a claim that was debunked.US Representative Harriet Hageman of Wyoming said in a video clip that Harris was "intellectually, just really kind of the bottom of the barrel".While many Republicans have criticized Harris, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and the chair of the House GOP campaign arm, Richard Hudson of North Carolina, urged their party to focus on her policies.belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.comA US report has confirmed that at least 973 Native American children died while attending federal Indian boarding schools between 1819 and 1969, but acknowledged that "the actual number of children who died while in Indian boarding schools is greater".Many of the children were buried in at least 74 marked and unmarked burial sites at 65 former schools across the country, according to the report released on Tuesday by the US Department of Interior. The actual number of children who died and the number of potential burial sites are probably greater, the report said.The report urges the US government to formally apologize for the 150-year-long "deliberate and strategic actions" to assimilate the children and destroy their culture.The Indian boarding school system was established by the US government to "civilize" and assimilate Native Americans into Anglo-American culture. Children were forcefully taken from their homes and put into boarding schools.The Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative under the Interior Department has identified by name 18,624 Native children who entered the school system, adding that it is not a comprehensive list.Additional children may have died after becoming sick at school and being sent home, officials said.In a letter presenting the report to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary, the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Bryan Newland, who led the investigation, wrote: "For the first time in the history of the country, the US government is accounting for its role in operating Indian boarding schools to forcibly assimilate Indian children, and working to set us on a path to heal from the wounds inflicted by those schools."Newland described one piece of history related to the schools."On Dec 28, 1890, the US military entered Third Mesa of Hopi and took 104 children from their families so they could be sent to the Keams Canyon Boarding School. Four years later, on Nov 25, 1894, two US cavalry companies with rapid-fire artillery guns arrived again at Third Mesa to arrest 19 Hopi leaders as prisoners of war after they refused to send additional Hopi children to the school."Newland said those Indian leaders were imprisoned for almost one year on Alcatraz Island, a former US military installation in San Francisco Bay.The report also said the US government appropriated more than $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars between 1871 and 1969 for the federal Indian boarding school system and other similar institutions and associated assimilation policies.After removal from their Indian tribes and families, many children sent to the boarding schools didn't return home, the report said.Students' sufferingChildren in boarding schools were punished for using their own native language in the schools. Some suffered sexual abuse. The report shared some accounts of the boarding school experiences in the project "The Road to Healing"."I experience feelings of abandonment because I think of my mother standing on that sidewalk as we were loaded into the green bus to be taken to a boarding school. And I can see it — still have the image of my mom burned in my brain and in my heart where she was crying. What does a mother think? She was helpless," said an Arizona participant."Unfortunately, Wrangell was a place that attracted pedophiles and many matrons, men and women, perpetrated themselves upon little boys and girls. … We saw girls going home in the middle of the school year pregnant, and a lot of these children were like 11 and 12, 13 years old," a participant from Alaska stated.The report cited studies showing that Native children who were separated from their parents suffered both physically and mentally and have had higher rates of suicide and substance abuse compared with the general population.The report said the US government "should issue a formal acknowledgment of its role in adopting a national policy of forced assimilation of Indian children and carrying out this policy through the removal and confinement of Indian children from their families and Indian Tribes and the Native Hawaiian Community and placement in the federal Indian boarding school system".NEW YORK -- US carriers Delta Air Lines and United Airlines on late Wednesday temporarily suspended their flights to the Israeli city of Tel Aviv amid heightening tensions in the Middle East region.United Airlines suspended its daily services to and from Tel Aviv, beginning with the Wednesday evening's flight from Newark Liberty International Airport in New York to Tel Aviv, the company said, citing "security reasons.""We continue to closely monitor the situation and will make decisions on resuming service with a focus on the safety of our customers and crews," a company spokesperson said in an announcement.Delta paused flights between New York and Tel Aviv through Friday, Aug. 2, "due to ongoing conflict in the region," the airline said on its website.Delta has issued a waiver for customers who booked travel to/from Tel Aviv before Aug. 14, allowing them to change their plans without paying a fare difference.The airline said it "is continuously monitoring the evolving security environment and assessing our operations based on security guidance and intelligence reports. "The US Department of State updated a travel advisory for the Mideast region on Wednesday, warning US citizens not to travel to Northern Israel and the West Bank, due to the rising tensions between Hezbollah and Israel, as well as armed conflicts.WASHINGTON -- The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged at a 22-year high of 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent, as inflation continues to be cooling, hinting that a rate cut might come as soon as September."Inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated. In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective," the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's policy-setting body, said in a statement after a two-day policy meeting.Regarding the Fed's statement, the language reflected an improvement compared to the June meeting. Previously, the policy statement mentioned only "modest further progress" in reducing price pressures.The committee reiterated that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.In addition, the committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, the statement said.When asked whether a September rate cut is a reasonable expectation, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters at a press conference Wednesday afternoon that "we have made no decisions about future meetings. That includes the September meeting."The Fed chair, however, noted that "the broad sense of the committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate."Noting that the last couple of inflation readings have "added to confidence," Powell said "we've seen progress across all three categories of core PCE inflations, goods, non-house services, and housing services."In the second quarter, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 2.6 percent, compared with an increase of 3.4 percent in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased 2.9 percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.7 percent in the previous quarter."We think the time (for a rate cut) is approaching. If we get the data that we hope we get, a reduction or policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting," the Fed chief said.CARACAS -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday submitted an appeal to the Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice to audit and certify the results of Sunday's presidential elections amid calls for greater transparency.Maduro asked the highest court to summon the pertinent institutions "to compare all the elements of evidence and certify, by carrying out an expert opinion of the highest technical level, the electoral results of July 28."He went to the Supreme Court accompanied by First Lady Cilia Flores, Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez, Attorney General Reinaldo Munoz and Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil, among other members of his cabinet.In remarks to the press upon leaving the court, Maduro said: "I have told the Electoral Chamber that I am willing to be summoned, interrogated ... investigated by the Electoral Chamber as the winning presidential candidate of Sunday's elections and as head of state; I am showing up, I am submitting to justice."The Great Patriotic Pole and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, which backed Maduro's reelection bid, are ready "to present 100 percent of the electoral records that are in our hands," he said, adding that the Electoral Chamber should expect the same from each candidate and political organization.On Monday, Venezuela's National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner of the presidential elections, paving the way for his third six-year term, from 2025 to 2031.With eyes peeking out from a hidden burrow in the grass, the creature quickly scurries toward a block that buzzed with life just hours earlier. It's one of the nocturnal rulers of the street — rats — poised to attack the garbage in black plastic bags piled high on the sidewalks of New York City, awaiting pickup by sanitation workers.Street garbage has become a daily banquet for New York's rat population. The city generates about 14 billion pounds of trash a year, potentially feeding roughly 3 million rats. That's the number of rodents estimated in the city in a 2023 study.Controlling the rat population in the city remains a challenge despite numerous efforts. In January, the city Sanitation Department said New York was winning the war on rats, as rodent sightings in mitigation zones were down across the city.In early July, Mayor Eric Adams joined department officials to unveil the city's first official trash bin meant to keep the streets cleaner and curb the rat population. All residential buildings with one to nine units will be required to put trash in rat-proof containers as of Nov 12.Once the rule takes effect, officials say that 70 percent of all trash in New York City will be containerized.The latest attempt to lower or control the number of rodents featured the formation of the "Rat Pack", a nickname inspired by the group of 1950s celebrities that included Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. Adams asked New Yorkers to join the "elite squad of dedicated anti-rat activists"."We're really proud of the city's efforts of going after public enemy number one. Now we're doing something new. We're recruiting an entirely new generation of the 'Rat Pack,'" Adams said during a news conference in Brooklyn on Sunday.Though anyone can join, the initiative is designed for building superintendents, property managers, community gardeners and business owners."From cutting our rats' food supplies to closing down rat havens, Rat Pack members will be able to defend their communities from rodents and achieve our goal of making New York City the least rat-friendly city in America," he said. "We need you to help reduce the rat population in our city, and the rat swag will be your badge of honor as you walk through your communities."That swag is a T-shirt or hat with a rat logo on it. But before they can get their hands on one, there are three things New Yorkers must do.They must attend a two-hour New York City Health Department "rat academy" session that will give instructions on how to deal with rodents. They will need to participate in a rat-mitigation event and go out on a rat walk, hosted by Kathy Corradi, the city's first "rat czar".A former elementary school teacher in Brooklyn, Corradi was appointed last year by the mayor. She coordinates with city government agencies, community organizations and the private sector to reduce the city's rat population.City officials are so determined to fight the rat population that they will host a "National Urban Rat Summit" Sept 18-19. It will bring together researchers at academic institutions and municipal pest-control managers from Boston, New Orleans and Seattle. They will share best practices on rodent mitigation and the science of urban rat management."New Yorkers may not know this about me — but I hate rats, and I'm confident most of our city's residents do as well," Adams said in announcing the summit. "The best way to defeat our enemy is to know our enemy. That's why we're holding this inaugural summit to bring experts and leaders from across the country together to better understand urban rats and how to manage their populations."Reaction from some city residents to the Rat Pack and the new garbage bins ranged from "at least it's an effort" to "it's a waste of time" and "only in New York, a rat patrol"."It all sounds like a good cause, because there is a lot of trash in New York, like nobody cares," Anaiyah Glover, a resident of the Bronx, told China Daily. "I've seen thousands, thousands [of rats]," she said. "They have run at me, straight on. It was scary."She recalled when a "big fat one" ran toward her. She moved to the side of the street and jumped over the "baby melon big" rat. "It was really fat, like, he ate a lot," she said.Maura, who asked that her last name not be used, lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with her husband and teenage son. One evening, back when her son was a toddler, she said she took him inside their building lobby and then came back out for his stroller. "There was a rat in it," she said. Her son had followed her: "'It's so cute,' he said as I screamed."CARACAS -- Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Yvan Gil on Tuesday announced that the Venezuelan government has decided to sever diplomatic relations with Peru."The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has decided to sever diplomatic relations with the Republic of Peru, on the basis of Article 45 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961," Gil said on social media platform X.Gil's announcement followed statements by his Peruvian counterpart, Javier Gonzalez-Olaechea, who said, "Peru will not accept the violation of the popular will of the Venezuelan people," referring to the country's presidential election."We are forced to make this decision after the reckless declarations of the Peruvian foreign minister that ignore the will of the Venezuelan people and our constitution," the Venezuelan diplomat added.California is experiencing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, with recent data indicating a sharp increase in the levels of coronavirus in wastewater across the state.The levels are considered "very high" and have been since early July, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.For the seven-day period ending July 20, the wastewater levels were at 93 percent of the peak in the summer of 2022 and have already surpassed last summer's peak.Overall, 37 states and the District of Columbia have rates of coronavirus in wastewater classified as "high" or "very high".As of last weekend, California's current seven-day test-positivity rate was 13.8 percent, an increase of 2.3 percentage points from the previous week. That rate is approaching the highs of the summer of 2022, which peaked at 16.1 percent.Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious disease at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, told the Los Angeles Times that more people are seeking outpatient treatment."The wastewater numbers are still headed up. So we're definitely seeing more and more cases," she said. "If you have cough-and-cold symptoms, at this point, living in Los Angeles, you should really think that they are COVID until proven otherwise."There was an average of 286 COVID-19-positive patients in hospitals for the week ending July 20 in Los Angeles County. That number is about half of last summer's peak and one-quarter of the peak from summer 2022."This virus is still very, very new to humans, and the virus wants to live, and the way that it lives is by evading immunity," said Hudson.Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at the University of California, San Francisco, told the Los Angeles Times that there is lot of COVID outside the hospital, and "almost everybody has it".Other states with "high" or "very high" coronavirus levels in wastewater are Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.Agencies contributed to this story.Footwear retailers and other importers in the United States may have to put on their running shoes in a rush to bring in goods before tariffs on China get raised again.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who kicked off the tariff spree on Chinese imports in 2018 when he was US president, earlier this year floated the idea of putting a 60 percent tariff on all imports from China and 10 percent on all imports worldwide."That (possibility) is obviously driving a lot of interest for our members about how to start to bring in products maybe prior to some of those decisions to push duties up," said Matt Priest, the president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.He said it would "obviously impact costing and our consumers, who ultimately pay the price of those duties".Priest made the comments at a Port of Los Angeles webinar on July 17 about monthly container traffic at the California port, where two-thirds of US shoe imports arrive.Port of LA Executive Director Gene Seroka said that footwear traffic is a top 10 driver of import volume at the port "year after year".More than 90 percent of the shoes sold in the US come from Asia — from China, Vietnam and Indonesia, Priest said.The US footwear industry imports 2.5 billion pairs of shoes a year and already pays $4 billion a year in tariffs, according to footwearnews.com.In 2019, Trump's second round of tariffs added a 15 percent duty on about half of the footwear imports from China. He cut the rate to 7.5 percent in 2020.Priest said the industry has seen weaker purchasing power from people in households making under $100,000 a year, and they could face higher costs buying shoes in the back-to-school season."Footwear is kind of the barometer of the overall health of the economy because people need to buy shoes," he said.In an interview with Fox News Sunday on Feb 4, Trump dismissed the notion of a "trade war" with China but said of the 60 percent tariff idea, "maybe it's going to be even more".Trump imposed tariffs on an estimated $380 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2018 and 2019. The administration of US President Joe Biden has kept most of those levies in place, and in May, raised some others on an additional $18 billion in Chinese imports, such as electric vehicles and semiconductors.In a July 18 speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump said he would welcome Chinese EV companies, if they built factories in the US."Those plants are going to be built in the United States, and our people are going to man those plants," he said, or he would impose tariffs as high as 200 percent on the cars entering the country.Priest said there's been a "run on capacity to get product in" ahead of the start of the higher tariffs on electric vehicles on Aug 1, which has led to a spike in shipping container rates.Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, told China Daily that higher tariffs could present a dilemma for the Federal Reserve, which has signaled it would eventually cut interest rates."More tariffs will certainly add to inflation and make the Fed's job harder. My guess is that the Trump and Biden tariffs added about one percentage point to the CPI (consumer price index) between 2018 and 2023, in other words about 0.2 percentage points annually for five years.'High probability'"If Trump is elected, I see a high probability that he will slap high tariffs on virtually all US imports from China," Hufbauer said. "Trump has talked about a 60 percent rate; my forecast is that he will at least go for 40 percent."China will retaliate. This will cause an enormous amount of trade diversion, both Chinese and US exports. It will also cause some outright trade destruction, maybe on the order of $200 billion annually," he said."That's bad news for the world economy. A few other countries will be tempted to increase their own tariffs or nontariff barriers, if only to dampen the effects of trade diversion. All told, this will shave something off world economic growth, perhaps 0.1 percent," he said.In a June 26 article, Erica York, senior economist and research director with the nonprofit Tax Foundation's Center for Federal Tax Policy, wrote that the current Trump-Biden tariffs amount to an average annual tax increase on US households of $625.York estimated that the current tariffs would lead to the loss of 142,000 full-time equivalent jobs.CARACAS -- Venezuelan authorities have arrested 749 people for participating in violent riots following Sunday's presidential elections, Attorney General Tarek William Saab said Tuesday.Those arrested face charges of "incitement, obstructing public roads, hate crimes ... resisting arrest and, in the most serious cases, terrorism," the attorney general said at a press conference.According to Saab, as a result of the violence, 48 military and police officers have been injured, some by gunshots, and a military officer in northern Aragua state was killed.Authorities have verified that far-right groups have been using minors and people under the influence of drugs in riots in various cities in Venezuela.The riots, Saab said, are not protests but rather the work of "armed criminals" looking "to create chaos. They wanted ... this to escalate to the national level ... so there is foreign intervention."Venezuela held presidential elections on Sunday, and the National Electoral Council on Monday declared President Nicolas Maduro the winner of the elections.As wildfires in California burn hundreds of thousands of acres and threaten houses, US home insurers reported their biggest loss of the century last year. A report by AM Best, a credit rating agency, said that "the segment suffered a $15.2 billion underwriting loss in 2023, more than double the losses seen in the previous year. The 2023 loss was also the worst this century, with $14.8 billion in losses in 2011 the next highest."In 2023, there were a record 28 weather and climate disasters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with total damages of at least $92.9 billion. For comparison, the annual average for such events between 1980 and 2023 was 8.5.While CLM (Claims and Litigation Management), an organization for claims and litigation professionals, estimated that Hurricane Beryl, on the US Gulf Coast, the first hurricane of 2024, would cost the US insurance industry between $2.5 billion and $4.5 billion, more than 100 wildfires are raging in the United States, with the largest burning in California.According to California fire officials, the Park Fire, the sixth-largest wildfire in California history, had burned more than 370,000 acres as of Monday — an area larger than the city of Phoenix — with 134 structures destroyed.Another wildfire, the Borel Fire, destroyed the historic mining community of Havilah, where only a few buildings were left standing, according to the Los Angeles Times. An evacuation order was in effect for the town with a population of 250.In total, more than 726,000 acres have burned in the state this year as of Monday, with 232 structures destroyed, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). In Oregon, the 2024 wildfire season so far has burned 1,142,727 acres, according to the Oregon Fires and Hotspots Dashboard. The Durkee Fire, the largest active blaze, has burned almost 300,000 acres, with 23 structures destroyed.Multiple fires also are burning in Utah and Colorado.A wildfire in the Canadian Rockies' largest national park is still not controlled, according to the Jasper National Park Facebook page. An estimated 30 percent of houses and businesses in the popular Canadian resort town of Jasper, Alberta, were incinerated as a wildfire continued to roar through the area.  The fire forced thousands of visitors, seasonal workers and residents to flee Jasper. The AM Best report said one of the major reasons for the increased losses is population migration into areas where weather-related events are occurring more frequently."The US population overall grew 7.4 percent between 2010-2020 but rose 10.2 percent in the South and 9.2 percent in the West during the period," said David Blades, associate director of industry research and analytics at AM Best. "Population trends show residents increasingly moving toward regions that are more prone to hurricanes, severe convective storms or even wildfires."According to the US census, California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Washington accounted for 53 percent of US population growth between 2010 and 2020. All six states are prone to severe weather-related events.Christopher Graham, senior industry analyst at AM Best, said in a company video that if the Category 5 Hurricane Andrew in 1992 occurred today, the damage could double due to population growth. At $58.6 billion in damages, Hurricane Andrew is rated as the most costly catastrophe for the US between 1900-2023.For the flood-prone South, more buildings mean less nature to absorb rainfall, thus causing more flooding, according to Graham."The same goes for California with the wildfires. Building in areas more prone to wildfires and then human activities create more wildfires" and "there are a whole lot of human activities in the area that's prone to catastrophes exacerbating catastrophes," Graham said.In the Park Fire, Ronnie Stout, 42, has been arrested and accused of starting the blaze. Stout is suspected of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully and causing the inferno, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said.Some insurance companies aren't writing new policies or are pulling out of the areas prone to catastrophes, said Graham.For example, State Farm, the largest homeowners insurance company in the US, will stop covering more than 72,000 homes and apartments in California this summer. The company said the decision is due to soaring costs, increasing wildfire risks and outdated regulations, The Orange County Register reported.Agencies contributed to this story.mayzhou@chinadailyusa.comWASHINGTON - US President Joe Biden on Monday announced a plan to reform the Supreme Court, saying that he looked forward to working with Congress to prevent the abuse of presidential power and "restore faith" in the nation's highest court."President Biden believes that no one -- neither the President nor the Supreme Court -- is above the law," the White House said in a fact sheet.In the face of this "crisis of confidence" in America's democratic institutions, Biden was calling for three reforms to "restore trust and accountability": No immunity for crimes a former president committed in office; Term limits for Supreme Court justices; Binding code of conduct for the Supreme Court, according to the fact sheet.Firstly, Biden called for a constitutional amendment that makes clear no president is above the law or immune from prosecution for crimes committed while in office.This came in response to the court's July 1 ruling, which determined that presidents cannot be prosecuted for "official acts" performed while in office, a decision related to a case involving former President Donald Trump, who was indicted by a federal grand jury for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.Secondly, Biden supported a system in which the president would appoint a Justice every two years to spend 18 years in active service on the Supreme Court. Currently, Supreme Court Justices serve lifetime appointments on the court.During his tenure, Trump nominated three conservative justices, shifting the balance of the Supreme Court from a 5-4 to a 6-3 conservative majority, thereby strengthening the conservative advantage. Biden has become more vocal in his criticism of the Supreme Court and its decisions."In recent years, the Supreme Court has overturned long-established legal precedents protecting fundamental rights. This Court has gutted civil rights protections, taken away a woman's right to choose, and now granted Presidents broad immunity from prosecution for crimes they commit in office," the White House said.Thirdly, Biden believed that Congress should pass binding, enforceable conduct and ethics rules that require Justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity, and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest."Recent ethics scandals involving some Justices have caused the public to question the fairness and independence that are essential for the Court to faithfully carry out its mission to deliver justice for all Americans," according to the fact sheet.Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have faced scrutiny for their personal conduct. Thomas did not disclose receiving extravagant travel from wealthy Republican donors. Alito's wife displayed flags outside their homes associated with the Jan 6, 2021, Capitol riot and efforts to overturn the 2020 election."President Biden and Vice President (Kamala) Harris look forward to working with Congress and empowering the American people to prevent the abuse of Presidential power, restore faith in the Supreme Court, and strengthen the guardrails of democracy," the White House said.In a statement released Monday, Harris, who has become the Democrats' likely White House nominee, said that "there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court as its fairness has been called into question after numerous ethics scandals and decision after decision overturning long-standing precedent."Implementing term limits and an ethics code for the Supreme Court would likely necessitate new legislation, which means the currently divided Congress is not anticipated to address this issue before the yearend. The House is controlled by Republicans, while Democrats have a slim majority in the Senate.Furthermore, even if Democrats gain control of both chambers following the election in November, they are unlikely to achieve the 60 Senate seats required to overcome a filibuster. A constitutional amendment would face even greater challenges.Reform and modernization were key takeaways from the communique issued at the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, experts from a think tank in the United States said.They also see reform and modernization as crucial to boosting productivity and long-term growth through technological innovation.Guoguang Wu, a senior fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, said the Party is sending a "very strong signal to Chinese people and the international society that we will have reform".Wu offered his observations on Friday at a webinar held by Asia Society, a think tank and nonprofit organization, titled "The Third Plenum: What is Xi Jinping's Plan for China?"Lizzi Lee, a fellow on Chinese economy at the ASPI's Center for China Analysis, noted that the emphasis of the third plenary session was on "Chinese-style modernization", including emphasis on technology innovation and the "new quality productive forces".The plenary session also highlighted challenges such as income inequality, trade tensions and fiscal issues and noted strategies to address those issues through supply chain policies, market roles and financial reforms.Lee noted two other points: self-sufficiency and major breakthroughs, especially in frontier science, which is "no surprise given the rising geopolitical tensions, particularly with the US".She said the plan also emphasizes a dual role of State guidance and intense competition among private sector companies and entrepreneurs.In its original text, the communique said that "we must better leverage the role of the market, foster a fairer and more dynamic market environment, and make resource allocation as efficient and productive as possible. We will lift restrictions on the market while ensuring effective regulation, striving to better maintain order in the market and remedy market failures".The government "will continue to provide guidance and support for industry supply chains, while the private sector drives growth and innovation". That strategy has already been successful in the electric vehicle and battery sectors, and China plans to extend it to key areas such as semiconductors, medical equipment and machine tools, Lee said.China has a major economic goal to lift per capita GDP to that of a mid-level developed country by 2035, and to reach that target, China's economy would need to grow at about 4.5 to 5 percent annually, she said.According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on July 15, China's economy grew by 4.7 percent in the second quarter of the year after 5.3 percent growth in the first quarter."It's clear to me from the third plenum document that the Chinese leadership has decided that to sustain this level of growth, China needs systemic upgrading along the global value chain, not just short-term stimuli," Lee said.Bert Hofman, an honorary senior fellow on Chinese economy at the ASPI's Center for China Analysis, said the document is "about high-quality development, the high-standard socialist market economy as being the tool for this Chinese modernization".Hofman saw a consistent policy on the supply side. He said that the policy is about significantly increasing investment in science and technology and integrating it with industrial policy. The goal is to use various tools to link current and future technologies with high-quality productive forces.Hofman also said that one of the most important points of the third plenum is the reaffirmation of a key principle acknowledged by the third plenary session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 2013: that the market plays a decisive role in allocating resources.He said that he believes that the government-market balance is now even stronger than in 2013.Although this principle wasn't mentioned in the communique, it is reiterated in the resolution, emphasizing the need to leverage the market's role, he noted.The plenum clearly recognizes the fiscal problems in China, particularly at the local level due to issues in the real estate sector, he said.There are promises of tax and transfer reforms, centralizing expenditures and improving budget management. The resolution provides a clearer framework and direction for addressing those issues, he added.WASHINGTON - The US federal government's total public debt has surpassed 35 trillion US dollars for the first time, as recorded at the end of last week, according to data released by the Treasury Department Monday.The total public debt outstanding climbed to 35 trillion dollars on Friday, according to the newly released Daily Treasury Statement. The data is updated at the end of each business day with data from the previous business day.Just seven months ago, the US national debt surpassed 34 trillion dollars in late December 2023. Three months before that, the United States reached a historic milestone by passing 33 trillion dollars."The borrowing just keeps marching along, reckless and unyielding," said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, in a statement. "Yet despite all the risks and warning signs, these alarm bells seem to be falling on deaf ears.""We are going to have to get serious about the debt, and soon. Election years cannot be an exception for trying to prevent completely foreseeable dangers -- and the debt is one of the major dangers we are facing," said MacGuineas.According to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan organization focused on addressing US long-term fiscal challenges, the national debt of 35.001 trillion dollars translates to 103,945 dollars of debt per person in the United States."Our deficits are caused mainly by predictable structural factors: our aging baby-boom generation, rising healthcare costs, and a tax system that does not bring in enough money to pay for what the government has promised its citizens," the foundation said.Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former official at the International Monetary Fund, told Xinhua earlier that "there can be no question that the US budget deficit is on an unsustainable path."The "dangerous trajectory" poses "serious questions for the dollar" and inflation's long-run outlook, Lachman said.China congratulated Venezuela on Monday on successfully holding its presidential election, as well as Nicolas Maduro on his reelection as president.China and Venezuela are good friends and good partners supporting each other, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular news conference.Noting that this year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations, Lin said China highly values the development of bilateral ties, and hopes to work with Venezuela to keep enriching the content of their all-weather strategic partnership to better benefit the people of both countries.Incumbent Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has secured a third term after being declared the winner of the South American nation's presidential elections, according to the electoral authority.Venezuelans took to the polls on July 28 in a hotly contested election between Maduro and retired diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez, the face of a coalition of opposition parties.The results were expected to be challenged by opposition parties, who allege widespread fraud in counting of votes.The National Electoral Council (CNE) said that with 80 percent of votes counted, Maduro had secured 51.2 percent of the vote, ahead of Gonzalez on 44.2 percent. The CNE said it announced the results as Maduro's lead was insurmountable.Maduro's United Socialist Party has been in power for a quarter of a century, with Maduro in office as president since 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez. His next six-year term starts in 2025.The president went into the election trailing in opinion polls with opposition parties blaming him for an economic contraction unprecedented outside wartime.Gonzalez represented the Democratic Unity Platform after being chosen in April to replace Maria Corina Machado, who was blocked from running in elections for 15 years by the country's Supreme Tribunal of Justice.Eight other candidates stood on the ballot but only Gonzalez posed any real challenge to Maduro."For the first time in history, there are nine opposition candidates. This has never happened in any presidential election," said Franco Vielma, a sociologist at the Mision Verdad think tank."All remained separate, and the traditional opposition candidate (Gonzalez) did not benefit from any withdrawals by other opposition candidates," Vielma said, noting that splitting the vote indicated a severe weakness among the opposition.Despite enjoying momentum, Gonzalez could not manage to unite the opposition, Vielma said.Gonzalez had to overcome significant challenges including the fact that he was virtually unknown before being nominated, Vielma said, noting that this worked against the opposition."The electoral process was optimal," said Deny Reyes, a director at Radio del Sur in Caracas, the country's capital. "This was a positive and mostly peaceful election.""The streets are quiet," he said, although he noted that crowds were beginning to gather.Despite the potential for violence and unrest, the vote was mostly peaceful.Polls opened at 6 am but many voters started lining up to vote hours before. Some 21 million people were eligible to vote in 15,000 voting centers set up across the country.According to Vielma from Mision Verdad, Maduro has claimed he "plans to advance the diversification of the economy away from oil dependence, promote small and medium-sized enterprises, and maintain state control over strategic resources".Venezuela has some of the largest oil reserves in the world and was once one of the continent's richest economies.However, falling oil prices, domestic shortages, and hyperinflation have seen unrest and the mass emigration of an estimated 8 million Venezuelans.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.CARACAS -- Venezuelans went to polling stations across the country and cast ballots on Sunday in the presidential election.Aime Nogal Mendez, a member of the National Electoral Council (CNE), said she has been "touring voting centers" since early Sunday morning.The official CNE account on social media platform X clarified that, according to the law, voters must show their ID card to vote, even if it is expired. The law states that polling stations will be open from 6:00 am (1000 GMT) to 6:00 pm (2200 GMT), and will stay open as long as there are people waiting to vote.Minutes after the voting process began, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro Moros, who's seeking a third term in office, cast his vote at Fuerte Tiuna, Caracas. He said the election had started peacefully and called for high voter turnout."I am sure everything will go well, and tomorrow will be a beautiful day," Maduro told the media."Respect for the electoral process is respect for the Constitution," said the president, highlighting the need for all participating political forces to respect the electoral authority and recognize the official results of the National Electoral Council.Maduro is running against nine presidential candidates. Of all the candidates, Edmundo Gonzalez, a retired diplomat, is seen as a significant challenge to Maduro.More than 21.6 million Venezuelans are eligible to vote, choosing from among 10 presidential candidates. The head of state will lead the nation from 2025 to 2031. NEW YORK -- SpaceX and NASA said on Friday they planned to launch the SpaceX Crew-9 mission, a crew rotation mission to the International Space Station (ISS), no earlier than Aug 18.According to the announcement, the international crew will lift off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft.Crew-9 is the ninth crew rotation mission with SpaceX to the ISS under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.The spacecraft is scheduled to carry four astronauts to the orbiting laboratory for a six-month science research plan.In a dramatic move to address California's long-standing homelessness crisis, Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday issued an executive order for dismantling thousands of homeless encampments across the state.The action marks the most comprehensive response yet to a recent US Supreme Court ruling that expanded government authority to remove homeless individuals from public spaces."This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them — and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same," Newsom said in a statement.The governor's decision comes in the wake of a June 28 Supreme Court ruling that upheld an Oregon city's ban on homeless residents sleeping outdoors, saying the city had not violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment by ticketing homeless campers.The ruling overturned previous opinions by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, which had deemed it unconstitutional to punish people for sleeping in public spaces when they had no other legal options.Many politicians, including Newsom, blamed the appellate court's rulings, saying it limited the abilities of cities to address homelessness with arrests and citations.California's homelessness crisis has reached staggering proportions, with more than 180,000 people estimated to have experienced homelessness on any given night in 2023. Of these, 123,000 individuals were living in unsheltered conditions, inhabiting tents, trailers and vehicles across the state, according to the governor's office.Since taking office in 2019, Newsom's administration has invested approximately $24 billion to address homelessness. More than 165,000 homeless people were moved into interim or permanent housing in the 2022-23 fiscal year.Additionally, the California Department of Transportation has removed 11,188 encampments from state right of way since July 2021, according to the executive order.However, the effectiveness of the cleanup efforts has been called into question. A recent study by the RAND Center on Housing and Homelessness found that encampment cleanups have no long-term effect on reducing the number of people living on the streets.The study pointed to rising rents, high home prices, regulatory barriers to housing production and a lack of coordination among service entities as contributing factors to the persistent problem.The root causes of homelessness in California are complex and multifaceted, said researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, in their report last year. The study revealed that 75 percent of homeless adults in the state were local residents, with many citing unaffordable housing as the primary reason for their situation.California has the nation's highest housing costs, further complicating efforts to address the crisis. And despite extensive investment in homelessness programs, the state still faces a shortage of emergency housing.A growing list of Hollywood celebrities have shifted their support to US Vice-President Kamala Harris following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race.Just a month ago, Hollywood's elite turned out in force for a fundraising event for Biden, organized by former DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg. The event raised more than $30 million, making it the largest single-evening campaign haul in Democratic history. Attendees included George Clooney, Barbra Streisand and Julia Roberts.Beneath the surface camaraderie at the fundraising event, however, signs of strain emerged due to Biden's meandering answers. Influential Hollywood figures, who had consistently supported the president, expressed significant concerns over the 81-year-old's cognitive abilities, according to the Los Angeles Times.Biden's disastrous debate performance against former president Donald Trump on June 27 further compounded those concerns. Loyal supporters, previously steadfast in their backing, began advocating for him to step down.The cascade of influential voices calling for change significantly shifted the political landscape, leading to increased support for Harris. On Sunday, Biden dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House and endorsed Harris to succeed him.In 24 hours, stars from film, television, fashion, music and media — such as Jamie Lee Curtis, Spike Lee, Questlove and Ariana Grande — have voiced their support for Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.Harris raised $81 million for her White House bid in the first 24 hours after Biden announced he would not seek reelection, setting a record for the largest campaign haul in that time frame. According to Harris' campaign, more than 880,000 donors contributed to her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees.As expected, Biden and Harris received the majority of their funds from Californians, reflecting the state's large population and concentration of wealthy donors.Support from high-profile figures can significantly enhance a campaign, both financially and in terms of public visibility. A-list endorsements can attract considerable attention and potentially sway voter opinions, according to Andrzej Bartkowiak, a Hollywood cinematographer and film director.Hollywood also influences public opinion through its entertainment, according to writer and producer Bob Underwood."If you create content that resonates emotionally with people, you gain insights into how your audience feels about various issues. That's why Hollywood plays a crucial role for Democrats," Underwood told China Daily.Wilmot Reed Hastings, co-founder and executive chairman of Netflix, has donated $7 million to a super PAC (political action committee) supporting Harris, the largest single contribution to a candidate, according to a source who wasn't authorized to speak publicly."We are fully committed to Kamala and have been since she announced," said Andy Spahn, a Los Angeles political consultant who collaborates with media figures like Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg. "There is tremendous excitement and energy around Kamala's candidacy. We are all in."Agencies contributed to this story.Amid rapidly growing economic and social links, the Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, or China-CELAC Forum, marked its first decade last week.Since its inception in 2014, when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Brazil, the forum has facilitated over 90 cooperative events, strengthening links between China and the LAC region through trade, investment and partnerships across multiple industries. Trade between China and the region has almost doubled at that time to almost half a trillion dollars."In recent years, in line with the rise of its international prominence, China has promoted a set of multilateral cooperation mechanisms aimed at strengthening ties with other regions of the world," said Sebastian Schulz, a researcher at the National University of La Plata in Argentina and a researcher at the university's Center for Chinese Studies."The purpose of these initiatives is to create spaces for dialogue and partnership in areas such as commerce, finance, culture, society, education and technology, among others."Trade facilitation has been the most significant contribution of the forum, said Renzo Burotto, a historian at the University of Chile. As a result of the forum's work, China has become the largest trading partner for several Latin American countries, including Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay."Now that China has learned from its integration and going-out experience, it has positioned itself as an irreplaceable trading partner, strengthened commercial and financial institutions at both bilateral and multilateral levels with Latin American countries, and aligned its industrial and development policies with the region's export demands," Burotto said.The forum has helped China strengthen existing free trade agreements, or FTAs, with Chile, Peru and Costa Rica while facilitating Chinese investments in Latin American infrastructure projects by providing a channel to identify opportunities and coordinate priorities.CELAC was founded in 2010 to facilitate the integration of economies of some 33 member states throughout the LAC region.The forum emerged four years later when, on July 17, 2014, Xi attended a meeting of regional leaders in Brazil. That was a year after Xi launched China's Belt and Road Initiative to boost connectivity among countries in multiple regions.The first meeting of foreign ministers of forum member countries was held in Beijing in January 2015 and participants signed the first cooperation plan that included provisions to promote infrastructure development.Trade between China and Latin America has surged.Between 2000 and 2020, annual trade between the two sides skyrocketed from $12 billion to $315 billion, a 26-fold increase, according to the World Economic Forum. In 2022, trade stood at around $450 billion.Lin Jian, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, commented on the anniversary during a regular news conference on July 17, and highlighted the 90 events that have been held through the forum.Continuous progress"Over the past decade, thanks to the joint efforts of both sides, continuous progress has been made in building a China-LAC community with a shared future; and the China-LAC relationship has ushered in a new era characterized by equality, mutual benefit, innovation, openness and more benefit for the people," he said.Lin noted that China has signed Belt and Road cooperation memorandums of understanding with 22 countries in the region, and the annual trade is now nearly $500 billion.China pursued "dual-track cooperation", said Schulz. "On one hand, it's through bilateral agreements like those signed under strategic partnerships, Belt and Road Initiative or free trade agreements. On the other hand, the modalities, guiding principles and objectives of the relationships are defined regionally within the framework of the China-CELAC Forum."Despite concerns that may arise in individual countries, Burotto said Latin America should maintain strong relations with both China and traditional partners. He called for leveraging the platform to address mutual interests and concerns."Strengthening Latin America's engagement with China could demonstrate not only the interdependence of a shared future but also the high costs and counterproductiveness of decoupling or de-risking from China due to political pressures," said Burotto.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.In a busy week for Boeing, the aircraft maker has resumed delivery of 737 MAX aircraft to Chinese airlines, picked up some large orders and reached a guilty-plea deal on a criminal conspiracy charge regarding two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX jet.Boeing handed over a 737 MAX 8 to Xiamen Airlines on July 20 from Zhoushan Putuoshan Airport, where Boeing's 737 completion and delivery center is located, according to Simple Flying, an online aviation news outlet. Soon after, Boeing delivered another 737 MAX 8 to Hainan Airlines.Boeing's deliveries to China had been temporarily suspended since April due to a regulatory review of the 25-hour cockpit voice recorder (CVR) batteries.Boeing's deliveries to China have been intermittent since 2019, in part due to two fatal crashes of MAX jets that killed 348 people, and also from rising tensions over issues ranging from trade, technology to national security between the US and China.Simple Fly reported that 80 737 MAXs assigned to Chinese airlines haven't been delivered, with aircraft ages varying from 1 to more than 5 years.Overall, about 200 fully or mostly finished airplanes are parked in airfields, outside plants or other locations, awaiting parts such as interiors or engines.Boeing has been experiencing problems with plane delivery since the two MAX crashes, and recently slowed production again due to regulatory and safety scrutiny after the door panel of a Boeing 737 MAX 9 operated by Alaska Airlines blew off midair in January.Boeing's statement on second-quarter deliveries showed that the company has delivered 175 planes in the first half of 2024, a big reduction compared to 266 from the first half of 2023.Despite all the issues, Boeing picked up large orders at the Farnborough International Air show outside London, which concludes Friday.Korean Air said it would purchase up to 50 Boeing wide-body planes. The agreement calls for the airline to receive 20 777Xs and 20 787 Dreamliners, with an option to buy 10 more Dreamliners.In another agreement, with Japan Air, Boeing will deliver up to 20 additional 787 Dreamliners, including 10 787-9s, with options for 10 more.Qatar Airways also signed an agreement to purchase an additional 20 Boeing 777X aircraft, bringing the airline's commitment to the twin-aisle plane with folding wings to 94, including both passenger and freighter variants.Boeing also received a significant order of 20 737 MAX 8 narrow-body planes from Macquarie AirFinance.Overall, Boeing received orders for 118 planes at the air show, while Airbus received total orders of 85 planes as of Thursday.While Boeing is picking up pace in orders, it is still facing the aftermath of safety issues related to its MAX jets. A court filing submitted on Wednesday showed that Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government and would pay another $243.6 million in a penalty on top of the same amount previously paid by Boeing if the deal is approved.Based on the plea agreement reached earlier with the US Justice Department in July, Boeing admitted that through its employees it made an agreement "by dishonest means" to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration that evaluated the 737 MAX.As a result of Boeing's deception, the FAA was given incomplete and inaccurate information about the plane's flight-control software and how much training pilots would need to operate it before the agency gave its approval.The court document says that the US government won't charge Boeing with any other criminal offense related to the conduct. Boeing also will be put on a three-year organizational probation and "shall invest in its compliance, quality, and safety programs a total of at least $455 million". Boeing is also required to have its board meet with the families of crash victims.Agencies contributed to this story.In a dramatic move to address California's longstanding homelessness crisis, Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday issued an executive order mandating the dismantling of thousands of homeless encampments across the state.The action marks the most comprehensive response yet to a recent US Supreme Court's ruling that expanded government authority to remove homeless individuals from public spaces."This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them — and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same," Newsom said in a statement. "The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets. There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part."The governor's decision comes in the wake of a June 28 Supreme Court ruling that upheld an Oregon city's ban on homeless residents sleeping outdoors, saying the city had not violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment by ticketing homeless campers.The ruling overturned previous opinions by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, which had deemed it unconstitutional to punish people for sleeping in public spaces when they had no other legal options.Many politicians, including Newsom, blamed the appellate court's rulings, saying it limited the abilities of cities to address homelessness with arrests and citations.California's homelessness crisis has reached staggering proportions, with more than 180,000 people estimated to have experienced homelessness on any given night in 2023. Of these, 123,000 individuals were living in unsheltered conditions, inhabiting tents, trailers and vehicles across the state, according to the governor's office.Since taking office in 2019, Newsom's administration has invested approximately $24 billion into addressing homelessness. More than 165,000 people were moved from homelessness into interim or permanent housing in the 2022-23 fiscal year.Additionally, the California Department of Transportation has removed 11,188 encampments and 248,275 cubic yards of debris from state rights of way since July 2021, according to the executive order.However, the effectiveness of the cleanup efforts has been called into question. A recent study by the RAND Center on Housing and Homelessness found that encampment cleanups have no long-term effect on reducing the number of people living on the streets.The study pointed to rising rents, high home prices, regulatory barriers to housing production and a lack of coordination among service entities as contributing factors to the persistent problem.The root causes of homelessness in California are complex and multifaceted, said researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, in their report last year. The study revealed that 75 percent of homeless adults in the state were local residents, with many citing unaffordable housing as the primary reason for their situation.California has the nation's highest housing costs, further complicating efforts to address the crisis. And despite extensive investment in homelessness programs, the state still faces a shortage of emergency housing.The governor's order has ignited a heated debate among California officials and advocacy groups. Supporters of the move, like San Francisco Mayor London Breed, have welcomed the decision. The city plans to begin removing encampments next month and may start citing homeless individuals who refuse offers of shelter.On the other side of the debate, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who opposed the Supreme Court's decision, criticized Newsom's order."Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work," Bass said in a statement. "We thank the Governor for his partnership thus far and hope that he will continue collaboration on strategies that work."A growing list of Hollywood celebrities have shifted their support to US Vice-President Kamala Harris following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race.Just a month ago, Hollywood's elite turned out in force for a fundraising event for Biden, organized by former DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg. The event raised more than $30 million, making it the largest single-evening campaign haul in Democratic history. Attendees included George Clooney, Barbra Streisand and Julia Roberts.Beneath the surface camaraderie at the fundraising event, however, signs of strain emerged due to Biden's meandering answers. Influential Hollywood figures, who had consistently supported the president, expressed significant concerns about the 81-year-old's cognitive abilities, according to the Los Angeles Times.Biden's disastrous debate performance against former president Donald Trump on June 27 further compounded those concerns. Loyal supporters, previously steadfast in their backing, began advocating for him to step down.The cascade of influential voices calling for change significantly shifted the political landscape, leading to increased support for Harris. On Sunday, Biden dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House and endorsed Harris to succeed him.Biden's decision to not seek re-election was praised by Democratic political figures and personalities. Clooney, in a statement to CNN, said Biden displayed "true leadership" and, "We're all so excited to do whatever we can to support Vice-President Harris in her historic quest."On June 10, the actor wrote a blistering op-ed for The New York Times, stating, "I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee."Andre Morgan, a film and television producer, told China Daily that Hollywood still loves Biden. "They love him more. Hollywood is very predictable," he said.In 24 hours, stars from film, television, fashion, music and media — such as Jamie Lee Curtis, Spike Lee, Questlove and Ariana Grande — have voiced their support for Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.Harris raised $81 million for her White House bid in the first 24 hours after Biden announced he would not seek reelection, setting a record for the largest campaign haul in that time frame. According to Harris' campaign, more than 880,000 donors contributed to her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees.As expected, Biden and Harris received the majority of their funds from Californians, reflecting the state's large population and concentration of wealthy donors.Support from high-profile figures can significantly enhance a campaign, both financially and in terms of public visibility. A-list endorsements can attract considerable attention and potentially sway voter opinions, according to Andrzej Bartkowiak, a Hollywood cinematographer and film director."I have faith in her to do what is right, not just for America but for the world," Bartkowiak said of Harris.Hollywood also influences public opinion through its entertainment, according to writer and producer Bob Underwood."If you create content that resonates emotionally with people, you gain insight into how your audience feels about various issues. That's why Hollywood plays a crucial role for Democrats," Underwood told China Daily.Wilmot Reed Hastings, co-founder and executive chairman of Netflix, has donated $7 million to a super PAC (political action committees) supporting Harris, the largest single contribution to a candidate, according to a source who wasn't authorized to speak publicly."We are fully committed to Kamala and have been since she announced," said Andy Spahn, a Los Angeles political consultant who collaborates with media figures like Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg. "There is tremendous excitement and energy around Kamala's candidacy. We are all in."Agencies contributed to this story.China's top UN envoy reiterated on Thursday that China is "not a creator of the Ukraine crisis" but rather, it promotes peace and a political solution."China is not a creator of the Ukraine crisis, much less a party to it," Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, said at a Security Council meeting initiated by Russia to discuss the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine."However, we did not sit by. On the contrary, we have all along insisted on promoting peace and negotiation and pushing for a political solution, (to) which the international community can bear witness," Fu said.Fu made his statement to refute a US envoy's claim that China's "partnership and large-scale support is propping up the Russian defense industrial base"."Russia deploys its acquisitions from China in attacks that kill civilians and destroy Ukraine's infrastructure," said Robert Wood, US deputy permanent representative to the UN.China's effort to promote peace in the Ukraine conflict "is not something that the United States can write off simply by resorting to slandering", Fu said.He emphasized that China has "never poured oil on the fire or taken advantage of the situation, nor has it provided lethal weapons to any party to the conflict. China exercises stricter control over military and civilian dual-use items."The Chinese enterprises carry out normal economic and trade cooperation with other countries, including Russia and Ukraine, in accordance with the rules of the WTO and the rules of the market. This is totally reasonable, justified and beyond reproach," Fu added.Fu mentioned Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba's visit to China and said the two sides had in-depth exchanges of views on the Ukraine crisis."We note that Foreign Minister Kuleba said that Ukraine values China's views and has carefully studied the six-point understandings proposed by China and Brazil on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, and that Ukraine is willing and ready to engage in dialogue and negotiation with Russia," he said.Kuleba met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday in Guangzhou, the first visit to China by a Ukrainian foreign minister since the military conflict with Russian began in February 2022.The Ukraine situation occurred against the "backdrop of historical complexities and practical realities", Fu said, adding that it is "in essence an eruption of security dynamics in Europe"."China had no part in creating this crisis, nor is it a party to the conflict. China has not provided lethal weaponry to any party to the conflict and has not and will not do anything to profit from it. China's position on the Ukraine issue has been consistent and clear. It is to urge and promote peace through a political settlement," he said.Pro-Palestine protests turned violent in Washington, DC, on Wednesday as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the US Congress.The protesters called for the United States to stop military aid to Israel. They hoisted Palestinian flags and burned US ones outside Washington's Union Station in demonstrations.About 1 kilometer away, police used pepper spray on some of the thousands of protesters who gathered outside the US Capitol while Netanyahu spoke.Before Netanyahu's speech, some protesters tried to block his route to the Capitol but were removed from the street by police. After being turned away by officers near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of the nearby rail station.Various videos posted on social media platform X showed police and protesters clashing, along with images of monuments covered in red paint and slogans in favor of Palestine and against Israel.Netanyahu was scheduled to meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris on Thursday and former president Donald Trump on Friday.Shortly before Netanyahu started speaking, Capitol Police said protesters in a march tried crossing a blockade and did not retreat when asked."The crowd failed to obey our order to move back from our police line. We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line," police said in a statement."We were no threat (to police)," said Sarah Bowles, a pharmacy technician from Delaware who attended the protest and assisted injured protesters. One of the protesting groups said police attacked demonstrators as they marched.Nine people were arrested across Washington, including four on charges of assaulting a police officer outside Union Station.Capitol Police said in a post on X that six people who disrupted Netanyahu's address were removed from the House gallery and arrested."Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the congressional buildings is against the law," police said.Outside of Union Station, protesters shouted "Let them go!" at officers who formed a circle around several people who were arrested. One person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance.'Wanted criminal'Pro-Palestinian groups and university students have for months protested in the US against Israel's offensive in Gaza, where health authorities say nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed.A stage at the protest site near the Capitol was decked out with banners, including one that declared the Israeli leader a "wanted war criminal" in reference to an arrest warrant sought by International Criminal Court prosecutors. Netanyahu denies war crime allegations.Dozens of Democratic lawmakers skipped Netanyahu's speech to Congress in protest over the deaths and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where nearly all of its 2.3 million people have been displaced.US Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up signs that said "war criminal "and "guilty of genocide" during Netanyahu's speech.Meanwhile, negotiations on a cease-fire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages and Biden and Netanyahu will discuss remaining gaps on Thursday, a senior US official said on Wednesday.The official, briefing reporters ahead of their talks, said the remaining obstacles are bridgeable and there will be more meetings aimed at reaching a deal between Israel and Hamas over the next week.Militants of Hamas stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies. Hamas and other militants are still holding 120 hostages, and Israel believes around a third of them are dead.Months of stop-start talks have failed to produce a deal to secure the release of some of the remaining hostages.The senior US official said both Israel and Hamas still have some issues to resolve but that a deal is close in which a six-week ceasefire would take place in exchange for the release of women, elderly men and wounded hostages over a 42-day period.Agencies contributed to this story.In face of the recent record-setting heat wave that tested California's power grid, experts attributed the state's success to its commitment to renewable energy and called for collaboration with China to accelerate the path to a fully clean electricity grid.California has set aggressive targets for renewable energy adoption, with state law requiring 90 percent of all retail electricity sales to come from renewable sources by 2035 and 100 percent by 2045. To meet those ambitious goals, the state is turning its attention to offshore wind power."In California, we have zero offshore wind today ... right now, China is far ahead of the US on the offshore wind industry," Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, and director of its Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory, said.California has designated two zones for offshore wind farms — one in Humboldt Bay in the north, and another in central California. "Offshore wind is exciting because it can be permitted more quickly and serves as a 'battery' for the grid," Kammen said.Offshore wind can complement the production cycles of solar and on-land wind energy. That characteristic is particularly valuable, as solar production quickly diminishes when the sun sets, requiring system operators to replace those megawatts with other sources in real time to maintain grid stability.It also offers flexibility in energy production, capable of generating electricity during peak demand and producing hydrogen or methanol during periods of low electricity prices. That flexibility presents huge opportunities to decarbonize sectors that have traditionally been difficult to transition to clean energy, Kammen said.The state can directly apply some of China's practices, he said. "The best way to apply it is not just to read about it, but to actually get partners from China."California has already taken such steps by inviting engineering groups from Norway. The state is also exploring opportunities in fuel cells, hydrogen production and other offshore renewable energy sources, such as tidal and wave power. Those areas promise rich opportunities for knowledge exchange and collaboration with Chinese partners, who have wide experience in the fields, Kammen added.California and China have a history of partnership in developing clean energy technologies.Kammen, however, stressed the need to accelerate the collaborations. He highlighted his own partnerships with research colleagues at Tsinghua University and North China Electric Power University, as well as with Chinese companies such as Geely."We want to build more of those teams so that we can move quickly when the politics let it happen," he said.Gaining momentumDespite tensions at the national level, locality cooperation between China and the United States has gained momentum recently."I think the conference may give you the best example," said Richard Dasher, director of the US-Asia Technology Management Center at Stanford University, referring to the 2024 Global Green Development Summit at his university on the weekend.The summit, held by the Global Green Development Alliance, brought together climate and energy experts, as well as business leaders from both countries to discuss "energy transition and innovation for carbon neutrality".Companies must provide solutions that are both economically viable and attractive to consumers, Dasher said.Kammen emphasized the need for a combination of Silicon Valley's innovative mentality and the large-scale industrial capacity of entities such as China's State Grid and the State Grid Electric Vehicle Service.He pointed to the productivity of new companies and university offshoots as evidence of the potential for collaborative innovation with Chinese companies.US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday night in a nationally televised address that he decided not to seek a second term because he wanted to "pass the torch to a new generation", which he said is "the best way" to unite the nation.In the 13-minute speech, Biden made references to the danger he said the United States would face if Donald Trump wins the Nov 5 election, without naming the former president and Republican nominee.He said he was dropping out of the race against Trump to help heal the wounds in the Democratic Party and unite Democrats in the goal of winning."Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition," he said during a prime-time address in the Oval Office."You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. But there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices and that time and place is now," he said.It was Biden's first explanation about his abrupt departure from the 2024 presidential race and capped more than 50 years in politics.Biden said that during the last six months of his time in office, he will be focused on his job as president, from working to grow the economy to "defending our personal freedoms".The president touched on a lot of the themes of his campaign.The political aspects of the message prompted Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump, to post on X: "Every single network that televised this campaign speech will be getting follow-up letters from our attorneys regarding equal time."Biden said he would call for Supreme Court reform in his final months in office.The Supreme Court and its 6-3 conservative majority has in recent years made a series of landmark decisions, overturning Roe versus Wade on abortion rights, limiting affirmative action and granting wide immunity to presidents for official acts taken while in office.Praise for HarrisBiden also praised Vice-President Kamala Harris, 59, the likely Democratic nominee, as a strong leader who would make an effective president, saying that she is experienced, tough and capable.The speech comes after he dropped his bid early Sunday afternoon in a letter addressed to "my fellow Americans", the first sitting president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 not to seek a second term in the White House.Then he announced the decision in a post on X and he followed that moments later with an endorsement of Harris for the nomination.Harris has consolidated support from within the Democratic Party and is expected to win a virtual roll call of Democratic delegates — perhaps without opposition — as early as Aug 1 and no later than Aug 7.Biden returned to the White House on Tuesday after testing negative for COVID-19. He began drafting his anticipated address while isolating with the virus in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, senior officials told CNN.A Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Tuesday showed Harris with a 2 percentage-point lead over Trump, 44 percent to 42 percent. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS showed Trump leading Harris, 49 percent to 46 percent. Both findings were within the polls' margins of error.The Harris campaign on Wednesday said it had raised $126 million since Sunday, with 64 percent of donors making their first contribution of the 2024 campaign.Agencies contributed to this story.It was an occasion to celebrate the personal experiences of the sister-city relationships over the years.Alix Nathan, president of the Portland-Suzhou Sister City Association in Oregon, said at the sixth US-China Sister Cities Summit on Friday in Tacoma, Washington state, that one of the most crucial aspects of the exchanges and relationship with sister city Suzhou, in East China's Jiangsu province, is in education."For more than 20 years, Portland has been using and working with schools in the US and Suzhou to facilitate reciprocal school-to-school bilateral group programing for students," Nathan told China Daily.His association has assisted in the effort by spending a minimum of one week visiting each other's classrooms, city attractions, parks and museums, as well as spending time with host families."Obviously, during the pandemic, many of these programs were shut down," he said. "However, now we're very excited to rekindle this relationship, as we have many schools restarting their activities to promote American students from Portland going to China, with more than 12 schools now enlisted in activities to foster exchanges in the coming year."During the summit, a delegation of 13 students from the Affiliated High School of Fuzhou Institute of Education in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian province, arrived in Tacoma for an 11-day educational exchange program."Besides the beautiful country and the delicious food we had, making friends and talking to people was the best part," Izabell Saldana, a 12th grader at Lincoln High School in Tacoma, said of her multicity trip to China last month. "I do believe that this is absolutely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."Celeste Nunez Salcido, director of international business resources for the New Mexico Trade Alliance, was the US fellow during the 2023 Gansu International Fellowship Program organized by the Gansu provincial government.The fellowship convenes professional candidates from around the world to learn about Gansu's and China's economic development efforts, cultural heritage, language and history to promote mutual understanding and peaceful cooperation.Salcido's participation in the program marked the first exchange opportunity between Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Lanzhou, Gansu province, since the pandemic."Here, every one of you is a citizen diplomat," she said in her speech at the end of the summit. "Every one of you has the ability and power to strengthen these friendships that lead to cooperation."She said cooperation is important for the shared challenges of the future."The US and China are the top two global economies. This is not going to change in the near future. And that means that we need people to understand each other," she said.Yang Wanming, president of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, told China Daily it will launch a youth exchange program next year, inviting and organizing trips for 1,000 US high school and university students aged 16 to 22 to China."Through a seven-to-10-day visit, students will experience a real, multidimensional and comprehensive China. They will become young ambassadors for promoting Sino-American relations," Yang said. US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday after outrage expressed by both political parties over her agency's failure to prevent an assassination attempt against former president Donald Trump at a campaign rally 10 days ago in Pennsylvania.Cheatle, 53, announced her resignation through an internal email. She said that "in light of recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to step down as your director". Cheatle said that she didn't want the calls for her resignation "to be a distraction from the great work" the agency is doing.Cheatle served on the team of agents that secured Vice-President Dick Cheney on Sept. 11, 2001. Cheatle later worked on Joe Biden's detail during his vice-presidency and was assigned to his wife, Jill Biden.President Biden issued a statement Tuesday after her resignation: "As a leader, it takes honor, courage and incredible integrity to take full responsibility for an organization tasked with one of the most challenging jobs in public service."Within minutes after news of Cheatle's resignation broke, Trump posted a statement on his social media network saying: "The Biden/Harris Administration did not properly protect me, and I was forced to take a bullet for Democracy. IT WAS MY GREAT HONOR TO DO SO!"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appointed Secret Service Deputy Director Ronald Rowe as the agency's acting director. Rowe is a 24-year veteran of the service. In an interview last week, Rowe defended Cheatle's leadership and said she shouldn't resign.The security measure during Trump's July 13 rally was seriously flawed by not monitoring a nearby warehouse, where the gunman, Thomas Crooks, 20, positioned himself for the shooting.The day before her resignation, Cheatle testified at a congressional hearing where she offered no clear answers to the failure to protect Trump.She acknowledged that the shooter was identified as suspicious — having had a range finder and backpack — more than an hour before he opened fire. She also acknowledged that Secret Service agents had received multiple notifications of a person acting suspiciously "somewhere between two and five times" prior to the shooting.However, the potential threat seemed to not have been conveyed to Trump's security team."If the detail had been passed information that there was a threat, the detail would never have brought the former president out on the stage," Cheatle said in the hearing.Crooks fired at least six rounds from an AR-15-style rifle from the roof of the American Glass Research building, roughly 400 feet from where Trump spoke. The shots killed one spectator, critically injured two others and grazed Trump's right ear.A Secret Service sniper team shot back, killing Crooks, whose motive remains unknown.House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Tuesday agreed to form a bipartisan task force to lead the congressional investigation into the assassination attempt."The security failures that allowed an assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life are shocking," Johnson and Jeffries said in a joint statement. "The task force will be empowered with subpoena authority and will move quickly to find the facts, ensure accountability, and make certain such failures never happen again." US Vice-President Kamala Harris, having now secured backing from Congress' top Democrats, held her first presidential-style campaign rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday, where she sharply criticized the Republican nominee Donald Trump.Harris continued to bolster her political support Tuesday after announcing that she also had secured pledges from enough party delegates to secure the Democratic nomination for president.Harris, 59, had moved quickly to shore up her likely nomination after President Joe Biden, 81, on Sunday announced that he would not seek reelection. Biden endorsed Harris that day, and the vice-president's campaign picked up steam.Most Democratic lawmakers have lined up behind her candidacy, including the party's leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who endorsed Harris on Tuesday at a joint press conference. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed Harris on Monday.Democrats were looking to unify the party following a tumultuous month of infighting over whether Biden should remain the nominee.An Associated Press unofficial survey found that Harris has the support of 3,095 delegates from various states — 1,976 are needed for the nomination. Delegates still may vote for the candidate they prefer when the party picks its new nominee next month at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago."This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. This is about who we fight for," she said before an enthusiastic audience Tuesday at a high school in West Allis, a Milwaukee suburb.Wisconsin, along with Michigan and Ohio are crucial US Rust Belt battleground states in the November election."The path to the White House goes through Wisconsin. And to win in Wisconsin, we are counting on you, right here in Milwaukee," Harris said in the 17-minute speech. "Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?" she said. "We believe in the sacred freedom to vote. We believe that every person in our nation should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence … and we trust women to make decisions about their own bodies."Of her time as a prosecutor in California, Harris said she "took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women; fraudsters who ripped off consumers; cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type," in an apparent reference to some of the former president's legal issues.Harris has previously served as the San Francisco district attorney, the California attorney general and a US senator from the state.She has faced some controversy for her stance on marijuana. During Harris' tenure as district attorney in San Francisco from 2004 to 2011, more than 1,900 people were convicted for marijuana offenses, Forbes reported.She opposed a California ballot initiative in 2010 that would legalize cannabis, although she did favor its medical use. In 2015, she favored the lifting of a federal ban on medical marijuana.In a call with reporters on Tuesday, Trump criticized Harris' record on immigration since she was tasked by Biden with looking into the root causes of the migration surge."Kamala Harris was appointed border czar, as you know, in March 2021, and since that time, millions and millions of illegal aliens have invaded our country, and countless Americans have been killed by migrant crime because of her willful demolition of American borders and laws," Trump said on the call.A July 22 YouGov poll showed Trump had a 15 percent lead on Harris on the issue of immigration.Recent polls on voter preference overall are mixed.Harris led Trump 44 percent to 42 percent among registered voters in a national Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday.A recent YouGov poll showed Trump ahead 44 percent to 39 percent, among registered voters. A Yahoo News poll had each candidate with 46 percent, in a contest that has five candidates.Trump said Tuesday that he would like to debate Harris "more than once" but did not commit to appearing at the next scheduled debate in September on ABC.Trump told reporters that he was "not thrilled at ABC" and may want another network, such as Fox, to air the debate. He said he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice — during the June 27 debate that led to the president bowing out of the race, and then in September.But Trump said he still wants to debate Harris."I think debating's important for a presidential race," he said. "You sort of have an obligation to debate."Agencies contributed to this story.WASHINGTON - US Vice President Kamala Harris, who has garnered wide support to become the Democratic presidential nominee, holds a two-percentage-point lead over Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to the latest poll.In a Reuters/Ipsos survey conducted on Monday and Tuesday, one of the first following incumbent President Joe Biden's exit from the race on Sunday, Harris leads Trump by 44 percent to 42 percent, a margin within the poll's error range.Harris, 59, is viewed as "mentally sharp and capable of handling challenges" by 56 percent of registered voters, compared to 49 percent for Trump, 78.On Monday, Harris announced that she had secured enough support from her party, just a day after Biden withdrew from the race under growing pressure from Democrats concerned about his age and mental fitness to serve another term.A PBS/NPR/Marist survey conducted on Monday shows Trump leading Harris 46-45 percent, with 9 percent of respondents undecided.The poll further indicates that 41 percent of Americans, including 65 percent of Democrats, believe Biden's departure improves the Democrats' chances of winning in November.In her first presidential campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Tuesday, Harris framed the choice between herself and Trump as one between "freedom, compassion, and the rule of law" versus "chaos, fear, and hate"."Donald Trump wants to take our country backward," she told a cheering crowd.Meanwhile, Trump expressed confidence in his ability to beat Harris during a conference call on Tuesday, offering to engage in "more than one debate" with her. He spent much of the call criticizing Harris' record on immigration and border issues, according to US media reports.The Chancay Port project in Peru, being built by China's COSCO Shipping, could facilitate trade with the entire Latin American region and cut the time it takes to ship products by almost two weeks.The $3.5 billion mega project, identified as a gateway from Latin America to Asia, could facilitate direct shipping between the two regions, said Carlos Aquino, an economist and director of the Center for Asian Studies at Peru's National University of San Marcos.Chancay also has the potential to become South America's main logistics hub because it could facilitate the shipment of products from mountain and jungle regions, Aquino said. Opening a direct shipping route will also be more cost-effective to export products to China.Alejandro Indacochea, president of Indacochea Asociados, a law firm that specializes in oil and gas, said he expects the port will cut shipment times.Other countries in the region could also benefit from the port. Brazil, a large buyer of Chinese products and supplier of commodities to China, could benefit from the port as could nearby countries such as Ecuador, Colombia and Chile, Indacochea said. The port could support the development of the entire Peruvian coast, as well as agricultural and mining exports."If Brazil could send its cargo through the port of Chancay and directly to China, it is said that it could save perhaps up to 15 days or a little more (in transport time). So, I believe that this is another great benefit," Aquino told China Daily.China's state-owned COSCO Shipping holds a 60 percent stake in the Chancay Port project, the first phase of which could be completed later this year. COSCO invested $1.3 billion in the first phase of the mega port, which is about 83 percent complete.Challenges remainHowever, Indacochea said that challenges remain in the development of the port, including developing a complementary infrastructure network, integrating the port with an industrial park and railway networks, and facilitating the routing of exports through it."This project is in the pipeline, but I don't think the geopolitical and economic scope and magnitude it has for Latin America is fully appreciated," Indacochea said.More than 35 percent of Peru's export trade is directed to China, which consumes 80 percent of the Andean nation's copper exports, Indacochea said.In Beijing late last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with visiting Peruvian President Dina Boluarte Zegarra.The two leaders said they aim to boost trade and strengthen economic ties. They also agreed to upgrade an existing free trade agreement. China and Peru signed an FTA in 2009, the first such agreement that Beijing signed with a country in Latin America.The meeting resulted in cooperation agreements covering various fields, including the digital economy and scientific and technological innovation.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.OTTAWA -- About 17,500 Albertans were out of their homes from the Jasper and nearby wildfires in western Canada, local media reported Tuesday.Everyone in Jasper National Park, the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies, along with residents of the Jasper townsite were ordered out late Monday night.The Albertan province, the Municipality of Jasper and Jasper National Park said Tuesday that evacuation from the town and the park was "progressing well."On Tuesday, British Columbia Wildfire was reporting 300 active wildfires, and Alberta Wildfire was reporting 176 active wildfires.Thick smoke from wildfires in Alberta and British Columbia settled over Alberta, according to CTV News.The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) in Calgary was rated as a 7 (high risk), with some locations, including Edmonton and Red Deer, reaching a 10+ (the highest rating on the AQHI scale), CTV News reported.UNITED NATIONS -- Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, on Tuesday called on all parties concerned to stay on the course of political solution to the Yemen crisis, emphasizing that "the settlement of the Yemeni question requires political and diplomatic means."In remarks at the Security Council briefing on Yemen, Fu said China hopes that all parties concerned will stay on the course of political solution, build consensus, meet each other halfway, jointly promote a Yemeni-led and Yemeni-owned comprehensive political process, and resolve tensions and differences through dialogue and negotiation."The international community should provide assistance and play a constructive role in this regard," he pointed out.With the ongoing tensions in the Red Sea unsettling, the Chinese side once again urged the Houthis to respect the right of navigation of commercial vessels under international law in the Red Sea, cease attacks, and maintain safe navigation in the Red Sea water, said Fu.He also called on other relevant parties to maintain restraint and halt any actions that may exacerbate tensions.Addressing the humanitarian situation in Yemen, which "remains grim," the ambassador said the international community should scale up humanitarian and development assistance to Yemen, support and help the government and people of Yemen to develop economy and improve living conditions.He noted that China expresses its serious concerns of the detention of UN personnel in Yemen, and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all UN personnel.Stressing that the tensions in the Red Sea are a prominent manifestation of the spillover of the Gaza conflict, Fu called for the full and effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions and the promotion of an immediate ceasefire in Gaza."We call on all parties to exercise restraint, avoid further escalations, and prevent plunging the entire region into an even greater catastrophe," he said, adding that China stays committed to working with the international community and making unremitting efforts for the political settlement of the Yemeni question and the maintenance of peace and stability in the Middle East. WASHINGTON -- US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday after widespread outrage over the agency's failure to prevent the recent assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month.Cheatle's resignation came one day after she was grilled at a congressional hearing by lawmakers, who said she failed to answer basic questions and demanded that she step down immediately.At the hearing held by the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, Cheatle acknowledged that it was "the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades".The committee issued a statement following the hearing. "Republican and Democrat members pressed US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle for answers on the egregious security lapses that led to the attempted assassination of (former) President Trump, the murder of an innocent victim, and harm to others in the crowd at the campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania," it said."Director Cheatle could not or refused to answer basic questions from Committee members, leading Republican and Democrat members to call for Director Cheatle's immediate resignation," the committee said.At the hearing, Cheatle frequently stated that it's only 9 days after the shooting, and she was still waiting for reports of the ongoing investigations, emphasizing her effort to ensure the information she provided was accurate.When asked why the Secret Service failed to secure a rooftop in proximity to the rally site and with a clear view of Trump's podium, Cheatle suggested that the Secret Service had intentionally left the rooftop unattended, as the agency preferred "sterile" rooftops, meaning empty ones.She explained that the warehouse rooftop was meant to have "overwatch", with law enforcement officers monitoring it from a higher vantage point. "There was a plan in place to provide overwatch and we are still looking into responsibilities and who was going to provide overwatch."When asked whether the Trump detail requested additional resources before the event, Cheatle said that "for the event on July 13th, the assets that were requested for that day, were given".A recorded footage clearly showed the gunman, who was getting into position to assassinate Trump, caught the attention of some people around. When asked why the rally wasn't paused at that point when people alarmed officers, Cheatle said "we are currently still combing through communications and when communications were passed."The US Secret Service has been facing scrutiny after a 20-year-old man, identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as Thomas Matthew Crooks, armed with an AR-style rifle, was able to get close enough to shoot and injure the former president. WASHINGTON - US Vice President Kamala Harris said late Monday that she has secured enough support of Democratic delegates to become the party's nominee for the upcoming presidential election."Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee," she wrote in a statement sent by her campaign. "I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon."Under mounting pressure from within the Democratic Party, US President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he was dropping out of the 2024 presidential race. He also offered his full support for nominating Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate.Harris has won endorsement from a number of prominent Democratic figures including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has urged the party to unify and charge forward to "resoundingly defeat" former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.The United States as a staunch backer of Israel should seize the opportunity to urge visiting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to observe United Nations resolutions and international laws, experts said.They also said the international community needs to work together to ensure the International Court of Justice's decision to call Israel's presence in Palestinian territory unlawful is implemented.Netanyahu, who left for the US on Monday, traveled to Washington to meet with US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. Netanyahu told reporters before he boarded the plane that his visit would be an opportunity to discuss the goals for both Israel and the US in the "critical months ahead".Ayman Yousef, a professor of international relations at the Arab American University in Jenin in the West Bank, said the meeting would be a chance for the Democratic Party to apply pressure on Netanyahu.Yousef said they can push the Israeli prime minister to agree to a cease-fire deal with Hamas and also avoid any negative intervention by him in the coming US elections.The ICJ said on Friday that Israel's presence in the Palestinian territory was unlawful. The call came just a day after the Knesset, Israel's parliament, rejected a resolution establishing Palestinian statehood, which was widely criticized.Netanyahu has slammed the ICJ ruling as "absurd", adding that no opinion from The Hague "can deny the historical truth or legal right of Israelis" to live in their "ancestral home".The UN Security Council had previously passed several resolutions on Gaza. The latest one, Resolution 2735, passed in June.Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, said the ICJ's legal opinion "confirms and reinforces the Palestinian people's attainment of their legitimate and legal rights in accordance with international and UN resolutions to regain the Palestinian territories seized by the Israeli occupation forces".The countries that have backed the ICJ's decision include Belgium, Iceland, Norway, Ireland, Slovenia, Spain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt. Traditional US allies Australia and the United Kingdom said they respected the ICJ's role in upholding international law and the independence of the ICJ, respectively.Omar Awadallah, Palestine's assistant foreign minister for the UN and Specialized Agencies, said the "historic" advisory opinion was "not only for the question of Palestine but for justice and for all the legal system".Awadallah, who was part of the delegation to the ICJ sessions, said he believed that this determination "will help in achieving justice and stability in the region if it's implemented"."Our move will be toward countries bilaterally. That means that we will be working with states toward taking irreversible steps, toward taking actions by putting consequences on this illegal occupation," Awadallah told China Daily.Hassan Ben Imran, board member at Law for Palestine, a nonprofit human rights organization, lauded the court's advisory opinion as it offered several legal grounds for Palestinians "to further their legal struggle for freedom and liberation".But he said he is not optimistic that Israel would comply with the resolutions, suggesting that the only way forward could be imposing economic, political, and military sanctions on Israel, including suspending its UN membership.United States President Joe Biden, after nearly a month of mounting pressure from his own party, dropped his reelection bid on Sunday and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris to head the Democratic ticket in November."It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president," he wrote in a letter posted on social media. "And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus entirely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term."Biden's endorsement of Harris came in a subsequent post on social media platform X."Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year," Biden wrote. "Democrats — it's time to come together and beat Trump."Harris said, "I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party- and our nation — to defeat Donald Trump." She added that she was honored to have Biden's endorsement, and wrote on X that "my intention is to earn and win this nomination".The Democratic candidate, to be nominated at the Democratic National Convention, which starts on Aug 19 in Chicago, will face former president Trump, 78, the Republican nominee.While Trump said on Sunday that Harris would be easier to defeat than Biden, he continued to criticize Biden, telling NBC News, "There has never been a president who has done such damage to our country, from energy independence to letting in millions and millions of illegal immigrants."House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, wrote on social media: "The Democrat Party forced the Democrat nominee off the ballot, just over 100 days before the election. Having invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president, the self-proclaimed 'party of democracy' has proven exactly the opposite."Debbie Walsh, director at the Center for American Women and Politics, said of Harris, 59, who is of Jamaican and Asian Indian descent, "Should she win the nomination, the nation will watch a multiracial woman compete in a presidential general election for the first time in history."Harris began shoring up support on Sunday. The North Carolina and South Carolina delegates pledged their backing for her on Sunday evening, as did some governors and members of Congress.While Biden endorsed Harris, her nomination is not guaranteed, and there could be a rare open convention, also referred to as a "floor fight". There also has been talk of Democrats selecting a nominee virtually before the convention.Harris needs the backing of 1,969 of the 3,936 Democratic delegates to secure the nomination.Among the names mentioned as other potential Democratic presidential candidates are governors Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Andy Beshear of Kentucky. Some of them also could be considered as potential vice-presidential running mates for Harris.Biden and Harris together had raised a $240 million war chest as of June 30, according to The New York Times.Media reports circulated last week that Biden, 81, would step down on Sunday, but the stories lost steam after Biden angrily dismissed them.The president's political fortunes began to crumble after his dismal performance in a debate with Trump on June 27.Former president Barack Obama praised Biden, his former vice-president, in a statement on Medium.com on Sunday, saying that Biden "wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America".Obama said Biden "pointed us away from the four years of chaos, falsehood and division that had characterized Donald Trump's administration".Agencies contributed to this story. WASHINGTON -- Former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, on Monday endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee, consolidating support for Harris following incumbent President Joe Biden's exit from the race."With immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future, I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for President of the United States. My enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris for President is official, personal and political," Pelosi said in a statement posted on her personal account on X, formerly known as Twitter."Politically, make no mistake: Kamala Harris as a woman in politics is brilliantly astute -- and I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory in November," said Pelosi.Noting that diversity is the Democratic Party's strength, the former House speaker also urged the party to unify and charge forward to "resoundingly defeat" former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.Pelosi's statement came one day after Biden announced that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race, after a new wave of concerns about his age and mental fitness surged following his disastrous debate performance on June 27.After announcing his withdrawal, Biden offered his full support for nominating Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate and urged Democrats to unite to defeat Trump. Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife, former US Senator and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, have also expressed their support for Harris as the party's nominee.However, in statements released shortly after Biden's exit, Pelosi and other Democratic heavyweights such as former President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries did not immediately endorse Harris, sparking speculation whether they want to leave their options open.As one of Biden's staunchest allies, Pelosi's approval acts as a significant show of support for Harris. This gesture is significant as it follows a tumultuous few weeks within the Democratic Party, characterized by internal disputes. WASHINGTON - US Vice-President Kamala Harris made her first public appearance on Monday since entering the presidential race after President Joe Biden, 81, abruptly abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed her as his successor."Joe Biden's legacy over the last three years is unmatched in modern history," Harris said, before delivering remarks at a White House event to honor college athletes.ReutersSAN FRANCISCO — CrowdStrike's routine update of its widely used cybersecurity software, which caused clients' computer systems to crash globally on Friday, apparently did not undergo adequate quality checks before it was deployed, security experts say.The latest version of its Falcon sensor software was meant to make CrowdStrike clients' systems more secure against hacking by updating the threats it defends against. But a faulty code in the update files resulted in one of the most widespread tech outages in recent years for companies using Microsoft's Windows operating system.Global banks, airlines, hospitals and government offices were disrupted. "We currently estimate that CrowdStrike's update affected 8.5 million Windows devices," Microsoft said in a blog post on Saturday.CrowdStrike released information to fix affected systems, but experts said getting them back online would take time as it required manually weeding out the flawed code."What it looks like is, potentially, the vetting or the sandboxing they do when they look at code, maybe somehow this file was not included in that or slipped through," said Steve Cobb, chief security officer at Security Scorecard in New York, which also had some systems affected by the issue.Problems came to light quickly after the update was rolled out on Friday and users posted pictures on social media of computers with blue screens displaying error messages.Patrick Wardle, a security researcher specializing in studying threats against operating systems, said his analysis identified the code responsible for the outage.The update's problem was "in a file that contains either configuration information or signatures", he said. Such signatures are code that detects specific types of malicious code or malware."It's very common that security products update their signatures, like once a day ... because they're continually monitoring for new malware and because they want to make sure that their customers are protected from the latest threats," he said.The frequency of updates "is probably the reason why (CrowdStrike) didn't test it as much", he said.It is unclear how that faulty code got into the update and why it was not detected before being released to customers."Ideally, this would have been rolled out to a limited pool first," said John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress Labs in Maryland. "That is a safer approach to avoid a big mess like this."Agencies via Xinhua US President Joe Biden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee, moments after he made a stunning decision that he would no longer seek the Democratic nomination for president."Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year," Biden said in a post shared on X on Sunday.

He is the first sitting US president to not seek reelection since Lyndon B. Johnson in March 1968."Should she win the nomination, the nation will watch a multiracial woman compete in a presidential general election for the first time in history," Debbie Walsh, director at the Center for American Women & Politics, said of Harris, 59, who is of Jamaican and Asian Indian descent.Harris previously served as a US senator from California and as California attorney general.She immediately got to work shoring up her support on Sunday, and as the evening wore on she appeared to be quickly building momentum. The North Carolina and South Carolina delegates pledged their support to her on Sunday evening as did a growing list of Democratic governors and members of Congress.While Biden did endorse Harris, her nomination is not guaranteed, and there could be a rare open convention, also referred to as a "floor fight". There also had been talk of Democrats selecting a nominee virtually before the convention.But Representative Nanette Barragán of California, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who said she spoke with Harris on Sunday, said the vice-president wants to forego a virtual roll call for the nomination process and instead hold a process that adheres to regular order.Harris needs the backing of 1,969 of the 3,936 Democratic delegates to secure her nomination, Reuters reported."Biden does not control his delegates: He cannot tell them whom to vote for next month. And party politics being what it is, they are most likely to go with whomever they think has the best chance to defeat Mr. Trump," The New York Times reported on Sunday.Among the names mentioned as other potential Democratic presidential candidates are governors Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.Although Newsom wrote on X on Sunday: "With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump's dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America's Vice President, @KamalaHarris."Whitmer and Beshear issued statements praising Biden but did not mention Harris.Biden and Harris together had raised a massive campaign war chest of $240 million through various entities as of June 30, according to the Times.ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform, announced it had collected $46.7 million as of 9 pm ET from small-dollar donations for Harris' campaign.Media reports circulated last week that Biden would step down on Sunday, but the stories lost steam as Biden angrily dismissed them.Biden's political fortunes began to crumble after his dismal performance in a debate with Trump on June 27. Gaffes in subsequent interviews and appearances led to more doubts about whether he should continue.Former president Barack Obama praised Biden, his former vice-president, in a statement on Medium.com on Sunday, saying Biden "wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America".Obama said Biden "pointed us away from the four years of chaos, falsehood, and division that had characterized Donald Trump's administration"."We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges."Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, in comments from his family compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, said neither party will address what he considers the major issues facing the US.Agencies contributed to this story. With critical days ahead, President Joe Biden is facing the stark reality that more people want him to consider stepping aside from the 2024 election, as former president Donald Trump accepts the Republican nomination at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.The New York Times reported on Thursday that "several people" close to Biden have said he has begun to "accept the idea" that he may have to drop out of the contest.But the White House denied he would drop out, the Times reported.Democratic leaders in the House and Senate — Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer — have told Biden directly that he will not only lose the White House, but also endanger their efforts to win back the House, according to reports in multiple news outlets.Opinion polls show four of the seven most competitive states are looking increasingly out of reach for Biden. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, said it believes it is now competitive in Democratic-leaning states, including Minnesota, New Hampshire and Virginia.Senator Jon Tester, who faces a challenging reelection battle in Montana this year, on Thursday, became the 21st congressional Democrat and the second senator to publicly call on Biden to drop out.Former president Barack Obama has told others that Biden, who was Obama's vice-president, should rethink his candidacy, The Washington Post reported, citing anonymous sources.This came as Trump predicted an "incredible victory" on Thursday in accepting the Republican presidential nomination at the party's national convention on Thursday."We will have an incredible victory," Trump said at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.It was his first speech since a 20-year-old man shot at him, causing a wound to one ear and killing a bystander during a rally last weekend.Promising to complete a wall on the United States-Mexico border, Trump said an "invasion" of immigrants had brought "destruction" and "misery" to a "nation in decline".He vowed to end Biden's massive spending on fighting climate change, calling it a "scam".Meanwhile, US Vice-President Kamala Harris has been courting Asian American voters, speaking at events in Las Vegas and Philadelphia this month in an effort to woo the increasingly important voting bloc.Harris, who is of South Asian and Jamaican descent, is the first female US vice-president and is encouraging Asian American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI, voters to back Biden's reelection bid.Harris' speech before a crowd of AAPI community leaders and organizers at the Pennsylvania Convention Center last Saturday was overshadowed later that day by the attempted assassination of Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.With rumors of Biden dropping out, political pundits are also speculating whether Harris would make a better candidate against Trump.The Democratic National Convention will begin on Aug 19 in Chicago.The Philadelphia event was organized by Asian Pacific Islander American Vote, or APIAVote, an advocacy group focused on mobilizing Asian American voters.The 2024 Asian American Voter Survey, which APIAVote helped conduct along with three other groups, found that 46 percent polled said they would likely vote for Biden, down from 54 percent in 2020, and 31 percent for Trump, up 1 percentage point from 2020, with the rest undecided.The survey of 2,479 voters from the six largest Asian American groups was released on July 10.Christine Chen, co-founder and executive director of APIAVote, said in a news release that "while there's little evidence of a broad political realignment of Asian American voters, recent elections have shown that their political identities are more tenuous than their voting habits imply, and that when candidates make concerted efforts to engage them, Asian American voters are persuadable".The survey also found that 31 percent identify as independent, compared with 25 percent in 2020.Agencies contributed to this story.belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.com  SAN FRANCISCO -- A faulty software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Friday morning has affected computers-running Microsoft Windows at organizations, causing major IT outage, taking out banks, airlines and businesses globally.U.S. federal airspace officials announced a nationwide ground stop of air traffic on Friday due to the outages.

"I had God on my side," he said.The former president called on Democrats to "immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy"."They should drop these partisan witch hunts which I have been going through for approximately eight years," Trump said, alluding to the multiple criminal cases he's mired in.He praised a recent federal judge's decision to dismiss the case against him involving allegations of holding classified documents and obstructing efforts to recover them, which President Joe Biden called a "specious" decision.In early July, the US Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, ruled that Trump has immunity from criminal charges for his 'official' actions conducted as president in the attempts to reverse the 2020 election results, a decision harshly criticized by Democrats.In the speech, Trump lashed out at the Biden administration's policies, highlighting surging inflation, an influx of illegal immigrants and a chaotic international situation."We have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable, ravaging the incomes of working and low-income families and simply crashing our people like never before," Trump said.He pledged to continue building the US-Mexico border wall, accusing illegal immigrants of destroying the country. "I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing a wall," he said.Trump also vowed to end the "electric vehicle mandate" and bring back car manufacturing, threatening to put a tariff of 100 to 200 percent on each imported car.The former president signed a 1.5 trillion tax cut in late 2017 and called for a fresh round of tax cuts while pledging to cut federal debt with "tremendous" economic growth."To all of the forgotten men and women who have been neglected, abandoned and left behind, you will be forgotten no longer," Trump concluded his speech by making a similar appeal from 2016.Thursday marks the final day of the four-day Republican National Convention. On Wednesday night, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, author of the bestselling memoir "Hillbilly Elegy", accepted the party's nomination for vice president and introduced himself to the nation.The Republican National Convention was held as Biden grapples with intensifying pressure from his Democratic Party to drop out of the race. About 20 Democratic lawmakers urged him to step aside.Former US president Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have reportedly expressed concerns privately that they think the president's chances of beating Trump in November are diminishing.According to the latest average of polls from Real Clear Politics, Trump leads President Joe Biden by 3.0 percentage points. In crucial swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, Trump leads by 3.3, 1.7 and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. LAS VEGAS/MILWAUKEE — US President Joe Biden again faced calls to exit the presidential race as he tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, while former president Donald Trump's running mate J.D. Vance formally accepted the Republican vice-presidential nomination.Biden tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling Wednesday in Las Vegas and is experiencing "mild symptoms" including "general malaise" from the infection, the White House said.Biden was scheduled to speak at a conference for the Latino civil rights and advocacy group UnidosUS, but he would no longer be able to attend. Biden previously tested positive in 2022.The diagnosis came as Biden faces mounting pressure from some Democrats to step down from the presidential race due to concerns about his age and mental fitness following his poor debate performance against Trump in late June.Prominent Democratic Representative Adam Schiff on Wednesday joined nearly 20 Congress members of his party to press Biden to withdraw from his reelection bid, as the Democratic National Committee grapples with uncertainties in the nomination process scheduled to be completed by the end of next month.While the "choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone", it is time for Biden "to pass the torch" and "secure his legacy of leadership" by allowing another Democrat to beat Trump, Schiff said in a statement.US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told Biden in a meeting on Saturday it would be better for the country and the Democratic Party if he ended his reelection campaign, ABC News reported on Wednesday.Across the United States, nearly two-thirds of Democrats and 70 percent of citizens said Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to a latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.The AP-NORC poll, conducted from July 11-15, also found that only about 3 in 10 Democrats are extremely or very confident that he has the mental capability to serve effectively as president, down slightly from 40 percent in an AP-NORC poll in February.In response to Schiff's comments, the Biden campaign has pointed to what it called "extensive support" for him and his reelection bid from members of Congress in key swing states, as well as from the Congressional black and Hispanic caucuses.The Democratic National Committee is pushing ahead with plans for a virtual vote to formally make Biden its nominee in the first week of August, before the Democratic convention scheduled for Aug 19-22 completes the nomination process.Meanwhile, Vance urged voters to "choose a new path" as he formally accepted his nomination to be the Republican Party's vice-presidential candidate in an address on Wednesday."I stand here humbled, and I'm overwhelmed with gratitude to say I officially accept your nomination to be vice-president of the United States of America," he told the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Trump, who has just survived an assassination attempt, is set to formally accept his party's nomination with an address later on Thursday.Hundreds of people attended a vigil to remember the former fire chief killed at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania.In the face of security concerns aired after the shooting, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has agreed to testify before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on July 22 for a hearing related to the shooting, the panel said on Wednesday.US prosecutors formally appealed on Wednesday a federal judge's decision to throw out the criminal case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith accusing Trump of illegally holding on to classified documents following the end of his presidency.Smith's office filed a notice indicating it would ask the Atlanta-based 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals to revive the case and reverse Florida-based US District Judge Aileen Cannon's ruling on Monday that Smith had been unlawfully appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland.Agencies/XinhuaMILWAUKEE, the United States - J.D. Vance, a senator from the US state of Ohio and author of the bestselling memoir "Hillbilly Elegy", on Wednesday night accepted the nomination for vice president at the ongoing Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Introducing himself to the nation as Donald Trump's vice-presidential pick, Vance used his speech at the convention to recount his tough upbringing and argue that the Republican Party is most attuned to the difficulties faced by struggling Americans, especially the overlooked working class."To the people of Middletown, Ohio, and all the forgotten communities in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio, and every corner of our nation, I promise you this," Vance said. "I will be a vice president who never forgets where he came from."Vance, 39, had a tumultuous childhood and was raised by his grandparents in impoverished Rust Belt Ohio. He joined the Marines after graduating from high school and later attended Ohio State University and Yale Law School.He was once a fierce critic of Trump but shifted his opinion after meeting Trump in 2021, becoming a close ally and a staunch defender. He was elected to the US Senate in 2022 with Trump's endorsement.Wednesday marks the third day of the Republican National Convention. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Former Director of the US Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott were among a long list of speakers.On Tuesday, Trump's former rivals and critics, including former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and Senator Marco Rubio, took the stage to make speeches, highlighting the party's unity.Trump, who just recently survived an attempted assassination, is expected to accept the Republican nomination for president on Thursday and will make a keynote speech.WASHINGTON - Across the United States, nearly two-thirds of Democrats and 70 percent Americans said US President Joe Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to a latest Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.The AP-NORC poll, conducted from July 11-15, also found that only about three in 10 Democrats are extremely or very confident that he has the mental capability to serve effectively as president, down slightly from 40 percent in an AP-NORC poll in February.Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling Wednesday in Las Vegas, is facing growing calls from his own party to step aside, amid questioning about his age and mental fitness to do the job, after last month's dismal debate performance.Prominent Democratic Representative Adam Schiff on Wednesday joined nearly 20 Congress members of his party to press Biden to withdraw from his reelection bid, as the Democratic National Committee grapples with uncertainties on the nomination process scheduled to complete by end of next month.While the "choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone", it is time for Biden "to pass the torch" and "secure his legacy of leadership" by allowing another Democrat to beat former president Donald Trump, Schiff said in a statement. The representative from California is close to former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, making his call particularly notable.Trump received enough delegate votes on Monday to officially become the Republican Party's nominee in the Nov 5 presidential election.In response to Schiff's comments, the Biden campaign has pointed to what it called "extensive support" for him and his reelection bid from members of Congress in key swing states, as well as from the Congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses.Biden is traveling in Nevada this week, and the campaign noted that he's been joined on the trip by "nearly a dozen" Congressional Black Caucus members, according to an AP report.Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee is pushing ahead with plans for a virtual vote to formally make Biden its nominee in the first week of August, before the Democratic convention scheduled for Aug 19-22 completes the nomination process.While the exact date of the virtual vote remains undecided, a group of House Democrats have cautioned about swiftly nominating Biden as the party's pick for reelection, saying the virtual roll call would be a "terrible idea" to stifle debate about the party's nominee."It could deeply undermine the morale and unity of Democrats," according to a letter from the group obtained by the Associated Press.From yarns and fabrics to finished garments and home products — each stitch connects China's textile industry to the world.This week, more than 500 Chinese companies are displaying their latest innovations and sustainability efforts at a major industry event at the Javits Center in New York City.The 25th China Textile and Apparel Trade Fair, Texworld New York City, Apparel Sourcing New York City, and Home Textiles Sourcing Expo New York City are participating in the three-day exhibition at the sprawling convention center in Manhattan, which started on Tuesday.It primarily focuses on two major themes: "Future Trends" and "Sustainability". More companies are joining the eco-friendly movement; 137 Chinese companies have environmentally friendly certifications, about 29 percent of participants.The semiannual exhibition is jointly organized by the Sub-Council of Textile Industry, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and Messe Frankfurt North America.More than 700 enterprises from 22 countries and regions will converge in an exhibition area of more than 21,500 square feet (20,000 square meters).Long lines formed in the registration area, made up of buyers from the textile and apparel industry, including retail giants Target, Macy's, Walmart, JCPenney, Athleta, American Eagle and Ralph Lauren.Chinese companies also featured those companies' logos at their booths, indicating who buys their products."We have participated in this exhibition for more than a decade. The biggest change we've seen is the gradual upgrading of the Chinese textile industry," said Sheng Wubin, CEO of Ningbo Mondiland Fashions, a maker and distributor of men's suits and coats."We are now producing more advanced products, with faster response times in product development, higher technical requirements and superior quality," Sheng told China Daily.The company has annual revenue of $30 million, with markets in the Americas, Europe and Japan."Ningbo is the hometown of tailors. Our local industry integrated with the development of Ningbo and Shanghai very early," he said. "In the 1920s and 1930s, we introduced many Italian, Japanese and German suit-making technologies and equipment into our garment town, forming a complete system."Sheng said that the company's greatest strength "lies in our understanding of different markets and meeting their stylistic needs with significant changes and improvements"."Ningbo's strong supply chain has also provided us with substantial support," he said. "We hope to see Chinese diplomats wearing suits designed and made in China on the international stage."Zameer Syed, the operational director of SNS Fashion Ltd, noted that speed of delivery and fabric innovation are strengths of the Chinese manufacturers.SNS, which started operations in China in 2002, supplies fabrics to most US apparel branches."All the Chinese supplies are not regular supplies; they have innovations and sustainability," Syed said.Constantin von Vieregge, president and CEO of Messe Frankfurt, said: "There was always the 'stigma' that Chinese exhibitors are lower quality, the cheap fashion. But that has changed completely over the years. So you can see they're getting better and better from a quality perspective."The company has been cooperating with the CCPIT for years, bringing Chinese companies and exhibitors to North America, France, Brazil, and Singapore as well as international exhibitors to Shanghai.The locations are hubs of international sourcing for yarns and fabrics and serve as selling windows for knitting, hosiery, sports and outdoor wear and digital intelligence technology in the industry."It [the partnership with China] is a very, very important one for us because obviously, the Chinese economy is such a strong economy; there are so many great exhibitors," von Vieregge said. "Everybody needs clothes, and we all need affordable clothes."Von Vieregge said "the consumer wins" in a competitive situation.He said that having so many Chinese companies participating in the global textile market is not overcapacity but vibrancy."The demand will regulate the market," he said. "The strongest partner, or the strongest company, will always win.""Now we see there are more and more coming from Chinese exhibitors, the awareness about sustainability and you can see every year it's getting better and better," von Vieregge said.Erin Baker, a fashion student from Kent State University, told China Daily that it's been "really cool to see, just different kind of ways people are trying to implement sustainability into their brands"."They were able to kind of show us insight into how more brands are the more sustainable, what is behind the scenes," she said. "Sustainability is a trend."Gigi Marinho, also a fashion student at Kent State, said she was "wowed" watching a demonstration of the design and manufacturing process of a Chinese textile company.China's textile and apparel exports totaled $115.84 billion from January to May 2024, a 1.4 percent increase over the same period in 2023, according to the General Administration of Customs. In May, export value exceeded $26 billion, a year-on-year increase of 4.5 percent.Exports to the United States rebounded, growing by 9 percent year-on-year, while exports to ASEAN countries saw a jump year-on-year of 21.3 percent.UNITED NATIONS - As instability intensifies in Haiti, displaced women and girls are increasingly vulnerable to sexual violence, according to a report by UN Women released on Wednesday.The report paints a grim picture of the living conditions for approximately 300,000 displaced women and girls in Haiti amid political chaos, rampant gang violence, and the ongoing hurricane season.With over half of the 580,000 displaced persons in Haiti being female, the UN Women Rapid Gender Assessment underscores the peril in makeshift camps lacking essential amenities, making them particularly susceptible to sexual and gender-based violence.The survey, conducted in April across six major displacement sites in Port-au-Prince, revealed a lack of basic security measures like lighting and locks in critical areas, including bedrooms and bathrooms.The presence of gangs and the daily threat of stray bullets amplify the dangers, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced protection measures in these camps.The study also noted that aggression, particularly rape, is often employed as a tactic by gangs to control women's access to humanitarian aid within the camps."Our report tells us that the level of insecurity and brutality, including sexual violence, that women are facing at the hands of gangs in Haiti is unprecedented. It must stop now," UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said.She urged the Haitian government to adopt preventive and responsive measures against the violence and to involve women more in camp management to ensure their safety concerns are addressed.The report further revealed the economic desperation faced by the women in the camps, with nearly 90 percent having no source of income. Over 10 percent have considered or resorted to sex work to meet their basic needs, while 20 percent knew someone who had engaged in such activities. Additionally, about 16 percent of respondents reported feeling intimidated, harassed, or traumatized by armed gangs, and almost 70 percent were mentally affected by the increase in violence.In response, UN Women is aiding women's organizations in Haiti to support displaced communities through various projects funded by international partners, including training police officers to prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence and supporting women entrepreneurs affected by the ongoing violence.This report underlines the critical situation in Haiti and the essential role of international and local actions in safeguarding and empowering the displaced female population amidst the crisis.WASHINGTON - US President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, the White House confirmed."Earlier today following his first event in Las Vegas, President Biden tested positive for COVID-19. He is vaccinated and boosted, and he is experiencing mild symptoms," White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement."He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time," she said."The president presented this afternoon with upper respiratory symptoms, to include rhinorhea (runny nose) and non-productive cough, with general mailaise," according to a note from Biden's doctor provided by Jean-Pierre.Biden was scheduled to speak at a conference for the Latino civil rights and advocacy group UnidosUS, but he would no longer be able to attend."Regrettably, I was just on the phone with President Biden and he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon. The president has been at many events, as we all know, and he just tested positive for Covid," Janet Murguia, president of the group, told attendees after Biden was late to his scheduled appearance.This is not the first time the 81-year-old Biden tests positive for COVID-19. He previously tested positive in 2022.The latest news came as Biden faces mounting pressure from some Democrats to step down from the presidential race due to concerns about his age and mental fitness following his poor debate performance against former US president Donald Trump in late June.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its forecasts for China's economic growth to 5 percent this year and 4.5 percent next year, according to its July 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update released on Tuesday.The report projected global economic growth to remain at 3.2 percent, the same as the April forecast.Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, said at a news briefing that the forecast for China had risen from 4.6 percent for 2024 and 4.1 percent for 2025 compared with the April outlook."And this revision was in part based on stronger consumption numbers in the first quarter of the year, stronger exports also, and that led us to that revision," he said."One of the reasons is that we expect that the new program, which is called trading and equipment upgrade, put in place by the Chinese authority, will help boost consumption and investment and growth at the same time," said Jean-Marc Natal, who is the deputy chief of the World Economic Studies Division in the IMF's Research Department."We have been recommending a shift towards consumption in the last few years, and this is one step in the right direction," he told reporters at the news briefing.The China National Bureau of Statistics released its latest economic figures on Tuesday, including that China's GDP grew by 5 percent year-on-year.Lin Jian, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said: "Judging by this scorecard, the Chinese economy did a pretty good job in the first half of 2024."Despite the rising instability and uncertainty in the global economy, China's economy withstood the pressure and played an important role as an anchor and source of strength," said Lin.The IMF said it still expects the world economy to grow 3.2 percent in 2024, unchanged from its previous forecast in April; It forecast growth of 3.3 percent in 2025, 0.1 percent higher than in April."Global growth remains steady," said Gourinchas, estimating that China and India would account for nearly half of global growth this year. The IMF raised its growth forecast for India to 7 percent this year, mainly based on a better outlook for private consumption, especially in rural areas.Overall, the outlook raised the growth forecast for emerging markets and developing economies in 2024 to 4.3 percent. It also predicted that the euro area's growth is expected to increase to 0.9 percent in 2024 and 1.5 percent next year."Global activity and world trade firmed up at the turn of the year, with trade spurred by strong exports from Asia," said the report.The IMF lowered expectations for the United States and Japan. The report said due to a "slower-than-expected start to the year", US growth in 2024 was downgraded to 2.6 percent; April's forecast was 2.7 percent. Japan's growth is expected to be 0.7 percent this year, 0.2 percent lower than projected.Warning that government balance sheets are weak coming out of the pandemic and then vulnerable to new shocks, Gourinchas, in a blog on the July 2024 WEO, called the US a "concerning" example, and that at full employment, it "maintains a fiscal stance that pushes its debt-to-GDP ratio steadily higher, with risks to both the domestic and global economy".The WEO report also warned that inflation risks have increased, with services prices holding up disinflation, which increases the prospect of interest rates staying elevated longer "in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty"."We see an explosion in the number of trade-restrictive measures," Gourinchas said, noting that the measures include export restrictions and industrial policies, and both may lead to retaliation."One concern we have is that going forward, this will weigh down on global activity," he said.The report also said that a resurgence of tariffs could lead to retaliation and a "costly race to the bottom"."So, let's remember that when we look at the assessment of, for instance, the previous rounds of tariffs that have been imposed by countries, very often the cost assessment finds that it's the country that imposes the tariffs that bear the cost of these tariffs," he said. "And so, it hurts the domestic economy, and it also inflicts spillovers to other countries as well."Arrests for illegally crossing the US-Mexico border dropped by 29 percent in June over the previous month, the lowest count of Joe Biden's presidency, according to figures announced Tuesday by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).The agency credited the decrease to the presidential proclamation announced on June 4 by Biden to temporarily suspend asylum eligibility for those who illegally enter across the border.As a result, the border encounters in June dropped to about 83,500 incidents from 117,900 in May. CBP said the June border encounter number is the lowest since January 2021 as well as lower than the number of encounters in June 2019, the last comparable year prior to the pandemicThe drop came as Biden has been repeatedly criticized for the surge of border crossings in recent years and the public sentiment about immigration is at its lowest in two decades. A June Gallup poll showed 55 percent of Americans want to see a decreased level of immigration, the highest since 2001. Former president Donald Trump has made a major issue in his White House bid.The seven-day average also dropped more than 50 percent to below 1,900 encounters per day from the date of Biden's announcement to the end of the month.The CBP also doubled the rate at which noncitizens were removed from US Border Patrol custody in June. Under the new policy, the Homeland Security Department has removed or returned more than 70,000 individuals to more than 170 countries since June 5. More than 150 international repatriation flights were used as part of the efforts.The total removals and returns over the past fiscal year exceeded removals and returns in any fiscal year since 2010, said CBP. A majority of US-Mexico border encounters during the past three fiscal years resulted in a removal, return or expulsion."Recent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully," said Troy Miller, acting CPB protection commissionerAsylum processing at ports of entry has continued under Biden's proclamation. US border officials have continued to process and admit roughly 1,500 migrants each day at the legal entry points.San Diego was the busiest of the Border Patrol's nine sectors bordering Mexico by number of arrests, followed by Tucson, Arizona.The American Civil Liberties Union and a coalition of immigrant advocacy groups sued the Biden administration last month over his June 4 order, saying it differs little from a similar move during the Trump administration that was blocked by the courts, violates US asylum law and increases the chances of American officials sending migrants back to places where they can be harmed.Wine glasses clinked as enthusiasts in New York savored the rich flavors of various red and white wines from the eastern foothills of Ningxia's Helan Mountain.More than 100 people attended the promotion of the Ningxia Hui autonomous region's specialty industries at the Chinese Consulate General on Monday evening, where they enjoyed wine and a goji berry-tasting.It was the Ningxia delegation's second visit to the United States this year, as the region in Northwest China is trying to widen its market in the US and internationally.The Fourth China International Wine Culture and Tourism Expo will be hosted by the regional government from Aug 9 to 11 in Yinchuan, Ningxia's capital, and welcomes winemakers and visitors from around the world to join and taste the wine, the delegation announced."I've heard that people who are separated by an ocean can be brought together by a glass of wine," David Adelman, managing director and general counsel of asset manager Krane Funds Advisors and a trustee of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, told China Daily."I've been to vineyards in Argentina, South Africa, of course, California. So, I've been lucky enough in my life to taste some nice wine," he said, noting that he is still learning more about wine from China. "I think China will do a magnificent job promoting its wine across the world, including the US," he added.The wine region lies at Helan Mountain and stretches along the Yellow River, forming a corridor seen as a golden zone for the high-quality growth of wine grapes, with more than 2,800 hours of sunshine a year and less than 8 inches of rainfall.It is the largest area for growing wine grapes in China, covering 40,133 hectares (99,170 acres), with 128 wineries producing 140 million bottles of wine. The output value is $5.5 billion, and the wine is exported to 40 countries according to data from the delegation.The region grows grapes for wines such as cabernet sauvignon, merlot, marselan, riesling and others.Ningxia's wines have won more than 1,000 honors internationally, including the Decanter, Concours Mondial de Bruxelles and the Berliner Wein Trophy.The region's venture into winemaking began in the 1980s and has since grown significantly, attracting winemakers and companies from China and the West."Not only does the wine offer an excellent taste, but it also provides the region with massive job opportunities, lifting residents out of poverty," said Bai Yuzhen, the director-general of the Ningxia foreign affairs office."Wine is a great connector, and it's a cultural product in many countries of the world," said Pablo Piñeiro Aramburu, consul general of Argentina in New York. "I think it has a great future."It has improved enormously. It has a lot of potential, and today we have a very good wine," he said, recalling that when he started his career in China years ago, the wine industry in Ningxia had just started."It needed development; wine needs a lot of time to evolve and become a better product," he said. "And now, today, I was impressed.""I didn't know anything about it, so it was very educational to understand that. I knew that [in China], we're producing wine, but not to this extent. It's very informative," said Francesco Rizzo Marullo, chairman of the United Nations World Cultural Arts Organization."I tried the wine, and I liked it. So, as an Italian, I think it's a compliment," he said. "It's a good wine what we tasted tonight. It was really good. It's something I would drink on a day-by-day basis.''He said that when people are dining with others of different nationalities and cultures, wine is a good cultural ambassador that connects people easily."I've been to China twice. And so next time I can add Ningxia to my bucket list," he said.China's envoy to the United Nations said on Tuesday that some countries intend to "create another system outside the existing system of international law", and he called NATO a "troublemaker"."We often hear the talk about a rules-based international order by some countries. But what kind of rules are they talking about? And who are the rulemakers? No one has given us a clear and precise answer," said Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the UN."I would like to emphasize that there is only one order in the world, that is the international order based on international law. There is only one set of rules, and they are the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. There is no room for ambiguity on matters of principle, and the positions must be clearly staked out," Fu said.He delivered the statement at a UN Security Council meeting on multilateral cooperation for a more just, democratic and sustainable world order, convened by Russia, which is presiding over the 15-member body in July.He called on NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to stop being a "troublemaker"."NATO, a regional military bloc left over from the Cold War, has been seeking to expand its sphere of influence," he said, "stirring up confrontation between camps, and even shifting the blame to countries outside the region to frame them on the issue of Ukraine."History has amply proved that wherever NATO's hand extends, turmoil and chaos will ensue. China hereby advises NATO and certain countries to conduct some soul-searching and stop being the troublemakers who jeopardize common security at the expense of others," he said.NATO is attempting to expand its reach to the Asia-Pacific region. Last year, NATO announced plans to open a liaison office in Japan.During last week's NATO summit in Washington, the alliance claimed that China is a "decisive enabler" of the Ukraine crisis.China strongly condemns the "irresponsible and provocative remarks", said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian. He said such a statement is "steeped in Cold War mentality and ideological bias and consists of baseless accusations".Fu also emphasized that common development and security are essential for a fair international order. He stressed the need for reforms in the international financial system and AI governance to help developing countries."Some individual countries have overstretched the concept of national security by building a 'small yard, high fence' and indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions to disrupt the global production and supply chains, which will ultimately lead to a situation of no winners, whether bilaterally or multilaterally. We must resolutely resist such erroneous practices," he said.Fu said China believes that to build a more just and equitable international order, the focus should be on six areas: upholding sovereign equality in a multipolar system; respecting each nation's development path without interference; building common security through dialogue; promoting inclusive economic globalization; upholding fairness and justice by strengthening the UN and developing countries' voices; and fostering openness, dialogue and shared human values.The Security Council meeting was chaired by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said the US "has long declared its own exceptionalism".He said the United States requires "unquestionable obedience" from its allies, "even to the detriment of their national interests".Lavrov said that Rule America, "the essence of the notorious rules-based order", is a "direct threat to multilateralism and international law", adding that the UN Charter and the Security Council's decisions are "perversely interpreted by the collective West".LOS ANGELES -- American billionaire Elon Musk announced Tuesday that he would move the headquarters of SpaceX and X out of California, one day after the state's Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill that bans school rules requiring staff to disclose children's gender identity changes to their parents."This is the final straw," Musk wrote on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter. "Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas."Soon after making the SpaceX announcement, Musk wrote another statement announcing that X would also be moved out of the Golden State, from San Francisco to Austin, Texas."I did make it clear to Governor Newsom about a year ago that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children," Musk complained.The new law makes California the first US state to bar school districts from requiring staff to notify families about a student's gender identity or sexual orientation without the child's permission.UNITED NATIONS -- A Chinese envoy on Tuesday called on countries to uphold sovereign equality and promote a multipolar world in an equal and orderly manner."First, we must uphold sovereign equality. Every country should be able to find its own place and play its role in the multipolar system. We must work jointly to promote a multipolar world in an equal and orderly manner," stated Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, during the UN Security Council open debate on multilateral cooperation in the interest of a more just, democratic, and sustainable world order.Fu emphasized the importance of sovereign equality and international cooperation. He highlighted that building "a just, democratic, and sustainable international order is the joint pursuit of humanity."He praised the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 as a means to "save succeeding generations from the scourge of war" and uphold the spirit of multilateralism.The UN Charter, he noted, is "the cornerstone of the modern international order" and embodies the "noble ideal of working towards a just and equitable international order."Reflecting on historical context, Fu mentioned that the principles of peaceful coexistence, proposed by Chinese leaders 70 years ago, continue to guide international relations. These principles include "mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefits, and peaceful coexistence."Addressing security, Fu called for "common security based on the objective law of indivisibility of security," advocating for the resolution of disputes through dialogue and consultation to build a more balanced, effective, and sustainable security architecture.He underscored the importance of promoting common development by accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and striving to "leave no country and no one behind."Fu highlighted the need to uphold fairness and justice, safeguard the authority of the United Nations and international law, and promote global governance characterized by "extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit," enhancing the representation and voice of developing countries.He also called for embracing openness and inclusiveness, promoting equal dialogue and exchanges among different civilizations, and fostering mutual understanding and friendship among peoples to promote the common values of humanity.Addressing the so-called "rules-based international order" advocated by some countries, Fu questioned the nature and origin of these rules.He emphasized that "there is only one order in the world, that is the international order based on international law," and that "there is only one set of rules," which are based on the UN Charter.Criticizing NATO, Fu accused the alliance of seeking to "expand its sphere of influence," creating "false narratives," and stirring up "confrontation between camps."He asserted, "History has amply proved that wherever NATO's hand extends, turmoil and chaos will ensue."Fu urged NATO and certain countries to "stop being the troublemakers who jeopardize common security at the expense of others."Fu concluded by stressing the interdependence of common development and common security as the foundation of a sound international order.He called for substantive progress in reforming the international financial architecture and governing artificial intelligence to help developing countries catch up.The ambassador urged the international community to resist practices that disrupt global production and supply chains, as these lead to "no winners."Looking ahead, Fu expressed hope for the upcoming Summit of the Future and the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, emphasizing the need to "practice true multilateralism" and build a "just, democratic, and sustainable international order."WASHINGTON -- US Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, who was accused of receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, including cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz, was found guilty on all counts Tuesday in his federal corruption trial.Federal prosecutors in New York alleged the New Jersey senator, formerly the head of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accepted bribes in exchange for helping foreign governments.A jury convicted Menendez of 16 federal charges including bribery, fraud, acting as a foreign agent and obstruction after more than 12 hours of deliberation over three days.Prosecutors said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) discovered gold bars and over 400,000 US dollars in cash hidden in various locations such as jackets and shoes within his residence.Prosecutors alleged that in return for the bribes, Menendez assisted in securing millions of dollars in US aid for Egypt.Two businessmen are facing trial for allegedly seeking the senator's assistance illegally to benefit the Egyptian government and secure millions of dollars from a Qatari investment fund. A third businessman pleaded guilty."This wasn't politics as usual; this was politics for profit," US Attorney Damian Williams, whose office prosecuted the case, said in a statement, citing "shocking levels of corruption."Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the upper chamber, immediately called on Menendez to resign from the Senate after the conviction."In light of this guilty verdict, Sen. Menendez must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate, and our country, and resign," Schumer said in a statement.In September 2023, Menendez willingly decided to step down from his position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after prosecutors revealed the charges against him.Menendez's conviction came as one of the piling up scandals in Congress. In December 2023, the US House of Representatives voted to expel New York Republican George Santos from Congress over the lies, scandals and alleged campaign finance crimes.NEW YORK - Four in five Americans are concerned about increasing political violence following an assassination attempt on former US president Donald Trump, and fear that the United States "is spiraling out of control", a Reuters/Ipsos poll found on Tuesday.Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. The shooting became an alarming headline of news and social media forms, and sent political shocks across the country, with only over three months away from the presidential election.Some 84 percent of voters in the poll said they were concerned that extremists will commit acts of violence after the November election, an increase from the 74 percent of the previous result in May.Around 80 percent of US voters, including Democrats and Republicans, agreed that "the country is spiraling out of the control".Only 5 percent of respondents said it was acceptable for someone in their political party to commit violence to achieve a political goal, down from 12 percent in a Reuters/Ipsos poll from June 2023.According to the poll, Republican presidential candidate Trump leads a margin over Democratic President Joe Biden, with 43 percent to 41 percent.It suggested that the attempt on Trump's life had not sparked a major shift in voter sentiment, Reuters said after the poll.The poll, which was conducted online, surveyed 1,202 US adults nationwide, including 992 registered voters. LIMA -- At least 21 people were killed and nearly 20 others injured in a passenger bus accident in the southern Peruvian region of Ayacucho on Tuesday, local authorities said.The interprovincial bus went off the road in the district of Paras, Cangallo province, Ayacucho region, and fell into a ravine about 200 meters deep, said Jhonny Rolando Valderrama, head of the National Police Road Protection Division, as reported by the state news agency Andina."Unofficially, there would be 21 deceased people," Valderrama said, adding that about 40 passengers were on the bus.The accident occurred around 05:00 am local time, very close to the town of Rumichaca, on the Los Libertadores national highway that crosses the border of the Huancavelica and Ayacucho regions, when the bus was traveling on the Lima-Ayacucho route.The regional health director of Ayacucho, John Tinco, said on RPP Radio that so far 15 injured had been counted, and were taken to the hospital.In May, 17 people were killed in a bus crash in the Ayacucho region, including Edgar Alarcon Tejada, the country's former comptroller general and a former congressman.If you live in Oklahoma or Alabama, you can now pick up baby formula along with a cartridge or two of bullets from your neighborhood grocery store.Instead of selling drinks, candy and chips usually found in vending machines, Texas-based American Rounds is putting machines selling ammunition in grocery stores.Included are various firearm calibers and ammo for rifles, shotguns and handguns, according to American Rounds.A video posted on the company's website, Grand Magers, CEO at American Rounds, said the first such machine was installed last November in Pell City, Alabama.The website showed that six such vending machines have been installed at supermarkets in Alabama and Oklahoma. Two others are planned soon for stores in North Texas and Colorado.A camera in the machine scans the customer's face to verify the buyer is 21 or older and matches the ID. The machine then dispenses the cartridge.Magers says in the video that the company is changing the landscape of ammunition sales to "make it more available" by moving them to grocery and convenience stores. He said the approach is safer because at a traditional sporting goods store, ammunition "sits on the shelf, it's very accessible, and there is a high rate of theft".The innovative technology has sparked fear in gun control advocates, FOX 7, a TV station in Central Texas, reported."In a country where guns are the leading cause of death for children and teens, Texas included, and in a state that has experienced some of the most high-profile mass shootings in recent years, expanding gun access and, in this case, ammunition access is the wrong direction," the report quoted Texas Gun Sense Executive Director Nicole Golden as saying.Joshua Horwitz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, told The New York Times that there were too many unknowns about how the machines could affect public safety to be installing them in stores without input from stakeholders, including legislators, law enforcement and Second Amendment supporters.Nick Suplina, senior vice-president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety, told The Associated Press that ammunition doesn't belong in a grocery store."Innovations that make ammunition sales more secure via facial recognition, age verification and the tracking of serial sales are promising safety measures that belong in gun stores, not in the place where you buy your kids milk," he said. "In a country awash in guns and ammo, where guns are the leading cause of deaths for kids, we don't need to further normalize the sale and promotion of these products."A Houston gun owner self-identified as Nancy B. said she would try the vending machine at least out of curiosity if it were available near her.She said that she normally buys ammunition from either local dealers or online. However, she has some misgivings. Nancy B. said that a customer needs to know what ammunition to buy because the machine shows only pictures.She also had a more serious concern: "What if some bad actors break the machine and rob all the ammo?"Whether selling ammunition in a grocery store is legal has been questioned. A grocery store in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, home to the University of Alabama, recently removed such a machine after the City Council questioned it, according to a local media report."I got some calls about ammunition being sold in grocery stores, the vending machines," Tuscaloosa Councilman Kip Tyner said before a council meeting, according to a local media report. "I thought it was a lie. I thought it was a joke but it's not."The local grocery manager said the removal was due to low sales.Federal law requires a buyer to be at least 18 or 21 years old, depending on the type of ammunition, and American Rounds limits sales to those 21 or older.So far, interest in the vending machines has come mostly from rural communities with small populations, Magers told the AP. For example, one vending machine was installed in Lindsay, Oklahoma, where the population is around 3,000."Someone in that community might have to drive an hour or an hour and a half to get supplied if they want to go hunting, for instance," he told AP. "Our grocery stores, they wanted to be able to offer their customer another category that they felt like would be popular."Agencies contributed to this story.Former US president Donald Trump announced Monday that he has chosen Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio as his running mate.Trump made the announcement on Truth Social as delegates were formally voting to name him the GOP presidential nominee in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the four-day Republican National Convention started on Monday."After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of vice-president of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio," Trump wrote.In the post, Trump pointed to Vance's potential appeal to voters in the Midwest."J.D. has had a very successful business career in Technology and Finance, and now, during the campaign, will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American workers and farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond", Trump wrote in his post.Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania helped propel US President Joe Biden to victory in 2020.Vance, who will turn 40 (Trump is 78, Biden 81) in August, was once a strong critic of Trump. In 2016, he suggested Trump could be "America's Hitler''.But as he began his 2022 Senate run, Vance deleted critical comments about Trump, said he was wrong, and credited Trump for the work he did in office as president. Trump then endorsed him in the Republican US Senate primary in Ohio.Vance has been one of Trump's most vocal supporters, appearing outside the New York City courthouse during Trump's criminal trial this year and on cable TV.Biden posted a fundraising appeal on social media about the Vance selection, saying that the Ohio senator "talks a big game about working people" but wants to raise taxes on the middle class while cutting them for the rich. "Protect democracy. Defeat Trump-Vance," it says.The convention started just two days after Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was struck by a bullet in the ear, and one attendee died after being shot by the gunman, who was killed by Secret Service snipers.There were widespread calls for unity from Republicans and Democrats after the assassination attempt.Two hours after shots were fired during the rally, Vance wrote on X that he believed the Biden campaign's rhetoric directly contributed to the shooting attempt."Today is not just some isolated incident," Vance wrote. "The central premise of the Biden campaign is that president Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to president Trump's attempted assassination."Vance is an investor, venture capitalist and best-selling author of his 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, in which he chronicled growing up in a family beset by drug addiction and poverty.Vance was born in Middleton, Ohio. He served in the US Marine Corps for four years, including a six-month deployment to Iraq, before studying political science and philosophy at Ohio State University and going on to graduate from Yale Law School. He went on to work at a large corporate law firm and then as a principal at an investment firm in San Francisco.Vance and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, have three children. His wife is the daughter of Indian immigrants and grew up in the San Francisco area. They met as students at Yale Law School and got married in 2014, one year after they graduated. She also has a master's degree in philosophy from the University of Cambridge.She was a corporate litigator at a San Francisco law firm and has clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he was an appeals court judge.J.D. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 after defeating former Democratic representative Tim Ryan for an open seat in Ohio.Vance has opposed US aid to Ukraine and opposes abortion, saying the government should find ways to encourage people to have children.Vance changed how he discussed abortion after Ohio and other states voted in favor of abortion access last year. In a December CNN interview, he said Republicans must "accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans". He recently said that he supports access to the abortion drug mifepristone.In the Senate, Vance has pushed both bipartisan and conservative legislation. He introduced a rail safety bill with Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, Ohio's senior senator, after the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Vance also worked with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on legislation to hold executives accountable for failed banks.Vance's other bills reflect conservative views. He introduced legislation to ban gender-affirming care for minors and a bill to eliminate government diversity programs.Before the V-P announcement, Trump learned that a judge had thrown out a federal classified documents case filed against him by special counsel Jack Smith.A federal judge in Florida dismissed the case, siding with defense lawyers who said the special counsel who filed the charges was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.Hours later, Smith's office said it would appeal the order.Agencies contributed to this story.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday that a gunman — one of whose volley of shots hit former US president Donald Trump in the ear — never should have reached his rooftop position."We are speaking of a failure," Mayorkas told CNN. "We are going to analyze through an independent review how that occurred, why it occurred, and make recommendations and findings to make sure it doesn't happen again."Mayorkas said that he still has "full confidence" in Secret Service's leadership.The top of Trump's right ear was torn by a bullet in the shooting at a rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which one of his supporters was killed and two others wounded before Secret Service agents shot dead the 20-year-old suspect, Thomas Crooks.Trump had turned his head slightly clockwise to look at a chart just before the bullet struck, which likely saved his life.At the rally, police had received a report of a suspicious man pacing near magnetometers. Witnesses pointed and shouted at an armed man on a nearby roof.When a Butler Township police officer climbed up to the roof to investigate, the gunman turned and pointed his rifle at him. But the officer did not — or could not — fire a single shot.Investigators are trying to determine how an armed man with no military background managed to reach high ground and get the jump on Secret Service agents.At least a dozen police officers and sheriff's deputies were assisting the Secret Service and Pennsylvania State Police with rally security.The Butler Township officer was hoisted by another officer so he could grab the edge of the roof, local officials said.The officer dropped back down to safety when the gunman turned and pointed his rifle at him, according to Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe.Slupe, who did not witness the encounter, said the officer could not have wielded his own gun under the circumstances."I think all law enforcement on site did everything that they could, especially the local law enforcement," Slupe told The Associated Press on Monday. "I hope they're not made a scapegoat, because they did their job to the best of their abilities."Butler Township Manager Tom Knights said the officer lost his grip and was not retreating when he fell 8 feet to the ground."He was literally dangling from the edge of a building and took the defensive position he needed to at that time. He couldn't hold himself up," Knights said.The officer, who was not identified, severely injured an ankle in the fall, Knights said.A former fire chief, 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, was killed in the shooting. A GoFundMe campaign for the man's family has raised more than $1 million.A law enforcement official told AP on condition of anonymity that investigators believe Crooks purchased 50 rounds of ammunition on the day of the shooting.Authorities said they believe the gunman's AR-style rifle was purchased by his father.Kevin Rojek, FBI special agent in charge in Pittsburgh, said investigators do not yet know if Crooks took the gun without his father's permission.The FBI believes Crooks, who had bomb-making materials in the car he drove to the rally, acted alone.The roof where Crooks lay was less than 150 meters (164 yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. That is a distance at which US Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M-16 rifle.The FBI said on Monday it had gained access to Crooks' phone as it searched for a motive."FBI technical specialists successfully gained access to Thomas Matthew Crooks' phone, and they continue to analyze his electronic devices," the bureau said in a statement. "The search of the subject's residence and vehicle are complete."The AR-style 556 rifle used by the shooter was legally purchased by his father and officials said there was no indication that the suspect suffered from any mental health issues.They added that a preliminary review of Crooks' calls and texts did not shed any light on his motive.In the aftermath of the shooting, President Joe Biden directed the Secret Service to protect independent presidential Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mayorkas said Monday.Kennedy's campaign has been urging the president to provide him with the protection for months and has sent multiple requests.Kennedy's uncle, President John F. Kennedy, and his father, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, were both assassinated less than five years apart in the 1960s.On Monday, Trump urged the government to provide the Secret Service detail to Kennedy, who had repeatedly been denied the protection."Given the history of the Kennedy Family, this is the obvious right thing to do!" Trump wrote on Truth Social."Thank you, President Biden, for extending me Secret Service protection," Kennedy said in a statement.In October, a man was arrested after trespassing twice in one day at Kennedy's Los Angeles home, and a month earlier, an armed man accused of impersonating a federal officer was taken into custody outside a Kennedy campaign event.Kennedy also thanked his private security firm, Gavin de Becker & Associates, "for keeping me safe for the past 15 months of my presidential campaign".Though Kennedy is a long shot to win Electoral College votes, much less the presidency, his campaign events have drawn large crowds people interested in his message.Amid calls for a toning down of political rhetoric in the US, Biden said in an interview Monday that it was "a mistake" to say that he wanted to put Trump back in "a bullseye", but also stood by his depictions that the former president is "a threat to democracy"."How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says?" Biden said to NBC's Lester Holt in an excerpt from the interview."Do you just not say anything because it may incite somebody?" he said."He talks about there'll be a blood bath if he loses," Biden said. Trump has maintained that he was referring to the economy.Just last week, Biden faced intense scrutiny and calls for him to step aside as the Democratic candidate from within his own party. The pressure began following Biden's listless performance in a debate against Trump on June 27.But Biden has dismissed the uproar and has vociferously maintained that he would continue as the candidate. Saturday's shooting has refocused media coverage.Ai Heping in New York and agencies contributed to this story.Krista Chan, a San Francisco Bay Area resident, often contemplated the striking contrast between the region's affluence and the persistence of homelessness. That led her to seek answers in the documentary Voices from the Frontline: China's War on Poverty, now a focal point in a censorship controversy."How can we learn from what they did?" Chan asked. "After watching this documentary, I can tell you it took a lot of innovative business models, anti-corruption efforts, planned relocation, and incredible sacrifice and hard work on the part of the Chinese people."Produced by PBS in 2019, the film, a collaboration between investment banker and China expert Robert Kuhn and Emmy-winning director Peter Getzels, documented China's methods to lift 800 million people out of extreme poverty in the past 40 years.The film crew traversed China, engaging with locals for in-depth discussions and exploring bottom-up poverty-alleviation programs that played a crucial role in eradicating poverty for the final 100 million people impoverished.However, after its initial release, the documentary faced harsh criticism from anti-China politicians, who accused it of portraying China in an overly positive light. Their pressure led to PBS taking down the film after a single showing.PBS didn't respond to a request for comment from China Daily."I have seen this documentary and also traveled to China since I was a young child, witnessing firsthand how China has modernized and uplifted the poorest," said Chan, a volunteer with the "China is not our enemy" campaign of the anti-war group CodePink.She cited the World Bank's 2022 report, which revealed that China contributed "close to three quarters of the global reduction" in extreme poverty over the past 40 years. "That's pretty incredible," she added.One of the key takeaways for Chan from the film was the unwavering political will demonstrated by the Chinese government.From young cadre in small villages to Chinese President Xi Jinping himself, "this has been their priority — to dedicate themselves to serving people through poverty alleviation," she explained. "Maybe that's the little secret PBS doesn't want us to know. They don't want us to know that China is working hard to meet people's needs while Americans grapple with student debt and a soaring cost of living."The censorship of the documentary has sparked growing concern among peace and human rights activists. CodePink has been actively raising awareness of the film, hoping to encourage broader discussion among Americans.The group stressed that the documentary provides not only insights into successful poverty alleviation but also a deeper understanding of China, a country often demonized in the public eye in the US."Censoring the documentary only serves those wanting to escalate divisions between the US and China," warned CodePink on its website. "By censoring Voices from the Frontline: China's War on Poverty, they also deprive the public of the opportunity to learn about poverty-alleviation policies that have changed millions of lives. Right now, amidst an increasingly dangerous climate crisis and high poverty rates, we need understanding and cooperation instead of censorship and fear."The organization encourages the public to contact it for access to the full film. Last month, they delivered a petition with more than 5,800 signatures to PBS national headquarters in Virginia, demanding the release of the documentary. Similar petitions have been delivered to local PBS stations across the country, including in Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Maine and New Hampshire.In San Francisco, peace groups, including CodePink, Pivot to Peace, ANSWER Coalition, and Veterans for Peace, rallied on Saturday in front of KQED, a PBS affiliate, demanding the airing of the documentary."People deserve to see the positive things that are going on in China," said CodePink San Francisco organizer Cynthia Papermaster at the rally. "PBS is supposed to be an educational broadcasting company. So, show the film and have discussion."Richard Becker, West Coast coordinator of the ANSWER Coalition, noted that poverty, once a prominent topic in US presidential campaigns, has been sidelined."Maybe there's a fear of the elite that if they showed something about how this miraculous transformation has happened in China — alleviating poverty for 800 million people — that you might have to start talking about poverty in the United States," he said.Julie Tang, a retired San Francisco Superior Court judge and co-founder of Pivot to Peace, recounted her own experience witnessing China's transformation. When she visited China 20 years ago, she saw people living in shabby houses next to mountains in a dangerous environment. "Today, those things are no more. We see beautiful houses lined up," she said."People are prevented from seeing the truth of what's happening in China. It is a shame because a documentary like this can help ameliorate a lot of the tensions that are going on in the US-China relationship right now," said Tang.WASHINGTON - Former US president Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, received enough delegate votes on Monday to officially become the party's nominee and announced that he has chosen Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate in the Nov 5 presidential election.The former president garnered a majority of votes from delegates at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He reached the required threshold with votes from Florida, which were announced by his son, Eric Trump.Trump is scheduled to formally accept the party's nomination in a prime-time speech on Thursday. He will lead the Republican Party through a third consecutive election, following his victory against Hillary Clinton in 2016 and his defeat to current President Joe Biden in 2020.The four-day convention commenced in downtown Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum two days after Trump barely survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and hours after he secured a significant legal victory when a federal judge dismissed one of his criminal prosecutions.The assassination attempt, which killed one bystander and left Trump with a bloodied ear, immediately shifted the focus of the presidential campaign.US District Judge Aileen Cannon ruled on Monday to dismiss federal charges against Trump for retaining classified documents after leaving the White House, which effectively removed a major legal threat against the former president, who faces other criminal cases that he says should also be thrown out."This dismissal of the lawless indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of all the witch hunts," Trump said on Truth Social on Monday, also referring to the prosecution of hundreds of his supporters who stormed the US Capitol on Jan 6, 2021.Earlier Monday, Trump announced via his social media platform Truth Social that he had chosen Vance as his running mate, ending months of speculation on his vice president pick.Vance, 39, was elected to the US Senate in 2022 and sworn into office in January 2023. He was a fierce Trump critic in 2016 but has since become a prominent supporter of the former president's "Make America Great Again" agenda, particularly on trade, foreign policy and immigration.He first achieved recognition with the 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy", a bestseller which detailed his Appalachian family background and Rust Belt upbringing. The book gave a voice to rural, working-class resentment in left-behind America.Analysts say Vance's selection will boost Trump's support in the Nov 5 election, especially in some Rust Belt states where the election is likely to be decided, but it offers less opportunity to win over more moderate voters and women.Earlier in the day, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the other two finalists, were told they would not be selected.Following the assassination attempt on former United States president Donald Trump during a campaign rally on Saturday, there was much commentary as to whether the US Secret Service had provided adequate security.The Secret Service is facing scrutiny after a 20-year-old man, identified by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was armed with an AR-style rifle, was able to go unnoticed by security as he scaled a building less than 150 meters away.Bomb-making materials were found inside Crooks' vehicle and at his home, officials said.The FBI has taken the lead role in the investigation, the bureau said. On Sunday, the FBI said that the shooter likely acted alone. His motives remain unclear.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose department oversees the Secret Service, said that officials were engaged with President Joe Biden's and Trump's campaigns, and were "taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security".Bill Pickle, a former deputy assistant Secret Service director, told The Wall Street Journal that how the agency communicated with local law enforcement and used technology such as drones will be investigated."The reality is there's just no excuse for the Secret Service to be unable to provide sufficient resources to cover an open rooftop 100 yards away from the site," Pickle said. "And there's no way he should've got those shots off."House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer said in a statement that he has "already contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and is also calling on Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing".The Secret Service said at a news conference on Sunday that it was confident in its existing security plan and hadn't made any changes following the shooting.Both Trump and Biden sought calm and unity on Sunday in the wake of the shooting.Trump arrived in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Sunday evening for the Republican National Convention, which began on Monday.Trump told the Washington Examiner that he had rewritten his speech for the event to focus more on national unity than on Biden's policies. "This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would've been two days ago," he said.Trump is due to receive his party's formal nomination at the convention on Thursday.In the third time that Biden addressed the shooting, the president said from the Oval Office on Sunday night that it was time to "lower the temperature" in US politics."All of us now face a time of testing as the election approaches," he said.Biden, who is running against Trump in a rematch of 2020, said the two men had a "short but good "conversation on Saturday night.Crooks, the shooter, was a registered Republican, but had also given $15 to a progressive group on Biden's Inauguration Day more than three years ago, The New York Times reported.Saturday's shooting has increased calls for independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to receive Secret Service protection.Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story.hengweili@chinadailyusa.com Large swathes of Central Europe continue to brace against floods, the worst in at least two decades, prompting officials to warn that such extreme weather events could become the norm due to climate change.Heavy flooding this week has affected Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, with at least 21 fatalities reported across the countries as of Wednesday.While some areas have seen waters recede, others prepared for river overflows, as the floods moved through different zones, forcing residents and authorities to respond to rapidly changing conditions.Torrential rains brought by Storm Boris on the weekend have destroyed infrastructure, submerged vehicles, and caused billions of euros in damages.Areas along the Czech Republic-Poland border have suffered the worst damage, reported Reuters, as debris-filled rivers destroyed historic towns, bridges, and houses, leaving tens of thousands without power or fresh water.Cities including Wroclaw, Poland's third-largest and situated on the Oder River, and Budapest, the Hungarian capital on the Danube River, were braced for flooding from rising water levels.The European Union's executive branch issued a stark warning on Wednesday, citing the catastrophic floods across Central Europe and lethal wildfires in Portugal as combined evidence of climate collapse, predicting such events will become commonplace without immediate and decisive action."Make no mistake. This tragedy is not an anomaly. This is fast becoming the norm for our shared future," said EU Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic.Storm Boris brought record rainfall in areas including Lower Austria on the weekend, when cold northern air met moisture from the Mediterranean Sea, which had reached unprecedented summer temperatures.Rampant wildfires in northern Portugal during the last week have killed at least seven people. More than 5,000 firefighters have been deployed to combat the blazes that Portugal's Prime Minister Luis Montenegro described as "raging across the country".Researchers say fossil fuel emissions have exacerbated global heatwaves, making them longer, more frequent, and more intense, which in turn raises the likelihood of wildfires."Europe is the fastest-warming continent globally and is particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events like the one we are discussing today. We could not return to a safer past," Lenarcic told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France.Countries are also struggling with escalating financial costs of both emergency repairs and the process of post-disaster recovery, said Lenarcic."The average cost of disasters in the 1980s was 8 billion euros ($8.9 billion) per year. More recently, in 2021 and in 2022, the damage is surpassed 50 billion euros per year, meaning the cost of inaction is far greater than the cost of action," he said.According to Terry Reintke, who leads the Greens group in the European Parliament, the financial burden on the EU resulting from these climate events has been calculated at approximately 650 billion euros since the 1980s."Our success will depend on how determined we are to combat climate change together in order to reduce emissions," Reintke said. BUDAPEST -- Hungary has entered the most challenging phase of dealing with the current wave of flooding, Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced on Wednesday.Orban told a press conference in Budapest that the peak of the flood wave hit Hungary from Tuesday night to dawn on Wednesday. Defense efforts are projected to last for around a week, with the floodwaters expected to leave the southern border to Serbia by next Thursday.The flood wave on the Danube is expected to peak at Budapest on Saturday, between afternoon and evening, at 40-50 cm lower than the 846 cm historic high in 2013, Orban said.He told journalists that this phase of flood defense, involving water management officials, disaster management, the military, and volunteers, would be the most difficult.However, the Prime Minister added that the country's flood defenses have successfully withstood the strain so far. He characterized this year's defense as "preparing for known and anticipated events," emphasizing that previous experience from 2013 has equipped authorities to handle the situation.Around 4,400 workers have been dispatched by the water and disaster management authorities, Orban said. Police and prison services are currently participating in flood defense efforts across 544 km of river in Hungary.The government has invested 435 billion forints ($1.22 billion) in flood protection since 2013, resulting in better infrastructure, Orban underlined.Hungary has not reported any casualties so far but continuous rainfalls in other Central and Eastern European countries over the last few days has claimed lives, triggered evacuations, and caused widespread damage and disruption. BRUSSELS -- US technology firm Qualcomm will have to pay a fine of 238.7 million euros ($265 million) for abusing its dominant position, the European Union's General Court ruled on Wednesday.The European Commission originally imposed a fine of 242 million euros on Qualcomm in July 2019, saying it held a dominant position on the market of chipsets at a worldwide level at least from the start of 2009 till the end of 2011.The Commission said that Qualcomm had abused its dominant position in those years by supplying some of its Universal Mobile Telecommunications System chipsets to Chinese Huawei and ZTE at below-cost prices with an intention of eliminating Icera, its main rival at the time.Qualcomm sought to have the fine annulled or significantly reduced, citing procedural issues, including the excessive length of the investigation. However, the court dismissed all of Qualcomm's arguments except one concerning the fine's calculation, which resulted in a slight reduction.The court pointed out that the Commission substantiated Qualcomm's intention to eliminate Icera from the market "by providing both direct and indirect evidence." MOSCOW -- Two people have been killed and seven have been injured in a shooting near the office of Russia's online retailer Wildberries, local media reported Wednesday citing the Russian Investigative Committee.The BRICS Media Summit has started in Moscow. The event gathered leading experts from over 60 media outlets from 45 countries. The main theme of the meeting is "The Role of Media in a Multipolar World".The Media Summit is attended by high-ranking officials and media representatives not only from the BRICS countries but also from nations interested in expanding cooperation with the union. The guests were welcomed by the photo exhibition "BRICS Family," which showcases the works of photojournalists from Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Ethiopia, South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.At the opening ceremony, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov greeted the participants of the summit in the format of a video message. He noted the role of the media in interstate communication development, strengthening the atmosphere of friendship, trust, and mutual understanding between peoples."I hope that the summit will become a platform for establishing business contacts and sharing experience and will contribute to the emergence of a constructive news and information agenda based on truth and verified facts," Lavrov said.Fu Hua, executive chairman of the BRICS Media Forum and President of China's Xinhua News Agency, also addressed the event. He emphasised that the media have a special mission, being active participants in the construction of the BRICS cooperation mechanism."We (the media. - Ed.) will continue working to make our voice heard, to bring progress, and to establish a multipolar world. We want the BRICS story to be globally recognised and the influence of the union to grow," Fu Hua said.The meeting includes a plenary session on "The role of the BRICS media community in bolstering stability in a multipolar world".Speakers will include representatives of TV BRICS media partners, including Jose Juan Sanchez, CMA Group President, Yu Zijun, Secretary General of the Chinese newspaper People's Daily, Yohannes Wondirad, Director of Public Relations and Strategic Partnerships of the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA), and Luis Enrique Gonzalez Acosta, President of Prensa Latina News Agency.In an exclusive commentary for TV BRICS, Yohannes Wondirad said the ongoing summit in Moscow will help the media to build partnerships, exchange ideas, and deepen cooperation."The main purpose of the BRICS Media Summit is to share experience. We can, for instance, learn something new from TV BRICS. Ethiopian news agencies in Africa will, in turn, pass on their experience to this international media network and other Russian media or media from the group's countries. So this is a good opportunity," he explained.Furthermore, during the panel discussion, the Chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Leonid Slutsky, noted the efficient work of TV BRICS."In 2017 in China at the IX BRICS summit on the proposal of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the TV BRICS International Media Network was created. Today, this network has united more than 70 media outlets from around the world; it has 1.5 billion users and content in five languages: Russian, English, Chinese, Portuguese, and Spanish. I am confident that the BRICS information space will expand in the near future," he said.On Sunday, experts will discuss the technological transformation of BRICS media at a plenary session. Mohammad Sarfi, editor-in-chief of Tehran Times, will participate in the roundtable.The BRICS Media Summit takes place from Sept 13 to 17 in the year of Russia's chairmanship in the group. The event was established in 2015 as a non-governmental platform for dialogue between the leading media outlets of the group's countries.This is the seventh time the meeting has been held, but now it is in a summit format.TV BRICSEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Tuesday her new team of commissioners during her second five-year term, just a day after Thierry Breton, France's European commissioner for internal market, abruptly resigned by accusing his boss of "questionable governance".The new team includes six executive vice-presidents, four women and two men. The previous third layer of vice-presidents has been dropped.Stephane Sejourne, the 39-year-old outgoing French foreign minister, whom French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Monday as the new candidate to replace Breton, will be the executive vice-president for prosperity and industrial strategy.The other executive vice-presidents are: Teresa Ribera of Spain for the clean, just and competitive transition; Henna Virkkunen of Finland for tech sovereignty, security and democracy; Roxana Minzatu of Romania for people, skills and preparedness, and Raffaele Fitto of Italy for cohesion and reforms, while Kaja Kallas of Estonia was named the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy.The new commission is not gender-balanced as von der Leyen had wished. Of the 26 nominees, only 11, or 40 percent, are women. But von der Leyen argued that when she received the first set of nominations, only 22 percent were women."That was unacceptable. So I worked with the member states and we were able to improve the balance to 40 percent women and 60 percent men. And it shows that, as much as we have achieved, there is still so much more work to do," she told a news conference on Tuesday in Strasbourg during the European Parliament plenary session.She also announced on Monday night on social media platform X that executive vice-president Margrethe Vestager of Denmark will take over Breton's portfolio during the remaining period of the mandate.Anger voicedIn an open letter on X on Monday morning, Breton said he was standing down from his role effectively immediately, expressing his anger that von der Leyen has tried to stop him from reappointment in the next European Commission.Breton, 69, is widely regarded as an influential commissioner with his portfolio covering digital market regulations, critical raw materials, COVID-19 vaccines and boosting the EU's defense and space industries since 2019. Many had thought he would be promoted to be a commission vice-president for the next five years."In the very final stretch of negotiations on the composition of the future College (of Commissioners), you asked France to withdraw my name," Breton wrote in a scathing letter to von der Leyen, also posted on X.Breton said von der Leyen had "offered, as a political trade-off, an allegedly more influential portfolio for France in the future College"."In light of the latest developments — further testimony to questionable governance — I have to conclude that I can no longer exercise my duties in the College," he wrote.At the Monday daily news briefings, European Commission deputy chief spokeswoman Arianna Podesta was bombarded with some 40 minutes of questions on the subject, but she would not comment on Breton's accusations.Breton angered von der Leyen in March by publicly questioning the support for her in the June reelection from her center-right European People's Party.He was also one of the four commissioners who challenged von der Leyen's "transparency and impartiality" in April over the appointment of Markus Pieper, a political ally, to a well-paid job as European Union's envoy for small and medium-sized enterprises.The other three — foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and commissioners Nicolas Schmit from Luxembourg and Paolo Gentiloni from Italy, are also not in von der Leyen's team in the second term.Breton triggered a storm in August when he warned X owner Elon Musk of possible harmful content ahead of his interview with former US president Donald Trump on X. But von der Leyen's commission distanced itself from Breton's message, which was criticized as an assault on freedom of expression."It's a good day for free speech," Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, posted a comment on Monday on Breton's open letter on X.Germany has reintroduced border checks scrapped decades ago as part of its membership of the European Union, in a move aimed at reducing cross-border crime and the flow of immigrants into the country.The checks — reintroduced in the west and north of the country on Monday along borders with Belgium, France, Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands — increased tension between Germany and its neighbors and seemed to signal the end of the EU ideal of borderless, visa-free travel.The country reintroduced similar checks last year, along its borders with Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Switzerland.Berlin said it had no choice, after successive years in which irregular arrivals from the Middle East and Africa have placed a strain on its infrastructure and the influx has led to the rise of the far right.The border checks will be carried out during the coming six months while the government decides whether to make them permanent. It means all of Germany's land crossings are now subject to controls.Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the reintroduction of checks in some areas last year ensured more than 30,000 unauthorized entries were blocked."That is why we will expand our temporary border control to include all of Germany's land borders," Faeser said. "My order is also intended to protect against the acute threat of Islamist extremist terrorism and serious cross-border crime."The checks will be carried out by police officers on a random basis, with most people still likely to flow through freely. Officers will target their checks based on information and the security situation, she said.The Interior Ministry said travelers, even those from EU countries, should have valid identification and people from outside the EU will also need valid entry documents.With a federal election due next year and the far right polling well, Svenja Niederfranke, an immigration expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations, told Euronews: "The German government wants to show that they are doing something… this is very important political signaling … that we take back control of our borders."Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk criticized the move, saying more immigrants will settle in neighboring countries as a result. And Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer said it means his country will likely now also have to reintroduce checks, sending the EU's border-free ideal into tatters.And as a potential row between Germany and the EU over the issue brews, the cost of the new checks has also been questioned, with one police union saying an additional 5,000 officers will be needed.ATHENS -- A fire broke out on Tuesday at the Motor Oil refineries complex near the city of Corinth, about 70 kilometers west of Athens, local authorities said.No injuries have been reported, according to the local fire brigade.Greece's civil protection officials have advised residents in the area to evacuate as a precaution, following an explosion at the facilities, as firefighting forces have been deployed.A plume of thick black smoke has covered the area, and roads near the complex have been closed.Motor Oil (Hellas) Corinth Refineries S.A. is a petroleum industry group based in Greece. It is a leading supplier and trader of fuels in southeastern Europe, and manages a network of fuelling stations in Greece, Cyprus, and the Western Balkans, according to Greek national news agency AMNA.PARIS -- A fire broke out in the 13th arrondissement of Paris on Tuesday afternoon, leaving two people injured, according to local media reports.The blaze started around 5 pm local time (1500 GMT) on a rooftop under renovation, as reported by the French news channel BFMTV.Two gas bottles exploded as a result of the fire, further intensifying the situation. Fortunately, workers on site and nearby residents were evacuated promptly before the explosions occurred.Emergency services quickly responded to the scene, with firefighters battling the flames. A firefighter and a worker were injured during the response, though no further details about their condition have been provided at this time.As a precaution, an elementary school located nearby was also evacuated, according to Jerome Coumet, the mayor of Paris's 13th arrondissement, who spoke to BFMTV. The fire was brought under control around 7 pm local time (1700 GMT), Coumet confirmed.The police have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the fire.As part of the Mid-Autumn Festival hosted by the London Chinatown Chinese Association on Sunday, China's mesmerizing face-changing performance drew the attention of many local residents and visitors alike.Video by Han Jing.China won 36 gold, nine silver, and four bronze medals at the 47th WorldSkills Competition in Lyon, France.

"They cannot cut with scissors. They cannot climb a tree. They cannot walk backward because they are sitting with their cell phones."A lack of physical activity linked to excessive screen time was even resulting in youngsters developing physical ailments more usually associated with the elderly, he added, and disrupted sleep patterns linked to mobile phone use are contributing to increased anxiety and depression, especially among girls.Currently, there are voluntary restrictions on access to personal digital devices in school in the country, but this could now be made the law, and, if so, it would follow a growing trend across Europe for limiting young people's screen time.Earlier this month, France became the latest country to introduce a trial ban on phones, which must be handed over at the start of the school day, in an effort to give youngsters what has been called "a digital pause".A report by a commission set up by President Emmanuel Macron made similar observations about the damage done by phones to those noted in Sweden, including "a very clear consensus on the direct and indirect negative effects of digital devices on sleep, on being sedentary, a lack of physical activity, and the risk of being overweight and even obese … as well as on sight".Servane Mouton, a neurologist who served on the commission, said it was not just down to young people, however, adding "we have to teach parents once again how to play with their children".Italy banned phones for all school-age groups in 2007, before reversing the decision in 2017, only to impose it again in 2022.Portugal has designated phone-free school days. And there are regional bans in Spain and limitations and guidelines aimed at curbing use of phones in Germany and the United Kingdom."For far too long, we have allowed screens and apps to steal time and attention at the cost of what we know is needed to feel well," added Forssmed. "Children's health is paying the price for tech companies' profits."Dominique Pelicot, the 71-year-old French man accused of drugging his then-wife and inviting dozens of men to rape her over a period of nearly a decade, confessed in court on Tuesday to his guilt for the various criminal charges he faces.The white-haired grandfather appeared in the dock at the Vaucluse Criminal Court in Avignon, where he is on trial alongside 50 other men, all accused of the "aggravated rape" of his former wife, Gisele Pelicot, who is 72.Dominique Pelicot also faces charges in the mass trial that began on Sept 2 and that is due to run until mid-December relating to various privacy breaches because of his alleged recording and disseminating of sexual images.According to prosecutors, Pelicot, who was first arrested in 2020 after trying to film up a woman's skirt in a supermarket, offered sex with his wife online and filmed the subsequent abuse.He is said to have sedated his wife by putting crushed sleeping tablets and Temesta – a powerful anti-anxiety drug – into her meals and drinks, reported news agencies."I admit to the charges in their entirety," Pelicot, told the court, adding: "I am a rapist just like all the others in this room."He said his co-defendants "all knew" he was inviting them to rape her and added "she did not deserve this"."I ask my wife, my children, my grandchildren to accept my apologies," he said. "I regret what I did. I ask for your forgiveness, even if it is not forgivable."Pelicot's testimony in the case, which has stunned France, was originally scheduled for last week but was postponed due to health concerns.Gisele Pelicot, who was present during his testimony, was given permission to react immediately to her ex-husband's confession.She said: "It is difficult to hear from the mouth of Mr Pelicot what he has just said. For 50 years, I lived with a man who I would never have imagined for a single second that he could do these acts. I had complete confidence in this man."Fourteen other defendants have admitted rape, while the rest deny any wrongdoing. If found guilty, they face up to 20 years in jail.Gisele Pelicot insisted on a public trial to expose the accused and shed light on sexual violence, her lawyers said. She has become a symbol of the struggle against sexual violence in France, said Reuters news agency, with hundreds of supporters, mostly women, demonstrating across the country.In a separate case, Dominique Pelicot faces additional charges for the alleged 1991 rape and murder of Sophie Narme, a 23-year-old estate agent in Paris. In a similar attack, a 19-year-old estate agent escaped after resisting. Police have said that DNA from blood at the scene matches Pelicot's profile. Greece is urging its citizens to have more babies, in the hope that a growing population will get its economy moving again.The Mediterranean nation of 10.5 million people has had economic woes since 2008, when the global economic crash hit it especially hard because of its high debt load.Now, the government has unveiled a package of incentives — including vouchers, childcare support, and tax breaks — aimed at persuading people to procreate."It is a given that the demographic problem ... cannot simply be solved by benefits and cash incentives," Deputy Finance Minister Thanos Petralias said during a news conference last week, while also promising improvements to the country's education system and its healthcare provisions. In addition, Petralias said Greece will try to bolster people's incomes and help parents find a better work-life balance.Greece has one of Europe's lowest fertility rates — with around 1.3 babies born for every woman — which is something experts attribute to the economic crisis and to the emigration of many young people to countries with stronger economies.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has described the falling birth rate as a "ticking time bomb" that could have a devastating impact on the country's pension system, as fewer workers, and especially a workforce hit by an exodus of high-earning skilled workers, falls short of being able to support the country's retired citizens.The new batch of incentives aimed at boosting the birth rate came on top of the around 1 billion euros a year ($1.11 billion) the government is already spending on supporting families.Despite all the efforts, in 2022 Greece recorded its smallest number of births since records began nearly a century ago.The Reuters news agency said Greece, which is the European Union's second-poorest nation, is planning to unveil an additional set of measures later this year aimed at increasing its birthrate. They are expected to include additional affordable housing for young families, financial incentives for new parents, and ways to incorporate migrants into the country's workforce. There is also likely to be financial support for people needing in-vitro fertilization and egg donation services.Although Greece's economy did finally grow a little last year, expanding by a welcome 2 percent, it is still much smaller than it was in 2007, prompting experts to ask whether the country can afford such incentives in the longer term.While Greece has a particularly big problem, low birth rates have become an issue all over Europe, with France, Italy, Norway, and Spain all having recently unveiled incentives to try to reverse the trend. Among these, Hungary said recently it will offer loans of 30,000 euros to people thinking of starting or growing a family. United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer says he is "interested" in finding out more about Italy's migration control plans, including one for the temporary holding of migrants in Albania, ahead of a visit to Rome to meet his Italian counterpart, Giorgia Meloni.Because of its proximity to North Africa, the route used by many migrants to enter the European Union, Italy receives more migrants than any other EU member state, but according to figures from Frontex, the EU's border force, this year, there has been a 64 percent drop in attempted entries.The UK's departure from the EU has led to a surge in people trying to make the dangerous crossing of the English Channel from France, because there is currently no legislative facility to return them, frequently resulting in tragedy.The previous Conservative Party government devoted much effort and money to a plan to send would-be migrants to Rwanda, which yielded no results whatsoever.When the Labour Party won the general election in July, one of its first acts was to abandon this, but so far it has not come up with an alternative."I've long believed that prevention and stopping people traveling in the first place is one of the best ways to deal with this particular issue," said Starmer.Italy has taken steps to deal with the challenge of migration both as part of a wider EU approach and independently.The EU has paid significant money to Tunisia to improve border security and coastguard facilities, and Italy has supplied patrol vessels and also made arrangements with nearby Libya.But there has been concern about this because of fears over human rights abuses in some of the countries the EU has been dealing with."It seems that we are bankrolling dictators across the region," said Mounir Satouri, a French member of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee. "That is not the Europe that we want to see. That is not the place which the EU should be holding in the world".In November 2023, Meloni signed a deal with the government of Albania for it to build two migration centers, funded and managed by Italy, in Albania, where up to 36,000 people could be held while their asylum claims are assessed.Although the Albanian authorities have said they only have such a deal with Italy, it has clearly caught the eye of the UK government.In a BBC interview on Sunday, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the two prime ministers would discuss Italy's approach to migration, "particularly with Albania".When quizzed on the topic by Sky News, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper also hinted that it was something of interest.The arrangement, she said, is "effectively around having a fast track for those who have arrived from predominantly safe countries and is also a scheme that is monitored by the UNHCR (the United Nations' refugee agency) as well to make sure that proper standards are in place and we will see how it develops." Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed the possibility of delivering long-range precision weapons to Ukraine, even if NATO allies decide differently.Scholz reaffirmed his opposition to supplying Taurus cruise missiles with comments made in response to questions at a public forum in the town of Prenzlau, in Germany's eastern state of Brandenburg, on the weekend.He stated that such an action would involve "a great risk of escalation" in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.The 500-kilometer range of Taurus cruise missiles would extend Ukraine's potential attack radius to include Moscow, reported the DPA news agency."I said no to that," Scholz said. "And of course that also applies to other weapons, if we had supplied them, which could reach this long distance."Scholz said his decision "remains the case … even if other countries decide differently".Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been calling for long-range weaponry to enable Ukrainian military forces to strike Russian supply lines and air bases situated beyond the immediate combat zone.DPA noted that while Germany's longest-range weapon supplied to Ukraine has a range of 84 kilometers, some NATO allies have supplied missiles that are able to reach up to 300 km, sparking debate about potentially authorizing strikes on Russian soil.Scholz's remarks follow recent comments from United States President Joe Biden on potentially lifting restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range Western weapons to strike targets within Russian territory.United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with Biden at the White House last week, and despite holding talks on weapons for Ukraine, the leaders gave no clear indication of their intentions.During his address in Prenzlau on Saturday, Scholz also emphasized Berlin's commitment to bringing those responsible for the 2022 Nord Stream gas pipelines attack to justice."That was a terroristic act," Scholz declared, noting that his administration had instructed security agencies and prosecutors to pursue the investigation. "We want to bring those who did this, if we can get a hold of them, to court in Germany."He added that there would be "no leniency" with the case.On Monday, Russian officials said Scholz was correct to seek a comprehensive inquiry into the explosions that ruptured the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines that were built to carry Russian gas to Europe under the Baltic Sea, reported Reuters.The Kremlin suggested that certain Western nations were attempting to suppress the true circumstances of the incident.No one has ever claimed responsibility for the explosions, which took place seven months after the outbreak of conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Scholz noted that prior to the blasts, Russia had already ceased pumping gas through the pipelines. He added that replacing Russian gas supplies with alternative supplies had brought Germany costs exceeding 100 billion euros ($111 billion). Storm Boris has wreaked havoc across Central and Eastern Europe, causing record rainfall and flash floods that have claimed at least five lives in Poland and Romania, forced hundreds of people to evacuate, and left many stranded as of Sunday.A slow-moving low-pressure system that arrived on Friday and is expected to linger for days has unleashed a month's worth of rain in just 24 hours across Poland, Romania, Austria, the Czech Republic and Hungary, news agencies reported.Rising floodwaters have overwhelmed emergency services in the Czech Republic, Poland and Austria, while Romania faced tragedy with four flood-related fatalities on Saturday, amid unprecedented downpours.Rescue services in Romania battled severe flooding in eastern counties, particularly Galati and Vaslui, where the four deaths were reported.Romania's President Klaus Iohannis addressed the flood crisis on social media."Severe floods that have affected a large part of the country have led to loss of lives and significant damage," he said."We are again dealing with the effects of climate change, which are increasingly present throughout the European continent, with dramatic consequences on people. We must continue to strengthen our capacity to anticipate extreme weather phenomena," he added.In the Czech Republic, river waters swelled to alarming levels in many areas, with authorities evacuating hundreds, including hospital patients in the southeastern city of Brno.More than 70 areas received the highest flood warnings, with officials from the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute stating such "extreme floods" occur only once a century in these regions.In Austria, 24 villages in the northeast province of Lower Austria were declared "disaster zones" and evacuated. A firefighter battling flooding in Lower Austria was killed, Austrian Vice-Chancellor Werner Kogler said on social media."We are experiencing difficult and dramatic hours in Lower Austria," stated the governor of the province, Johanna Mikl-Leitner."For many people in Lower Austria, these will be the hardest hours of their lives," she added.In Poland's second-largest city, Krakow, which lies on the Vistula River that has reached extreme low water levels in recent months due to record-breaking heat waves, severe flooding forced resident evacuations and disrupted public transportation.In southwestern Poland's Klodzko district, one person drowned and 1,600 residents were evacuated.After meeting with a crisis management team in Klodzko town on Sunday, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk emphasized the gravity of the situation."The situation is very dramatic, it's most dramatic in Klodzko county," Tusk said.In Slovakia and Hungary, heavy rain is making flooding worse along the Danube River, keeping rescue workers busy.Slovakia declared a state of emergency in its capital, Bratislava, due to severe flooding. In Germany, rising water levels have affected southern and eastern regions, with authorities issuing flood warnings for rivers in Saxony.The floods in Central and Eastern Europe follow an unusually hot early September in the region and Earth's hottest summer on record. Climate change is intensifying rainfall patterns, reported Euronews. French officials say at least eight people died on Saturday night when a boat sank off the coast of the Pas-de-Calais region in the north of France, attempting to cross the English Channel to the United Kingdom.The incident comes less than two weeks after another boat of migrants attempting the trip sank, claiming at least 12 lives in the deadliest incident in the seaway so far this year.The boat in the latest incident had around 60 people on board, from countries including Eritrea, Iran, Sudan and Syria. Coast guard officials said it was reported to be in difficulty near the French coastal town of Ambleteuse, in a position where they could not offer assistance from the sea.It came apart after being driven onto rocks, and emergency services tended to 53 people and confirmed eight deaths.Since leaving the European Union, the UK has no arrangement to return migrants to France, from where so many of them make their crossing, as it is the closest point between the UK and mainland Europe.Since this year, it is estimated that more than 21,000 people have tried to cross in small, often dangerously overcrowded and unseaworthy boats, and there have been more than 30 deaths.In the 24 hours from Friday to Saturday night, French coast guards recovered 200 people off the coast of Calais, with the highest number in a single incident being 61. On Saturday alone, 18 attempted boat launches were observed.British Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC that he had seen the "awful sort of rubber dinghies that people are coming across the Channel with, many of them, of course, not able to make it in these contraptions".The government has said the focus of its efforts to get to grips with the issue will be to target the people-smuggling gangs who run the boats. Lammy added that it had been "discussing how we go after those gangs, in cooperation upstream with other European partners".On Monday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to be in Italy, the country that has the most migrant arrivals in the EU. Lammy said Italy's handling of the crisis, which includes an agreement with Albania for the temporarily housing of asylum claimants, would be on the agenda when Starmer met Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.But a Home Office source later said that Britain exploring a similar setup involving another country "is not something we are working on", to avoid any confusion over government policy.Enver Solomon, CEO of London-based charity Refugee Council, said it was a mistake to think that rule enforcement was the only solution to the ongoing crisis that has led to so many deaths."People are being forced into the arms of smugglers because they are desperate, fleeing violence and persecution in countries like Afghanistan, Syria and Sudan in search of safety," he told The Guardian newspaper."Smugglers will respond to tougher policing by making these refugees take bigger risks, with more perilous crossing points and more crowded boats." PARIS -- Eight migrants died while attempting to cross the English Channel from France between Saturday night and Sunday morning, France's Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea said on Sunday.Besides the 8 deaths, six other people were found in relative critical conditions, the French news channel BFMTV reported, citing Jacques Billant, prefect of France's northern department of Pas-de-Calais.According to Billant, a boat carrying 59 migrants was seen shortly before midnight near the town of Ambleteuse, Pas-de-Calais.France's Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea said on Saturday that they had rescued some 200 people who were tempted to cross the English Channel Friday night.On Sept 3, at least 12 people died while attempting to cross the English Channel from France.The region around Calais in northern France is the starting point for the shortest sea crossing to the United Kingdom (UK).According to British government figures, between Sept 7 and 13 this year, a total of 412 irregular migrants attempted to cross the English Channel in small boats without permission to enter the UK.During a visit to France last month by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the two countries affirmed their desire to boost cooperation on illegal migration in the Channel, particularly in relation to human trafficking rings.MOSCOW - Russia's patience regarding a nuclear response to Western actions in Ukraine is wearing thin, warned Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's security council, in a message posted on his Telegram channel on Saturday.Medvedev said while "a nuclear conflict is in no one's interest," Russia has thus far exercised restraint in utilizing its nuclear capabilities in response to Western involvement, particularly concerning high-precision strikes deep into Russian territory. However, he cautioned that "even the greatest patience has its limits."This warning came following recent US discussions regarding the provision of Army Tactical Missile Systems to Ukraine, which could enable strikes deeper into Russian territory.The Kremlin has also signaled its awareness of the escalating threat, with the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov noting that Russia is preparing countermeasures.This week in Lyon, France, China has 68 competitors in the World Skills Competition, the world’s largest vocational skills competition, which this year has brought together 1,400 participants from 69 countries and regions.Reporter: Wang MingjieVideo: Brian ChangMOSCOW -- Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Thursday that by providing Ukraine with long-range weapons, Western countries risk involving directly in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.In such circumstances, Russia would be forced to make "appropriate decisions" based on the new threats, Putin was quoted by Russian media as saying.Ukraine has been pleading with its Western allies for it to use their missiles, including long-range ones, to fire deep into Russian territory, according to Western media reports."In fact, only service people from NATO countries can make flight assignments to these missile systems. Ukrainian service people cannot do that," Putin told Russian state TV."So this is not a question of allowing the Ukrainian regime to attack Russia with these weapons or not. It is a question of deciding whether NATO countries are directly involved in a military conflict or not.""If this decision is taken, it will mean nothing else than direct participation of NATO countries -- the USA and European countries -- in the war in Ukraine," he said.According to a report by Politico, the White House is finalizing a plan to ease restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S.-donated weapons in battles against Russia, including the use of British long-range missiles that contain American parts to strike targets inside Russia.MOSCOW -- The Federal Security Service of Russia (FSB) has revoked the accreditation of six employees of the British Embassy in Russia, citing their involvement in intelligence and subversive activities, local media reported on Friday.The FSB said that it had obtained documents confirming that London was coordinating efforts to escalate the international military and political situation, according to a report by RIA Novosti.The FSB named the Directorate for Eastern Europe and Central Asia of Britain's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office as the primary entity orchestrating subversive activities against Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).The directorate, established to focus on Russia and CIS affairs, has effectively functioned as a special intelligence service since the beginning of the special military operation in Ukraine, said the FSB."The facts revealed provide grounds to consider the activities of British diplomats sent to Moscow by the directorate as a threat to the security of the Russian Federation," it said, noting that the directorate's main objective has been to strategically undermine Russia.In cooperation with other relevant agencies, the Russian foreign ministry has terminated the accreditation of six employees from the political section of the British Embassy in Moscow, said the report.The FSB also warned that it would demand the immediate termination of the mission of any British diplomatic staff found to be involved in similar activities in the future.ST. PETERSBURG - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday voiced willingness to work together with China to advance multipolarity and build an international order based on justice and international law.Putin made the remarks during talks with Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, in St. Petersburg.Putin asked Wang to convey his sincere greetings and best wishes to Chinese President Xi Jinping, expecting China's attendance at the BRICS leaders' summit in Kazan next month.Russia and China, acting on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, have been deepening their comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era. Interactions at all levels maintain a strong momentum, and cooperation in various fields is progressing smoothly, he said.Russia is willing to take the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries this year as an opportunity to follow through on the important consensus reached by the heads of state, strengthen the alignment of development strategies, and lift the Russia-China relationship to a new level, said Putin.Putin thanks China for its support for Russia as the rotating chair of BRICS, stressing that the BRICS security council meeting has achieved positive results, and the successful dialogue with the Global South countries fully demonstrates the influence and strength of BRICS.The Russian president applauded China's diplomacy based on the long-term and the common future of humanity, and voiced willingness to strengthen coordination with China to unite more Global South countries and jointly push for a multipolar world so as to build an international order based on justice and international law.For his part, Wang conveyed Xi's warm greetings to Putin.China and Russia have solid mutual trust and a profound friendship, he said, adding that under the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries, the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era has achieved sound and steady growth.The two sides have strengthened strategic cooperation, rejected unilateral bullying, and resist bloc confrontation, which is in line with the trend of the times and the common aspirations of the vast number of the countries of the South, said Wang, adding that China is willing to maintain strategic communication with Russia, unite more like-minded countries, and promote world multipolarity.He said that with the joint efforts of all parties, the BRICS Plus cooperation has got off to a good start.At the upcoming Kazan Summit, the first meeting of leaders after the expansion of BRICS, China will continue to offer full support for Russia in fulfilling its responsibilities as the chair, and strive to make the summit a full success.China is ready to work with BRICS partners to push for an equal and orderly multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization so as to make contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind, he added.The two sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine issue.Putin appreciated the "six-point consensus" made by China and Brazil, reiterating Russia's openness to negotiations.Wang said that China is committed to promoting a political solution to the crisis and is willing to work with all parties to foster an objective, rational, and balanced voice in the international community.Before their meeting, Putin met with the heads of delegations attending the meeting of the BRICS high-ranking officials responsible for security matters and national security advisors.Norway will not impose sanctions on Chinese electric vehicles, and is eyeing further cooperation with China in areas of common interest such as shipping, seafood and green transition, said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store on Wednesday in Shanghai.Store made the remarks as he concluded a three-day official visit to China in connection with the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries."Norway has no car production. We are not a member of the European Union, so we don't have a common trade policy and will not impose sanctions unilaterally in this regard," he said.Norway is aiming to become the world's first country to end the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2025. The Norwegian market has seen a rapid increase in the number of Chinese EVs, which have made a notable contribution to the country's green efforts.According to the sales database of the Norwegian Road Federation, Chinese brands, including Volvo, increased their EV market share from 14 percent in 2023 to 23 percent in August this year.Green transition is an area in which both countries share a common interest. On Tuesday, Store first visited Beijing and signed a joint statement with Chinese Premier Li Qiang to establish a dialogue on green transition."My visit to Beijing confirmed with the Chinese leadership that Norway and China (as two nations), different in size and geographic locations, see strategic opportunities to work together in areas of common interest. We can do more in trade cooperation, especially in the maritime area," he said, noting he has seen China more "confident, relaxed and open" during this visit.China is a critical market for the Norwegian maritime industry, with about one-third of Norwegian companies present in China in the sector. China is also the world's largest shipbuilding country, where 55 ships are being built for Norway.Largest carrierEarlier on Wednesday, Store visited a shipyard in Nantong, Jiangsu province, where he attended the naming ceremony of one of the most environmentally friendly car carriers, which has been built jointly by Norway and China. Hoegh Borealis, which was delivered on the occasion, can carry 9,100 cars, and is the largest car carrier in the world.Tomra, a Norwegian recycling solutions provider, which has been present in China for 14 years, expressed optimism over the outlook of the country's circular economy as well as the prime minister's visit.Store's visit has been fruitful and sent positive signals, said Jet Chang, vice-president of public affairs at Tomra Asia."As Norway gains 15-day visa-free access to China, it would be much easier for senior business management to make a visit and communicate with the people here. The business section on both sides can expect positive and further bilateral cooperation," he said.Chang spoke highly of the two nations' joint statement on green transition, which highlighted the development of the circular economy."We have seen steady and continuous growth of our business in China with the nation's improving business environment and particularly its efforts in garbage classification in recent years. We are very pleased to see the joint statement, which would benefit us a lot," said Chang.Chang pointed out that developing a circular economy can better secure resources, reduce carbon emissions and environmental risks, as well as provide opportunities for investment and economic development.Wrapping up a four-day visit to China, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez emphasized on Wednesday that his country will be constructive and try to find a solution between China and the European Commission to avoid a potential trade war over electric vehicles and other issues."I have emphasized we do not want a trade war, as it would benefit no one," Sanchez said at a news conference in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, pledging Spain's efforts to "build bridges" and find compromises through negotiation amid existing tensions.Sanchez reiterated Spain's advocacy for open trade between Europe and China based on multilateral norms provided by the World Trade Organization for trade conflicts, with negotiated resolutions to conflicts that address the legitimate interests of both parties."I must say (Chinese EV) is truly advanced," Sanchez remarked, saying he had an opportunity to sit in and drive a Chinese EV during his visit. "I believe the major European brands have a lot to learn from the technology and advancements made by Chinese brands in EVs.""One of my main objectives during this visit was also to attract Chinese investment to Spain so that this Chinese investment can also establish itself in the form of a value chain in our country," he added.Sanchez said his second visit to China in less than two years demonstrated the two countries' shared commitment to maintaining regular high-level dialogue."I believe this visit has helped bring us closer to a key partner, opening doors for stronger cooperation in areas of mutual interest," Sanchez stated.During his stay, Spain and China inked eight agreements spanning trade, investment, culture, education, science and green development. Sanchez said this spirit of cooperation transcends the bilateral relationship between Spain and China and extends to the European Union.Economic tiesEconomic and commercial ties were the central focus. Sanchez met with Spanish companies operating in China and conveyed Spain's aim to consolidate trade and investment growth, especially in innovative and eco-friendly industries.He cited the example of the newly signed deal with Chinese green technology company Envision Group for building a zero-carbon hydrogen industrial park in Spain through an investment of nearly 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), creating about 1,000 jobs, both direct and indirect.However, the prime minister acknowledged that Spain and the EU's trade deficits with China were a concern. To that end, Sanchez said Spain and China have agreed to establish a permanent mechanism for cooperation and dialogue on trade and investment issues.He also prioritized bolstering cultural, educational and scientific ties during his visit, areas he considers vital given both countries have a rich heritage and excellent prospects.Sanchez said Spain considers China as a key partner in addressing major international issues such as climate change and development financing."China and the EU play a central role in addressing these challenges, and while differences may arise between us as naturally can happen between friendly partners, I believe that the common points are more important and far outweigh the divergences," Sanchez remarked. "Therefore, we must continue to cooperate."Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeated his defense of his government's migration policy and stressed the need for the country to continue to attract skilled overseas workers, as the topic becomes an increasingly dominant issue in the country's political discourse.A stabbing attack by a failed asylum seeker from Syria at the end of August that left three people dead raised public concern about immigration. And the far-right Alternative for Deutschland party, or AfD, is continuing to make political ground by campaigning heavily on the issue of migration control.Scholz's three-party coalition government comprising the Social Democrats, Greens, and Free Democrats recently held talks with political opponents to try and find common ground over the topic, but the opposition Christian Democrats, or CDU, said it would not take part in any more meetings."There is no country in the world with a shrinking working population that has economic growth. That is the truth we are confronted with," Scholz told members of the country's parliament, the Bundestag.But while continuing to stress the importance of welcoming outsiders, he also made it clear that there must be tighter controls than those employed by previous governments."We are a country that offers protection to those who are politically persecuted, who are running for their lives, who have to save their lives, and that is in our Constitution and we are not putting that up for debate," he said. "Openness to the world is, therefore, necessary. But openness to the world does not mean that anyone who wants to can come. We must be able to choose who comes to Germany. I say that quite explicitly here."Scholz accused opposition groups, including the CDU, of "sloganeering, not getting anything done", and he said the party was seeking to make publicity out of the issue without trying to resolve it.CDU leader Friedrich Merz said Scholz's proposals lacked substance, "and that is why we are not entering into an endless loop of talks with you".But Scholz replied: "We will never slam a door, you can always come back (to discussions)."At the same time as calling for tougher measures, however, Merz did concede that Germany needs to welcome outsiders for its economic and social health."Germany must remain an open and foreign-friendly country," he said, and, wary of the rise of the AfD, he added that the CDU stands "clearly and unequivocally against all forms of xenophobia".Recently, Germany has introduced more controls at its frontiers with fellow European Union member states Poland and Czechia, and also non-EU country Switzerland, in addition to controls that have long been in place at the frontier with Austria.Next week, more frequent checks will also be introduced for people arriving on land from neighboring Belgium, France, Denmark, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, and the country's Interior Ministry reported that the new measures have already seen more than 30,000 people refused entry.Europe's record-breaking heat wave has had a major impact on water bodies, with the continent's lakes and rivers experiencing severe depletion, particularly in Poland where water levels have reached critically low levels.The European Union's climate monitoring service, Copernicus, reported recently that the world has just experienced its hottest northern hemisphere summer on record, surpassing last year's temperatures as global warming intensifies.This unprecedented heat, particularly evident in the June-to-August period, significantly increases the probability that 2024 will surpass 2023 as the warmest year in recorded history, it said.The Vistula River, Poland's longest and most important waterway, has dropped to a fraction of its normal depth, with Warsaw recording just 20 centimeters on Wednesday, below the 2015 record low of 26 cm.This drastic reduction, far from the usual 105-250 cm range, was confirmed by Poland's Institute of Meteorology and Water Management, or IMGW, highlighting the severe impact of the heat wave on vital waterways.The extreme low water levels in the Vistula have forced tour operators to alter their routes. Andrzej Stanski, who runs a river cruise company, explained the challenges they face."We're sailing off the route, because here and there you can simply hit a stone," he told Reuters. "The engines cost quite a lot, and it's about the safety of both the passengers and ourselves."Warsaw University hydrologist Jaroslaw Suchozebrski warned that Poland is experiencing a hydrological drought with far-reaching consequences."We have less and less water at our disposal, which means that water recipients have to approach it a little more rationally ... mainly the energy industry," he told Reuters. "Our energy production is based on cooling processes using water. The second concern is the water quality, as lower river fl ow reduces the dilution of pollutants."Hydrological data paints a concerning picture, with nearly three-quarters of Poland's monitoring stations reporting diminished water levels, while the count of locations exhibiting signs of hydrological drought has surged to 295, said Euronews.The serious environmental consequences of the drought were highlighted in a report from Poland's Radio RMF, which revealed that numerous dead fish had been found in the Vistula River's southern sections.Suchozebrski noted that weather forecasts indicate heavy rainfall in the coming days, which could lead to a swift increase in river levels, potentially shifting the crisis from drought to fl ash fl oods.Other Central and Eastern European countries, including Hungary, are experiencing similar issues that threaten agricultural productivity, noted Reuters."During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record," said Copernicus Climate Change Service deputy director, Samantha Burgess.Without immediate and significant reductions of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions by nations worldwide, extreme weather "will only become more intense," added Burgess.The United Kingdom's publicly funded healthcare system, the National Health Service, or NHS, is "broken" but can be fixed, the country's prime minister insisted on Thursday.Keir Starmer said in a speech made in response to a damning report about the NHS that the service is, indeed, far below the level it should be operating at, but he said his government will turn things around.Starmer said the report released on Thursday by former Cabinet minister and surgeon Ara Darzi, which details "ballooning" wait times and gridlock in accident and emergency, or A&E, departments was accurate.But he said more investment is not the answer."We have to fix the plumbing before turning on the taps," he said. "No more money without reform."Speaking at a gathering organized by the King's Fund, a healthcare think tank that has called for "change" and "bold action", Starmer said the NHS failings are a matter of "life or death".Blaming mismanagement by the Conservative Party administration that ran the country before his government took over on July 4, Starmer said: "People have the right to be angry".Calling Darzi's report a "raw and honest assessment" of the state of the NHS, he said the inefficiency and shortcomings of the service, which keeps almost a tenth of A&E patients waiting at least 12 hours, is "devastating, heart-breaking, infuriating" and a cause of avoidable deaths.Starmer conceded more than 100,000 sick infants waited at A&E departments for six hours or more last year, and said many people with mental health issues do not get help for at least a year. But he said the NHS "may be broken, but it's not beaten".Earlier, Health Secretary Wes Streeting had also responded to the report, saying the government will oversee three "big shifts" in how the NHS operates.Streeting said it will, in future, prioritize care in the community over hospital stays; migrate the way it works, from analogue to digital systems; and focus on preventing illness, instead of treating it.Starmer picked up on those ideas in his speech, saying the NHS, which was stretched to its limits before the novel coronavirus pandemic began, must "reform or die". But he insisted that, no matter how it changes, treatment will be free at the point of delivery."When you fall ill, you should never have to worry about the bill," he said.Starmer explained that the NHS overhaul will involve a move away from massive hospitals in population centers toward smaller neighborhood hubs, and more digital consultations.The government will detail its plans in the coming months, but Starmer said they will take 10 years to complete. And he did not mention how much they will cost. FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday announced it would cut key interest rates again, marking its second rate reduction this year following a move in June, with no indication of the future rate path.In a press release, the ECB announced that it has decided to reduce the deposit facility rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent due to declining inflation. This decision follows the bank's June rate cut, which marked its first reduction in five years.The market expects this move would further ease financing conditions for households and businesses in the eurozone."Based on the Governing Council's updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to take another step in moderating the degree of monetary policy restriction," the bank said.According to the spread established by the ECB between the three key interest rates, the rates for the main refinancing operations and the marginal lending facility will be reduced to 3.65 percent and 3.90 percent, respectively, following the cut to the deposit facility rate.The latest staff projections released by the central bank maintain the inflation forecasts unchanged from its June estimates. The ECB staff anticipate that inflation will average 2.5 percent in 2024, 2.2 percent in 2025, and 1.9 percent in 2026.The core inflation projections have been revised upward for both 2024 and 2025.Projections for economic growth in the euro area have been revised downward compared to June. The ECB staff forecast that the economy will grow by 0.8 percent in 2024, 1.3 percent in 2025, and 1.5 percent in 2026.The ECB reiterated its commitment to reducing inflation in the euro area in a timely manner, stating, "It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim."It marks the second time the ECB has cut key interest rates since June, when the rates were lowered by 25 basis points.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez reiterated Spain's advocacy for open trade based on multilateral World Trade Organization norms, with negotiated resolutions to conflicts that address the legitimate interests of both parties during his visit to China, which concluded on Wednesday."I have emphasized we do not want a trade war, as it would benefit no one," he said, pledging Spain's efforts to "build bridges" and find compromises through negotiation amid existing tensions between China and the EU.Sánchez said Spain considers China as a key partner in addressing major international issues such as climate change and development financing."China and the EU play a central role in addressing these challenges, and while differences may arise between us, as naturally can happen between friendly partners, I believe that the common points are more important and far outweigh the divergences," Sánchez said. "Therefore, we must continue to cooperate."German automaker BMW Group expects to spend up to $1 billion on fixing a problem with the braking systems of around 1.5 million vehicles it sold during the past two years.The company said the vehicles have been distributed globally, with around 370,000 in China, 270,000 in the United States, 150,000 in Germany, 70,000 in South Korea, and 60,000 in France.It detailed the size of the problem on Tuesday, triggered a sizable fall in its share price.The company had made people aware of the issue in April, but investors seemed to have been surprised by its scale.BMW said the potential defect has also been identified in around 320,000 vehicles that have not yet been shipped to customers, which will slow up their delivery by around a month.The company said it has set aside a "high three-digit million amount" to pay for the work, which will be done under warranty.The Munich-based automaker also said it has been experiencing weak demand for its products in China.The recalls and the disappointing sales figures led it to cut its full-year earnings forecast, with earnings likely to drop significantly below last year's $18.9 billion.BMW said its full-year operating margin will now likely be in the 6 percent to 7 percent range, instead of the previously expected 8 percent to 10 percent range."The one-off technical action and China market development is definitely challenging," the Financial Times newspaper quoted BMW as saying.The company said cars produced between June 2022 and August 2024 are affected by the glitch, with models being recalled including the BMW X1, the Mini Cooper, and the Rolls-Royce Spectre.BMW said the defect is likely to affect between 3 percent and 5 percent of vehicles produced during the time window.The company said the fault is related to the vehicles' braking support system, although it said impacted autos will still be within the legal requirements for braking, in spite of the fault.BMW Group said the faulty components were supplied by a third-party vendor, a German parts supplier called Continental AG.A spokesperson for BMW said the company "has developed a diagnostic software to detect the brake fault before it occurs", with the software able to warn drivers and tell them to visit a dealership as soon as possible.The business news agency Bloomberg said BMW's difficulties following hot on the heels of VW Group announcing layoffs and possible factory closures points to a crisis among German automakers.It said "the one-two punch "dealt a blow to Germany's economy, which has been struggling with expensive energy prices, high inflation and interest rates, and industrial action.BMW's shares closed 8.7 percent lower in Frankfurt on Tuesday, with the company's market valuation down by around $5.53 billion.The family of the Eiffel Tower's architect has pushed back against the Paris mayor's proposal to permanently install the Olympic rings on the iconic structure.Gustave Eiffel's descendants have stated they "oppose any alteration that negatively impacts respect for the work" of their ancestor and added that they have already sought legal counsel to potentially block the plans proposed by Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo.Hidalgo wants to retain the giant Olympic rings on the Eiffel Tower, which Parisians affectionately call the "Iron Lady", until at least the 2028 Games in Los Angeles."As mayor of Paris, the decision is mine," Hidalgo said in an interview with the Ouest-France regional newspaper on the weekend." I want the spirit of celebration to remain. I'm delighted that the French have fallen in love with Paris again, after 10 years of bashing and telling us that (the Olympic Games) was going to be hell."The massive ring structure, weighing 30 metric tons and measuring 29 meters by 13 meters, is too heavy to remain permanently on the Eiffel Tower, and Hidalgo's plan is to replace it with a more lightweight steel copy "as soon as possible", reported Agence France-Presse.The descendants of Eiffel contend that the Olympic emblem is "colorful, large in size, placed on the main avenue of approach to the tower" and claimed it "creates a strong imbalance" in the structure's silhouette.They argue that this addition significantly alters "the very pure forms of the monument".Retaining the rings on the tower would go against "the neutrality and meaning acquired over the years by the Eiffel Tower, which has become the symbol of the city of Paris and even all of France across the world", the Association of Descendants of Gustave Eiffel, or AGDE, said in a statement on Sunday.Hidalgo's comment that it was her decision alone was "incomprehensible", said Olivier Berthelot-Eiffel, Gustave's great-great grandson, who is president of the AGDE."Let the rings remain for a little longer than the Paralympic Games, why not? We have no problem with that," he said on Monday. "But the Eiffel Tower is not intended as an advertising platform. Anne Hidalgo should surely have said that she wanted to keep the Olympic rings and asked for the opinion of the Paris city council and other competent people, not that she had decided to do so."Another of Eiffel's descendants, Savin Yeatman-Eiffel, suggested that keeping the rings in place would limit the tower's ability to support various causes and events, as it has done previously.He told BFMTV: "The Eiffel Tower, which is a symbol of Paris and France, has a much broader vocation than being associated with an organization or concept like the Olympic Games."KYIV - Visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Wednesday announced new aid packages for Ukraine, local media reported.Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv, Blinken said that the United States would provide more than 700 million US dollars for Ukraine in fresh assistance, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported.Of the sum, 325 million dollars will be directed for the restoration of energy and electric networks, 290 million dollars for humanitarian aid and 102 million dollars for humanitarian demining.Blinken also informed that he had discussed with Ukrainian officials the use of long-range weapons.For his part, Lammy announced that Britain will provide more than 600 million pounds (about 783 million US dollars) worth of support for Ukraine, the Ukrinform news agency reported.The funding will be used to finance Ukraine's urgent humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs, and provide credit guarantees for Kyiv.Blinken and Lammy arrived in Kyiv earlier in the day for a joint visit. The diplomats met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and senior government officials. They also took part in the fourth Crimea Platform Summit.BRUSSELS - Germany's recent decision to reinstate passport checks at all land borders to combat irregular migration, terrorism threats, and cross-border organized crime has sparked reactions from neighboring countries and the broader European Union (EU).The move, following a series of violent crimes, including a deadly stabbing in Solingen last month, has raised concerns about its impact on the Schengen Area's principle of free movement.The reinstatement of border checks, which applies to all of Germany's nine neighboring countries, has drawn particular concern from its Schengen partners, many of whom fear disruptions to trade, travel, and European unity.Transport and Logistics Netherlands (TLN), a Dutch transport industry organization, has expressed alarm over the potential impact on trade, citing past experiences of long border delays during similar measures, such as during the pandemic and major events like the European Football Championship."Germany is undermining the Schengen Agreement and the free movement of goods," TLN said, warning that delays could lead to severe consequences for supply chains.Dutch Asylum and Migration Minister Marjolein Faber said while she understood Germany's decision but emphasized the need for clear enforcement measures to ensure smooth trade and traffic flow.Poland has reacted strongly, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk calling Germany's move "a de facto suspension of the Schengen Area" and labeling it "unacceptable" for Poland."I have no doubt that the tightening of these measures is driven by internal political factors in Germany, not our policies regarding illegal migration at our borders," he said."In the coming hours, we will reach out to other countries impacted by these decisions from Berlin for urgent consultations on actions to be taken within the European Union, particularly with all of Germany's neighboring states," Tusk added.In addition to Germany, which recently took this measure, other EU member states have also strengthened border controls in recent years, basically on the grounds of cracking down on illegal immigration, causing friction with neighboring countries.Austria, for example, has maintained border controls with Slovakia and extended checks along its border with Slovenia, citing efforts to combat illegal migration. Slovakia, which shares a significant cross-border commuting population with Austria, has voiced concerns about the disruptions these measures cause.Slovenia, too, has protested repeatedly to EU authorities regarding Austria's ongoing border controls, which have been extended multiple times since 2015.Italy has also reintroduced controls at its border with Slovenia, while Latvia recently extended a reinforced border protection regime with Belarus until the end of the year, citing a surge in attempts to illegally cross the border.Meanwhile, the European Commission is engaging in discussions with Germany over its border control decision.A spokesperson for the commission, Anitta Hipper, confirmed that Germany had informed the commission of the decision and noted that under Schengen rules, "member states have the authority to reintroduce internal border controls if necessary and proportionate to address significant threats to public policy or internal security.""The EU Commission is coordinating with Schengen authorities, who are in close contact with German authorities as well as other member states currently enforcing internal border controls," Hipper added.The 47th WorldSkills Competition officially kicked off in Lyon, France, on Tuesday, bringing together 1,400 competitors from 69 countries and regions. French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the event, which is expected to draw 250,000 participants, including those attending the competition, ceremonies, and city-wide activities for WorldSkills Lyon 2024.One of the most eagerly anticipated moments, the Parade of Nations, set a vibrant and inspiring tone for the evening. Teams from every country and region marched with pride, greeted by rapturous applause from the audience. As the final team took its place, the diversity and strength of the WorldSkills community were fully on display.China, a regular participant in the biennial competition, is making its seventh appearance this year, fielding 68 competitors with an average age of 22. China has the highest number of competition categories among all participating countries.The Chinese team will compete in all 59 skill areas, spanning six major categories: information and communication technology, transportation and logistics, manufacturing and engineering technology, construction and building technology, creative arts and fashion, and social and personal services.Max Roche, president of WorldSkills Lyon 2024, highlighted the four core values of WorldSkills —excellence, generosity, openness, and unity. He said: "We believe that everything is possible with skills. This competition is all about sharing — sharing skills, knowledge, happiness, and success. We want to welcome everyone, no matter where they come from."WorldSkills President Chris Humphries and WorldSkills Champions Trust representative for Asia Shweta Ratanpura delivered a joint opening speech. Ratanpura competed at WorldSkills Kazan 2019 in Graphic Design Technology and became the first Indian woman to win a WorldSkills medal.She encouraged competitors to seize the moment. "I ask you to make a commitment right now to pay it forward," she said. "Take all the advantages you've been given and make the WorldSkills movement even stronger. Make your mark and pursue excellence in everything you do."Humphries echoed her sentiments, saying, "Whatever country we come from and however different our journeys have been, each of you shares the ambition to imagine a better way forward and the determination to lead us toward a more secure, equitable, and sustainable planet."The spotlight then turned to President Macron, who officially declared the 47th WorldSkills Competition open.Running through Sept 15, this event, often referred to as the "Olympics of Skills", is the world's largest vocational education and skills competition, showcasing excellence across a wide range of trades.WARSAW - Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday that he plans to seek urgent consultations with neighboring countries affected by Germany's decision to tighten border controls.The head of the Polish government called Germany's actions "a de facto suspension of the Schengen area" and added that this was unacceptable for Poland.German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said on Monday that the controls, set to start on Sept 16, will be initially imposed for six months, aiming to curb illegal immigration and protect German citizens from terrorism and crime."I have no doubt that the tightening of these measures is driven by internal political factors in Germany, not our policies regarding illegal migration at our borders," Tusk said."In the coming hours, we will reach out to other countries impacted by these decisions from Berlin for urgent consultations on actions to be taken within the European Union (EU), particularly with all of Germany's neighboring states," he added.The new measures will affect Germany's borders with France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Poland.Germany's government has announced a new six-month tightening of border checks will come in from the start of next week, in the aftermath of an attack in the town of Solingen in August that left three people dead, for which the Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility.The suspect detained is a Syrian national who had failed in his asylum application and was awaiting deportation from Germany.Shortly after the incident, the far-right Alternative for Deutschland party, or AfD, enjoyed its biggest success yet in local elections.Germany shares more than 3,700 kilometers of land borders with Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland, all of which are members of the Schengen Zone, within which free movement is usually permitted, with no restrictions.An increase in first-time asylum requests last year meant that Germany had already imposed some level of checks at the frontiers with Austria, Czech Republic, Poland and Switzerland, but these are now being extended nationwide.Interior Minister Nancy Faeser insisted the government was "taking a hard line" against irregular migration to reduce cross-border crime. "We are doing everything in our power to protect the people of our country against these threats," she added.Public concernIn recent years, Germany has welcomed huge numbers of people fleeing conflict, but the AfD campaigned heavily on the issue in the recent election and had success, so politicians are aware it is becoming an increasingly significant public concern.Members of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government have already held talks with center-right opposition groups about a new approach to the issue of migration in the aftermath of the Solingen attacks, and Friedrich Merz, leader of the mainstream conservative Christian Democratic Union party, said migration in general needed to be tightened up."If the coalition wants to talk to us about the solution, then item one on the agenda must be limiting migration," he said.Marcus Engler, a researcher from the German Center for Integration and Migration Research, told the Reuters news agency that "the intention of the government seems to be to show symbolically to Germans and potential migrants that the latter are no longer wanted here". United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in London for a two-day visit that includes talks with United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy.The US State Department stated that the visit aims to launch a "US-UK strategic dialogue", reinforcing the "special relationship" between the two nations.Blinken was set to "discuss a range of critical issues, including the Indo-Pacific, AUKUS partnership, the Middle East, and our collective efforts to support Ukraine", the department said in a statement ahead of the visit.Blinken and Lammy previously met during Starmer's visit to Washington for a NATO summit in July, where they "reaffirmed the importance of ensuring Ukraine has the economic, security, and humanitarian assistance it needs to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity".They also "discussed the need to reach a ceasefire in Gaza that secures the release of hostages and lays the groundwork for durable peace".Blinken has made frequent visits to Israel since the Hamas attacks on Oct 7, and recently claimed to have secured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's acceptance of Washington's "bridging proposal", which is aimed at bringing Israel and Hamas closer to a deal.The US diplomat's London visit comes amid growing pressure on Netanyahu to finalize a deal, following widespread protests in Israel.His visit follows the UK's recent suspension of certain arms export licenses to Israel for equipment that could be used in the conflict in Gaza.US President Joe Biden's administration faces pressure to limit arms deliveries to Israel, its key Middle East ally, amid criticism of the ongoing conflict.During the visit, Blinken and Lammy are expected to initiate discussions on the so-called UK-US Strategic Dialogue, which aims to enhance bilateral relations in various areas, the UK government said.The UK stated that the dialogue would address "key elements of the UK-US relationship, including defense and security, Europe, Ukraine, the Middle East, the Indo-Pacific, and other global priorities"."In a more volatile and insecure world, it is even more important that we are highly aligned nations," Lammy said in a statement before the meeting.The White House announced that a second bilateral meeting between Starmer and Biden is scheduled for Friday in Washington.Starmer previously described his July talks with Biden as a chance to "recommit" to NATO and the UK-US "special relationship".White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated that the upcoming meeting will involve "an in-depth discussion on a range of global issues of mutual interest".Chronic overcrowding in prisons in England and Wales forced the United Kingdom government to release 1,700 inmates on Tuesday, in a move that has been criticized by victims' advocates and opposition lawmakers.The mass release, which was made in addition to the usual weekly release of around 1,000 inmates, came as the UK's prison population passed 88,000, and as institutions hit breaking point.The prison population, which is the largest it has ever been, grew by more than 1,100 during August, as people were sentenced following anti-immigrant riots that swept the country.The ruling Labour Party, which swept to power in the general election on July 4, said the previous Conservative Party administration was to blame for the lack of prison space following years of underinvestment.Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the system was at "crisis point".Jonathan Reynolds, the UK's minister for business, explained on the BBC's Breakfast program that victims were being told about prisoners' early release "where it's relevant"."Most British people would say it should never get to this point and I understand those concerns," he said.Reynolds said the authorities had put "many safeguards" in place to protect the public. He said domestic abusers, sex offenders, terrorists, and other violent offenders were not eligible for early release under the policy that calls for non-violent prisoners sentenced to less than five years to be freed after serving 40 percent of their term, instead of the previous 50 percent.The government says the change will free up 5,500 spaces.But Helen Newlove, the victim's commissioner for England and Wales, told the BBC she was "concerned about the impact of these early releases on victims' confidence in our justice system"."Victim safety must remain the absolute priority," she said.The Conservative Party said the government had mismanaged the situation and created "serious public concern" as a result.Mel Stride, the party's spokesperson on work and pensions, said he was concerned some prisoners would be freed without a home to go to."We're not getting satisfactory answers as to whether appropriate accommodation is actually being provided for those prisoners that are being released," he said. "And in the event it is not, we know the chances of reoffending increase very significantly."Chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor agreed, telling the Associated Press: "It's inevitable that some of these prisoners will get recalled to custody and it's inevitable that some of them will go out homeless."He said in his annual report on the state of UK prisons that the number of people in custody will grow by 27,000 by 2028, but that construction is unlikely to keep up.The Prison Reform Trust said the UK's overcrowded prisons now mean inmates are simply being "warehoused" and do not have adequate access to education, training, and work. BRUSSELS -- Google lost its final court appeal on Tuesday against a European Union (EU) fine of 2.4 billion euros ($2.65 billion), for abuse of its dominant position by favoring its own comparison shopping service.In 2017, the Commission determined that in 13 countries within the European Economic Area, Google prioritized its own comparison shopping service by displaying it at the top of its general search results. Meanwhile, competing comparison shopping services appeared only as standard generic search results.The Commission therefore concluded that Google had abused its dominant position in the markets for online general searches and for specialized product searches, and imposed the fine.Following a lower court's ruling to uphold the Commission's decision and maintain that fine, Google and its parent firm Alphabet appealed to the Court of Justice."By today's judgment, the Court of Justice dismisses the appeal and thus upholds the judgment of the General Court," the court said in a press release.The Court of Justice said that EU law does not sanction the existence of a dominant position, but only its abusive exploitation."In essence, the Google Shopping case was a catalyst for change, inspiring a more vigilant and proactive approach to regulating big tech and ensuring a fairer digital marketplace," said Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the European Commission for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age, following Tuesday's court ruling.  BRUSSELS -- The European Union (EU)'s Court of Justice on Tuesday delivered its final judgment on Apple's appeal, confirming that the company must repay illegal tax benefits to Ireland.In 2016, the European Commission ruled that companies within the Apple Group had received unlawful tax advantages worth 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in the form of State aid provided by Ireland from 1991 to 2014.The General Court annulled the Commission's decision in 2020, saying the Commission had not sufficiently proven that the companies involved had received a selective advantage.Tuesday's ruling by the Court of Justice overturned the earlier decision. "The Court of Justice gives final judgment in the matter and confirms the European Commission's 2016 decision: Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid which Ireland is required to recover," the court said in a press release.Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the European Commission for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age, hailed Tuesday's court ruling as "a big win for European citizens and for tax justice.""This means that the recovered taxes, which have been in an escrow account for quite some years in Ireland during the ongoing court proceedings, now must be released to the Irish State," she said.She also noted that the investigations have contributed to a shift in mindset among member states, encouraging them to initiate or accelerate regulatory and legislative reforms. MOSCOW -- Russian forces have intercepted and destroyed 144 Ukrainian drones across nine of the country's regions on Tuesday, the Russian defense ministry said.Seventy-two drones were destroyed over the Bryansk region, 20 over the Moscow region, and 14 over Russia's Kursk region, said the defense ministry.Overnight, apartment buildings in the Ramenskoye district of the Moscow region had been damaged as a result of a drone attack, according to Moscow region governor Andrey Vorobyev.According to preliminary information, one woman has died, three people have been hospitalized, and 43 people have been placed in temporary housing centers following the attack.The defense ministry added that 13 drones were destroyed over the Tula region, eight over the Belgorod region, seven over the Kaluga region, five over the Voronezh region, four over the Lipetsk region, and one over the Oryol region.  (AP VIDEO, Source: PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES / WILL WARR)LONDON -- The United Kingdom's (UK) Princess of Wales said on Monday that she has completed her chemotherapy treatment for cancer."As the summer comes to an end, I cannot tell you what a relief it is to have finally completed my chemotherapy treatment," 42-year-old Princess Kate said in a video where she was seen spending time with her family in Norfolk, east of England."Doing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus. Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes," she said.The princess said she's looking forward to being back at work and undertaking a few more public engagements in the coming months.Kate revealed her cancer diagnosis in March and her chemotherapy began in late February.An expert in the United Kingdom specializing in China-Africa relations has praised the series of partnership actions announced at the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing, saying the event showcased the depth and breadth of bilateral ties."FOCAC remains the most prominent platform for China-Africa cooperation, especially in terms of its scale and longevity," said Linda Calabrese, a senior research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute, a global affairs think tank headquartered in London."The forum is well attended by many African leaders, and it has been running for many years, providing a crucial platform for high-level government dialogues but also for other discussions for strengthening economic, political and cultural ties. This showcases the depth and breadth of China-Africa relations."During the opening ceremony of the summit on Thursday, Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled 10 partnership actions for modernization to deepen cooperation in the next three years, pledging support for Africa in trade, agriculture, infrastructure connectivity, green development and other sectors."The first thing to note about the speech is the financial pledges that were made to support Africa," Calabrese said, referring to the 360 billion yuan ($50.6 billion) of financial support promised for implementing the actions. "It reaffirms China's ongoing support for Africa's development aspirations, even amid global economic challenges."The new financing represents a substantial investment, demonstrating China's confidence in Africa's future and the importance it attaches to its partnership with Africa, she said.Calabrese also praised the efforts to promote trade, highlighting China's unilateral opening of its market to the continent. Notable measures outlined in the speech include giving all least-developed countries that have diplomatic relations with China, including 33 countries in Africa, zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines."China is committed to improving Africa's market access," she said. "This (the zero-tariff action plan) coupled with trade facilitation initiatives such as the 'green lanes', presents a significant opportunity for diversifying and growing African exports to the Chinese market, particularly in the agriculture sector."Additionally, Calabrese found it particularly "encouraging" to see China backing the development of the African Continental Free Trade Area, a project that aims to create a single market for goods and services across the continent and other related infrastructure needs."This is a much-needed support. China's continued investment in the infrastructure area will play a vital role in driving economic growth."Regarding the China-Africa industrial chain cooperation proposed in the speech, she expressed hope that greater emphasis could be placed on automotive, pharmaceuticals, agro-processing and transport and logistics.zhengwanyin@mail.chinadailyuk.com The newly appointed chief of Ferrovie dello Stato, Italy's national railway company, has announced that the organization will explore options for attracting external investment, including the possibility of listing the company on the stock exchange, a move that would align with the Italian government's broader privatization efforts.Last September, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government unveiled a plan to manage Italy's public debt, including a privatization initiative to generate approximately 20 billion euros ($21.6 billion) between 2024 and 2026.The country's public debt is the second-highest in the eurozone relative to its gross domestic product and is projected to reach about 140 percent of GDP by 2026.In an interview with Reuters on the weekend, the railway company's CEO Stefano Donnarumma indicated listing on the Borsa Italiana stock exchange was one option under consideration as the business seeks to attract new capital and fund future investments."I am ready to consider opening up the company's capital to investors ... a bourse listing is usually a consequence of such a process. I wouldn't speak of flotation per se, but of opening up the capital," he said from the sidelines of the TEHA business forum.Reflecting on his tenure as CEO of power grid operator Terna Group, Donnarumma highlighted the advantages of private investment in a regulated infrastructure.He noted that his experience had shown him the value of having private shareholders, particularly in their ability to contribute to funding for new investments."It's not an obligation, the decision is the state's to take. And it's not like I've been brought in to oversee a privatization," he said. "It was studied before my arrival, and I plan to go over that study in the coming weeks, as we work on our strategy and see how it fits with them. The management's job is to come up with strategies and propose them. The shareholder will decide."Donnarumma said he expects to have more clarity about the group's direction toward the end of the year, but he added that the process of incorporating private investors would likely take two years.In November, the Italian Treasury generated 920 million euros by divesting a 25-percent share in Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank.Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti has previously indicated that portions of state-owned railway and motorway networks might also be put up for sale, said Reuters.In December, Meloni said the Italian government's privatization plans would not result in state assets being sold off cheaply."We have launched a privatization plan, but let's be clear: with this government, these will never become sell-offs," Meloni said. The chief executive officer of Volkswagen Group, or VW, has defended the German multinational automaker's decision to lay off workers and potentially close factories.Oliver Blume said the company that sells vehicles under the Audi, Bentley, Cupra, Jetta, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, Skoda, and Volkswagen brands has no alternative to considering painful options."Fewer cars are being sold in Europe and new competitors from Asia are pushing aggressively into the market," he told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday. "The cake has got smaller and we have more guests at the table."After seeing the value of VW's shares fall by around a third during the past five years, the 90-year-old automotive giant has said it needs to save 4 billion euros ($4.25 billion) through compulsory job cuts. And Blume has said the economic situation the company is facing is now "so serious that we can't simply continue as we were", and that factory closures in Germany are also on the table.Unions and left-wing politicians have responded by pointing out that the company paid out billions of euros in shareholder dividends last year, which they say suggests VW is in better financial shape than Blume has claimed.They also say VW is so important to Germany, Europe's largest economy, that downsizing must be avoided at all costs.Janine Wissler, chairwoman of the Left Party, told the Rheinische Post newspaper: "It is incredibly sleazy that Volkswagen could pay out 4.5 billion euros and now claims that it can't raise 5 billion euros to prevent plant closures and job losses."But the Federation of German Industries, or BDI, which represents more than 100,000 German companies that employ 8 million people, said the challenges VW is facing are being experienced throughout the country's manufacturing sector.BDI President Siegfried Russwurm told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper German companies are encountering difficulties because of soaring energy prices, high taxes, layers of bureaucracy, and "unreliable public infrastructure"."The problems in Germany are obvious," he said while urging the government to intervene.Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been keeping a close eye on the situation and says he has spoken with union representatives.He told the Tagesspiegel newspaper his government wants an outcome in which the company manages to "secure jobs and plants".The company, which was the world's largest automaker by sales volume in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 and the world's largest automaker by revenue in 2022, was seventh in the 2020 Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.VW has three joint ventures in China — FAW-Volkswagen, SAIC Volkswagen, and Volkswagen Anhui — and also has production facilities in at least 26 other countries, employing a global workforce of around 676,000 people.There are many opportunities for both China and Spain, and the two countries "should be brave enough to seize them," said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.Sanchez, on an official visit to China from Sunday to Wednesday, made these remarks at the opening ceremony of the 9th China-Spain Forum held in Beijing on Monday morning.In his speech, the Spanish leader invited various parties to strengthen cooperation and promote mutual understanding between the two countries through this high-end forum.He added that Spain and China have close exchanges and last year the two countries jointly celebrated the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic relations.Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership, and Spain will further strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various aspects, he said."Although we still have differences on some issues between the two sides, there is a shared willingness to engage in further dialogue and consultation. We are committed to working together to find agreed solutions based on mutual benefits and win-win situations," he said.Speaking about the exchange of visits between the two countries, he thanked China for granting Spanish citizens visa exemptions."Our aim and vision is also to have more Chinese citizens visit our country," he said.He noted that tourism between the two countries has fully recovered in the first half of this year and will exceed projected levels by the end of the year.Chinese tech companies are making a strong impression at this year's IFA Berlin, Europe's largest consumer electronics trade show, with prominent exhibition spaces and ads from leading home appliance brands greeting attendees at the trade fair entrance.This year marks IFA Berlin's centennial celebration, featuring over 420 Chinese firms and underscoring China's vital role in the global consumer technology market. Among the 1,800 exhibitors, major Chinese brands such as Haier, Hisense, Midea, and TCL command some of the largest exhibit spaces, showcasing a wide range of smart home appliances. The event, expected to draw over 182,000 visitors from 139 countries, runs until Sept 10, with artificial intelligence being one of its key themes.Leif Lindner, CEO of IFA Berlin, emphasized the lasting appeal of the trade show, pointing to the strong demand from exhibitors. "IFA has always been, and will continue to be, at the forefront of change and disruption, showcasing real-world innovations, with consumers engaging with new technologies in real time," Lindner said.Haier, along with its subsidiary brands Candy, Hoover, and Casarte, continued to showcase their cutting-edge technology at the expo. "Haier not only demonstrated the technological leadership of Chinese companies through innovative solutions and scenarios but also illustrated the global rise of Chinese brands by achieving the fastest growth in the European market for eight consecutive years," said Neil Tunstall, CEO of Haier Europe.Midea, a leading Chinese air conditioner manufacturer, has made a significant investment at IFA Berlin this year, evident in its massive ad space at the trade show entrance. Zhu Zhou, the Europe sales director of Chinese electrical appliance manufacturer Midea, said: "We've recognized that single products alone can no longer meet the diverse and sophisticated demands of today's consumers. Therefore, we are focusing on a unified, scenario-based approach enhanced by AI technology to better address these varied needs."Hisense, a leading Chinese appliance and electronics manufacturer, unveiled its AI-driven applications, green intelligence solutions, and innovations in emerging industries, providing visitors with an immersive experience at their booth. Notably, the Hisense U7 TV was showcased alongside the game Black Myth: Wukong, demonstrating its user-centric technology and smooth performance, which significantly enhances the gaming experience.Honor introduced several new devices in the global markets, including the MagicBook Art 14 and the MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon PC.In addition to major Chinese industry names, the trade show has also attracted smaller Chinese companies. Liu Yuegui, sales director of Shenzhen-based Aukey Technology, a producer of consumer electronics, said: "We've been attending the fair for the past three years. After seeing the benefits of increased customer engagement last year, it made perfect sense for us to return to the expo this year."Jeffrey Towson, founder of TechMoat Consulting and an expert on Chinese tech companies, observed, "China's domestic market is highly competitive, so companies are already well-prepared before they go international. However, participating in exhibitions helps Chinese leaders better understand foreign markets and their customers."Lorenzo Coruzzi, director at Brand Finance, a London-based brand valuation consultancy, said: "Global trade show presence for Chinese companies is critical, not optional. IFA Berlin offers unparalleled exposure to European markets, media, and competitors. It's a vital platform for relationship-building, trend-spotting, and asserting market position."Louis Brennan, a professor of business studies at Trinity Business School in Ireland, said Chinese companies can significantly influence future trends in consumer electronics and home appliances."Chinese companies will reinforce existing trends such as intense price competition and the digitization of consumer electronics and home appliances. They have an opportunity to meet the consumer demand for ease and simplicity of use while providing excellent customer service," Brennan added.Six Serbian police officers have arrived in China to carry out a one-month joint patrol mission, marking the first time that China and Serbia have conducted joint patrols in China, the Ministry of Public Security announced on Saturday.This joint patrol will help Serbia gain a deeper understanding of Chinese public security work, further enhancing law enforcement cooperation between the two countries, and creating a safer environment to help forge people-to-people exchanges between the two nations, the MPS said.During the joint patrol, Serbian officers will wear Serbian police uniforms and patrol in mixed teams with Chinese police officers at tourist attractions in the provinces of Hainan, Zhejiang and other locations. Serbian officers will not carry any weapons or equipment but will provide policing advice to assist Chinese officers in addressing the safety concerns of Serbian citizens in China, thereby creating a safe tourism environment together, according to the MPS.In 2019 and 2023, in response to invitations from Serbia, the MPS dispatched teams to Serbia to carry out China-Serbia joint patrol missions twice.France's new Prime Minister Michel Barnier, 73, the former EU Brexit negotiator, now faces the challenge of uniting a deeply divided National Assembly, which is split into three main blocs, to create a functional government.Barnier is also a former foreign minister from the center-right Les Republicains party, or LR.President Emmanuel Macron is relying on the experience of the former European Commissioner and his negotiation skills to maintain stability in the government.Barnier's political career has spanned several decades, beginning in the mid-1990s under the late president Jacques Chirac. His appointment comes nearly three months after snap legislative elections left France in political deadlock, with no party winning an outright majority. The New Popular Front, or NFP, a left-wing alliance, won the most seats, with Macron's coalition finishing second, ahead of the far-right National Rally, or RN.Following Thursday's decision, the left-wing NFP alliance expressed its anger and vowed to back no-confidence motions against Barnier in the National Assembly."He starts with many strengths. It's up to him to show that he knows how to adapt to the national terrain. He is not a novice," said Pascale Joannin, general manager of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a think tank specializing in European issues, on Friday on the French TV channel France Info.However, as the oldest prime minister in the history of the Fifth Republic, Barnier's challenge will be to remain in office as long as possible and avoid being overthrown. He is expected to win 235 seats with support from Macron's coalition (166 seats), the LR (47 seats) and the centrist LIOT group (22 seats). This total still falls short of the absolute majority of 289 seats required.He faces a difficult path as several MPs from Macron's camp have already set conditions for their support. Agnes Pannier-Runacher, a former minister and MP from Macron's party, warned their MPs would not give the new government "a blank check or censure it in principle", but would be "vigilant about the line that will be taken". She made these comments in an interview with French daily Le Monde published on Friday.Meanwhile, the RN and its allies hold 142 seats and the left-wing NFP alliance has 193 seats. With the left-wing MPs already announcing a censure motion, the abstention of the far right will be essential for Barnier's government to survive.Barnier's appointment has been welcomed by several European leaders due to his previous role as a European Commissioner. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have all expressed their support.Far right reactionMarine Le Pen, a prominent figure in the discussions over the new prime minister, was closely involved in this week's negotiations. "This news was not warmly welcomed by RN supporters," said Christelle Craplet, director of BVA Opinion, on the French Public TV channel Public Senat on Thursday.RN lawmaker Sebastien Chenu told the French private news channel BFM TV on Thursday that the party would wait to hear what Barnier has to say about immigration and reforms to France's voting system.Macron's negotiations with the National Rally have caused unease in his camp. After dissolving parliament following the far right's strong performance in June's European election, Macron has campaigned to prevent extremist parties from gaining power in Paris."The constitution is primarily focused on the prime minister, making the president of the republic more of an arbitrator," explained Bertrand-Leo Combrade, a professor of public law at the University of Poitiers, on Thursday on Public Senat.There is no legal deadline for a new prime minister to form a government. However, the current political context in the Assembly is unstable, with no bloc holding an absolute majority, meaning it could take several days or even weeks for Barnier to establish a coalition government.Time is running out on the parliamentary front. The government must present its budget to the Assembly by Oct 1, when the ordinary parliamentary session resumes, adding urgency to Barnier's task.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily. The Canadian government announced it will refuse applications for low-wage temporary foreign workers in regions with an unemployment rate of 6 percent or higher.The policy, announced on Aug 26, will go into effect on Sept 26.A UN report issued July 22 called the program a "breeding ground for contemporary slavery" and said workers experienced a wide range of abuses because they had insufficient access to legal remedies.Employers will be permitted to hire a maximum of 10 percent of their workforces from the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP), down from 20 percent.The TFWP was designed to help employers fill temporary labor shortages when qualified Canadian citizens or permanent residents aren't available.In 2023, the highest number of work permit holders were from Mexico (45,500), followed by India, with 26,495, according to Canadian government data. There were 2,930 workers from China.Speaking to reporters at the Liberal Party cabinet retreat in Halifax last Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government had relaxed the program's rules to help businesses facing labor shortages recover from the pandemic.But the economic situation is different now, he said, and Canada "no longer needs as many temporary foreign workers''.According to public data from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, there were 135,818 temporary foreign worker permits issued in 2022, up from 84,004 in 2018.Mario Seccareccia, a professor in the economics department at the University of Ottawa, told China Daily: "I would rather describe this as a somewhat hybrid form of indentured labor, where workers are brought over and are taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers by abusing them and not respecting their contractual obligations and not fully paying them."He said that existing regulatory mechanisms didn't protect the workers' rights. The key issue is the power imbalance created by the system, in which foreign workers are tied to a single employer, he said. That creates a dependency that can lead to potential abuse, as workers fear losing their jobs and being forced to return to their home countries if the employer no longer wants them, Seccareccia said."A simple solution is to allow the foreign workers during the period of their work permit in Canada to find another job, for example, in agriculture or the services industry. Removing that bondage to one employer would clearly reduce this abuse," he said.He said the program can easily lead to abuse because it doesn't allow foreign workers to leave abusive employers and to stay in Canada during the full term of their permits.But the federal and provincial governments should have more closely monitored the situation, he said.The UN report called for an end to closed work permit systems and for all workers to be given the right to change employers. The report also emphasized the need for governments to work proactively to inform workers of their rights, rather than deferring to the demands of employers.Mathis Denis, a spokesman for Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, told China Daily: "The health and safety of temporary foreign workers in Canada is paramount. It is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure that employers are complying with the program and to hold those who are not to account.''Denis noted that in the last fiscal year, the government completed 2,122 inspections under the TFWP. During that period, $2.1 million in fines were issued to noncompliant employers for violating program rules, an increase of approximately 36 percent from the prior fiscal year. Twelve employers were banned from the program, compared with the previous fiscal year, when seven were banned.The employment minister's office said that last year, the government conducted a survey of more than 1,600 workers in the TFW program; 76 percent of respondents said they knew about their rights and responsibilities; and 80 percent reported increased knowledge of their rights and the resources and services available to them.gaoyang@chinadailyusa.comBRUSSELS -- August 2024 has tied with August 2023 as the hottest August on record globally, with the average surface air temperature hitting 16.82 degrees Celsius, 0.71 degrees Celsius above the average August temperature from 1991 to 2020, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).The data also showed that August 2024 was 1.51 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels, marking the 13th time in the past 14 months that the global average surface air temperature has surpassed 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a critical threshold set by the Paris Agreement.Meanwhile, year-to-date data indicates 2024 is on course to become the hottest year on record, as the global average temperature for January to August was 0.7 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, the highest on record for this period.C3S stressed that the average temperature anomaly for the remainder of the year would need to drop by at least 0.3 degrees Celsius to avoid surpassing 2023 as the hottest year -- a highly unlikely scenario based on historical data."During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record," said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of C3S.Burgess emphasized that the temperature-related extreme events seen this summer foreshadow more severe and destructive climate impacts unless urgent measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.French state-owned energy company EDF has begun producing energy at the country's first newly-built nuclear power plant in a quarter of a century.On Monday night, the company announced that 12 years behind schedule, the reactor known as Flamanville 3 on the northern coast of Normandy was due to experience its first chain reactions overnight. If the plant, the country's 57th so far, operates as hoped, it could be connected to the national grid by the end of the year.The news will be welcomed by President Emmanuel Macron, who in early 2022 said he wanted to see as many as 14 new reactors built to make the country carbon neutral by 2050 and end its reliance on fossil fuels."What our country needs ... is the rebirth of France's nuclear industry," he said, calling the decision to commit to nuclear power a "choice of progress, a choice of confidence in science and technology".Although Macron won a second term of office as president a few months after making that announcement, he has since lost control of the national assembly, a situation which was not resolved by an election this summer, which could mean that the proposed new projects take even longer to be made reality.Various factors contributed to the delay of the new reactor, including design complexity and a skills shortage caused by a global downturn of the nuclear industry meaning that many specialist workers moved away from the sector, and in addition to the delays, Flamanville ended up costing more than four times its initial budget.Regis Clement, co-head of EDF's nuclear production division, called its belatedly coming into operation "a historic step in this project… our teams are on the starting blocks".The company has also revised its estimate for the country's nuclear power output this year, after faster than expected maintenance work in the absence of significant weather events in the summer.From an initial figure of 315 to 345 terawatt hours, EDF now revised France's nuclear power generation for 2024 to reach somewhere between 340 and 360 TWh.France has been one of Europe's most pro-nuclear energy countries since the early 1970s, when the global oil crisis highlighted the country's dwindling coal supplies and lack of oil or gas reserves.Having developed the nuclear technology, EDF has been keen to export it and already has contracts to build new reactors in England.In the mid-1980s, EDF was a major partner in China's first large-scale nuclear power project and was actively involved in the construction of Daya Bay nuclear power station.The United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom were set to sign the first legally binding international artificial intelligence treaty on Thursday that prioritizes human rights and democracy in regulating both public and private AI systems.The new framework agreed by the Council of Europe binds signatories to collaborative efforts in overseeing AI technologies and safeguarding citizens from their possible abuse.Distinct from the recently enacted EU AI Act, the AI Convention primarily emphasizes safeguarding the human rights of individuals impacted by artificial intelligence systems, reported Reuters.The AI Convention, developed through extensive negotiations among 57 nations over several years and officially adopted in May, aims to address the potential risks associated with AI technologies, while simultaneously promoting responsible innovation across various sectors and applications.In contrast, the EU's AI Act encompasses wide-ranging rules governing the creation, implementation, and application of AI technologies across the EU's internal marketplace.Established in 1949, the Council of Europe is a separate entity from the EU, dedicated to protecting human rights, and comprises 47 member nations, encompassing all 27 EU countries. Although the UK left the EU in 2020, it remains a member of the council, while Australia, the US and Israel are among countries outside the EU invited to sign the AI treaty.Council of Europe Secretary General Marija Pejcinovic Buric said: "We must ensure that the rise of AI upholds our standards, rather than undermining them."The Framework Convention is designed to ensure just that. It is a strong and balanced text — the result of the open and inclusive approach by which it was drafted and which ensured that it benefits from multiple and expert perspectives."Pejcinovic Buric said the convention is an "open treaty with a potentially global reach"."I hope that these will be the first of many signatures and that they will be followed quickly by ratifications, so that the treaty can enter into force as soon as possible," she added.In a news release, the UK government noted that while artificial intelligence promises advantages, such as enhancing productivity and improving cancer diagnosis, this newly established convention incorporates crucial protections against potential drawbacks, including the proliferation of false information and the use of prejudiced data that could lead to biased decision-making."This Convention is a major step to ensuring that these new technologies can be harnessed without eroding our oldest values, like human rights and the rule of law," stated UK Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood. KIEV -- The Ukrainian parliament voted on Thursday to appoint Andrii Sybiha as the country's new foreign minister, replacing Dmytro Kuleba, according to lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko.Sybiha won the support of 258 of 315 lawmakers present, Honcharenko said on Telegram.Earlier in the day, the parliament voted to dismiss Kuleba, who tendered his resignation on Wednesday.Sybiha, 49, previously served as deputy head of the President's Office and became Kuleba's deputy in April.The VI International Municipal Forum of BRICS countries (IMBRICS) has ended in Moscow. The event is included in the calendar of Russia's presidency in the union. TV BRICS International Media Network is a member of the organising committee of the BRICS International Municipal Forum and acted as an international media partner of the event.Over the two days, the participants discussed various aspects of the development of modern cities as well as formats of cooperation between megacities of the BRICS countries and their partners.Alexey Shaposhnikov, Chairman of the Moscow City Duma, noted that the Russian capital plays an active role in the course of Russia's presidency in BRICS."Dozens of international events have already been held, and dozens more are planned. They are aimed at the widest audience and involve the exchange of best practices on key issues of urban and agglomeration development. For residents of many other megacities around the world, our city has also become one of the most popular communication platforms," Alexey Shaposhnikov said.Furthermore, the IMBRICS has become a platform for building real business partnerships between cities. In an exclusive commentary for TV BRICS, Mehdi Chamran, Chairman of the Islamic City Council of Tehran, spoke about the cooperation agreement between the capitals of Russia and Iran."We have concluded a memorandum between the municipalities of Moscow and Tehran. An additional meeting was held to discuss the content of the document. It was a very productive work," said Mehdi Chamran.In his opinion, the IMBRICS and similar events are very much in demand, as they allow the BRICS nations to get closer to each other.At the same time, for other participants at this stage, the forum in Moscow has become a platform for finding partners.Bruno de Queiroz Costa, Head of International Relations of the Executive Office of the State of Rio de Janeiro, in a comment for TV BRICS, noted the value of the Moscow venue in building new ties due to the geographical distance of many BRICS members from each other."The State of Rio de Janeiro is interested in applying the experience of other cities and regions in adapting to climate change and using information technology in state and municipal government," said Bruno de Queiroz Costa.The forum in Moscow attracted not only representatives of the BRICS countries. It was also attended by delegations from states interested in developing economic cooperation with the members of the union.Najiba Djilali, Chairwoman of the People's Assembly of the Algiers Province, told TV BRICS about the development of bilateral ties between the country's capital and BRICS megacities. According to her, Algeria is adopting the best practices of partner cities and is actively developing economic and investment cooperation with them.Humanitarian and inter-parliamentary ties were also in the center of attention of the forum participants. Lev Zakirov, Deputy Chairman of the Chamber of Young Legislators under the Federation Council, informed TV BRICS about the initiative to establish the BRICS+ Youth Assembly."Youth parliamentary diplomacy has great potential for development. This is especially relevant for the period of the Russian Chairmanship. We want to promote a positive image of Russia, including through the establishment of inter-parliamentary ties," said Lev Zakirov.VI International Municipal Forum of the BRICS countries was held from August 27 to 28, 2024. The event was attended by about 700 speakers and 5 thousand delegates from more than 120 countries. More than 50 thousand viewers followed the events of the IMBRICS in the online format.The Forum was supported by the Russian Presidential Administration, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federation Council, and the Roscongress Foundation. The Moscow City Government was the general partner.TV BRICSFrench President Emmanuel Macron has nominated Michel Barnier as France's new prime minister, the Elysee said on Thursday.Macron has tasked Barnier with forming a unified government to serve the country and the French people, the Elysee said in a press release.According to Elysee, Barnier's nomination came after an unprecedented cycle of consultations. Macron ensured that the future government led by Barnier would meet the conditions of being "as stable as possible and give themselves the chance to unite as broadly as possible," the press release added.On July 16, Macron accepted Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's resignation but asked him to remain in charge of a caretaker government until a new cabinet is formed.In the two rounds of legislative elections held on June 30 and July 7, Macron's centrist coalition finished second with 163 seats, trailing the left-wing parties' alliance, the New Popular Front (NFP). The NFP secured a relative majority with 182 seats in the 577-member National Assembly.Macron's nomination of Barnier from the right-wing party The Republicans (LR) was criticized by the left-wing parties, who expected an NFP candidate in line with the election results.Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of the far-left party La France Insoumise (LFI), said that the nomination shows Macron has decided to "officially deny" the results of the snap legislative elections. The prime minister should come from the NFP alliance, he added.Meanwhile, the First Secretary of the Socialist Party Olivier Faure said that Barnier's nomination brings "democratic denial to its peak," emphasizing that the LR only came fourth in the legislative elections.As a pro-European politician, Barnier's nomination has not met with opposition from the French far-right party National Rally (RN).The RN's ex-President Marine Le Pen said on her X account that she and her party members would be "attentive" to the project that the new prime minister would implement.Along with Le Pen, the current RN President Jordan Bardella said that the new prime minister should "respect" the 11 million voters who chose the RN in the legislative elections."We reserve all political means of action," Bardella said on his X account, urging Barnier to address issues such as purchasing power, security, and immigration.Former French President Francois Hollande, who is now a Socialist Party deputy, said on X platform that the RN has given a form of "approval" for Barnier's nomination.Born in 1951, Michel Barnier was elected to the French National Assembly in 1978, becoming the youngest deputy at that time in France. Elected as president of the departmental council of Savoie, he led the city of Albertville to win the hosting of the 1992 Winter Olympic Games.During his political career, he has served as French environment minister, minister delegate for Europe, foreign affairs minister, and agriculture minister. He also served as the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator.Barnier's first urgent mission is to form a government capable of completing a draft budget for 2025 before Oct 1 and submit it for voting in a National Assembly that has so far been hostile towards the right-wing prime minister.The handover ceremony for the Fifth Republic's youngest Prime Minister Attal, to its oldest Prime Minister Barnier, is scheduled for 6 pm local time (16h00 GMT). BERLIN -- An armed man was shot dead by police near the Israeli Consulate General in central Munich, Germany, local police confirmed on Thursday.Police said in a statement on social media platform X that the individual was deemed "suspicious" and was involved in an exchange of fire with the police.Authorities have not yet clarified the identity of the man.According to local media, the incident occurred after officers saw a man "apparently carrying a firearm" near Karolinenplatz in the city center. Police have confirmed that no other suspects are involved and that the area was cordoned off as a precaution. No other injuries have been reported so far.German Press Agency DPA said that Interior Minister Nancy Faeser described the shooting as a "serious incident."The shooting took place on the anniversary of the 1972 Munich Olympics terrorist attack, in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed.BERLIN - Germany's migration commissioner proposed deporting to Rwanda migrants who arrive illegally to the European Union through its borders with Belarus, as Berlin contemplates measures to restrict refugees arriving in the bloc.The proposal comes amid rising pressure on Germany's ruling coalition government to restrict irregular migration following a fatal stabbing linked to Islamic State at a city festival last month that fuelled far-right opposition and criticism of Berlin's migration policies.Joachim Stamp, Germany's Special Representative for Migration Agreements, said the EU could utilize existing asylum facilities in Rwanda, which were initially intended for Britain's 2022 plan to send unauthorized migrants to the East African nation. The British plan was scrapped by Keir Starmer's new government in July.Under Stamp's proposal, the asylum procedures in Rwanda would be conducted under the supervision of the United Nations."We currently have no third country that has come forward, with the exception of Rwanda," Stamp said in a podcast by Table Media published on Thursday.Stamp, a member of the junior coalition FDP party and whose position sits in Germany's Interior Ministry, said this model would specifically target refugees crossing the EU's eastern borders."My suggestion would be that we concentrate on this group. It's about 10,000 people a year," he said, dismissing broader proposals from the conservative opposition to apply such a model to all refugees.He said Rwanda has publicly expressed its willingness to continue implementing this model.In addition, Stamp suggested removing the so-called "connecting element" in the new Common European Asylum System (CEAS), which currently requires external asylum procedures to be conducted in countries where the asylum seeker has a social connection.The European Union agreed in December on new rules to handle irregular arrivals of asylum seekers and migrants, a deal hailed as a breakthrough after almost a decade of bitter feuds on the issue. It could take until the end of 2025 for the pact to take full effect.ReutersExperts said China's efforts in promoting high-quality economic development and fostering new quality productive forces could further boost the nation's green transition.Their comments came after the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China which concluded in July. The plenum's resolution described high-quality development as a "primary task "in building China into a modern socialist country in all respects, and identified fostering new quality productive forces as one of the key guidelines in achieving the goal.Some detailed measures in the resolution include further developing new energy sectors soundly and orderly; encouraging companies to apply digital, intelligent, and green technologies to transform traditional industries; and imposing tighter institutional constraints for environmental protection, among others.Following the closing of the plenum, China has also introduced a series of policies to accelerate the green transition, including the establishment of a dual control system that now prioritizes carbon emission reductions over the previous focus on energy consumption intensity and total energy consumption.Muyi Yang, senior electricity policy analyst for China at Ember, an energy think tank headquartered in the United Kingdom, praised this trajectory for being "sustainable"."By focusing on high-quality development, China aims to build an economy that is not only larger but also more sophisticated, efficient, and adaptable to future challenges, including climate change. This philosophy emphasizes the need to upgrade industries, foster technological innovation, and enhance productivity while minimizing environmental impact, thereby ensuring long-term prosperity and social well-being," he said.Belinda Schaepe, China policy analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, which is based in Helsinki, Finland, noted that China's continuous push for its new development path has already led to a boom in clean technologies."Clean energy was already the top driver of China's economic growth in 2023, contributing 40 percent of the GDP expansion," she said, quoting a research paper published by the center in January this year. "The heightened focus by the Chinese government on fostering new quality productive forces, including green technologies, will likely further drive production in this sector."She said the growing volumes of affordable clean products in China could also help the global energy transition and the supply chains that need to be expanded worldwide."China's investment and production of green technologies were key drivers in bringing down international prices, accelerating the uptake worldwide," Schaepe said. "Chinese companies are already setting up new production facilities in other countries. They can contribute to diversifying supply chains and offering technology transfer, particularly with countries in the Global South."Sustained focusMeanwhile, China's sustained focus on green transformation has also driven some traditional energy-intensive industries to become cleaner, both experts pointed out.Yang found out that both China's central and local state-owned enterprises in the electricity sector, while owning the majority of coal power assets in the country, have actively diversified into renewable energy, which significantly contributed to controlling the emissions by limiting coal consumption increase.The steel sector saw no new permits for coal-based steel plants in the first half of 2024, signaling a shift toward cleaner production methods such as electric arc furnaces, Schaepe said."The record expansion of renewables capacity, coupled with saturation in the real estate sector and emission reductions from heavy industry, signals that China may already have seen a carbon emissions peak in 2023," she said.Despite that, China's path to carbon neutrality can still be "long and winding", she admitted.Schaepe called for ambitious, staged carbon reduction targets leading from peak to carbon neutrality, a clearer coal phase-down plan, and stronger support for grid flexibility and power market reform to integrate renewables.Yang expressed hope that policy support for clean industries would remain on course, emphasizing the need for continued investment in research and development, creating new supply chains to deliver essential materials and components, and cultivating a new generation of skilled workers to support a decarbonized economy.A 17-year-old who allegedly stabbed his parents and 12-year-old brother to death on Sunday after feeling "extraneous" and wanting to break "free" is in custody in the Italian city of Milan.The triple killing, which the youth is thought to have carried out after obsessively listening to the melancholic Beatles ballad The Long and Winding Road, has shocked the nation and led to claims that the tragedy is a symptom of the changing role of the family in modern Italy.Police say the suspect planned the attacks in advance and carried them out after the family had celebrated the father's 51st birthday at their home in Paderno Dugnano, near Milan.Investigators said the suspect, who they are calling Riccardo, was from an apparently stable family and had not shown signs of distress or mental illness before the incident, prompting massive speculation in Italy about how such a thing could happen.A school friend told the Italian daily newspaper Corriere della Sera that Riccardo was a kind boy from a "very normal" family.Police believe he waited until everyone was asleep before starting his assault.Local media reported that the boy has since confessed to the killings, and said he carried them out because he wanted to be "free".Reports said the boy told officers: "I thought one stab would be enough to kill, then I realized it wasn't like that."Luigi Ruzza, a spokesman for the local police department, said Riccardo was waiting for officers outside his home following the incident, after telephoning police to report the crime.Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni described the killings as "beyond imagination", while Matteo Lancini, a psychologist, was quoted by The Times newspaper as saying: "Italian parents are asking the question: 'What if it happens to us?'"Meloni offered one theory as to why Riccardo carried out the killings, saying: "I don't think we have understood what is happening to new generations", with issues created by isolation experienced during the novel coronavirus pandemic lockdown combining with "digital dependency".The Italian news agency ANSA said the boy told police on Tuesday he had planned the attack but never thought he would go through with it."I experienced this unease, this existential angst but I never thought I would go as far as killing anyone, I can't explain what happened that night, unfortunately it did," ANSA quoted him as saying.The youth, who is being detained in Milan's Beccaria juvenile prison, met his lawyer, Amedeo Rizza, on Tuesday, who later described him as deeply affected by what he had done."He is becoming aware of what he has done, even if he can't explain it," Rizza told reporters.Edouard Philippe, a prominent centrist figure and former prime minister of France under President Emmanuel Macron, has declared his intention to run in the country's 2027 presidential race.Since stepping down from his role as Macron's first prime minister in 2020, Philippe has maintained his popularity among the French public, having established Horizons, a new center-right political party of his own."I will be a candidate in the next presidential election," Philippe told news magazine Le Point. "I'm preparing to propose things to the French. What I propose will be massive. The French will decide."Philippe's announcement has added another layer of complexity to France's already turbulent political landscape, which was recently shaken by unexpected parliamentary elections called by Macron.The president's attempt to strengthen his party's position through the early elections in July failed to yield the desired results, leaving him in a precarious situation.Macron's centrist bloc is now sandwiched between a dominant left-wing alliance and the far right in a fragmented National Assembly, complicating his search for a new prime minister.Amid ongoing negotiations to resolve the political gridlock, Philippe has officially announced his long-anticipated bid to replace Macron, who is ineligible for a third term in the 2027 presidential race due to constitutional term limits.In his interview, Philippe expressed his commitment to his presidential ambitions, emphasizing his readiness to pursue the office regardless of potential political upheavals."It's often said that in a presidential election, you have to want nothing else. I agree," he said.Philippe also emphasized he is prepared to be president in the unlikely event Macron surprised the country again by announcing his resignation.Macron is attempting to reinvigorate discussions about forming a new French government. This effort comes in the wake of the leftist alliance's refusal to participate after Macron declined their proposed candidate for prime minister.In response to the deadlock, Macron has widened his approach, stating on Tuesday that he is engaging with "anyone who wants to come and work for the overriding national interest".The statement follows a series of unsuccessful negotiations held during the weekend and into Monday, which failed to yield any significant progress in resolving the political impasse.Regarding the political negotiations, Philippe conveyed a willingness to back a broad spectrum of potential prime minister candidates in the interest of forming a functional government.He stated his support for "any prime minister picked from a political space ranging from the conservative right to social-democracy"."All governing parties should have as their main objective the stabilization of political life," he added.In a pointed message to the conservative Les Republicains party, Philippe said: "The right must become engaged. By refusing to participate in this central bloc, it is pushing everything to the left." French officials have confirmed a pregnant woman and six children were among 12 people who died on Tuesday attempting to cross the English Channel.A boat carrying migrants from Cap Gris-Nez in France, around 34 kilometers from the English port of Dover, "ripped open" according to French coastguards. More than 60 people were rescued, but 12 were confirmed dead and others remain unaccounted for.France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin called it a "terrible shipwreck", adding the "provisional toll stands at 12 dead, two missing and several injured … all government services are mobilized to find the missing and take care of the victims".It is believed that those on board were mainly from Eritrea, with a large number of them women.The issue of boatloads of migrants trying to cross the English Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, from mainland Europe to the United Kingdom, often in dangerously ill-equipped or overloaded boats, has become a major humanitarian and political concern on both sides.Since its exit from the European Union, the UK has no facility to send people who make the crossing back to the continent, which has led to a huge rise in the number of people willing to take the risk, and also provoked an often angry political debate.The recently-elected UK government promised to adopt a new strategy toward the problem, targeting the organized groups who send people across.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the latest incident was "horrifying and deeply tragic", and added that there must be "vital" efforts made soon to dismantle "dangerous and criminal smuggler gangs".According to the BBC's Paris correspondent Andrew Harding, there is a perception in France that the issue is mainly a problem of Britain's making.When Darmanin spoke in the aftermath of the latest tragedy, he talked about "what he views as Britain's loosely regulated job market, that acts like a magnet, drawing young Eritreans, determined Sudanese, Afghans, Syrians and Iraqis to this (French) coastline, convinced that they if they can just make it across this last, short stretch of water — or even half way across — they'll end up in a country where they can find work, even without the right paperwork".The International Organization for Migration keeps records of fatalities among people crossing the English Channel as part of its Missing Migrant Project. It estimates that so far this year, 226 people, including 35 children, have died or are missing after attempting the crossing.Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, called the toll "shockingly high" and repeated calls for the government to open up more safe and legal routes for asylum seekers, so they do not need to take such perilous risks, rather than just impose tougher penalties."Enforcement alone is not the solution," he said. "This devastating trend shows the urgent need for a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach to reduce dangerous crossings."julian@mail.chinadailyuk.comBERLIN -- The first complete German version of the first volume of the Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica) has been published in Germany recently.A herbology and nature masterpiece, the Bencao Gangmu compiled by Li Shizhen in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) was the first book in the world that scientifically categorized medicinal herbs. It was a pioneering work that advanced traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pharmaceutical theory.The publication of the book has filled a gap in the knowledge of German students of traditional Chinese medicine and has further promoted cultural exchanges between China and Germany.The Bencao Gangmu has been translated into multiple language versions.Chinese scholar Zhou Hengxiang said that the book introduces the basic theory of TCM and other TCM classics and figures mentioned in the first volume of Bencao Gangmu are also introduced in the form of appendix. HELSINKI -- Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom is leaving office and parliament, according to Swedish media reports on Wednesday.Newspaper Dagens Nyheter and Swedish Television News have quoted Billstrom saying in the social media service X that he would be leaving the cabinet when Swedish parliament opens next Tuesday. He would also leave his parliamentary seat.Moderate conservative MP Billstrom has held the foreign minister portfolio since 2022. He said he has informed the prime minister about the decision he had been considered for some time.He wrote in X that he is leaving the political life with a mixture of sadness and pride. He said he would be pulling out politics altogether.The worlds of dance and martial arts may not have the most obvious crossover, but lovers of both art forms will head to Sadler's Wells dance theater in north London this week to see the Shenzhen Opera and Dance Theater put on a show combining them to spectacular effect, Wing Chun.The show's two-stranded storyline tells the tale of legendary martial arts master Ip Man, who has also inspired a film being made about his life.There are set to be 12 performances in London, running until Sept 7, and then in October the company will perform four shows in Paris.Wing Chun made its domestic debut in December 2022, before its first overseas visit to Singapore in September 2023 and its 200th performance will take place during the London run.Before the London premiere on Friday, China's Ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Zeguang praised the show and its cast for increasing cultural understanding."I am sure (the performances) will help the UK audience better understand both Chinese martial arts and the philosophy and value championed by the practitioners," he said, while also praising Shenzhen for its growing role as a cultural hub. "Shenzhen is at the forefront of China's reform and opening-up and technological innovation. Nowadays, the city is also building itself into a leader of culture."Zheng highlighted the city's role by mentioning how the Shenzhen Symphony Orchestra had toured the UK this year and also highlighted a recent visit to the city by the United Kingdom's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Zeng Xianglai, executive vice-president of the Shenzhen International Cultural Exchange Association, also praised the show as a cultural ambassador for the region and a traditional product showcased within it."Wing Chun showcases the allure of exquisite traditional Chinese culture through the harmonious fusion of two Chinese intangible cultural heritages: Wing Chun and gambiered Guangdong gauze," he said. "This innovative fusion not only bridges ancient Chinese kung fu and contemporary dance but also promotes mutual exchange, learning and communication, transcending cultural boundaries."Positive reviewsThe show has been well received, with The Guardian newspaper praising its "smart staging, sleek designs, awesome revolving sets, tricks of the light, a pulse-quickening soundtrack, uplifting storytainment, and above all, exceptional dance, acrobatics and martial arts".At a public question and answer session, the show's creative team and performers gave some insight into the lengths they went to put it together."The biggest challenge was combining martial arts with dance," said Zhou Liya, who for the sixth time shares a joint choreography credit with collaborator Han Zhen. "Most dancers have foundation-level knowledge of martial arts, but that's not enough for a production like this, so they spent over a year learning different martial arts styles from the masters, so they were familiar with what was required."In the main role of Ip Man, dancer Chang Hongji is the central character in a uniformly top-class cast, and he revealed the extreme level of study that went into the demanding role."I spent a lot of time researching my character and my moves, so when it looks like we are taking hard falls, we don't get injured. We spent many hours finding the right level of force to make the required impact without hurting ourselves," he said.With a castmate, he gave audience members a close-up view of the intricate moves used in fight scenes, which require hundreds of repetitions to look authentic.julian@mail.chinadailyuk.comUnited States-based technology company Hewlett Packard Enterprises, also known as HPE, has confirmed it plans to continue legal action against the estate of British entrepreneur Mike Lynch, despite his death in a yachting accident last month.Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter, and five others died after his boat, the Bayesian, went down in freak nighttime weather conditions off the coast of Sicily.Investigations remain at an early stage, but local prosecutors have said that potentially, charges including manslaughter could be brought.In June, Lynch, who was a scientific advisor to former United Kingdom prime minister David Cameron and who was described as "a titanic figure in the British tech industry" and an artificial intelligence pioneer, was cleared of fraud charges over the $11 billion sale of his software company Autonomy to HPE in 2011.Reuters reported that shortly after the purchase was completed, a major internal accounting scandal was uncovered, and in 2022, HPE won a civil case against Lynch related to it.When Lynch was cleared of the charges in June, he said: "I am elated with today's verdict and grateful to the jury for their attention to the facts over the last 10 weeks."I am looking forward to returning to the United Kingdom and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field."HPE has declined to discuss its plans in detail, other than to issue a statement saying: "In 2022, an English high court judge ruled that HPE had substantially succeeded in its civil fraud claims against Dr Lynch and Mr (former company finance chief Sushovan) Hussain."A damages hearing was held in February 2024 and the judge's decision regarding damages due to HPE will arrive in due course. It is HPE's intention to follow the proceedings through to their conclusion."It is understood Lynch's yachting trip was a thank you to friends who had stood by him during the trial, with some of them believed to have been on board when the yacht went down.Chris Morvillo, a lawyer at Clifford Chance, the firm that represented Lynch in his trial, was among the dead, as was his wife Neda Morvillo, and another senior partner from the company was rescued as the boat sank.Jonathan Bloomer, the chairman of Morgan Stanley International bank, who was a defense witness in the trial, also died, along with his wife Judy.In an interview he gave to The Times newspaper shortly after his acquittal and weeks before his death, Lynch said how the court's decision had given him "a second life: the question is: what do you want to do with it?".By coincidence, Lynch's boat sank two days after Stephen Chamberlain, the Autonomy finance executive who was his co-defendant in the trial, also died, after being hit by a car while out jogging near his home in England.Automaker Volkswagen, or VW, which sells vehicles under the Audi, Bentley, Cupra, Jetta, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, Skoda, and Volkswagen brands, has put shrinking sales in China among the reasons it is considering closing factories in Germany.The 87-year-old German giant has seen its market share contract in China as rival car companies have taken bites out of its previously dominant position, prompting Oliver Blume, its chief executive officer, to warn this week that his company is now mulling something that was previously thought impossible."The economic environment became even tougher, and new competitors are entering the European market. In this environment, we as a company must now act decisively," Blume said in a statement.He added that "Germany in particular as a manufacturing location is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness" with rivals, especially electric vehicle makers from China, able to undercut its performance.Describing the European automotive industry as being in a "very… serious situation", Blume said the company's plan to save 10 billion euros ($11.03 billion) of costs by 2026 was already several billion euros behind target.VW has been attempting to bring down costs by reducing the size of its workforce through offers of early retirement and voluntary redundancy packages. But the company said relying on not replacing retiring workers will be "insufficient to achieve the urgently needed structural adjustments for greater competitiveness in the short term "and that it is now expecting to make compulsory job cuts, something it had previously said would not happen before 2029.VW also said its financial situation means "even plant closures at vehicle production and component sites can no longer be ruled out".The German state of Lower Saxony, where VW is headquartered, owns 20 percent of the company and has traditionally blocked proposed job cuts, but even it admitted on Monday layoffs now appear inevitable.Stephan Weil, the prime minister of Lower Saxony, said it was "undisputed that VW needs to take action", although he said the state government will fight hard to avoid factory closures."We expect that (closures) will simply not happen," he said, promising the state government will "pay particular attention to this".VW, which employs around 600,000 people worldwide of which 300,000 are in Germany, has been especially disappointed with lower than expected demand for its electric vehicles.The Guardian newspaper said the company is considering closing two German factories, and that its works council, which represents employees, has been informed.The company said in July it was considering closing an Audi factory in Belgium, which would be the group's first global factory closure for 40 years.VW's difficulties come as Germany's economy has been teetering on the edge of a technical recession for around two years.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who will start her second five-year term, was dealt a heavy blow when most of the 27 member states of the European Union defied her instruction to nominate two candidates — a woman and a man — in order to form a gender balanced leadership.Bulgaria is the only member state which nominated a woman and a man as instructed, while 17 states have submitted a male candidate only. Nine countries — Belgium, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden — nominated a woman only. Von der Leyen herself represents Germany, while Kaja Kallas, the former Estonian prime minister, will become the bloc's foreign policy chief.The nominating by Belgium of its federal minister for foreign affairs and trade, Hadja Lahbib, announced on Monday, and Romania's swap on Monday of Roxana Minzatu, an MEP and former minister of European Funds, to replace MEP Victor Negrescu, a male candidate submitted earlier, have made the situation slightly better.Von der Leyen earned big applause in 2019 by forming a commission with 13 women including herself and 14 men. It was the most gender balanced commission in the EU's history. She was also the first woman to become the commission president.Interviews and hearingsIn the coming weeks, von der Leyen will start to interview those candidates and assign them various policy portfolios. After that, the European Parliament will hold hearings for the candidates. It has been the case in the past that a few candidates will fail to win approval.News media reported that von der Leyen is still trying to pressure member states which nominated male candidates to make the switch like Romania.European Commission deputy chief spokesperson Arianna Podesta told a news conference on Monday that von der Leyen "has been very clear in what her ambition is, which is a gender balance college".Outgoing European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, from Denmark, vented her outrage on Monday at the gender imbalance."Unfortunately it's a demasking of the lack of efforts when it comes to equal opportunities and gender balance," she told the press.Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU Law at HEC Paris, a business school, said on X that "the next European Commission could be the most gender-imbalanced in two decades".Augmented reality displays blend onscreen images and data with the real world and the technology has the potential to make driving much safer, with holograms on windscreens that can highlight hazards and additional environmental context for journeys likely in the near future.Head-up displays, or HUDs, are augmented reality displays that can be fitted to cars and work similarly to virtual reality headsets, except they provide visual feedback for the real world instead.Two dimensional HUDs are actually established technology that have been commonly used in aerospace and the military since as early as the 1980s. Three dimensional holographic versions however, provide a stronger more visible physical presence, which can integrate with the depth of field view of the driver.The human brain is not designed for prolonged attention to detail. The mind fatigues, and distractions become more commonplace and intense the longer time passes. When this happens, a driver can lose awareness of the road and react too slowly to upcoming hazards. HUDs can help highlight sudden changes in road conditions or preempt them.The technology would solve a major issue in road safety psychology called the "look but fail to see phenomenon". This is when a user does not register something right in front of their eyes. Having a secondary display system highlights problems, making them harder to miss. Studies show that visual cues draw human attention to details in situations extremely effectively, saving mental energy on prolonged trips.Able to assist with navigation, performance, and hazards, the promise of efficient and distraction-free driving is attractive to the consumer car industry, which has been silently developing the technology for many years.Miniature lasers powered by a graphics card processing chip produce 3D holograms that are powerful enough to create visible images, even when bathed in intense sunlight.Such advancements may also make driving more accessible to those with poorer vision. Current driving tests universally rely upon strict eyesight requirements. It is hoped that HUDs may increase accessibility for the differently abled or the elderly in the near future.Naturally, each brand or model of car will vary in the type of displays they choose to utilize and the type of holographic images on show. Sports vehicles could prioritize velocity and physics of the ride, perhaps showing the G force the driver is sustaining under each turn. Urban drivers on the other hand may prefer displays that warn about pedestrians ahead or potholes in the road. Whatever the requirements of the driver, an increased offering of visual information and context could allow them to stay alert.A key contemporary issue in a future that could include self-driving vehicles will be how best to balance road safety with a driver's desire to relax on a trip, while still remaining fully aware of hazards and taking action when necessary. Here, HUDs could also come into play, popping up with attention-grabbing colors and symbols to warn drivers, even while they are relaxing. Much like the way in which inflight entertainment halts when instructions are given for passengers to fasten their seat belts or prepare for landing, it is hoped HUDs will be able to alert drivers in the future by cutting into their relaxation.It is important however that they will be designed in a way that notifies people at critical times without causing alarm or confusion.Augmented reality displays are likely to become a mainstream optional consumer choice in the near future. Customers may opt to have the feature built into new car models, and also purchase HUDs as installable separate add-on extras. This element of choice is equally as important when it comes to customizing HUDs to fit driver requirements. Warning messages are of course a mandatory component of the HUD experience, however extras such as telephone call information and music choices must be carefully managed by drivers and offered with caution by the manufacturer to prevent further distractions.Barry He is a London-based columnist for China Daily.The United Kingdom government has announced it will suspend some arms export licenses to Israel due to humanitarian law concerns, a move Israel has criticized as rewarding Hamas.Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated it will not be a full arms embargo, but affect around 30 of 350 existing licenses following a two-month review.The decision stems from concerns about the treatment of Palestinian detainees and restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza, amid ongoing conflict in the region.Lammy said the review, commissioned immediately after the Labour Party's landslide election victory in July, found a "clear risk" the arms might be used to commit "a serious violation of international humanitarian law".In his statement to the House of Commons on Monday, Lammy emphasized the government's legal duty to review arms export licenses amid the Gaza conflict.He clarified this was a suspension of 30 licenses for components of military aircraft, helicopters, and drones. Lammy noted that the review conducted by the UK government could not "arbitrate on whether or not Israel has breached international humanitarian law" in Gaza."This is a forward-looking evaluation, not a determination of innocence or guilt, and it does not prejudge any future determinations by the competent courts," he said.The suspension excludes components for multinational F-35 fighter jets, raising concerns among opposition politicians and human rights organizations, reported Sky News.He said: "It is with regret that I inform the House today the assessment I have received leaves me unable to conclude anything other than that for certain UK arms exports to Israel, there does exist a clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law."Lammy added that the decision remains under review, and affirmed that "the UK continues to support Israel's right to self-defense in accordance with international law".Some opposition Conservative Party lawmakers accused the government of having made the decision in response to demands from pro-Palestinian activists, reported the Telegraph newspaper.Andrew Mitchell, the shadow foreign secretary, claimed the move had "all the appearance of something designed to satisfy Labour's backbenchers, while at the same time not offending Israel, an ally in the Middle East. I fear it will fail on both counts".Conservative Party leadership candidate Robert Jenrick called it "shameful gesture politics to appease the hard left".Jewish community leaders in the UK expressed strong opposition to the government's decision.The Jewish Leadership Council stated Lammy's decision "could place in jeopardy the long-standing defense and intelligence partnership between the UK and Israel, which is key to the UK's own security".A senior Israeli official told the Telegraph the UK decision was a "reward for Hamas". Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also criticized the UK's decision.An estimated 350,000 Israelis protested in Tel Aviv on Sunday after it became known that Hamas had executed six hostages. The protestors blamed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for rejecting potential deals that could have saved the hostages.As the spotlight shifted from the Olympic Games to the Paralympic events in Paris, the stories of Chinese volunteers who made their mark during the Games are emerging as a testament to international camaraderie and cultural exchange. Among them, Zheng Jiaxin and Liu Xinyi stand out for their dedication and the unique perspectives they brought to the grand event.With a remarkable 45,000 volunteers contributing to the Paris 2024 Games, Zheng, a 29-year-old Chinese expatriate who works at the Postal Bank in France, took two weeks off to volunteer during the Paris 2024 Olympics.Having lived in Paris for seven years after moving from China to study big data and finance, Zheng found volunteering at the Olympics a deeply personal and meaningful endeavor."Volunteering for the Paris Olympics was a way for me to give back to the city that has welcomed me with open arms," she said. "It was also an opportunity to celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and France."Zheng's role was crucial in helping manage the influx of spectators and ensuring a smooth experience for everyone involved. Her decision to dedicate part of her annual leave to volunteer highlighted her commitment."Even though I sacrificed 10 days of my vacation time, it was worth every moment," she said. "I wanted to repay the kindness I received when I first arrived in Paris. It felt like a way to contribute to a major event in the city I now call my second home."For Zheng, the Olympics were more than just a series of events, they were a symbol of global unity and cultural exchange."We came together with a shared purpose — to showcase the friendly and united spirit of Chinese volunteers," she said. "Being a part of this global celebration and helping others was incredibly fulfilling. It was a chance to promote not only my own culture but also the values of cooperation and respect."Zheng's sentiments were echoed by Liu Xinyi, a 25-year-old master's degree student in sociology at Sciences Po Paris, who contributed as a volunteer at the Paris Media Center during the Games.Liu, who arrived in Paris in August 2021, had been inspired by the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a child."I grew up in Beijing and the 2008 Beijing Olympics left a deep impression on me when I was 9 years old. It was the first time I encountered other cultures and foreigners and the first time I was involved in an international event. I remember the openness and inclusiveness of Beijing during that time, so I truly cherish this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," she said.At the Paris Media Center, Liu's role involved assisting journalists from around the world and ensuring they had a smooth experience covering the Olympics."I was responsible for greeting journalists, helping them navigate the center, and coordinating events," she explained. "The opportunity to use my multilingual skills and interact with media professionals was incredibly rewarding. It also allowed me to see the inner workings of international media coverage up close."Liu's work came with its challenges, including early mornings and a demanding schedule."Waking up at 6 am every day was tough," she admitted. "But the chance to attend news conferences and meet renowned figures, like French historian Patrick Boucheron, made it all worthwhile. The most valuable lesson I gained from being part of the Olympics and Paralympics volunteer team was the importance of maintaining curiosity and showing respect and enthusiasm for other cultures. This diversity greatly aided us in providing tailored services to journalists from different countries."As the Paralympics began, the stories of Zheng and Liu highlighted the significant impact volunteers have had on the Paris 2024 Games. Their contributions embody a broader spirit of international collaboration and mutual respect, reflecting the values that the Olympics and Paralympics aim to promote.For both, the memories of their volunteer work will remain a cherished part of their time in Paris and a symbol of their commitment to fostering international understanding.Germany's far right has achieved its most significant regional electoral triumph since World War II, as the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party won a major victory in the eastern state of Thuringia, a result it has hailed as a "historic success".The victory on Sunday for the anti-immigrant AfD represents a setback for Germany's political center, particularly for Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling coalition of three parties, which suffered losses in the vote."The results for the AfD in Saxony and Thuringia are worrying," Scholz said in a statement to Reuters."Our country cannot and must not get used to this. The AfD is damaging Germany. It is weakening the economy, dividing society and ruining our country's reputation."The AfD, founded in 2013, won 32.8 percent of the vote in Thuringia, outperforming the mainstream center-right Christian Democratic Union, which secured 23.6 percent.In the neighboring state of Saxony, the AfD finished a close second, by just half a percentage point, to the Christian Democratic Union, which leads the national opposition.A new populist-left party, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, secured third position in both states.Dealing a blow to ScholzThe far right's success deals a blow to Scholz's coalition just a year before the federal election, with his Social Democratic Party and coalition partners, the Greens and liberal Free Democrats, all performing poorly in Sunday's vote.Despite the AfD achieving a historic first by becoming the strongest party in a state election, it is almost certain to be excluded from power as all other rival parties have so far ruled out any direct cooperation with it, Deutsche Welle reported.The AfD is led in Thuringia by Bjorn Hocke, regarded as one of the party's most extreme figures.Hocke has faced legal consequences twice this year alone for employing prohibited Nazi slogans during his campaign events and is known for his frequent use of Nazilike rhetoric.Speaking after the vote, Hocke said he felt "a great, great deal of pride" and told public broadcaster ARD that his party would analyze the results before approaching potential coalition partners.When questioned about his party's classification as extremist, he said: "Please stop stigmatizing me. We are the number one party in Thuringia ...You don't want to classify one-third of the voters in Thuringia as right-wing extremists."The AfD, campaigning on a central demand for drastic changes in immigration policy, ran on a platform calling for the mass deportation of refugees from Germany.Tourists visiting Italy could soon be paying taxes of up to 25 euros ($27.70) a night after the government said it wants to discourage over-tourism while allowing cash-strapped municipalities to raise extra cash.Many Italian cities already collect taxes of up to a maximum of 5 euros on overnight stays, but the government is considering changing those patchwork taxes into a blanket tax based on the cost of the hotel room the tourist is using, with the most expensive rooms qualifying for the highest level of the new tax.The proposal calls for local governments to collect the money, which they could then use for local services, such as garbage collection.Marina Lalli, from Federturismo, an advocacy organization for tourism companies, told the Financial Times newspaper municipalities are currently supposed to spend taxes collected from tourists on products and services that support the tourism industry. But she said many local governments are actually spending the money on everyday services that should be funded by the Italian taxpayer, and that the proposed change would formalize that situation."When you go and fix your streets that are full of holes — and you pay with money you collect from tourist tax — is this really for tourists, or is this a normal, ordinary thing that you should do in your city?" she told the paper.The proposed change to the tourism tax is being championed by Daniela Santanche, Italy's tourism minister, who wrote on the X social media platform that it would be a win-win situation because it would generate income for cash-strapped cities and municipalities while also reducing visitor numbers and taking pressure of overcrowded tourism sites."In times of over-tourism, we are debating this so that it really helps improve services and make tourists who pay it more responsible," wrote Santanche.The proposed tax would start at 5 euros a night for economy rooms priced at 100 euros or less. Regular rooms rented out for between 100 euros and 400 euros a night would elicit a 10 euro a night tax. And high-end rooms billed out for between 400 euros a night and 750 euros would be taxed at the rate of 15 euros a night. Luxury rooms charged at more than 750 euros a night would be taxed at 25 euros a night.The problem of over-tourism has been widely debated across Europe in recent months, with the Italian city of Venice introducing a 5 euro admission charge for visitors, the English city of Cambridge considering limiting the size and number of tourism groups, and the Spanish city of Barcelona mulling a prohibition on apartments being rented out to non-locals.The issue has also prompted anti-tourist protests in tourism hotspots across Europe, including in the Netherlands, Greece, and Spain.earle@mail.chinadailyuk.com BERLIN -- German automotive giant Volkswagen is considering closing its production plants in Germany to cope with rising costs, said the company on Monday.Vehicle plant and component factory closures can no longer be ruled out in the current situation, barring rapid countermeasures, German Press Agency quoted the carmaker as saying.Alongside these potential closures, the company has also hinted at possible layoffs. Volkswagen said it had to cancel a long-standing agreement with labor unions in Germany, which has been in place since 1994 and aimed to prevent compulsory redundancies until 2029. The step has not yet been agreed with the employee side. BRUSSELS -- Belgium's King Philippe has reappointed Bart De Wever, leader of the Flemish nationalist N-VA party, to lead talks on the formation of a new government.The Royal Palace announced the decision on Monday after King Philippe met with royal mediator Maxime Prevot, who has been mediating since Aug 23.Prevot, leader of Les Engages party, has reported that the five involved parties -- the French-speaking Reformist Movement (MR), Les Engages, the N-VA, the Flemish Christian Democrats (CD&V), and Vooruit -- are now ready to resume negotiations.De Wever is now tasked with restarting coalition talks as soon as possible.De Wever resigned on Aug 22 due to major disagreements, which had arisen over a proposed capital gains tax aimed at raising 500 million euros ($553 million) annually.The worlds of dance and martial arts may not have the most obvious crossover but lovers of both art forms will head to Sadler's Wells dance theater in north London this week to see the Shenzhen Opera and Dance Theater company put on a show combining them to spectacular effect, Wing Chun.The show's two-stranded storyline tells the tale of legendary martial arts master Yip Man, and also a film being made about his life.The first half is mainly dance, with brief flashes of martial arts, which take center stage in the second half, showcasing the skills of China's unique cultural calling card that is so instantly recognized and widely admired around the world.There are also passing references to the enduring influence of kung fu on popular culture in movies such as The Matrix.There are set to be 12 performances in London, running until Sept 7, and then in October the company will perform four shows in Paris.Wing Chun made its domestic debut in December 2022, before its first overseas visit, to Singapore in September 2023, and its 200th performance will take place during the London run.Before the London premiere, China's Ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Zeguang praised the show and its cast for increasing cultural understanding."I am sure (the performances) will help the UK audience better understand both Chinese martial arts and the philosophy and value championed by the practitioners," he said, while also praising Shenzhen for its growing role as a cultural hub. "Shenzhen is at the forefront of China's reform and opening-up and technological innovation. Nowadays, the city is also building itself into a leader of culture."Zheng highlighted the city's role by mentioning how the Shenzhen Symphony Orchestra had toured the UK this year, and he also drew attention to a recent visit to the city by the United Kingdom's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Zeng Xianglai, executive vice-president of the Shenzhen International Cultural Exchange Association, also praised the show as a cultural ambassador for the region and a traditional product showcased within it."Wing Chun showcases the allure of exquisite traditional Chinese culture through the harmonious fusion of two Chinese intangible cultural heritages: wing chun and gambiered Guangdong gauze," he said. "This innovative fusion not only bridges ancient Chinese kung fu and contemporary dance but also promotes mutual exchange, learning, and communication, transcending cultural boundaries."The show has been well received, with The Guardian newspaper praising its "smart staging, sleek designs, awesome revolving sets, tricks of the light, a pulse-quickening soundtrack, uplifting storytainment, and above all exceptional dance, acrobatics and martial arts".Hong Kong-born choreographer and opera director Caroline Chao called it "stunning ... beautiful, fluid, seamlessly combining dance with martial arts into one brilliant whole".At a public question and answer session, the show's creative team and performers gave some insight into the lengths they went to putting it together."The biggest challenge was combining martial arts with dance," said Zhou Liya, who for the sixth time shares a joint choreography credit with collaborator Han Zhen. "Most dancers have foundation-level knowledge of martial arts, but that's not enough for a production like this, so they spent over a year learning different martial arts styles from the masters, so they were familiar with what was required."In the main role of Yip Man, Chang Hongji is the central character in a uniformly top-class cast, and he revealed the extreme level of study that went into the demanding role."Wing chun says we must be diligent and practice, and that has informed my involvement in this production," he said. "I spent a lot of time researching my character and my moves, so when it looks like we are taking hard falls, we don't get injured. We spent many hours finding the right level of force to make the required impact without hurting ourselves."With a cast-mate, he gave audience members a close-up view of the intricate moves used in fight scenes, which require hundreds of repetitions to look authentic, and Zhou Liya revealed "this needs so much practice that even in lunch breaks and at the start of the day when they greet each other, this is how they do it".Wing Chun runs at the Sadler's Wells theater in London until Sept 7.julian@mail.chinadailyuk.comVILNIUS/RIGA -- Several schools in Lithuania and Latvia received bomb threats via email on Monday, the first day of the new school year, according to police reports.As of 9 am local time, the police in Lithuania had received 26 reports of threats to blow up educational institutions in the capital city of Vilnius, as confirmed by Revita Janaviciute, a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian police, to the Baltic News Service (BNS).Currently, there is no information on any school evacuations. The Police Department, through its social media, advised schools not to panic and to maintain normal operations, emphasizing that evacuations should only occur if a suspicious item is found.In a related development, over 200 emails containing bomb threats were received by several schools across Latvia on Monday morning, as confirmed by Latvia's state police chief Armands Ruks. He described these emails as "low-risk threats," adding that there was no need for evacuation.The incidents follow a series of hoax bomb threats in October 2023, when thousands of schools, kindergartens, and municipal buildings across Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were targeted with similar emails.HELSINKI -- Children under two years old should avoid digital screens entirely, while teenagers should limit their daily screen time to a maximum of three hours, according to the latest recommendations published by the Swedish public health agency on Monday.The agency recommended a maximum daily screen time of one hour for children aged 2-5, one to two hours for children aged 6-12, and two to three hours for teenagers aged 13-18. Additionally, cell phones and tablets should be kept out of children's bedrooms during the night.Olivia Wigzell, the agency's acting director-general, said the recommendations aim to support parents and caregivers, as well as children and young people, highlighting that reducing screen time is essential for ensuring children get adequate exercise and sleep.Helena Frielingsdorf, a physician and researcher at the agency, noted that their research indicates young people experience both positive and negative effects from digital media. Many are concerned about the impact of screens and are seeking ways to change their habits. She added that the guidelines aim to provide the assistance they need.A report released in Sweden in June highlighted the consequences of excessive screen time, including poor sleep, depressive symptoms, and body dissatisfaction. It cautioned that children and adolescents can become easily engrossed in digital activities, often at the expense of sleep, relationships, and physical activity.Sweden's public health agency has urged tech companies to take greater responsibility in mitigating health risks for children and adolescents.The guidelines address the use of digital media during leisure time, including social media, video streaming, TV, video games, and other forms of digital entertainment. Their drafting involved consultations with children, parents, experts, and agencies from Denmark and Norway, as well as the World Health Organization (WHO). The prospect of a eurozone interest rate cut has excited investors, with many predicting the European Central Bank, or ECB, will now slash borrowing costs by a quarter of a point.The optimism followed news that inflation fell during August within the 20-member bloc that uses the euro for currency, to a three-year low of 2.2 percent, after having edged up in July to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent in June.Bert Colijn, an economist at ING, told the Financial Times newspaper the fact that Eurostat, the European Union's official statistics agency, declared the eurozone's inflation rate to be within a whisker of the ECB's target of 2 percent means rate cuts will be likely when the bank discusses the issue on Sept 12."The inflation environment is slowly getting more benign," Colijn said. "The ECB has arrived on a long home straight."Eurostat said Germany and Spain reported bigger than expected falls in consumer price rises in August, while France also did well, recording inflation at 2.2 percent in spite of cost pressures associated with hosting the Olympic Games.If the ECB does reduce its key interest rate by a quarter-point to 3.5 percent, it will follow on from a quarter-point cut in June and could lead to more cuts, with the Financial Times saying traders are now hoping for two or three additional quarter-point reductions before the end of the year.However, within the overall inflation rate, there was a worrying uptick in the cost of services, something that Jack Allen-Reynolds, from Capital Economics, told the Financial Times may cause concern at the bank."However, we doubt that August's unexpected increase in services inflation will stop the ECB from cutting interest rates at its next meeting in September," he told the paper.A 3 percent fall in the cost of energy during August more than offset the increase in the cost of services.Core inflation, which ignores price changes in volatile commodities including alcohol, energy, food, and tobacco, stood at 2.8 percent in August, according to Eurostat, down slightly from 2.9 percent in July.French newspaper Le Monde said the ECB is likely to look closely at the core inflation rate when setting its interest rate, and this could mean interest rate cuts are far from certain.The ECB started its campaign of aggressive interest rate hikes in July 2022, when the eurozone's inflation rate was rocketing up to 10.6 percent in October, largely because of fast-rising energy and food costs attributed to the Ukraine conflict.Sam Miley, from the London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research, told Le Monde that interest rate cuts are more likely now than they were a few weeks ago, but are not guaranteed."The … rate of core inflation and continually tight labor market will present risk factors to implementing looser monetary policy," Miley said. The ongoing political wrangling over who will form the next government in France has taken a new twist after the radical left-wing La France Insoumise party, also known as LFI, tried to rally other groups to bring impeachment proceedings against President Emmanuel Macron, for what it regards as serious failings in his constitutional duties.Earlier in the summer, Macron announced a surprise election for seats in the National Assembly, in a bid to call the bluff of the electorate over rising support from the far-right National Rally party, or RN.Although the two-round vote saw RN relegated to being the third-largest bloc in the parliament, a loose coalition of left-wing parties emerged as the largest grouping, ahead of Macron's own centrists, but, crucially, without an overall majority.After a temporary lull in political activity during the Paris Olympic Games, talks have resumed over who should be the next prime minister and what the make-up of the next Cabinet should be, but so far there has been little progress.Macron has already rejected one name put forward by some left-wing parties to be prime minister, economist Lucie Castets, saying he had a duty to ensure "institutional stability" and that she is regarded as someone who would not gain wider support and approval, leading to constitutional deadlock.This has prompted LFI to take action, saying it is not up to the president to do "political horse trading".Mathilde Panot, the parliamentary leader of LFI, said a draft impeachment document has been sent to assembly members from other parties in a bid to gain their support."The Assemblee Nationale (lower house) and Senat (upper house) can and must defend democracy against the president's authoritarian leanings," the document said.The impeachment bid looks to be largely symbolic rather than meaningful, however, with two-thirds of the combined members of the 577-seat national assembly and 349-seat Senate needing to support any action for it to be successful.Article 68 of the French Constitution says a presidential mandate can be terminated early "in the event of a breach of duty manifestly incompatible with the exercise of his mandate".Macron won a second five-year term in 2022, but National Assembly elections shortly after saddled him with a parliament that was of a different political make-up, a situation that has not been cleared up by this summer's election results.Political observers have noted that the Constitution lacks clear guidelines on how a hung parliament, which is one with no overall majority as is the current situation, should be managed, as it seems to have been written on the assumption that there would always be a clear majority group or party.VLADIVOSTOK - The bodies of all 22 victims in a Mi-8 helicopter crash in Russia's Kamchatka region have been found, local officials said on Monday."The bodies of the deceased have been found and handed over to forensic authorities. The search and rescue operation has been completed," Minister for Emergency Situations of the Kamchatka region Sergei Lebedev said on social media."The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations helicopter will pick up the rescuers from the crash site of the Mi-8 operated by Vityaz-Aero in half an hour," he wrote.The wreckage of the Mi-8 helicopter, which disappeared from radar on Saturday, was found on Sunday in the Vachkazhets mountain range area in Kamchatka. There were three crew members and 19 passengers on board.Authorities have declared Tuesday a day of mourning in Kamchatka.It's been two months since snap elections were held in France, yet the country is still to elect a new prime minister.Amid this political instability, the country successfully hosted the Paris Olympics and opened the Paralympic Games on Wednesday.According to experts, the ongoing political deadlock is putting President Emmanuel Macron to the test as he struggles to form a new government.It was hoped that hosting the Olympics would lift the morale of the country and ease political tensions. However, the temporary "political truce" for the Games is now over and there is no end to the impasse in sight.In a surprise move, Macron dissolved the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, and called for snap polls after a setback in the June European Parliament elections, in which the far-right National Rally party gained major ground.Two rounds of voting, on June 30 and July 7, produced no clear winner in the 577-seat National Assembly.Macron has "won and failed", Zhang Jinling, a senior research fellow on French studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of European Studies, told China Daily."He succeeded in blocking the far-right momentum, particularly through political maneuvers with the left-wing bloc after the first round," Zhang said. "However, Macron ultimately failed, as his Ensemble coalition lost its relative majority."The French team performed well in the Olympics but "the morale gained from the games failed to smooth the political process", Dai Zhixin, vice-dean of the Institute of French and Francophone Studies and research fellow at the Institute of Area Studies of Renmin University of China, told China Daily."The current political deadlock is rooted mainly in party divisions and conflicting interests. Resolving the situation will require political wisdom and compromise," Dai said.More efforts were underway as Macron launched a new round of talks to end the stalemate. Macron said he would not name a government led by the left-wing New Popular Front coalition, which emerged as the largest bloc but fell short of an absolute majority."France has traditionally been governed alternatively by the left or right," Zhang said. "Macron's rise to power in 2017, positioning himself as a centrist, foreshadowed the tripartite political landscape."The parliamentary structure indicates a "deepening polarization" in French politics, which makes the formation of a new administration particularly challenging, Dai said."France's political stability could be at risk if no compromise is reached, and the government's decision-making efficiency will be significantly impaired," Dai added.He also noted that Macron faces the risk of becoming a "lame-duck" president, with "passing bills becoming nearly impossible"."Some might suggest invoking Article 49.3 of the Constitution to bypass a vote, like last year's retirement reform. But it would be no longer feasible as the current situation makes it easy for the opposition to overturn such actions through a vote of no confidence," Zhang said."Due to significant disagreements among parties on key issues such as immigration and taxation, major reforms in France over the next three years are unlikely," he added.The New Popular Front had proposed economist and civil servant Lucie Castets, 37, as prime minister, but was turned down by Macron, who said the left-wing government would be a "threat to institutional stability", drawing strong criticism from the opposition.Macron's office has not provided any timeline for naming a prime minister, but the clock is ticking toward the Oct 1 deadline when the government must present a draft budget law for 2025, Agence France-Presse reported."If the new government leans toward a more conservative stance, it may lead to divergences with other European Union countries on issues like immigration and economic policy, potentially weakening EU cohesion," Dai said.Macron held a meeting with the United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Paris on Thursday, in which the two leaders agreed to deepen relations over security and migration. That day Macron began a two-day visit to Serbia, where Rafale jets deal and energy topped the agenda."The new government's foreign policy will be crucial in finding the optimal balance between France's national interests and the EU's collective interests, which will impact the EU's position on the global stage," Zhang said.PARIS -- Though described by European leaders as a "friend and partner", Keir Starmer, who assumed the British premiership in July, has given no indication of reversing Brexit or rejoining the European single market.However, eight years after Brexit strained Britain's relations with the EU, Starmer's choice of Germany and France for his first visits signals a desire to recalibrate relations, particularly in trade with EU members.At the 4th meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) held in Britain in July, Starmer indicated readiness to reset Britain's strained post-Brexit relations with Europe, especially as the region confronts "generational challenges".Following the long tradition of viewing Germany as key to improving relations with Europe, Starmer kicked off his EU visit in Germany where he met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.During the meeting, Scholz said that he was "pleased" with the Starmer's announcement that he would seek a "fresh start" in relations with the EU."Given the common challenges our two countries face, we are convinced that the time has come to take our bilateral relations to the next level," said a joint declaration on deepening and enhancing UK-Germany relations issued during Starmer's visit.Both permanent members of the UN Security Council with nuclear weapons, Britain and France maintained frosty relations during the years of Brexit negotiations.It was not until 2023 that French President Emmanuel Macron and then British PM Rishi Sunak broke the ice with a financial deal on the illegal migration, followed by Britain's King Charles III's first-ever state visit to France.After Starmer's meeting with Macron on Thursday, the British foreign ministry said that the two leaders "agreed on the importance of further strengthening and broadening the close relationship between the UK and France in the coming months"."The reset so far is on atmosphere rather than substance," Peter Ricketts, chairman of the House of Lords European Affairs Committee, told European news website Euractiv. "It's focused on goodwill and good intentions, a commitment to working together, and shared interests."It's the right thing for Britain to have good relations with the EU in defense and immigration cooperation and there has to be a renegotiation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, Professor Iain Begg from the London School of Economics and Political Science, told Xinhua.Amid high government debt and sluggish economic growth, it is believed that Starmer was chosen by the British people to "fix" the country's economic foundation.A major study by the Resolution Foundation, a leading British think tank, revealed that the British economy has been stagnating for 15 years, leaving low- and middle-income households "much poorer" than their counterparts in advanced economies such as France and Germany.The British economic outlook remains bleak, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting a GDP growth of just 0.7 percent in 2024 and 1.5 percent in 2025.According to the British government figures, Germany was Britain's second-largest trading partner in the four quarters to the end of the first quarter of 2024, accounting for 8.5 percent of its total.Germany and Britain were looking to "place their relations on a completely new footing" by concluding a treaty on bilateral cooperation, Scholz said at a joint news conference with Starmer.For his part, Starmer said that the upcoming new bilateral cooperation treaty would reflect "our status as the closest of partners in Europe" and closer links in science, technology and business would strengthen trade ties with Germany while creating jobs both in Germany and Britain.Describing economic growth as his government's top priority, Starmer said, "building relationships with our partners here in Germany and across Europe is vital to achieving it."During his short stay in France, Starmer also met with business leaders. "My Labour government will provide the economic stability needed for international business to invest in the UK. When business thrives, we all do," he said on X, formerly Twitter.Before the bilateral summit held in 2023 that fixed the frosty relations, Britain and France had clashed over issues including French fishermen's fishing licenses, illegal migration through the English Channel, and Australia's decision to cancel the submarine contract with France for British nuclear-powered alternatives.Although economic growth has been declared as a priority of his government, Starmer seemed to focus on another more urgent issue in discussions with Macron -- illegal migration.Following his visit to France, the two sides reaffirmed their desire to deepen cooperation on illegal migration in the English Channel, not least in the face of human trafficking rings.During the 2023 bilateral summit, France and Britain reached a controversial new deal to combat illegal migration across the channel, under which London would pay Paris millions of euros from 2023 to 2026, and a detention center should be built in northern France.British government statistics showed that between Aug 25 to 31, 2024, 1,758 irregular migrants attempted to cross the channel in small boats without permission to enter Britain.According to British journalist Philip Turle, the France-Britain relationship has been strained for years over the crossing of illegal migrants through the channel."Those who voted for Brexit believed that it would allow better control of immigration. They saw clearly that it had no effect," Turle told news channel France24. "The challenge for the British as well as for the Europeans is to work better with the countries of origin to reduce these migratory flows."Turle noted that Starmer's visits were also a way of expressing his worries over the rise of the far right in Europe, especially after riots on home soil, the French far-right wing party's win of more seats in the National Assembly, and rocking support for right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party after recent attacks.But for Begg, Starmer's trips to Germany and France were not just visits to Berlin and Paris.They aim to establish stronger relations with a big neighbor, a key trading partner, and an important source of potential cooperation on critical issues, including illegal migration and direct investment into their countries, he told Xinhua. BERLIN - The conservative CDU would not enter a coalition with the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), its general secretary Carsten Linnemann said Sunday after regional elections in two states."Voters know that we do not form coalitions with the AfD," Linnemann told broadcaster ZDF. The AfD topped exit polls in Thuringia, with the CDU in second, while the CDU had its nose in front in a narrow race for first in Saxony.AFPMOSCOW -- Seventeen bodies have been found after a Russian Mi-8 helicopter crashed in the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said Sunday.The helicopter went missing on Saturday with 19 tourists and three crew members on board, according to preliminary data from the Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency.Earlier in the day, the Ministry of Emergency Situations confirmed the crash of the helicopter and said that the search continues at the site.MOSCOW - Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency said that a Mi-8 helicopter went missing on Saturday over the Kamchatka Peninsula, with 22 people on board.According to preliminary data, those on board include 19 tourists and 3 crew members, the agency said on Telegram.Searching operation is going on, it said.David Bencsik, executive Editor-in-Chief of Magyar Demokrata Media Group of Hungary, highlighted at the 2024 Media Cooperation Forum on Belt and Road in Chengdu, Sichuan on Aug 28, that European media are constrained from opposing the US government under Western capital influence. MOSCOW - Pavel Popov, a former Russian deputy defense minister, has been arrested on charges of large-scale fraud and is being held in a pre-trial detention center, the TASS news agency reported on Thursday.The report said a Russian court has ordered Popov to remain in detention until Oct 29.Investigators said that Popov and Vyacheslav Akhmedov, director of the Patriot military-patriotic park, and Vladimir Shesterov, a deputy head of the Main Directorate for Innovative Development of the Russian Defense Ministry, misappropriated funds between 2021 and 2024.Popov was accused of abusing his position to divert resources from the park for personal benefit, including the construction, renovation, and furnishing of his private estate in the Krasnogorsk district of the Moscow region.The former deputy defense minister was also accused of coercing companies contracted by the park into constructing his private property for free, and continuing to use park resources for its maintenance and upkeep.Popov had served as the deputy minister of emergency situations from 2008 to 2013 before joining the Ministry of Defense in 2013 as an aide to Minister Sergei Shoigu. He was appointed deputy defense minister on Nov 7, 2013, overseeing scientific research, technological development, information systems, and robotics testing. His military service was terminated by presidential decree in June of this year.BELGRADE - Serbia and France on Thursday signed a series of preliminary agreements on nuclear energy, strategic raw materials, as well as a deal on acquisition of French Rafale fighter jets.French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Serbia for a two-day visit on Thursday afternoon. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic held talks with him, and they witnessed the signing of over a dozen agreements between governments and enterprises of the two nations.At a subsequent press conference, Vucic emphasized the depth of the discussions, which covered bilateral relations, Serbia's European Union (EU) accession process, and broader European and global issues."The agreements we signed today touch every aspect of our social and economic life," Vucic said. He also emphasized the importance of Serbia's purchase of 12 Rafale fighter jets from France.Macron said the agreements signed reflect France's support for Serbia's EU integration through enhanced ties. "We must reform the European Union and expand it," Macron said.In addition to letters of intent on nuclear energy and strategic raw materials, as well as the purchase agreement for Rafale fighter jets, the two countries also secured letters of intent on environmental protection, healthcare, agricultural and food industry, tourism, and infrastructure projects.VIENNA - The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Thursday that he will visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) next week as nuclear safety situation there "remains precarious."IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said in a statement that he will hold high-level talks and assess developments at the ZNPP during his visit.Grossi's visit comes after what he called "recent deeply concerning incidents" at the ZNPP, including a fire that broke out at the plant's cooling tower and a drone strike close to the facility earlier this month."A nuclear accident must be avoided at all costs, and a nuclear power plant must never be attacked. The consequences could be disastrous, and no one stands to benefit from it," Grossi warned, adding that he remains determined to protect nuclear safety.According to Thursday's statement, IAEA experts stationed at the ZNPP have "continued to hear explosions and other indications of military activities, at times near the plant itself."Grossi also expressed increasing concerns over the growing vulnerability of Ukraine's energy infrastructure and its potential impact on the safety of the country's operating nuclear power plants.Teenagers in the United Kingdom are falling victim to a so-called happiness recession after new research by the charity The Children's Society revealed British youngsters have the lowest life satisfaction levels in Europe.The study, called the Good Childhood Report, looked at youngsters in 27 countries and highlighted how girls are particularly badly affected, and also those from poorer backgrounds, with poverty a significant contributory factor."Children and young people deserve better," the report observed. "Decisive action and national leadership are needed to overturn the decline in children's wellbeing. We know that these experiences are not lived in a vacuum… The pandemic, rising levels of poverty, concerns over young people's safety, the climate emergency and other stresses have put a strain on young people's lives and can prevent the experience of a happy and fulfilled childhood."In 2021/22, children aged between 10 and 15 were asked to score levels of satisfaction with their quality of life in general, and also their school, schoolwork, friends, and appearance.Lower levels of satisfaction were found to be at least twice as high among UK teenagers as they were among youngsters of the same ages in Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Romania, and Portugal.Of those questioned in the UK, 41 percent of children and young people were "very" or "quite" worried about the cost of living, and, ranked against their peers in Europe, the UK was found to have the fourth-highest rate of food deprivation, the fifth-highest rate of physical inactivity outside school hours, and the second-highest level of bullying.The report comes in the same week that it was revealed that each day more than 500 children in England are being referred to the National Health Service's mental health support teams because of anxiety, figures that are more than twice those from before the pandemic.In 2023/24 there were 204,526 new referrals of patients aged 17 or younger, compared to 98,953 in 2019/20, before the pandemic began. There is an even sharper contrast with the year 2016/17, where the number was just 3,879.Andy Bell, chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health, told The Guardian newspaper there were many factors at play, including poverty and school concerns."Our research indicates that academic pressures, particularly those related to exams, have intensified in the last decade. Evidence also suggests that online harms, such as cyberbullying and pressures around appearance, are relentless and can fuel anxiety in children," he said."The pandemic has amplified these pressures on children and young people by disrupting their routines and increasing feelings of isolation and uncertainty about the world and their futures."Judges in France have placed Pavel Durov, the billionaire founder and chief executive of the Telegram messaging app, under formal investigation over the platform's alleged misuse by organized crime gangs.Durov was put under judicial supervision and ordered to pay a 5-million-euro ($5.6 million) bail bond, but has not been remanded in custody.The Russian-born tech leader, who also has French citizenship, must report to a French police station twice a week while the probe is ongoing and must not leave France.The development follows his detention on Saturday at an airport north of Paris and four days of questioning over alleged offenses related to the Telegram app.Prosecutors said on Wednesday that Durov is being investigated over potentially having been complicit in the administration of an online platform to enable illicit transactions by an organized gang, and for allegedly refusing to communicate with the authorities. He is also being probed for possible complicity in the organized criminal distribution of sexual images of children.Being placed under formal investigation does not mean that the authorities believe Durov is guilty, but they think there is a good reason to proceed with a probe.Durov's lawyer, David-Olivier Kaminski, said Telegram, which was founded in 2013, has consistently complied with European digital laws and regulations and is overseen in the same way as all other social media networks.He said his client had not been involved "in criminal acts that don't concern him either directly or indirectly", the BBC reported.Telegram, which is headquartered in Dubai, allows groups of up to 200,000 people to share information and comment on it, which is a far larger scale than those of its rivals such as WhatsApp, which tend to be limited to around 1,000.Some Telegram users choose to send encrypted messages that can only be seen by the sender and recipient. The app has around 950 million registered users, and it is popular in Russia and Ukraine.Act of intimidationTelegram said the company and its founder have "nothing to hide", while the Russian government said the investigation could be seen as an act of "intimidation" against the enterprise for political purposes.The BBC quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying: "Given (Durov's) Russian citizenship, we are ready to provide all necessary help and assistance. But here the situation is complicated by the fact that he is also a French citizen."Durov left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with the government's demand that the app block groups opposed to it. He subsequently obtained French citizenship in 2021 and has also become a citizen of the Caribbean nation Saint Kitts and Nevis and of the United Arab Emirates.His arrest prompted a protest near France's embassy in Moscow over the weekend.earle@mail.chinadailyuk.com LONDON -- The number of suicides in England and Wales has reached its highest level in 25 years, according to statistics released Thursday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The ONS reported a total of 6,069 suicides in England and Wales in 2023, or 11.4 suicide deaths per 100,000 people, compared to 10.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2022.The data revealed that while the suicide rate among males was higher than that of females, the rate for females rose to 5.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2023, the highest rate since 1994. Suicides were most common among males aged 45 to 49, and females aged 50 to 54.Meanwhile, the suicide rates in North-West and North-East England were reported to be twice as high as those in London.Keith Baker, a social scientist at Glasgow Caledonian University, told Xinhua that the cost of living crisis is one of the contributing factors."It's still the same underlying problems: the cost of living, the difficulty in finding work, not just any work, but work that provides a sense of pride and purpose," Baker said. "Part of the issue is that men often avoid discussing health issues, especially mental health. This problem is pervasive, and we haven't truly addressed it."Baker added that he was not surprised that the highest rates were in Northern England, which includes traditionally poorer and working-class areas."These regions haven't been well-supported by the government in terms of social services and support networks," he explained, noting that the closure of traditional working men's clubs has cut off a vital source of support for men facing challenges.Baker underlined the need for political action to address the issue of suicide. "I don't think the complete cut to the winter fuel payment is a good example of support," he said."We have long waiting times in the NHS for mental health services. It can take months to get help, yet providing immediate support and reassurance to someone in crisis can make all the difference," Baker added, emphasizing the importance of timely intervention.Vahe Nafilyan, head of data and analysis for social care and health at the ONS, said: "Suicide leaves a devastating impact on individuals, families, and communities, and we will continue to monitor suicide registrations closely."He added: "Many people feel they've been discarded by the time they reach 40 or 45, with very few opportunities to retrain. The decline of lifelong learning and the disappearance of adult education colleges have only worsened this situation."WARSAW - The Polish government has approved its 2025 budget, allocating nearly PLN 190 billion ($49.3 billion) for defense, a historic high.The spending represents 4.7 percent of Poland's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025 with a robust increase in defense spending and key investments in infrastructure.During a press conference held on Wednesday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk outlined the major aspects of the budget, highlighting the government's commitment to national defense and security.The budget also includes provisions for a real increase in the minimum wage and the initiation of critical infrastructure projects, particularly in the energy and railway sectors.In addition, the budget allocates PLN 222 billion ($57.6 billion) to healthcare, representing a significant increase from the previous year.Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski, who also spoke at the press conference, noted that the budget was formulated amid accelerating economic growth. He projected a GDP growth rate of 3.1 percent for 2024 and 3.9 percent for 2025.He further outlined expectations for increased public and private investments, along with a state budget deficit of PLN 289 billion ($74.9 billion) in 2025.France is to try out a ban on mobile phones at school for students aged 15 and under in an effort to give youngsters a "digital pause".The restriction will be tried out in 200 schools and could go nationwide next year and involves students handing over phones at the start of the day.The initiative goes one step further than a previous limitation introduced in 2018, which saw students allowed to keep their phones on them at school, but not allowed to use them.A report published earlier this year by a commission set up by President Emmanuel Macron expressed concern at the negative impacts of overexposure to screens, which it said was causing damage, not just to the children in question but society as a whole."All the experts say that screen addiction is the breeding ground for all kinds of problems — harassment, violence, dropping out of school," said Macron.The report noted what it said was "a very clear consensus on the direct and indirect negative effects of digital devices on sleep, on being sedentary, a lack of physical activity, and the risk of being overweight and even obese … as well as on sight", and said children under the age of 11 should not have phones at all."Parents, teachers, content creators, administrations — it is the whole of society that must get involved," the report added.Servane Mouton, a neurologist who served on the commission, said the phone "must (be) put … in its place," especially when it comes to how very young children are first made aware of the device."We have to teach parents once again how to play with their children," she added.But some groups have raised questions over the organizational practicalities of hundreds of children handing in and collecting phones each day, and David Lelong, from the teachers' union SE-UNSA, questioned its effectiveness when speaking to television news channel BFM TV."We are not convinced that cyber bullying between students will decrease with this measure, as we know that the majority of cyber bullying happens after class," he said.Bans on phones in schools have long been mooted in countries across Europe, but never fully imposed, with varying limitations put in place instead.In Germany, the use of mobile phones and digital devices in classrooms is confined only to educational purposes, and in the United Kingdom the previous government issued guidance, but said the imposition of rules should be a matter for individual schools and teachers. Spain too has resisted a full ban, but there are some regional restrictions in place, while schools in Portugal have specific phone-free days.Italy was one of the first countries to ban phones for all school age groups in 2007, only to reverse the ruling in 2017, then reimpose it five years later. The United Kingdom's prime minister began a two-day visit to Germany and France on Wednesday with high hopes of resetting his country's difficult relationship with some of its nearest neighbors.Keir Starmer started his trip by meeting President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany's head of state, before holding key talks with Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The UK leader was set to move on to France for talks with President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday.Starmer, who became the UK's prime minister in July after the Labour Party swept to power in a general election, described his visit as a "once-in-a-generation opportunity to reset our relationship with Europe"."We must turn a corner on Brexit and fix the broken relationships left behind by the previous government," he said, in reference to the UK's 2020 exit from the European Union.He added that he hoped the UK would be able to achieve "genuine, ambitious partnerships" with Germany and France "that deliver for the British people".And he noted that strengthening the UK's relationship with Germany and France would be "crucial, not only in tackling the global problem of illegal migration, but also in boosting economic growth across the continent and, crucially, in the UK".New deal proposedA proposed partnership with Germany was the major issue on the table on Wednesday.The deal, which is likely to be finalized next year, would call for more cooperation in trade, defense, and illegal migration, and could go some way toward restoring the close cooperation the countries enjoyed when the UK was a member of the EU.A spokesperson for the UK government told the BBC the deal would also cover other areas where increased collaboration would be beneficial, including market access for companies, cooperation in science and technology, and partnerships in clean energy, supply-chain resilience, and biodiversity.Nils Schmid, a foreign affairs spokesman for Scholz's Social Democratic Party, said on BBC Radio 4's Today program that the two leaders are in broad agreement on how UK-EU relations should look in the years ahead."There is a constant push by the German government to bring the UK closer to Europe and to facilitate cooperation between Great Britain and the European Union in as many fields as possible, ranging from trade to student mobility rights to defense," Schmid told the broadcaster."And then, of course, there's also the idea of not only preparing the ground for an EU-UK agreement, but also to strengthen the bilateral ties between Germany and Great Britain."One part of a future deal between the countries could include easier cross-border access for young people, Schmid added.Starmer and Scholz have met several times since Starmer came to power, including at a NATO summit in the United States and at the European Political Community summit in England, both in July.After leaving Germany, Starmer was expected to attend the opening ceremony of the Paris Paralympics on Wednesday evening.He was also expected to meet representatives from Siemens Energy and Rheinmetall and investors from Thales, Eutelsat, Mistral AI and Sanofi during the trip.PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games open on Wednesday evening at Place de la Concorde.About 4,400 athletes from a record 168 delegations will participate in the 11-day Games across 22 sports, with Eritrea, Kiribati and Kosovo making their Paralympic debuts.China has sent 284 athletes - 126 males and 158 females - to compete in 302 events over 19 sports, with 95 being first-time Paralympians.  PARIS - The CEO of Telegram Pavel Durov was charged on Wednesday by the French judiciary with a litany of violations related to the messaging app but allowed to go free while being banned from leaving the country.Durov was granted conditional release against a bail of five million euros on the condition he must report to a police station twice a week as well as remain in France, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement following an hours-long hearing with two investigating magistrates.AFPBERLIN -- The latest economic barometer fell to 83.4 points in August, marking a nearly four-point decline from July and moving further away from the neutral 100-point mark that measures average economic growth, the Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) said on Wednesday.The latest indicators, complied regularly by DIW Berlin to assess the current economic trend in Germany, suggest that German economic outlook for the third quarter remains bleak, with little to no expected increase in economic output."The bumpy global economic development, continues to slow the German export economy, which in turn makes companies hesitant to invest," said Geraldine Dany-Knedlik, head of the Forecasting and Economic Policy Department at DIW Berlin,Despite an initiated interest rate turnaround, interest rates remain high. "Only private consumption might contribute somewhat to stabilizing economic output this quarter, thanks to stable inflation rates and continued rising incomes," Dany-Knedlik added.The German industrial sector remains under significant pressure, with production stagnating at a low level. According to ifo economic surveys, industrial companies have barely increased production this quarter, with shrinking order backlogs and a deteriorating business climate in the manufacturing sector for the third consecutive month."The German industrial economy is still not doing well," noted Laura Pagenhardt, a DIW economic expert. "Companies in Germany are currently unable to benefit from the European Central Bank's interest rate turnaround; demand is stagnating, and investment remains weak."The services sector, while performing better than industry, also saw a decline in sentiment in August, particularly regarding future business expectations. Despite stable inflation and rising incomes, stagnating economic development is dampening consumer confidence. Many households are opting to save rather than spend, leading to a contraction in private consumption in the second quarter.The labor market is also feeling the strain of the weak economy, with seasonally adjusted unemployment rising and the number of job vacancies falling. Overall, employment growth is slowing, further complicating the economic situation in Germany.LONDON -- Three people were killed on Wednesday in a road collision at a seaside town in Wales, the United Kingdom, local police confirmed.North Wales Police said it responded to the accident in the town of Beaumaris, Anglesey, in the early afternoon. Beaumaris, located on the island of Anglesey off the northwest coast of Wales, is a popular holiday destination."Sadly, three people were pronounced deceased at the scene," the police said, adding that an investigation into the accident is underway.Chief Inspector Caroline Mullen-Hurst said, "We are appealing to anybody who witnessed the incident that hasn't already spoken to officers or anybody who might have dashcam footage, to please get in touch."The highway of the accident is closed for some time, therefore people are advised to avoid the area.BRUSSELS - Two environmental Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have taken the European Commission to court on Tuesday, urging the Commission to revise its greenhouse gas emissions targets for the bloc's member states from now until 2030.CAN Europe and the Global Legal Action Network said the annual emissions limits through 2030 for each European Union (EU) country in the buildings, agriculture, waste, small industry, and transport sectors were unlawful, according to a press release issued by CAN Europe.These sectors account for about 57 percent of the total 27-country bloc's greenhouse gas emissions.The EU set a 40 percent aggregate emissions reduction target, compared to 1990 levels, for these sectors and an economy-wide target of 55 percent less emissions for the EU as a whole.The NGOs argued that the EU's overall climate ambition remains alarmingly off-track from the 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming limit set out by the Paris Agreement.To address this, the EU must enable more ambitious emission cuts in the near term and achieve at least a 65 percent reduction in gross emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, the NGOs said.The case was initially presented in February 2024, following the European Commission's refusal to reassess annual emissions allocations for its member states until 2030.A hearing at the EU General Court could potentially be held in the second half of 2025 and a judgment released in early 2026, the release said.French President Emmanuel Macron said the arrest of Russian-born Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was part of an ongoing judicial investigation rather than a political move after the French action triggered a heated debate about free speech and protests from Russia.The first French official confirmation on Monday came two days after the 39-year-old Durov was detained on Saturday night after his private jet landed at Paris-Le Bourget Airport.French authorities extended Durov's detention on Sunday for allegedly not curbing offenses such as fraud, sexual exploitation, crimes against minors, drug trafficking, organized crime and promotion of terrorism on the Telegram messaging platform, French media reported.The billionaire, who holds multiple citizenships, including from France, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, could be detained up to a maximum of 96 hours for questioning and then the judge can decide to press charges or set him free.Telegram said in a statement on Sunday that its CEO "has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe".It said Telegram "abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act, or DSA — its moderation is within industry standards and constantly improving". The DSA is a regulation adopted in the European Union in 2022 to address illegal content, transparent advertising and disinformation."It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for abuse of that platform," the statement said.Durov backedRussia has come to Durov's defense by criticizing France for free speech double standards and said Durov should be accorded his rights. The Russian embassy in Paris said it had demanded access to Durov but "the French side is refusing to cooperate".Telegram is popular among Russian speakers.On her personal Telegram account, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said 26 NGOs "condemned the Russian court's decision to block Telegram" in 2018."Do you think this time they'll appeal to Paris and demand Durov's release?" she asked.Macron, who faces domestic political chaos following his party's defeat in the July parliamentary election, said France is "deeply committed to freedom of expression and communication", but such freedoms are "upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life".Macron has been a user of Telegram since the early days of his 2017 presidential campaign. The encrypted messaging app is popular among his supporters.The European Commission has distanced itself from the case with a spokesperson telling the media on Monday that Durov's arrest on suspicion of allowing criminal activity on his platform has nothing to do with Telegram's obligations under the DSA.Telegram has more than 900 million active monthly users globally, but its claim in February of 41 million monthly average users in the EU means it has not passed the 45 million threshold for a Very Large Online Platform under DSA and is subject to the strictest transparency rules.Ron Paul, former US Congressman from Texas, said on Monday that the arrest is "a huge blow to free speech across the globe".Agencies contributed to this story. Ride-hailing app Uber says it will appeal against what it called an "unjustified" fine by data protection authorities in the Netherlands, the third such punishment since 2018, over the transfer of driver data from European servers to the United States.On Monday, the Dutch Data Protection Authority, or DPA, called the transfer of information including identity documents, license and location information, and even criminal and medical records over a two-year period a "serious violation" of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, also known as GDPR.The company was fined 290 million euros ($323 million), which comes on the heels of previous data-related fines of 600,000 euros in 2018, and 10 million euros last year.The investigation began after a complaint by French drivers, and under EU rules, any such investigation of a company operating in multiple EU countries must be conducted in the country where its main office is situated, which in the case of Uber in Europe, is the Netherlands."In Europe, the GDPR protects the fundamental rights of people, by requiring businesses and governments to handle personal data with due care", said Aleid Wolfsen, chairman of the DPA."But sadly, this is not self-evident outside Europe. Think of governments that can tap data on a large scale. That is why businesses are usually obliged to take additional measures if they store personal data of Europeans outside the EU."Uber did not meet the requirements of the GDPR to ensure the level of protection to the data with regard to transfers to the US. That is very serious."The DPA also found that the company's process to allow drivers to access personal data was "unnecessarily complicated."Uber spokesperson Caspar Nixon told Reuters that the decision was "flawed" and the financial penalty was "extraordinary"."Uber's cross-border data transfer process was compliant with GDPR during a 3-year period of immense uncertainty between the EU and US," he added, saying that the company was confident "common sense will prevail" in its appeal against the punishment.Uber has been involved in several high-profile data breaches over the years, and in May 2023 the company's former chief security officer was sentenced to three years' probation for attempting to covering up a breach involving millions of customer records that occurred in 2014.In 2016, hackers again breached the company's system, and in September 2022 there was what the company called "a cybersecurity incident".PARIS - The United Arab Emirates and Russia have submitted requests for consular access to Telegram messenger CEO Pavel Durov, who was arrested Sunday in Paris over his alleged refusal to cooperate in the investigation of crimes related to the app.The UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said early on Tuesday that it was "closely following" Durov's case and had "submitted a request to the French government to provide him with all consular services urgently".Russia's embassy in Paris had earlier referred a note to the French foreign ministry demanding consular access to Durov, the TASS news agency quoted Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying.The Associated Press reported that Durov, who was born in Russia, is a citizen of France, Russia, the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, and the United Arab Emirates.Paris Public Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Monday that Durov was arrested in connection with a judicial investigation of 12 criminal counts, including one related to cybercrime."Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act -- its moderation is within industry standards and constantly improving," Telegram said in a statement Sunday evening."Telegram's CEO Pavel Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe," it said. "It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for abuse of that platform."After the arrest of the Telegram CEO, the owner of the US social media platform X, Elon Musk, and former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden both condemned his arrest on Sunday.Under French law, Durov can be held for 96 hours until Wednesday evening.Seven weeks after a surprise snap election, French President Emmanuel Macron has begun consultations at the Elysee Palace to resolve the ensuing political crisis and to appoint a new prime minister.In the July elections, no party won an outright majority in the National Assembly, resulting in a hung parliament. Outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has been leading a caretaker government that managed the country through the Paris Olympics.The next prime minister will face significant challenges, including securing parliamentary approval for the 2025 budget, especially as France faces pressure from the European Commission and bond markets to reduce its deficit.Opposition figures have strongly criticized Macron for the delay, with some describing his approach as "a denial of democracy".After extensive discussions, the left-wing New Popular Front, or NFP, the largest group after the election — announced they want 37-year-old economist Lucie Castets as the new prime minister.The meeting between Macron and the NFP on Friday morning lasted about an hour and a half, French media reported. On arrival at the Elysee Palace, Castets stressed the importance of respecting the election results and proposed a solution based on stability.After the meeting, Olivier Faure, the leader of the Socialist Party and part of the left alliance, said Macron had not provided a "specific date "for appointing a government but assured that it would happen soon.He also said there would be no division within the NFP. It is up to the leading coalition to form a government and find compromises.Later on Friday, Macron met with representatives from his centrist Ensemble alliance, the conservative Republicans, or LR. After the meeting, Annie Genevard from the LR rejected the idea of a coalition with any other parties.Macron also discussed with the Liot group, which includes members of parliament from the center-left, center and center-right, as well as the radical Left group. However, none of these groups made any public statements after their consultations with Macron.Meeting with Le PenOn Monday, the president hosted far-right figurehead Marine Le Pen for rare talks, AFP reported. The three-time National Rally, or RN, presidential candidate called after the meeting for an extraordinary session of parliament so MPs would be able to immediately depose any new government in a confidence vote."I don't want a prime minister to have a month to implement by decree a toxic policy that would be dangerous for the French people," Le Pen said.Laurent Jacobelli, an MP and spokesman for the RN, has told French TV BFM that his party would censure any government that includes hard-left France Unbowed or Green ministers. "Those who abuse democracy have no place at Matignon or in any ministry," he said on Friday. Matignon refers to the official residence of the French prime minister.Another RN lawmaker, Julien Odoul, told Radio Monte Carlo on Friday that he believes it is impossible to govern France "without the National Rally" and the "11 million French people" who voted for the RN, emphasizing they "are not second-class citizens".Beyond the RN, Macron's alliance and the LR also threatened to censure any government that includes ministers from France Unbowed.Meanwhile, Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Unbowed, has been playing a strategic game. Speaking on French national TV TF1 on Saturday, he challenged "the leaders of the three Macronist parties and the right", asking whether they would renounce censure of a Castets government if it did not include any France Unbowed ministers."If you say no, we'll know the real issue isn't the presence of (France Unbowed) ministers but the NFP program itself," he added.Faure said Melenchon is setting the stage for France Unbowed to support a Castets government without participating directly. "The excuse of (France Unbowed) ministers' presence no longer holds."The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.Prosecutors in Italy say the sinking of the superyacht Bayesian off the coast of Sicily, that left seven people dead, could results in charges of manslaughter and negligent shipwreck.Speaking to journalists, Ambrogio Cartosio, public prosecutor in the town of Termini Imerese, where the 56-meter long yacht owned by British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch went down, said "persons unknown" were being looked at, and names could soon be made public."It could be that we add someone to the list of people being investigated even way before the recovery of the boat," he said."It seems to me likely that offences of negligent shipwreck and manslaughter have been committed. It's about establishing who they can be ascribed to."The yacht had 22 people on board when it was caught up in extremely violent winds during the early hours of August 19, and 15 people, including all but one of the crew, managed to escape. The other seven people on board, including Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter Hannah, and Jonathan Bloomer, the chairman of Morgan Stanley international bank, died.The Financial Times newspaper reports that the boat went down rear first, suggesting that compartments at the back of the boat may have become flooded.Deputy prosecutor Raffaele Cammarano said the boat had been caught up in a "truly rapid, sudden" storm, and there are reports that the wind reached force 12 on the Beaufort scale, which is hurricane strength. In his only public comment so far, the ship's captain James Cutfield said "we didn't see it coming" when talking about the change of weather, but the chief of the company that built the boat, Giovanni Costantino, told the BBC human error must be a factor in what had happened."At the back of the boat, a hatch must have been left open," he said, "but also perhaps a side entrance for water to have poured inside."Before the storm, the captain should have closed every opening, lifted anchor, turned on the engine, pointed into the wind and lowered the keel."The Bayesian was a model for many other vessels because of its stability and exceptionally high performance… there was absolutely no problem with it. If water hadn't surged in, it was unsinkable."The vessel, whose tanks are still full of fuel, is now lying 49 meters below the surface and to avoid damage to the boat caused by the water that has built up inside it, the recovery process could take as long as two months and cost up to 15 million euros ($16.7 million)."This is the most delicate part of the operation and needs to be done very, very slowly, because the Bayesian is full of water," marine salvage engineer Nick Sloane told the Daily Telegraph newspaper, adding that around said 40 expert divers would be needed."The important thing is that when the yacht reaches the surface the sea must be calm. So they'll have to carefully check the weather forecasts. The yacht should be recovered exactly as it is, in one piece, with the aim of maintaining it as intact as possible." GENEVA - The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday launched a global drive to tackle human-to-human transmission of mpox.The Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan will run from September 2024 to February 2025, requiring 135 million US dollars in funding. By coordinating global, regional, and national efforts, it aims to enhance surveillance and response strategies, ensure equitable access to diagnostics and vaccines, reduce animal-to-human transmission, and empower communities in outbreak control.The vaccination plan targets those most at risk, such as close contacts of cases and healthcare workers, to break transmission chains. It will focus on providing strategic leadership and guidance, and ensuring access to medical treatment for vulnerable groups in affected regions."The mpox outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries can be controlled, and can be stopped," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.According to a WHO statement, a funding appeal will be launched shortly.LONDON -- Hundreds of firefighters tackled two fires in high-rise tower blocks in London on Monday, the London Fire Brigade (LFB) said.According to LFB, a fire at a block of flats in Dagenham, east London, was reported at 2:44 am and the whole building was affected by the fire.More than 80 people were evacuated. Two people were taken to hospital.The fire was under control by 11:13 am."We will now begin a full investigation into the fire and its cause," said Andy Roe, the commissioner of LFB. "This was a very dynamic and challenging incident, and we know there will undoubtedly be concerns around the fire safety issues present within the building and this will form part of our report."In a second high-rise fire on the same day, ten fire engines and around 70 firefighters tackled a flat fire in a building in Blackwall, east London.The fire was first reported at 1:28 p.m. and was brought under control by 2:50 pm, with no reports of any injuries.Due to the large amount of smoke produced in the Blackwall fire, LFB has advised those in the local area to keep windows and doors closed and avoid the incident location if possible. PARIS - Paris public prosecutor on Monday announced the charges on which the Telegram founder Pavel Durov was arrested in Paris a day before, in a global first for a messaging service.According to Paris Public Prosecutor Laure Beccuau, the Telegram founder and chief executive officer (CEO) is accused of 12 criminal offenses, including failing to take action against Telegram users involved in cyberbullying, sharing pedophilic content, and the glorification of terrorism.Durov can now be detained for up to 96 hours until Aug 28, Beccuau said. He is subject to the criminal procedure for organized crime offenses, including illegal transactions in an organized group, possessing pornographic images of minors, and offering or making available pornographic images of minors.Beccuau said the arrest "comes in the context of a judicial investigation opened on July 8, 2024". It also concerns "refusal to communicate, at the request of competent authorities, information or documents necessary for carrying out and operating interceptions allowed by law," the Paris prosecutor added.The Russian Embassy in Paris has begun working on the case, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Sunday, adding that it is Russian diplomats' duty to respond to cases involving the detention of Russian citizens abroad.Responding to the arrest, the Telegram group said on its X account that the company "abides by European Union (EU) laws, including the Digital Services Act". "It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for abuse of that platform," it added.Tech giant and owner of the US social media platform X Elon Musk, along with former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, condemned this arrest on Sunday, citing a violation of the freedom of speech.Following a tweet with the tag #FreePavel on X, Musk wrote several other posts stressing the importance of protecting free speech and democracy.Meanwhile, Snowden said on X that the arrest of Durov is "an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association"."I am surprised and deeply saddened that (French President Emmanuel) Macron has descended to the level of taking hostages as a means for gaining access to private communications. It lowers not only France, but the world," he said.However, French President Macron said on X on Monday that the arrest of Durov is "in no way a political decision", calling it "part of an ongoing judicial investigation".The French head of state stressed that his country is "deeply" committed to freedom of expression."In a state governed by the rule of law, freedoms are upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life, to protect citizens and respect their fundamental rights," he added.According to the French daily Le Figaro, Durov's arrest warrant was issued by a special unit within the French Interior Minister tasked with combating crimes against minors, in coordination with various investigative services.Durov, also holding French citizenship, founded Telegram in 2013. The messaging app allows up to 200,000 members per chat group and claims not to collect users' information or censor content.With approximately 900 million subscribers, it is now one of the world's leading messaging platforms and influential in Russia. It has become a critical source of information during the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) will be held in Vladivostok from September 3 to 6. The event is organised by the Roscongress Foundation. TV BRICS International Media Network is a media partner for the event.This year, the main theme of the forum is "Far East 2030". The guests and participants will focus on the development of the Russian Far East and its integration into the economic space of the Asia-Pacific region."Forum guests will have to discuss the image of the Far East's future and outline new directions for its development. The EEF-2024 programme includes about 100 business events on the widest range of topics formulated taking into account the development of technology and the changing structure of the global economy, " said Anton Kobyakov, adviser to the President of the Russian Federation.Yury Trutnev, Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District, notes the role of the EEF as a platform for developing support measures for the Far East, such as advanced development territories, the Free Port of Vladivostok (FPV), the Far Eastern Hectare programme and many others."The EEF has become one of the tools for the development of the Far Eastern macro-region. Politicians and representatives of business circles in Russia and dozens of other countries are already well aware that the most important issues of development of the Far Eastern Federal District and the entire Asia-Pacific region are discussed at the EEF. Today, the world is going through a complex stage of development, and a new structure of international relations is being formed. The Forum is becoming a platform for strengthening international ties, " Yury Trutnev said.In his opinion, the growing role of the EEF also corresponds to the priorities of Russia's foreign policy, for which the Asia-Pacific region is becoming one of the key areas.The forum's business programme is divided into thematic blocks corresponding to the main socio-economic trends relevant both for Russia and its partners in the Asia-Pacific Region and other regions of the world.The events of the New Contours of International Cooperation block will discuss multilateral partnerships within the framework of such associations as BRICS, SCO, and EAEU. Among the main topics are energy transition, the development of digital currency, and the modernisation of infrastructure. Innovations will be the topic of a separate section, "Technologies to Ensure Independence". Discussions are planned on cyber security, robotics, and the and the new materials industry. Another important track, "Financial Value System," is devoted to intellectual property protection and commercial arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region.Other parts of the forum are devoted mainly to domestic Russian topics. The Far Eastern Russia block will discuss the development of the Far Eastern Federal District, including agriculture, tourism, small business, and fisheries. Youth support and human capital development are included in the programme "People, Education, and Patriotism". In its turn, the "Master Plans: From Architecture to Economy" direction is devoted to the tools of integrated territorial development. Modernisation of the infrastructure framework of the Far East will be discussed at the "Transport and Logistics: New Routes" block. Special attention will be paid to the development of the Northern Sea Route and regional aviation.EEF-2024 will be not only a discussion platform but also a space for business meetings between Russian entrepreneurs and their counterparts from China, India, and ASEAN countries. In addition, events dedicated to cooperation through international organisations and associations are planned. Among them are the BRICS Creative Business Forum and the APEC International Conference on Cooperation in Higher Education.EEF participants and guests will also enjoy a cultural and sports programme presented by the Falcon Day International Forum, the Far East Street Exhibition, and the EEF Sport Games.The Eastern Economic Forum has been held regularly since 2015. In 2023, 2,400 business representatives from 62 countries took part in the EEF.TV BRICSGerman police have arrested a suspect for Friday's knife rampage in the western city of Solingen, an attack that killed three people and injured eight others.The three people who were stabbed to death were identified as two men aged 67 and 56 and a woman aged 56. Police said the attacker appeared to have deliberately aimed at the victims' throats.Early on Sunday, Dusseldorf police said in a joint statement with the prosecutor's office that the man arrested "stated that he was responsible for the attack". The statement said he had been arrested before, but gave no details."This person's involvement in the crime is currently being intensively investigated," the statement said.The Islamic State group claimed responsibility on Saturday, saying on Telegram that the attack was "in revenge for Muslims in Palestine and everywhere" and described the man who carried out the attack as a "soldier of the Islamic State".Germany is Israel's second-largest weapons supplier and the German government is regarded as deeply biased toward Israel in the current conflict between Israel and Palestine.Officials had earlier said a 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion he knew about the planned attack and failed to inform authorities, but that he was not the attacker. Later police made a second arrest of a man at a refugee center close to the site of the attack.The indiscriminate attack took place on Friday evening in the Fronhof market square in Solingen where live bands were playing during the Festival of Diversity to mark the city's 650th anniversary.The Bild newspaper reported that the man arrested was covered in blood when he approached officers just after 11 pm and said, "I'm the one you are looking for." Bild and news magazine Spiegel reported that the suspect had given himself up to the officers.He had reportedly been hiding in a backyard since the crime took place. Spiegel reported the suspect as a 26-year-old Syrian national who came to Germany in 2022 and applied for asylum in Bielefeld, about 150 kilometers northeast of Solingen."We are full of shock and grief," Solingen Mayor Tim-Oliver Kurzbach told reporters.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the attack "a terrible event that has shocked me greatly". "We must not accept something like this in our society … The full force of the law must be applied here," he said.In another development, French police said they have arrested a man suspected of starting fires and causing an explosion outside a synagogue early on Saturday in the southwest of the country.French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said "the alleged perpetrator" has been detained.French President Emmanuel Macron said on X that the attack was a "terrorist act".Agencies contributed to this story.BRUSSELS -- Several major airlines in European countries announced the suspension of flights to and from Israel and Lebanon Sunday following escalating hostilities between the two Mideast countries.According to French news channel BFMTV, Air France has decided to suspend its flights to Israel's Tel Aviv and Lebanon's Beirut until at least Monday due to growing tensions in the region."Today's and tomorrow's flights are canceled," an Air France spokesperson said, noting that the suspension could be extended after the company conducts a new assessment on Monday.Similarly, British Airways announced a suspension of flights to and from Israel's Tel Aviv until Wednesday."Due to the escalating situation in the region, Wizz Air is temporarily suspending flights to and from Israel on the 25th of August," Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air also posted on its website.Greek flag carrier Aegean Airlines canceled several flights to Israel and Beirut on Sunday. Its official website listed three flights to Tel Aviv and two flights to Beirut, including one scheduled for Monday, as canceled.German airline giant Lufthansa extended its suspension of flights to Beirut until Sept. 30, and to Tel Aviv and Tehran until Sept. 2.Israeli and Hezbollah forces engaged in extensive exchanges of fire early Sunday morning along the Israel-Lebanon border, marking a significant escalation in their longstanding conflict.Hezbollah claimed that it had launched hundreds of missiles into Israel in retaliation for the killing of its commander, Fouad Shokor, in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut last month. In response, Israel reported conducting numerous preemptive airstrikes targeting Hezbollah's rocket launchers in southern Lebanon.Following the most severe exchange of fire between the two sides in the Middle East, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defense Secretary John Healey both called their respective counterparts in Israel on Sunday, urging for an immediate ceasefire in the region, according to their posts on X, formerly known as Twitter.In early August, as tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border began to mount, many European countries urged their citizens to leave Lebanon. Meanwhile, some European carriers, including Air France and Romania's national airline TAROM, suspended their flights, although they later resumed services before this latest escalation.The Russia-born giant panda Katyusha celebrated her first birthday on Saturday with special cakes, a cheerful party and best wishes from Moscow citizens.Her keepers at the Moscow Zoo offered special desserts that took the shape of a large multitier cake made from her favorite bamboo and leaves. At the top of a cake, zoo staff members placed one bamboo shoot denoting the cub's age.Katyusha was also offered some desserts made from carrots, fruits and steamed cornbread.An improvised bamboo TV was also made in Katyusha's enclosure with a painted panda "leading" a news program.Katyusha was born at the Moscow Zoo in the late summer of last year, the first panda to be born in Russia. Her parents, Ru Yi and Ding Ding, giant pandas from China, met in the spring and immediately fell in love with each other, said Svetlana Akulova, director of Moscow Zoo.Ru Yi and Ding Ding arrived in Moscow in 2019.According to an agreement, two specialists from China will stay in the zoo for at least 120 days a year for 15 years, supervising and training Russian employees.Series of eventsIn order to celebrate the big event, the first birthday of the giant panda born in Russia, the zoo will be holding panda-themed workshops, excursions, quests, lectures, film screenings and traditional Chinese performances, in which everyone can take part, Akulova said."For example, guests could learn Chinese dance, try Chinese calligraphy and even take photos with a large Chinese dragon," she said, adding the Moscow Zoo has been decorated in Chinese style for the whole week with red lanterns and other Chinese elements.On Tuesday, there will be a lecture called Giant pandas — Mysterious guests from the East.Meanwhile, the film Katyusha — the first in Russia will be screened in the Moscow Zoo library, Akulova said.Chinese Ambassador to Russia Zhang Hanhui thanked the Moscow Zoo as well as experts from both countries for taking good care of the panda family.Zhang took part in a stamp-release ceremony on Saturday at the zoo. The postage stamp, dedicated to Katyusha and her parents, shows the healthy development of the panda family at the Moscow Zoo and reflects the friendship between China and Russia, he said.Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin called Katyusha the national favorite panda. At birth she weighed only 150 grams. Now, she is a 38-kilogram cub. Katyusha deftly climbs the logs, slides down the slide, and tries to repeat everything after her mother Ding Ding, Sobyanin said on his social media account.He noted that people come to the Moscow Zoo from all over the country to see the panda. About 15,000 people visit the Chinese Fauna Pavilion every day.MOSCOW -- Russia's defense ministry said Saturday that 115 Russian servicemen captured in the Kursk region were returned from the territory controlled by Ukraine as part of an exchange deal."In exchange, 115 prisoners of war of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were transferred," the ministry said, adding that the United Arab Emirates provided mediation efforts during the swap.All the exchanged Russian military personnel are currently in Belarus and will be sent to Russia for treatment and rehabilitation in medical institutions of the ministry, it said.MOSCOW/KYIV — Russia and Ukraine both reported new battlefield gains on Thursday, with Moscow saying that the Ukrainian drone attack on a nuclear power station was "an act of nuclear terrorism".The Ukrainian defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the development.The nuclear plant is located in the Kursk region of western Russia, where fierce fighting has raged since Ukrainian forces launched a surprise incursion on Aug 6.TASS quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying that it was an "act of nuclear terrorism" that required an immediate response from the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA.The head of the IAEA said on Thursday he will visit the Kursk power plant next week to assess the situation after Russia informed the agency of attempted attacks on the facility earlier in the day.IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said in a statement that he will assess the situation on-site and will discuss modalities for further activities needed to evaluate the nuclear safety and security conditions of the plant during his upcoming visit.Authorities in Kursk said they had begun installing concrete shelters to help protect civilians.In another development, Moscow said its troops had taken control of the village of Mezhove in the Donetsk region, and that they had beaten back an attempt by a Ukrainian force to infiltrate its border in a different region to Kyiv's Aug 6 incursion.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the seizure of a new village that he did not name, and said the incursion had helped reduce Russian shelling of the northeastern Sumy region.Also in Kyiv, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in the capital city on Friday, where he was due to meet with Zelensky. Officials in India and Ukraine said the visit was expected to focus on boosting economic ties and cooperation in defense, science and technology.Ukrainian media reported that Modi met with representatives of the Indian diaspora after arriving.Meanwhile in the United States, President Joe Biden's administration will send about $125 million in new military aid to Ukraine, officials said on Thursday.US officials said the latest package of aid includes air defense missiles, munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Javelins and an array of other anti-armor missiles.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid has not been publicly announced. The formal announcement could come as soon as Friday, which is the eve of Ukraine's Independence Day.The weapons are being provided through presidential drawdown authority, which means they are taken from Pentagon stockpiles and can be delivered more quickly.Agencies - XinhuaBERLIN -- At least three people were killed and several others injured in a knife attack in the western German city of Solingen on Friday evening, German media reported.The attack took place as a festival was underway to mark the 650th anniversary of the city's founding.At present, rescue workers are working on those injured.Some 80,000 people were reportedly present for the celebration. At about 10 p.m. local time, a man with a knife attacked people attending the event.Police then issued a major alert and a shooting alert. The celebration was immediately cancelled, and visitors were asked to leave.Police sources said no arrests have been made yet.BERLIN - Meng Meng, an 11-year-old female giant panda at Zoo Berlin, has given birth to twins, zoo authorities announced on Friday."The eagerly awaited second offspring of Meng Meng was born at 13:03 and 14:19 on Thursday in Zoo Berlin's Panda Garden," said the zoo in a press release.Both cubs are doing well and are lovingly cared for by their mum and the experienced panda team around the clock. The cubs weigh 169 g and 136 g and are about 14 cm long."Like other giant bears, giant pandas are born almost naked, deaf, blind and pink. The typical black and white panda markings only develop later. The sexes have not yet been determined with certainty," it said.As giant pandas usually only raise one cub when they give birth to twins, Zoo Berlin has decided to actively assist Meng Meng in raising her cubs in close cooperation with the experts at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding."We are delighted to have two experienced colleagues from the Chengdu Panda Base at our side to look after the cubs. With around 20 births a year, they have much more experience and are better able to assess the cubs' development," said biologist and panda curator Florian Sicks.Meng Meng arrived from China in 2017. In August 2019, she gave birth to the first-ever twin panda cubs, Meng Xiang and Meng Yuan, in Germany. The twins were sent back to China last December.Meng Meng was artificially inseminated on March 26 following intensive observation and careful preparation by an international team of experts.The first signs of a successful pregnancy emerged on Aug 11 when an ultrasound detected two heartbeats. Just 11 days later, the twins were born, following a gestation period of 149 days.The zoo said the now-experienced mother knew what to do immediately after the birth. "I am relieved that the two were born healthy. The little ones seem lively and mum Meng Meng takes great care of her offspring," said Zoo and Tierpark Director Andreas Knieriem.VIENNA - The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Thursday that he will visit the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) next week to assess the situation after Russia informed the agency of attempted attacks on the facility earlier in the day.IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said in a statement that he will assess the situation on site and discuss modalities for further activities needed to evaluate the nuclear safety and security conditions of the Kursk NPP during his upcoming visit.According to the statement, the United Nations nuclear watchdog was informed by Russia earlier on Thursday that "the remains of a drone were found within the territory of the Kursk NPP" and that "the drone was suppressed in the early morning" of that day."The drone fragments were reported to have been located roughly 100 meters from the plant's spent fuel nuclear storage facility," the statement read.Grossi warned that military activities near a nuclear power plant pose a serious risk to nuclear safety and security.With the end of the summer holiday in sight and the Paris Olympic Games having passed, French politicians are once again turning their attention to the business of trying to resolve the issue of who runs the country following the recent snap legislative election.The vote, across two rounds in June and July, was called by President Emmanuel Macron to see off the threat from the far-right National Rally party, or RN.But it was only partly successful as although his own centrist Ensemble coalition won more seats than RN in the National Assembly, the left-wing alliance, known as the New Popular Front, or NFP, ended up with the largest number of seats, but still no overall majority.This means the parliament is divided into three large blocs with major ideological differences, and six weeks since voting finished and the result became clear, the country still has the same cabinet and same prime minister, Gabriel Attal, in a caretaker capacity until a new government can be formed.Macron now faces the challenge of breaking the political logjam, and will start talks, initially with the NFP, on Friday."The appointment of a prime minister will follow on from these consultations and their conclusions," said a statement from the Elysee Palace. Macron, it continued, hoped "to continue to move toward the constitution of the broadest and most stable majority possible in the service of the country".NFP's leading prime ministerial candidate is left-wing economist Lucie Castets, but Macron has made it clear he would prefer someone with a wider base of support who is less likely to prompt a vote of no confidence in the government in the National Assembly.Other contenders include the Socialist Party's Bernard Cazeneuve, who previously served as prime minister from 2016-17 and has significant top-level ministerial experience, or if a more right-wing option is preferred, Xavier Bertrand of the Republicans party.Marine Le Pen and her protege Jordan Bardella, whose far-right National Rally came third in the second round of the legislative elections, will be taking their turn to speak with Macron on Monday, reported the France 24 news website.David Todd, a professor of modern history at Sciences Po University in Paris, told the website that the country is in uncharted political waters, and there is no clear way ahead."There's no precedent in the (post-1958) Fifth Republic to the situation we're in," he said."The current situation can only be provisional — everyone's just getting ready for the next election, whether that's a general or a presidential election. It's not really about running a government, but about running an electoral campaign."BERLIN - A significant increase in illegal migration to Europe was again observed in 2023, with Germany proving to be the main destination country in the European Union (EU), according to a report released Wednesday by the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA).The BKA said that the European Border and Coast Guard Agency reported approximately 380,200 unauthorized border crossings at EU/Schengen external borders last year, which represents the highest annual figure since 2016 and underscores growing pressures on Europe's borders.Within this EU-wide trend, Germany saw a particularly sharp increase. The BKA reported that 266,224 individuals were suspected of unauthorized entry and residence in Germany in 2023, marking a 33.4 percent increase compared to the previous year.A majority of these migrants entering Germany originated from Syria, with 54,207 arrivals, followed by 35,732 from Turkey and 35,370 from Afghanistan. "Many of these individuals depended on smugglers to facilitate their journey into Germany," the report said, adding that around 39,700 people suspected of being smuggled were checked at German borders last year.It also pointed to a disturbing rise in container smuggling. The number of cases doubled to about 1,200, while the number of individuals smuggled in this manner surged nearly fivefold to approximately 17,500."These operations often involved the use of easily rentable vans, which do not require special licenses, making them a preferred choice for smugglers," the BKA said.According to German public broadcaster ZDF, more than 200 escape attempts were reported across the country in 2023 in connection with so-called container smuggling, and one in four resulted in an accident.The increase in smuggling activities has been accompanied by a 26.6 percent rise in the number of registered smuggling suspects in the country and a 60.5 percent increase in the number of smuggling cases.The smuggling groups acted in a way that was increasingly risk-taking, and "ruthless towards the smuggled persons, uninvolved third parties and deployed police forces in order to evade control and thus prosecution," the report said.Messenger services like Telegram and WhatsApp were predominantly used for communication within smuggling networks, the BKA noted. ZDF also reported that smuggling organizations used social media platforms to market their services. Short videos promoting smuggling routes to Germany were actively shared on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. These platforms were also used to recruit drivers for smuggling operations.In light of the growing challenges posed by smuggling crimes, the BKA emphasized the need for enhanced cross-border cooperation among law enforcement authorities in countries of origin, transit, and destination, saying that such collaboration "remains crucial".BELGRADE -- The bodies of ten migrants were recovered after their boat capsized on the Drina River, according to Serbia's Interior Ministry and local media reports on Thursday.The incident occured late Wednesday night when around 30 migrants were taking a boat crossing from Serbia to Bosnia and Herzegovina. 18 people survived the incident, of whom 10 are minors, Serbian police confirmed.The search for the missing is still underway. Serbian police and the emergency situations sector responded promptly after being alerted early Thursday morning.The European Border and Coast Guard Agency, Frontex, reported a significant decrease in illegal border crossings in the Western Balkans during the first half of 2024. The illegal crossings towards EU borders reached 12,407 between January and July 2024, a 75 percent drop compared to the same period last year.Ukraine attacked Moscow on Wednesday with at least 11 drones that were shot down by air defenses in what Russian officials called one of the biggest drone strikes on the capital since its special military operation in Ukraine began in February 2022.The conflict, largely a grinding artillery and drone battle across the fields, forests and villages of eastern Ukraine, escalated on August 6 when Ukraine sent thousands of soldiers over the border into Russia's western Kursk region.For months, Ukraine has also fought an increasingly damaging drone war against the refineries and airfields of Russia, the world's second largest oil exporter, though major drone attacks on the Moscow region - with a population of over 21 million - have been rarer.Russia's defense ministry said its air defenses destroyed a total of 45 drones over Russian territory, including 11 over the Moscow region, 23 over the border region of Bryansk, six over the Belgorod region, three over the Kaluga region and two over the Kursk region.Some of the drones were shot down over the city of Podolsk, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said. The city, located in the Moscow region, is some 38 km south of the Kremlin."This is one of the largest attempts to attack Moscow using drones ever," Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app in the early hours of Wednesday. "The layered defense of Moscow that was created made it possible to successfully repel all the attacks from the enemy UAVs."Along Moscow's boulevards, cafes, restaurants and shops of the capital - which has been carefully insulated from the conflict - were crowded with little signs of concern.Moscow's airports, Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky, limited flights for four hours but restarted normal operations early in the morning, Russia's aviation watchdog said.Sobyanin said that according to preliminary information, there were no injuries or damage reported in the aftermath of the attacks. There were also no casualties or damage reported following the attack on Bryansk in Russia's southwest, the governor of the region, Alexander Bogomaz, wrote on Telegram.Ukrainian military's General Staff said in a statement that it struck an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system based in Russia's southern Rostov region overnight.Rostov governor Vasily Golubev said air defense forces had destroyed a Ukraine-launched missile over his region, but Russia's defense ministry made no mention of the incident in its daily statement on destroyed air weapons.In Russia's north Murmansk region, local authorities issued a drone attack warning on Wednesday, as local airports imposed flight restrictions following unverified reports of an unmanned aircraft being shot down.Shortly before the announcement, civil aviation authorities introduced flight restrictions at airports in the regional capital, Murmansk, and the town of Apatity.No drone attacks have previously been reported in the Murmansk region before. If confirmed, Wednesday's reported drone downing would mark the furthest a Ukrainian drone has flown into Russian territory.Russia meanwhile is advancing in eastern Ukraine, where it controls about 18 percent of the territory, and battling to repel Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region, the biggest foreign attack on Russian territory since World War II.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday Ukraine had not consulted Berlin about its August 6 shock incursion into Russia and that he expected that military operation to be limited in time and territory."Ukraine has prepared its military operation in the Kursk region very secretly and without feedback, which is certainly due to the situation," Scholz said. "This is a very limited operation in terms of space and probably also in terms of time."Separately, Scholz said Germany would continue to be what he said was Ukraine's biggest supporter in Europe after controversy in recent days over what some have called wavering German support for Kyiv over domestic politicking.MOSCOW -- Russia thwarted an attempted incursion by a Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group in the Klimovsky district of the Bryansk region Wednesday, regional governor Alexander Bogomaz said on his Telegram channel.Bogomaz confirmed that the breach was successfully prevented by the forces of the country's Federal Security Service and units of the Russian armed forces. The Ukrainian group sustained fire damage during the encounter, he said."The situation at the clash site has now been stabilized and is under the control of the regional operational headquarters," said Bogomaz.Citizens of the United Kingdom between the ages of 18 and 70 traveling to the European Union next year will have to pay a 7-euro ($7.80) visa-waiver fee, after the bloc finally announced May as the introduction date for its long-delayed new entry and exit system.The system, originally supposed to have been introduced in 2022, includes checks such as fingerprints and facial scans as security measures to reduce the risk of people traveling on fake passports.The European Travel Information and Authorisation System, or ETIAS, which comes into effect in November, requires citizens from visa-exempt countries including the UK, the United States, Australia and Canada to pay the permit fee before entering the 27-member bloc.The permit will be valid for three years or until the passport runs out, whichever comes first, and will cover travel to the whole of the 29-state Schengen Area free travel zone, which includes all EU states except Ireland and Cyprus, and in addition the non-EU states of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.After the ETIAS is introduced, there will be a six-month transition period, during which travelers will be expected to apply for the waiver, but will not necessarily be denied entry at the border if they have not done so, but it will kick in properly from May.Geographical proximityIt is a particular issue for British travelers because of their geographical proximity to the continent making frequent visits more likely, and because they have been used to free entry before the country left the EU.As part of the online application process, which could feasibly take up to 72 hours, British citizens must supply personal information, including their address, details of their job title and employer, or educational establishment for students, as well as any criminal convictions in the previous 20 years.With more than 700 million tourists having entered Europe last year, The Times newspaper quoted EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson as saying the entry and exit system would mean every single airport, harbor or road into Europe would have strict digital border controls, and as a result, European citizens could "sleep safer".But there is concern that longer and repetitive process could cause delays and missed flights for travelers."Turn up without (a permit) and, like the US, you won't be allowed in," an unnamed travel industry source told The Times. "It's going to catch people out, I am sure."Searches resumed for a third day on Wednesday on the wreck of a luxury yacht that sank off Sicily, with hope fading that the six missing passengers would be found alive.The search operation, which involves specialist divers aided by an underwater drone, continued until late on Tuesday and resumed at first light on Wednesday morning, firefighters said.Six people, including Jonathan Bloomer, chairman of Morgan Stanley International bank, British technology mogul Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah, and Chris Morvillo, a lawyer from Clifford Chance, remain missing following the sinking of the yacht about 700 meters from the Sicilian coast on Monday, according to Sicily's Civil Protection Agency.The Bayesian, a 56-meter yacht, was carrying a total of 22 people — 12 passengers and 10 crew members — comprising British, United States and Canadian nationals.The luxury yacht went down at about 5 am local time, after a heavy storm caused waterspouts, or rotating columns of air and mist, reported the BBC.Fifteen individuals were rescued, among them a 1-year-old British girl.Italian news agency ANSA cited witnesses saying the Bayesian had dropped anchor when the storm hit, resulting in the mast snapping and the vessel capsizing before sinking.Specialized fire and rescue divers, experts in confined-space operations, were flown in from Rome and Sardinia on Monday, said the BBC.Firefighters said on Tuesday evening that divers had entered the inside of the wreck, but that it was a "long and complex" operation.The yacht is largely intact, resting on the seabed some 50 meters down.Bodies foundOn Wednesday, divers found two bodies in the shipwreck, said a source close to the search. It was not immediately clear who had been found.The discovery brings the confirmed death toll to three.Previously, Sicily's Civil Protection Agency confirmed the body of the ship's cook, a Canadian who had been residing in Antigua, had been recovered, according to Italian newspaper la Repubblica.Lynch, dubbed "the British Bill Gates" in media reports, is a technology entrepreneur, who recently celebrated his acquittal in a high-profile fraud case related to the $11 billion sale of his company, Autonomy, to US computing giant Hewlett-Packard. He had reportedly been facing two decades in jail and invited his legal team aboard the yacht to celebrate the result of the case.The incident in Sicily coincides with the death of Lynch's co-defendant in the fraud case, Stephen Chamberlain, after an accident in Cambridgeshire in the United Kingdom on Saturday. Chamberlain was hit by a car while jogging.Morvillo, a prominent lawyer, worked on Lynch's trial and the investigation into the 9/11 New York terror attacks in 2001. Bloomer is the 70-year-old British chairman of Morgan Stanley International and of insurance company Hiscox. Both their wives are among the six missing individuals.A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley said the company was "deeply shocked and saddened" and added, "Our thoughts are with all those affected, in particular the Bloomer family, as we all wait for further news from this terrible situation."Agencies contributed to this story.PRAGUE -- Czech police on Wednesday evacuated 582 people from the vicinity of a chemical plant in the country's Northwest region due to "a high risk of explosion" after the discovery of an unexploded bomb."An unexploded aerial bomb from World War II" was found during excavation work in a remote part of the Orlen Unipetrol plant near Litvinov, Most District, the Czech refining and petrochemical company said in a statement on its website.Experts from the police and the regional fire rescue department intervened, and a partial evacuation was ordered in the refinery part of the plant."The bomb weighing 250 kg will remain in place until Aug 27. A crisis team is now meeting to decide on the next course of action," said the police.Unexploded munitions from World War II have been found repeatedly in the Most District in the past, according to the Czech News Agency. In May 2021, 5,400 people had to be evacuated after an aerial bomb was found on the premises of a chemical plant.LONDON -- A woman and three children died on Wednesday in a house fire in Bradford, the United Kingdom (UK). Police believe the fire was "started deliberately."Emergency services arriving at the scene of the fire in the early hours of Wednesday found a 29-year-old woman who had already died. Three children - two girls and a boy - were taken to hospital, but later died from injuries sustained in the fire.A 39-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder, and taken to hospital with critical injuries."Whilst inquiries are at their early stages, we believe that the fire was started deliberately and this incident was domestic-related," Superintendent Lucy Leadbeater of West Yorkshire Police told reporters.She said a murder investigation has been launched. PARIS -- The European Space Agency (ESA)'s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) has successfully completed the world's first lunar-Earth flyby, using the gravity of Earth to send it Venus-bound, on a shortcut to Jupiter through the inner Solar System, ESA said on Wednesday.The flyby, which took place on Monday and Tuesday, was to reroute Juice's path through space, using the gravity of first the Moon and then Earth to change the spacecraft's speed and direction, according to ESA.The flyby of the Moon increased Juice's speed by 0.9 km/s relative to the Sun, guiding Juice toward Earth. The flyby of Earth reduced Juice's speed by 4.8 km/s relative to the Sun, guiding Juice onto a new trajectory towards Venus. Overall, the lunar-Earth flyby deflected Juice by an angle of 100 degrees compared to its pre-flyby path.Jupiter is on average 800 million km away from Earth. Without an enormous rocket, sending Juice straight to the giant planet would require an impossible 60,000 kg of onboard propellant. And then Juice would need to be carrying an enormous additional amount of propellant to slow itself down enough to go into orbit around Jupiter once it arrives.Launched on an Ariane 5 from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou in April 2023, Juice has an eight-year cruise with flybys of Earth and Venus to slingshot it to Jupiter. The spacecraft will make detailed observations of gas giant Jupiter and its three large ocean-bearing moons-Ganymede, Callisto and Europa-to discover more about these destinations as potential habitats for past or present life. OSLO -- Denmark and Sweden have announced plans to strengthen their cooperation in response to a recent surge in violent crimes, which have involved Swedish teenagers being used as mercenaries in Denmark. The justice ministers from both countries made the announcement during a joint press conference in Copenhagen on Wednesday."The gangs' willingness to resort to violence knows no bounds. Therefore, our response must be strong and coordinated," said Danish Minister of Justice Peter Hummelgaard. He emphasized the importance of the two countries working together to apply pressure on nations where the masterminds behind these gang conflicts are believed to be hiding.As part of this agreement, Denmark and Sweden will enhance their cooperation, particularly through the exchange of information. The two Nordic countries also plan to intensify efforts to prevent the recruitment of children and young people into gangs via social media and other digital platforms.Swedish Minister of Justice Gunnar Strommer highlighted the need for Sweden to fundamentally overhaul its policies in the fight against gang-related crimes. He announced that the Swedish government intends to increase penalties for gang crimes to align more closely with those in Denmark.Hummelgaard said earlier this month that the Danish authorities knew of 25 cases where criminal groups in Denmark have hired Swedes to commit crimes in Denmark. ROME -- Five bodies were recovered Wednesday from the hull of the striken Bayesian yacht that sank in a freak storm on Monday, though searches are ongoing with one last passenger unaccounted for.The 56-meter ship was anchored near the shore of Porticello on the southern Italian island of Sicily when it was hit by a severe storm. Authorities said a powerful waterspout snapped the ship's main mast and flipped the yacht before it quickly sank beneath the waves.Fifteen of 22 passengers and crew members were immediately rescued, with eight of them rushed to local hospitals. The body of one crew member was quickly found near the spot where the boat went down.Hindered by severe weather and the unusual positioning of the sunken yacht, a team of divers working in 12-minute shifts, with the help of a remote-controlled undersea search robot, had trouble accessing the inside of the ship before Wednesday. That was when divers first found two bodies and then, later, two more, and according to news reports, a fifth body later in the day. In an effort to stimulate its slow-moving economy, Sweden's central bank has again lowered interest rates and suggested the possibility of several more rate reductions this year.The Riksbank decreased its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.5 percent on Tuesday, which is the second time this year it has lowered borrowing costs.Major central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have been maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation, although the European Central Bank and the Bank of England made their first cuts in several years this summer, signaling a potential shift in global monetary policy.Being outside the eurozone enables Sweden to have its own central bank and set its own monetary policy, allowing it to adjust interest rates based on its specific economic conditions."If the inflation outlook remains the same, the policy rate can be cut two or three more times this year, which is somewhat faster than the executive board assessed in June," the Swedish central bank said in a statement.Recent months have seen Sweden's inflation rate drop below its 2 percent target, coupled with the economic slowdown. The bank justified its decision by citing sluggish economic growth both domestically and internationally.Cited by Euronews, Lars Jonung, professor emeritus at the Knut Wicksell Centre for Financial Studies at Lund University, said: "The prime driver of the reduction is the decline of the Swedish inflation rate … which is close to the inflation target of the Riksbank of 2 percent."A secondary reason is that the Swedish economy is not booming, but rather Sweden is in a recession with a high rate of unemployment, one of the highest in the EU."Euronews noted that Sweden's economy, which is characterized by its heavy reliance on international trade and high household debt, is particularly vulnerable to monetary policy fluctuations. Changes in rates directly impact mortgage payments, consequently suppressing consumer spending.The largest Nordic economy has seen housing prices plummet, partly due to the prevalence of short-term fixed-rate mortgages, reported the Financial Times newspaper.Sweden's economy has been among the weakest in Europe this year, with the country's statistics agency recently warning that multiple indicators suggest the nation is experiencing a "clear recession", said the paper.The FT cited economists at Nordea, the region's largest bank, as saying "there are simply few arguments to keep the policy rate at restrictive levels as inflation is under control, the labor market is weakening, and global rates have come down, reducing the depreciation pressure on the krona exchange rates".The Riksbank began its rate-cutting cycle in May, being among the first central banks to do so in nearly eight years. It maintained its key rate at 3.75 percent in June, hinting at potential future cuts due to decreasing price pressures.Sweden's rate move comes as financial experts anticipate potential interest rate reductions from the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve during their upcoming September meetings, said the FT. The United Kingdom is planning to increase its inventory of government-owned subsidized homes, so it can help more people keep a roof over their head.The expansion of the government's property portfolio will be funded, in part, by an increase in rents charged on properties it already owns, unnamed government sources told the Financial Times newspaper.They said the country's finance minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, who took over when the Labour Party came to power after the general election on July 4, will raise social housing rents by 1 percent more than inflation in each of the coming 10 years.She is expected to introduce the plan in her annual budget in October.The move will ensure not-for-profit housing associations and local governments have the confidence to build more affordable homes, the paper said.Gavin Smart, chief executive of professional housing body the Chartered Institute of Housing, told the paper the affordable housing sector craves certainty."It is clear that ministers and officials understand that a rent settlement needs to be one that landlords and investors can rely on for a long period," he said.Around 4 million UK households live in subsidized accommodation but 109,000 other families are in temporary accommodation because there are not enough homes to meet demand.The Daily Mail newspaper said Reeves will likely also need to increase government income through tax hikes — likely inheritance tax and capital gains tax — in her Oct 30 budget, because of the 22-billion-pound ($28.7-billion) "black hole" in public finances she says her government inherited from the previous Conservative Party administration.Additionally, the government has been accruing more debt, with the Office for National Statistics saying on Wednesday public-sector net borrowing had risen to 3.1 billion pounds in July, from 1.8 billion pounds during the same period last year.The desired expansion of the UK's subsidized housing portfolio against the backdrop of shrinking government coffers comes as the nation's private-sector rental market has left many people in a so-called "price trap".Online property portal Zoopla says 17 people are currently chasing every available rental home, and that rents are rising faster than average earnings, which means many people cannot afford to move.Zoopla said rents rose by 5.7 percent in the private-sector market in the year ending June 2024, which was an improvement on the situation in the previous year, when rents went up by 12.3 percent. In the year before that, when 30 to 35 prospective tenants chased every available property, rents rose by 20 percent.Richard Donnell, Zoopla's executive director, told the BBC: "We have moved from a red-hot market over the last couple of years, to one which is still hot, but cooling."2024 CHINA FOCUS has been officially launched at the Edinburgh Festivals, showcasing eight outstanding Chinese theater productions. Launched in 2017, CHINA FOCUS serves as an artistic and dynamic platform for fostering innovation in the Sino-UK creative industries.Video by Han Jing.MOSCOW - Russia destroyed 45 Ukrainian drones overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, including 11 over the Moscow region, the Russian Ministry of Defense said on Wednesday.There were 11 drones shot down over the territory of the Moscow region, one of the largest drone attacks on Moscow ever, Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.Another 23 drones were destroyed over the Bryansk region, six were shot down over the Belgorod region, three over the Kaluga region and two over the Kursk region, the defense ministry said.Meanwhile, three counterattacks of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Avdeyevka direction were disrupted overnight, the ministry said.London City Airport has been given permission to increase its passenger numbers by more than one-third, as part of the new British government's program of projects to boost growth.The airport is located in the Royal Docks, a short distance from the capital's two main commerce hubs, the City of London and Canary Wharf, which makes it particularly popular with business travelers.The Labour Party put measures to increase growth at the heart of its manifesto for the general election that it won in July, restoring it to government after 14 years, and the newly expanded services will see passenger numbers rise from 6.5 million to 9 million by 2031.London City Airport serves a variety of short-haul destinations across Europe, including winter sports locations when there is seasonal demand.In 2009, it began offering a business class service to JFK Airport in New York, but this was suspended at the start of the pandemic, and scrapped altogether in August 2020.Despite being so close to business hubs, the airport is also surrounded by residential areas in the Borough of Newham, whose council had initially blocked plans for increased services.The airport appealed to the government, which overturned the council's decision, but as a concession to local residents, refused a bid for additional flights on Saturday afternoons, and also ruled that quieter craft must be used for any early morning flights.News of the expansion has provoked a mixed response, with environmental campaigners saying many of the journeys made by users of the airport could be done by train instead, and that the decision undermines the government's ambition to be a world leader in climate change and net-zero initiatives.London City Airport chief executive Alison Fitzgerald welcomed the expansion to service, but said the limits on weekend flight could cause delays to quieter and greener craft being introduced by airlines."Local residents would have had the added benefit of these aircraft operating at the airport throughout the week, not just in the extended operating hours," she said.Newham mayor Rokhsana Fiaz called the weekend flight restrictions a "victory" for local residents, but told Sky News she had worries about an increase in early morning flights from six to nine, which she called "deeply" concerning."We will be studying the decision notice carefully and considering all options as we remain concerned about the detrimental impacts on the health and quality of life of our residents," she added. BRUSSELS -- The European Union (EU) has approved a 5-billion-euro ($5.56 billion) state subsidy from Germany to support the construction and operation of a new microchip manufacturing plant, the European Commission announced on Tuesday.The facility, known as the European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, will be located in the city of Dresden in eastern Germany. It is expected to reach full operational capacity by 2029, with an annual production of 480,000 silicon wafers.According to the European Commission, the plant will produce chips using 300 mm silicon wafers, with node sizes ranging from 28/22 to 16/12 nanometers, primarily targeting automotive and industrial applications.The project aligns with the EU's plan of doubling its global market share in semiconductors to 20 percent by 2030, as outlined in the European Chips Act.Europe has traditionally been reliant on the import of chips and wafers. The European automotive sector has been hard hit in recent years by a lack of semiconductors, severely limiting the industry's capacity.Aiming to mobilize more than 43 billion euros from public and private investments, the European Commission introduced the EU Chips Act in 2022 to achieve its strategic independence from semiconductor imports, enabling it to react faster to supply chain issues. PRAGUE -- A bus and a lorry collided Tuesday in western Slovakia, leaving seven people injured, local media reported.The accident occurred near the village of Turna in the Kosice region Tuesday afternoon. All the injured were conscious, the News Agency of the Slovak Republic reported, adding that six ambulances and a helicopter were sent to the site.The road was closed in both directions and a mother with two children was among the injured, local police said on Facebook. It's not yet known how many people were on the bus. An investigation is underway.The United Kingdom's newest spaceport, on the tiny Scottish island of Unst, has been rocked by a massive explosion after a rocket engine failed during testing by the German company Rocket Factory Augsburg, or RFA.The enterprise hopes to eventually launch the UK's first vertical-takeoff rocket and was moving forward with the project on the island, which is part of the Shetland Islands, by conducting trials.RFA said no one was injured in the incident at the SaxaVord Spaceport on Monday night. It also said the launch pad itself was not damaged.The BBC said the explosion at the former Royal Air Force base was preceded by large flames and smoke "shooting horizontally from the bottom of the rocket" before the entire structure was engulfed in flames.The spaceport, which only opened three months ago, has received approval from the UK's Civil Aviation Authority to start launching spaceships this year and is the first facility in Western Europe to be licensed to launch vessels vertically. It has approval to carry out 30 such operations a year and is expected to become a major part of the UK's participation in the space industry.In addition to RFA, the German rocket-maker HyImpulse has expressed an interest in using the spaceport, as has United States aviation giant Lockheed Martin, and Edinburgh-based Skyrora.However, the site has not yet completed a successful launch.A spokesman for SaxaVord Spaceport said: "This was a test, and test campaigns are designed to identify issues prior to the next stage. We will work with RFA to understand and learn from the causes and support them as they move forward to the next phase of their preparations."RFA has high hopes of building a European rocket company that might, one day, be capable of challenging Elon Musk's SpaceX and wants to use the 30-meter rocket it is developing to carry payloads into a low-Earth-orbit.If Monday's test had been successful, all nine of the rocket's engines would have been fired up while the rocket itself would have remained on the ground.The spaceport said its employees and those of RFA were never in any danger because everyone had been evacuated from the site before testing began. The spaceport added that it will fully cooperate with any official investigation into the failure.The UK currently has lofty ambitions to become a leader in the global space industry and already has almost 50,000 people working in the sector at more than 2,000 companies worth a collective 17.5 billion pounds ($22.8 billion).The UK's only other spaceport, in the county of Cornwall in southwest England, was the first to become operational but is not licensed to launch vessels vertically and instead puts them into orbit piggy-backed on an aircraft. The country also has several other spaceports under construction. Six individuals, including Jonathan Bloomer, chairman of Morgan Stanley International bank, and Chris Morvillo, a lawyer from Clifford Chance, remain missing following the sinking of a luxury yacht off the Sicilian coast during a storm on Monday, according to Sicily's Civil Protection agency.British technology mogul Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah were initially reported missing after the incident about 700 meters from the Mediterranean island's shore.The Bayesian, a 56-meter yacht, was carrying a total of 22 people – 12 passengers and 10 crew members – comprising British, United States, and Canadian nationals.The luxury yacht went down near Palermo's coast at around 5 am local time, after a heavy storm caused waterspouts, or rotating columns of air and mist, reported the BBC.Fifteen individuals were rescued, among them a 1-year-old British girl.Sicily's Civil Protection Agency confirmed that the body of the ship's cook, a Canadian who had been residing in Antigua, had been recovered, according to Italian newspaper la Repubblica.Italian news agency Ansa cited witnesses saying the Bayesian had its anchor down when the storm hit, resulting in the mast snapping and the vessel capsizing before sinking.According to local media, Salvo Cocina of Sicily's Civil Protection Agency said: "They were in the wrong place at the wrong time."Specialized fire and rescue divers, experts in confined-space operations, were flown in from Rome and Sardinia on Monday, said the BBC.However, their initial exploration of the sunken vessel, located approximately 50 meters beneath the surface, proved unsuccessful."Access was limited only to the bridge, with difficulty due to the presence of furniture obstructing passage," the Italian fire department stated in a social media post.Mike Lynch, dubbed "the British Bill Gates" in media reports, is a technology entrepreneur, who recently celebrated his acquittal in a high-profile fraud case related to the $11 billion sale of his company, Autonomy, to US computing giant Hewlett-Packard, or HP. He had reportedly been facing two decades in jail, and invited his legal team aboard the yacht to celebrate the result of the case.The incident in Sicily coincides with the death of Lynch's co-defendant in the fraud case, Stephen Chamberlain, after an accident in Cambridgeshire, in the United Kingdom on Saturday. Chamberlain was hit by a car while jogging.Morvillo, a prominent lawyer, worked on Lynch's trial and the investigation into the 2001 9/11 New York terror attacks. Bloomer is the 70-year-old British chairman of Morgan Stanley International and of insurance company Hiscox. Both their wives are among the six missing individuals.Lynch's wife, Angela Bacares, was rescued along with 14 others, including a mother who held her 1-year-old baby above the waves, reported Sky News.A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley said the company was "deeply shocked and saddened" and added: "Our thoughts are with all those affected, in particular the Bloomer family, as we all wait for further news from this terrible situation."KYIV - The Ukrainian army has taken control of 92 settlements in western Russia's Kursk region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday.Ukrainian troops have seized more than 1,250 square kilometers of Russian territory, Zelensky said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter."The Russian border area opposite our Sumy region has been mostly cleared of Russian military presence," Zelensky said.The Ukrainian army continues its military operation in the designated areas of the Kursk region, he added.Ukraine started a military operation in the Kursk region on Aug 6. On Aug 15, Oleksandr Syrsky, commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said that his army had captured 82 settlements in the region.BAKU - President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Russia's commitment to supporting the normalization of relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia during a state visit to Baku on Monday.Speaking after talks with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, Putin emphasized Russia's role in facilitating a peace agreement based on the trilateral accords reached in 2020 and 2022 by the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia."We are prepared to assist in the delimitation and demarcation of the border, utilizing relevant Soviet-era documents, as well as in unblocking cross-border routes and establishing humanitarian contacts," Putin stated.Despite ongoing crises, including the situation in Ukraine, Putin underscored Russia's historical involvement in the South Caucasus and its commitment to participating in these efforts. He noted that any initiative must be primarily driven by the parties involved."If we can contribute to reaching a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia, achieve delimitation and demarcation of the border, and unblock necessary logistics and economic routes, we would be very pleased," Putin added.The European Union's decision to levy additional tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles could be counterproductive, as it puts the bloc's decarbonization goals at risk, experts said.Stephen Perry, honorary president of the 48 Group Club, a London-based nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Sino-British trade cooperation, said the tariffs could slow down the EU's transition from petrol cars to electric vehicles."It is a good time for European carmakers to make the transition. They are not prepared for this. China will enter joint ventures in Europe if the approach of the EU is friendly. Otherwise, the situation may deteriorate," he said."Sharing is the way forward, not battles. Everyone needs to remember that we are all supposed to be cooperating to help reduce carbon emissions. China is sharing its progress.""Now is not the time for the EU to compete with the United States for the tough-man title," Perry added, alluding to the general perception that the imposition of additional tariffs mirror the US strategy of pushing for de-risking and decoupling from China.The European Commission on June 12 announced temporary countervailing duties on battery electric vehicles imported from China, based on its anti-subsidy probe launched last October.The commission's primary executive arm provisionally concluded that the BEV value chain in China benefits from what it called "unfair" subsidization, which it claimed posed a threat to European BEV manufacturers.Different manufacturers will be taxed differently. The initial decision imposes a 17.4 percent tariff on BYD, 19.9 percent on Geely, and 37.6 percent on SAIC. These are in addition to the existing 10 percent import tariff the EU imposes on all non-EU electric vehicle manufacturers.While it is right for the EU to value its homemade goods, Chris Aylett, a research associate at the Environment and Society Centre at Chatham House, a London-based independent policy institute, highlighted in an analysis that the restrictions on Chinese BEVs jeopardize the union's legally binding climate targets of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and at least a 55 percent reduction by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.This is especially concerning given that clean products manufactured in Europe remain expensive, and EU-level investment in the industry falls "far short" with no signs of improvement, Aylett said, suggesting that the union will need to rely on China's imports."These targets are ambitious," he said. "With 2022 marking a reduction of 32.5 percent, accelerated and sustained action will be needed. This implies deploying mass-market clean technology products like solar panels and electric vehicles in very large numbers.""And when it comes to cheap, clean technology, China is the undisputed world leader. Two decades of consistent and targeted industrial policy, combined with the benefits of a huge domestic market, mean that China today produces extremely competitively priced, high-quality, low-carbon goods," he added."All else being equal, anything which stems the flow of the cheapest low-carbon products will increase the cost of the transition and slow it down," he concluded.Zulkafil Hassan Khan, president of the Society of International Relations & Law at the Institute of Legal Studies in Pakistan and director of the Pak-China Corridor of Knowledge, said in an op-ed for China Daily that the tariffs make the EU an "obvious loser", as it could fall behind other countries in realizing a green future."It would result in increasing the prices of the (EU) EVs because of which domestic automobile producers would face less competition," he said. "Simultaneously, the tariffs would open new markets for Chinese EV manufacturers."He added that Chinese firms have started picking up shares in countries with small domestic auto industries, such as Australia and New Zealand, which shows that the EU is the obvious loser in this case.Stephan Ossenkopp, a senior researcher at the Germany-based think tank Schiller Institute, pointed out in his op-ed piece for China Daily that "the real challenge for the European electric vehicle industry comes from developments within Europe, not imports from China."PORTICELLO, Sicily — British tech magnate Mike Lynch and five other people were missing after their luxury superyacht sank during a freak storm off Sicily early Monday, Italy's civil protection and authorities said. Lynch's wife and 14 other people survived.Lynch, who was acquitted in June in a big US fraud trial, was among six people who remain unaccounted for after their chartered sailboat sank off Porticello, near Palermo, sometime after 4 am. A tornado over the water known as a waterspout had struck the area overnight, said Salvo Cocina of Sicily's civil protection agency.One body was recovered, and police divers spent the day trying to reach the hull of the ship, which was resting at a depth of 50 meters (163 feet) off Porticello where it had been anchored, rescue authorities said. They returned to the site after 10 pm to see if it would be possible to search through the night, when weather conditions were expected to worsen, said Luca Cari, spokesman of the fire rescue service.The ship had a crew of 10 people and 12 passengers, the Italian coast guard said. A sudden fierce storm had battered the area overnight, and a waterspout struck precisely where the 56-meter (184-foot) British-flagged Bayesian had been moored."They were in the wrong place at the wrong time," said Cocina, noting that another big ship nearby, the Sir Robert Baden Powell, wasn't as badly damaged and helped rescue the 15 survivors — including Lynch's wife, Angela Bacares.The Bayesian was notable for its single 75-meter (246-feet) mast — one of the world's tallest made of aluminum and which was lit up at night, just hours before it sank. Online charter sites listed it for rent for up to 195,000 euros (about $215,000) a week.One of the survivors, identified as Charlotte Golunski, said she momentarily lost hold of her 1-year-old daughter Sofia in the water, but then managed to hold her up over the waves until a lifeboat inflated and they were both pulled to safety, Italian news agency ANSA reported. The father, identified by ANSA as James Emslie, also survived, said Cocina.Karsten Borner, the captain of the Sir Robert Baden Powell, said he had noticed the Bayesian nearby during the storm but after it calmed he saw a red flare and realized the ship had simply disappeared, ANSA and the Giornale di Sicilia newspaper reported. Borner said he and a crew member boarded their tender and found a lifeboat with 15 people, some of them injured, who they then took aboard and alerted the coast guard.Eight of those rescued were hospitalized while the others were taken to a hotel. One body believed to be the cook was found near the wreck, but six others were unaccounted for and believed inside the hull, said Cari, the fire rescue spokesperson. The rescue operations, which were visible from shore, involved helicopters and rescue boats from the coast guard, fire rescue and civil protection service.Cocina said the crew and passengers hailed from a variety of countries: In addition to Britain and the United States, passengers and crew were from Antigua, France, Germany, Ireland, Myanmar, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain, he said.The UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch is deploying a team of four inspectors to Italy to conduct a preliminary assessment. The Foreign Commonwealth and Development office said it was "providing consular support to a number of British nationals and their families."Dutch foreign ministry spokesperson Casper Soetekouw said the lone Dutch citizen on board, a man, had been rescued and was not in life-threatening condition. Lynch, once hailed as Britain's king of technology, was cleared in June of fraud and conspiracy charges related to Hewlett Packard's $11 billion takeover of his company, Autonomy Corp.The not guilty verdicts followed an 11-week criminal trial in San Francisco that delved into the history of HP's 2011 acquisition of Autonomy, a business software firm founded by Lynch.The fraud accusations represented a dramatic turn in the fortunes of an entrepreneur once described as the Bill Gates of Britain — a title he seemed to live up to when he netted an $800 million from the Autonomy sale.The acquittal vindicated Lynch, who had vehemently denied wrong doing and portrayed HP as a technological train wreck."I'm looking forward to returning the UK and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field," Lynch said in a statement released after the verdict.The yacht, built in 2008 by the Italian firm Perini Navi, can accommodate 12 passengers in four double cabins, a triple and the master suite, plus crew accommodations, according to Charter World and Yacht Charters.The vessel, which previously was named Salute when it flew under a Dutch flag, featured a sleek, minimalist interior of light wood with Japanese accents designed by the French designer Remi Tessier, according to descriptions and photos on the charter sites.AP A record surge in irregular migrant arrivals from Africa is impacting regions of Spain, with the Canary Islands experiencing a 126 percent increase and the autonomous city of Ceuta on the southern side of the Strait of Gibraltar seeing a 143 percent rise in the first two weeks of August compared to the same period last year.According to the Spanish Interior Ministry, 31,155 irregular migrants entered Spain between January and August, a 66.2 percent increase from the previous year, with the majority arriving by small boat.The influx primarily originates from Mauritania and the Sahel region, where escalating violence is forcing thousands to flee, reported Euractiv news website.Spain serves as a key entry point into the European Union for migrants, with routes including the perilous Atlantic journey from West Africa to the Canary Islands and crossings, including to Ceuta, at the Spanish-Moroccan border.Experts often describe the Spain-Morocco border as one of the world's most economically unequal. World Bank data underscores this disparity, revealing a stark contrast in GDP per capita between the two nations. While Spain boasts a figure of nearly $32,677, Morocco's GDP stands at a much lower $3,672.The migration issue has become a contentious political topic in Spain, with far-right parties including VOX using it to criticize Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's progressive socialist government.Regional authorities are struggling to cope with the influx of illegal migrants, with the Canary Islands facing the additional challenge of accommodating almost 6,000 unaccompanied minors after receiving 22,304 migrants between January and mid-August, while Ceuta confronts what its local government describes as an "unsustainable" situation due to the arrival of hundreds of children.In response to the crisis, regional political party Coalicion Canaria has urged immediate action from the government, calling on Sanchez to take "two hours out of his holidays to address the migration emergency".The situation has escalated to the point where opposition leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo, head of the Spanish People's Party, has called on the government to declare a "migratory emergency", and another of the party's politicians last month suggested deploying the army to manage the crisis.While the Western African route records unprecedented numbers, data from Frontex, the EU's external border agency, shows a 64 percent decrease in irregular journeys on the Central Mediterranean migration route to Europe during the first seven months of the year, highlighting the varying migration trends across Europe, reported Italian news agency ANSA.Frontex said the decline in migration on this route can be linked to proactive steps taken by Libya and Tunisia, following agreements with the EU and individual governments. "Arrivals from those two countries account for 95 percent of all migrants reported on the Central Mediterranean route," it noted.On the English Channel route to the United Kingdom, the number of detections in the first seven months of this year has increased by 22 percent, Frontex said. The United Kingdom may be complicit in Gaza war crimes, according to a British diplomat who has resigned over the issue.Mark Smith, who was second secretary at the UK's embassy in Ireland, said in his resignation letter: "Each day, we witness clear and unquestionable examples of war crimes and breaches of international humanitarian law in Gaza perpetuated by the state of Israel."He said the fact that the UK has supplied weapons to Israel while "senior members of the Israeli government and military have expressed open genocidal intent" means the British government could be held legally responsible."I can no longer carry out my duties in the knowledge that this department may be complicit in war crimes," he added.As examples of potential crimes, he highlighted Israeli soldiers taking videos of colleagues "deliberately burning, destroying and looting civilian property".Israel has insisted its activities in Gaza are legal and in measured response to an Oct 7 attack in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed.The authorities in Gaza have said at least 40,000 people in the territory have been killed in the nine months that have followed, prompting the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes.Smith said he used to oversee arms export licenses while working in the British government's Middle East and North African Department, and that arms exports to Israel must stop immediately."There is no justification for the UK's continued arms sales to Israel and yet somehow it continues," he wrote. "I have raised this at every level in the organization, including through an official whistleblowing investigation, and received nothing more than 'thank you we have noted your concern'."He said UK ministers' claims that the UK carefully controls arms exports "is the opposite of the truth".Smith later told the BBC: "When you look at what constitutes a war crime, it's actually quite clear — even from what you see in open source on the TV — that the state of Israel is perpetrating war crimes in plain sight."Sky News quoted a Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson as saying the UK fully complies with international law."We have made clear that we will not export items if they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law," the spokesperson said.Analysis by the Campaign Against Arms Trade claims the UK has exported more than 576 million pounds ($747 million) of weapons to Israel since 2008.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy ordered a review of those arms sales after the Labour Party was elected to govern the country on July 4. The review is ongoing.THE HAGUE -- The Dutch public health authority, RIVM, said on Monday that healthcare providers are on high alert for potential infections from a new variant of the mpox virus."If a case is detected, the Municipal Health Service will conduct source and contact tracing and provide guidance to prevent further transmission," the RIVM said. "Vaccination is available for close contacts. The Netherlands has sufficient vaccines in stock."RIVM virologist Chantal Reusken told local media that it is probably only a matter of time before a new variant of mpox appears in the Netherlands. But the risk is low and the disease is manageable due to the country's robust healthcare system, said Reusken.Mpox, caused by an orthopoxvirus, was prevalent in West and Central Africa. However, in the spring of 2022, cases began emerging in Europe without direct links to those regions. Following a peak in summer 2022, the number of cases sharply declined by autumn. There were a total of 1,316 confirmed cases to date in the Netherlands.In 2024, a more deadly variant, Clade 1b, emerged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries. On Aug 14, the World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern, activating its highest level of global alert for mpox for the second time in two years.On Aug 15, Sweden reported the first case of the new variant outside Africa.MOSCOW - Russia has officially requested Germany to investigate the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said Monday.Russia is pushing for negotiations to ensure Germany meets its international obligations in the fight against terrorism, said Oleg Tyapkin, director of the Third European Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry, in an interview with Russia's RIA Novosti news agency.Expressing dissatisfaction with the progress of the German investigation, Tyapkin said that German authorities have recently issued an arrest warrant for one of the suspected perpetrators, a Ukrainian national.He noted that German media have been promoting the narrative that these individuals acted independently and were not connected to any state, but warned that this could lead to the investigation being closed without identifying the true masterminds behind the sabotage."Russia will not accept this state of affairs," Tyapkin said, adding that Moscow has formally lodged complaints with Germany and other affected countries, urging them to fulfill their obligations under United Nations anti-terrorism conventions."We are seeking negotiations in accordance with existing international protocols. Our future actions will depend on the West's response," he added.German media recently reported that the German prosecution has issued an arrest warrant for Ukrainian citizen in connection with the pipeline explosions. Reports identified this suspect as diver Vladimir Zhuravlev from Kyiv, who was allegedly assisted by a Ukrainian couple.In September 2022, the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipelines exploded and sustained severe damage in the territorial waters of Sweden and Denmark. Prior to the explosions, Russia used the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to transport natural gas from Siberia to Germany and other European countries.Due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Nord Stream 2 was never put into operation, and Germany halted imports of Russian natural gas, leading to a sharp increase in domestic energy prices.The Russian Prosecutor General's Office has launched an investigation into the incident as an act of international terrorism. Russia has repeatedly requested information on the explosions but has not received any response, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Germany will stop new military aid to Ukraine in order to cut government spending, German media reported, just days after German prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian man suspected of being part of a team that blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines.The moratorium on new assistance has already taken effect and will impact new requests for funding, but not aid approved earlier, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported on Saturday.The newspaper quoted German Finance Minister Christian Lindner, of the Free Democratic Party, as saying in a letter to the German Federal Ministry of Defense that future funding would no longer come from Germany's federal budget but from proceeds of frozen Russian assets.Despite strong warnings of retaliation from Moscow, Germany and other G7 member states reached a preliminary deal in June to use the proceeds of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine. The European Commission transferred 1.5 billion euros ($1.65 billion) of profits from frozen Russian assets in late July to buy weapons for Ukraine.Germany is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine among 27 EU member states and the second largest in the world after the United States. But Berlin indicated last month when the coalition government adopted a preliminary deal on its 2025 draft budget that its future assistance to Ukraine will be slashed by half to 4 billion euros ($4.41 billion) to cater to other spending priorities.Lindner said last month that Ukraine would have to rely more on funds from "European sources" as well as the frozen Russian assets.Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi has stated that claims that the German government is halting military aid to Ukraine are incorrect and manipulative, Ukrainian news media quoted him as saying on Sunday.The three parties of the German coalition government all fared poorly in the European election in early June and their internal tensions have grown especially after Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Economic Affairs Robert Habeck, of the Greens, expressed last week his intention to run for chancellor in the 2025 federal election."It's quite obvious that this coalition has major problems finding common ground," he said regarding the recent disputes over a number of issues. "The ideas are falling apart."The latest news coincides with the arrest warrant issued last Wednesday by German authorities over the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines on Sept 26, 2022.Germany, Denmark and Sweden conducted investigations into the explosions but the Danish and Swedish authorities concluded their probes without pointing at any suspect.In a probe published by ARD and two other German news outlets, the suspect is a 44-year-old Ukrainian diving instructor, named only as Volodymyr Z. for privacy reasons.But the Swedish newspaper Expression identified the man as Volodymyr Zhuravlov.He was accused of attacking the pipeline with at least two others, also believed to be Ukrainian citizens.The suspect was believed to last be living in Poland, but Polish authorities said they could not act on the warrant because he had left for his native country when they tried to arrest him in a town near Warsaw in July.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has earlier denied Kyiv's involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, which were built to carry cheap Russian natural gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Saturday said the initiators of the gas pipeline project should "apologize and keep quiet". It came after one of his deputies denied a claim that Warsaw was partly responsible for its damage.Agencies contributed to the story.VIENNA -- Heavy rains and storms hit Austria over the weekend, leading to widespread flooding, mudslides and disruptions to transportation in various regions of the country.In the ski resort town of St. Anton in western Austria's state of Tyrol, heavy downpours on Friday evening flooded streets, damaged buildings and swept away cars, Austrian broadcaster ORF reported. Cleanup efforts are now in full swing, local authorities said on Sunday.Heavy rains also hit the capital city of Vienna on Saturday. The capital city recorded a staggering 110 liters of rain per square meter, a record-breaking figure for summer rainfall, the Austrian newspaper Kurier reported. A woman was swept under a bus by floodwater in Vienna's Doebling district on Saturday and sustained severe injuries, according to ORF.ORF also reported major delays of flights at the Vienna Airport over the weekend. In addition, rain-triggered mudslides forced closure of the Arlberg Pass, a key road connecting the western states of Tyrol and Vorarlberg, and it remained closed to traffic on Sunday afternoon, the broadcaster added.PARIS - French film star Alain Delon has died at the age of 88 at home in France, French media reported on Sunday.Delon "passed away peacefully in his home in Douchy, surrounded by his three children and his family," said a statement issued by Delon's children.Born in 1935, Delon had been in poor health since suffering a stroke in 2019. Best known in China for his performance in the film "Zorro," he has won a César for Best Actor, an Honorary Golden Bear in Berlin, and an Honorary Palme d'Or in Cannes. LONDON - A large blaze that ripped through the roof of central London's historic Somerset House, which houses a large collection of priceless artwork, has been put under control, according to the London Fire Brigade (LFB).No one was injured in the fire which broke out around midday on Saturday.Twenty fire engines and 125 firefighters were deployed to tackle the fire, according to the LFB.Keeley Foster, assistant commissioner of the LFB said the fire was located in part of the building's roof space. The Brigade was called at 11:59 a.m. local time and the fire was under control by 6:51 p.m. Firefighting crews from Soho, Dowgate, Islington, and surrounding fire stations attended the scene.Foster also said the LFB crews will remain on the scene into tomorrow to carry out further operations.Jonathan Reekie, director of Somerset House Trust, said the fire broke out in the west wing of the building, which is mainly comprised of offices and "back-of-house" facilities, and there are "no artworks in that area."Multiple priceless artworks were preserved in the building, including Vincent van Gogh's iconic Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear. LONDON — A fire broke out Saturday at Somerset House, a large arts venue on the River Thames in central London.Smoke billowed from the building and flames could be seen coming from the roof as firefighters on tall ladders showered it with water.The cause of the fire was not yet known, the London Fire Brigade said. Fifteen engines and about 100 firefighters were deployed.Somerset House said all staff and the public were safe and the site was closed. The venue had been scheduled to host a breakdancing event.The neoclassical building, which is nearly 250 years old, houses the Courtauld Gallery that features works by Van Gogh, Manet and Cezanne.APMOSCOW -- Ukrainian troops launched their first strike using Western-made missiles on civilian targets in Russia's Kursk region Friday, said Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova."Notably, this is the first time that civilian objects in the Kursk Region have been struck by Western-made rockets, likely American HIMARS," Zakharova said.She said a bridge over the Seym River in the Glushkovsky District of Kursk was destroyed and "volunteers helping civilians were killed in the strike."She said all those responsible for such acts would face severe punishment from Russia.MOSCOW - Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said Friday that Washington is implicitly legitimizing terrorism by remaining silent on the bombing of Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 pipelines."They want everyone to forget the inconvenient statements made by US leaders about the importance of destroying the pipelines," Antonov said, as quoted by Russia's TASS News Agency. "They aim to shift the blame entirely onto their Ukrainian puppets, although they are fully aware that Kiev will not take a single step without a go-ahead from Washington."Antonov noted that the refusal of US officials to comment on the high-profile topic is "quite telling," and that they are "taking a favorable position for themselves as outside observers.""The functionaries have not lifted a finger to ensure that the truth about the events from almost two years ago comes to light," Antonov added. "America is giving carte blanche for similar crimes in the future."Antonov's comment followed an early arrest warrant issued by Germany's federal prosecutor general for a Ukrainian suspect believed to be involved in the bombing of the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea.In September 2022, the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipelines exploded and sustained severe damage in the territorial waters of Sweden and Denmark. Prior to the explosions, Russia used the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to transport natural gas from Siberia to Germany and other European countries.PARIS — A central stone of the famous Stonehenge monument in southwest England came from 750 kilometers away in northeast Scotland, surprised scientists said Wednesday, solving one mystery but raising another: how did its prehistoric builders move the huge slab so far?The Neolithic circle of giant stones has been a source of wonder and mystery for nearly 5,000 years — in the Middle Ages, the wizard Merlin of Arthurian legend was said to have stolen the monument from Ireland.More recently, scientists have determined that the site's upright sandstones came from relatively nearby Marlborough, while the bluestones arrayed near its center came from Wales.But the origin of the Altar Stone, a unique 6-metric-ton slab lying on its side at the heart of the circle, remained elusive.It was long thought to have also come from Wales, but tests along those lines always "drew a blank", said Richard Bevins, a professor from Aberystwyth University in Wales, and co-author of a new study.This prompted a team of British and Australian researchers to broaden their horizons — and in turn discover something "quite sensational", he told AFP.Using chemical analysis, they determined that the Altar Stone came from Scotland's Orcadian Basin, which is at least 750 kilometers from Stonehenge, according to the study in the journal Nature.The researchers were stunned."This is a genuinely shocking result," study co-author Robert Ixer of University College London said in a statement.The "astonishing" distance was the longest recorded journey for any stone at the time, said fellow co-author Nick Pearce of Aberystwyth University.Whether people about 2,500 BC, were capable of transporting such huge stones from Wales had already been a matter of heated debate among archaeologists and historians.That a 5-by-1-meter stone made the trip across much of the length of the United Kingdom suggests the British Isles were home to a highly organized and well-connected society at the time, the researchers said.They called for further research to find out exactly where in Scotland the stone came from — and how it made its way to Stonehenge.Explaining theoriesOne theory is that the stone was brought to southern England not by humans but by naturally moving ice flows.However, research has shown that ice would actually have carried such stones "northward, away from Stonehenge", lead study author Anthony Clarke from Australia's Curtin University told a news conference.Another option was that the Neolithic builders moved the stones over land — though this would have been extraordinarily difficult.Dense forests, marshy bogs and mountains all formed "formidable barriers" for prehistoric movers, Clarke said.Another option is that the stone was transported by sea.There is evidence of an "extensive network of Neolithic shipping", which moved pottery and gems around the region, Clarke said.To work out where it came from, the researchers fired laser beams into the crystals of a thin slice of the Altar Stone.The ratio of uranium and lead in these crystals act as "miniature clocks" for rocks, providing their age, said study co-author Chris Kirkland of Curtin University.The team then compared the stone's age with other rocks across the UK and found "with a high degree of certainty" that it came from the Orcadian Basin, Kirkland said.Susan Greaney, an archaeologist at the UK's University of Exeter not involved in the study, said it established the first "direct link "between southern England and northern Scotland during this time."The placement of this stone at the heart of the monument, on the solstice axis, shows that they thought this stone, and by implication, the connection with the area to the north, was incredibly important," she told AFP.Agencies via XinhuaThe World Health Organization called for a coordinated global response against the mpox outbreak on Wednesday after declaring it a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, the agency's highest alarm at the moment.The announcement was made on the advice of an International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of independent experts who met earlier in the day and also a day after Africa's CDC declared a public health emergency on the continent."The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the reporting of cases in several neighboring countries are very worrying," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in declaring the PHEIC on Wednesday."On top of outbreaks of other mpox clades in DRC and other countries in Africa, it's clear that a coordinated international response is needed to stop these outbreaks and save lives."Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, has been endemic in West and Central Africa for decades, but DR Congo has become the epicenter of a dangerous new strain that emerged last year and is spreading through sexual and close personal contact. The strain is an offshoot of the clade I virus, which has a case fatality rate of about 10 percent.Mpox is an infectious disease that can cause a rash and skin lesions. Other symptoms include fever, headache and swollen lymph nodes. People with compromised immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness or death if they get mpox. Pregnant women and children are also at higher risk.According to WHO, mpox has been reported in DR Congo for more than a decade, and the number of cases reported each year has increased steadily over that period. Last year, reported cases increased significantly, and already the number of cases reported so far this year has exceeded last year's total, with more than 15,600 cases and 537 deaths.WHO said it needs $15 million to support Africa's mpox response, and it has already released $1.45 million from its emergency reserves. Tedros said the WHO plans to allocate more funding in the coming days."The current upsurge of mpox in parts of Africa, along with the spread of a new sexually transmissible strain of the monkeypox virus, is an emergency, not only for Africa, but for the entire globe," said Dimie Ogoina, WHO's mpox emergency committee chair.He said mpox, originating in Africa, was neglected there, and later caused a global outbreak in 2022.Decisive moment"It is time to act decisively to prevent history from repeating itself," he said.WHO declared a PHEIC over mpox in July 2022 when infections, mainly among gay and bisexual men, spread worldwide. By the time WHO's declaration ended in May 2023, about 87,000 mpox cases had been reported in 118 countries. The virus has remained a serious problem in Africa ever since.The 2022 outbreak was driven by clade II, which generally causes less severe illness, in comparison to clade I, a more dangerous one now spreading in Central and Eastern Africa.The European Commission announced on Wednesday that it will send more than 175,000 vaccines to Africa CDC for distribution, after Africa CDC called on the global community to mobilize 2 million doses.Some European scientists have warned that Europe should also be "very concerned" because countries no longer protect citizens against mpox through smallpox vaccination.Agencies contributed to this story.German companies are determined to ramp up investment in China, motivated by the country's heightened focus on expanding market openness and fast-growing industries, said business executives and market watchers.They said that in the context of a rapidly changing global economy, China's ongoing opening-up measures, flourishing high-end manufacturing and green industries are set to accelerate the emergence of new economic growth drivers and foster innovation. These advancements will present decent opportunities for German businesses.German direct investment in China reached 7.3 billion euros ($8.04 billion) in the first half of the year, compared with 6.5 billion euros for the whole of 2023, according to data from the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, shared with the Financial Times newspaper early this week.Maximilian Butek, executive director and board member of the German Chamber of Commerce in China — East China, said that in the long run, China is viewed as an important innovation market, leading to more research and development investment by German companies.Regarding supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, Butek said that German firms are addressing these challenges by diversifying their suppliers and developing local partnerships in China."Overall, German companies see the benefits of investing in China's growing market and are taking steps to minimize potential risks and overcome challenges," he added.According to the results of the chamber's latest survey, more than half of German companies plan to increase their investments in China, particularly big corporates, automakers and manufacturers of electronic products.Sharing similar views, Xu Daquan, president of Bosch (China) Investment Ltd, a country branch of German industrial conglomerate Bosch Group, said the Chinese market is evolving rapidly, and the vehicle industry holds great potential.Highlighting that China is Bosch's largest single overseas market with an average annual investment of 5 billion yuan ($700 million), Xu said the company's spending in this category will continue to rise."It is possible that going forward, the innovative technologies invented in the Chinese market could be applied in other foreign markets," he added.Following that trend, Volkswagen AG announced in May that it had started building the third phase of the group's mega R&D center in Hefei, Anhui province. The project is scheduled to be operational in 2027.BMW AG also announced in April an additional investment of 20 billion yuan in its production base in Shenyang, Liaoning province, to localize the manufacture of a new generation of BMW models by 2026.Wang Xiaohong, a researcher specializing in cross-border investment at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, said China's strengths will substantially enrich Sino-German economic and trade relations in the years ahead.With China introducing several policies this year to promote high-standard opening-up and explore new growth areas, including support for large-scale equipment renewals and trade-in programs for consumer goods, the Munich-headquartered BSH Home Appliances Group said it will continue to expand its investment in both sales network expansion and innovation within the country.Russia began evacuating thousands more people from its border regions on Thursday after Ukraine said it was advancing deeper into the country in a lightning incursion aimed at forcing Moscow to slow its advance along the rest of the front.The biggest foreign attack on sovereign Russian territory since World War II unfurled on Aug 6 when thousands of Ukrainian troops smashed through Russia's western border.Supported by swarms of drones, heavy artillery and tanks, Ukrainian units have since carved out a sliver of Russia and battles were continuing along a front about 18 kilometers inside Russian territory on Thursday.Authorities in the Kursk region have decided to evacuate its Glushkov district, acting Governor Alexey Smirnov said late on Wednesday.The district directly borders Ukraine and has a population of about 20,000 people. Smirnov said on Telegram that police and other state bodies would coordinate the evacuation process.Russian officials said at least 200,000 people have been evacuated from the border regions following the attack.The Ministry for Emergency Situations said more than 8,000 residents of Kursk, including more than 2,500 children, currently stay in temporary accommodation centers.The work to temporarily resettle people and provide them with everything they need continues, the ministry said.Most residents of Kursk districts bordering Ukraine have been evacuated to safety, the ministry added.Russia's Defense Ministry said on Thursday its forces had recaptured a village in Kursk after it was seized by Ukraine in its cross-border incursion.In the first such claim since the start of the Ukrainian offensive more than a week ago, the ministry said the army had "completed destruction of the enemy and restored control of the settlement of Krupets".Russian forces were continuing to "repel the attempted incursion of the Ukrainian armed forces", it said.Moscow said that using aircraft, artillery and drones, its forces had "foiled the latest enemy attacks", including attempts to break through deeper into Russian territory using mobile groups.As for the neighboring region of Belgorod, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said on Thursday that Russia will send additional forces to defend the border region.The Russian army has prepared "concrete actions" to defend Belgorod from Ukrainian attacks, including "the allocation of additional forces", Belousov was quoted by the ministry as saying.In a video published on Thursday by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's top commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said Kyiv had set up a military commandant's office in the occupied part of the Kursk region, where he said his forces were still advancing and had taken up to 1.5 kilometers in the past 24 hours.Kyiv's forces had advanced 35 km into Kursk since launching the incursion, Syrskyi added.'Buffer zone'Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said Ukraine would create a "buffer zone" in the region to prevent Russian cross-border strikes."The creation of a buffer zone in the Kursk region is a step to protect our border communities from daily hostile shelling," he said.In his nightly address on Wednesday, Zelensky referred to the growing number of Russian prisoners of war taken in Kursk who could be exchanged for Ukrainian fighters."Our advance in Kursk is going well today — we are reaching our strategic goal," he said. "The 'exchange fund' for our state has also been significantly replenished."Ukraine's surprise attack on Kursk has been seen by military analysts as an attempt to force Russia to divert forces from the eastern front, where Russian forces have taken control of a village that is just 16 kilometers from the city of Pokrovsk, which sits abreast of major roads that supply Ukrainian forces in the area.In a daily briefing, the Russian Defense Ministry said its army units "liberated the village of Ivanovka "in the Donetsk region.Russian forces have been inching toward Pokrovsk for months, taking a string of tiny villages in recent months as they seek to reach the outskirts of the city.A Ukrainian official told AFP over the weekend, on condition of anonymity, that the incursion had little effect on fighting in the east but that the "intensity of Russian attacks" had decreased slightly.Agencies contributed to this story.Environmental activists breached airfields at four German airports on Thursday, causing temporary flight suspensions at some of them, marking the latest in a series of similar protests.The Last Generation campaign group said in a statement that eight activists had participated in coordinated protests at Berlin, Cologne Bonn, Nuremberg and Stuttgart airports, demanding that the German government negotiate and commit to a global phase-out of oil, gas, and coal by 2030.German news agency dpa reported that flights were briefly suspended at Nuremberg and Cologne Bonn airports after protesters glued themselves to the ground, while at Berlin Brandenburg Airport, two activists were removed and detained.Nuremberg Airport reported on social media that activist disruptions had led to a brief suspension of flights lasting more than an hour, resulting in six delays, one cancellation, and one rerouted flight.Cologne Bonn Airport halted operations temporarily due to a security breach, with police reporting that intruders cut a hole in the perimeter fence.Stuttgart Airport reported that air traffic remained unaffected after police promptly apprehended two protesters who had attempted to block a taxiway.Last Generation previously announced its plans for disruptive action across various nations in Europe and North America, reported Reuters.Formed in 2021, the group derives its name from activists who view themselves as the final generation before climate collapse."What is at stake right now are billions of human lives," one of the group's activists stated in a video from an airfield, shared on social media on Thursday. "Climate collapse is already a reality for many people. We still have the privilege of being able to do something about it here."German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser condemned the protests on social media network X."These criminal actions are dangerous and stupid," she wrote, warning that the activists "are not just risking their own lives but also endangering others".German politicians have been calling for enhanced airport security since climate activist breaches disrupted air traffic, including two consecutive days of interference at Frankfurt Airport, the nation's busiest airport, last month.Faeser highlighted recent legislation approved by the German Cabinet, designed to strengthen penalties for those breaching airport security perimeters.The proposed bill, still pending parliamentary approval, envisions punishments of up to two years' imprisonment for individuals who deliberately enter restricted airport areas like taxiways or runways, pose a threat to civil aviation, or facilitate such actions by others. This would mark a change from the current system, where such intrusions typically result only in fines.Opponents of a plan to build Europe's largest solar energy project in the English county of Lincolnshire have formed a protest group to urge the government to block the idea.The Meridian Action Group, which claims to have more than 400 members, is angry that decisions about major energy projects are now made by the central government and not by local governments, which handled such issues until recently.All solar energy projects capable of generating more than 50 megawatts are now known as "nationally significant infrastructure projects", or NSIPs, and considered too significant to the United Kingdom's energy needs to be decided at the local level.Councilor Colin Davie, who is on the executive of Lincolnshire County Council's economic development, environment, and planning committee, told the BBC: "I have repeatedly said that these enormous infrastructure projects should not be dumped in our county and ruin the quality of life of our residents. Our agricultural land should be protected."The Meridian Solar Farm, if approved, would generate 750 megawatts of energy, which is enough to power more than 200,000 homes. Currently, Europe's largest solar project is in Germany, south of Leipzig, and can generate 650 megawatts.The Lincolnshire project is also set to include a battery storage facility and 12 kilometers of above-ground cabling to carry power to the nearest spur of the national grid network.The company behind the proposed project, Meridian Solar, has said it would help the UK meet "the urgent need for cleaner forms of generation to replace fossil fuels" and "make a significant contribution to energy security" while playing "a key role in accelerating the country's transition to net-zero".The Meridian Solar Farm would cover 1,012 hectares of farmland, which is the equivalent of 2,800 soccer pitches, south of the town of Spalding and would be the largest, but by no means only, solar power project in the rural county.Two other NSIP solar energy projects have already been approved recently, at Mallard Pass, near Stamford, and Gate Burton, near Gainsborough. And there are at least 10 other large solar projects on the way for Lincolnshire, which is seen as especially suitable because of its fl at topography and undeveloped farmland. But campaigners say it plays a vital role in the production of the UK's food and should not be compromised.Professor Janet Bellamy, an expert in food processing at the University of Lincoln, said at a recent packed public meeting about the project that the industrialization of Lincolnshire's fertile farmland could turn it into a "death valley", with a severely damaged ability to produce fresh vegetables and a limited contribution to national food security as a result. HELSINKI -- Swedish health authorities confirmed on Thursday that they have identified the first case of the more infectious Clade I variant of mpox in the country.The Public Health Agency of Sweden said this is also the first confirmed case of this variant outside Africa.Magnus Gisslen, the state epidemiologist at the health agency, said in a press release that the patient contracted the infection during a visit to the region in Africa where mpox Clade I is spreading.The news came a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern.The Swedish health agency noted that, unlike the previous variant which mainly spread through sexual contact, Clade I is now spreading primarily through household contacts and frequently infects children. Though it causes a similar illness to the Clade IIb variant that spread internationally in 2022, Clade I is considered capable of causing a more severe condition and higher mortality.The agency said that Sweden is prepared for the diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of Clade I patients. It had previously indicated that isolated cases of the variant might be expected in the country.Sweden reported around 300 mpox Clade IIb cases in the previous wave of infection.MOSCOW -- A mandatory evacuation has been ordered for all residents of the Glushkovsky district in Russia's Kursk region, Acting Governor Alexei Smirnov announced on his official Telegram channel Wednesday."The regional operational headquarters has decided to mandate the evacuation of the entire Glushkovsky district," Smirnov said.The Glushkovsky district, which borders Ukraine, comprises two towns and 11 villages.This comes after an earlier announcement of a mandatory evacuation in the settlement of Glushkovo within the district.Law enforcement agencies, local authorities, and volunteers from the Kursk Patriot Center will coordinate the evacuation process.Italy has witnessed a dramatic decline in seaborne illegal migration so far this year, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, reporting a significant decrease in asylum-seeker arrivals compared to last year.New UNHCR figures revealed this week show a 62 percent drop in potential refugee arrivals to Italy this year, with about 35,700 people reaching the country as of Sunday, compared to more than 94,000 during the same period last year.Italy had previously seen a consistent rise in arrivals since 2020, with numbers climbing from more than 67,000 in 2021 to more than 105,000 in 2022, peaking at nearly 158,000 last year — the highest yearly total since 2016.The trend toward decline has been attributed to deterrent policies implemented by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government, according to the Italian newspaper Il Giornale.Meloni, who was elected Italian prime minister two years ago, campaigned on a promise to curb the influx of migrants into the country.Last year, the southern Italian island of Lampedusa was the hardest hit of all landing sites, with about 120 boats carrying between 6,000 and 7,000 migrants arriving on the island on a single day in September.Top destinationBut even with this year's decrease, Italy continues to be the primary destination for migrants, with Spain receiving more than 30,000 arrivals and Greece more than 28,000, placing them second and third respectively, UNHCR data show.Tackling the migrant crisis is a politically divisive issue for the European Union's 27 member states ever since more than a million people reached European shores in 2015.The New Pact on Migration and Asylum, set to take effect in 2026, outlines EU-wide rules for handling unauthorized entries, including screening and deportation procedures.However, this reform does not offer an immediate solution to the ongoing crisis that has deeply divided EU nations over migrant responsibility and burden-sharing obligations.While the bloc attempts to address the issue, critics argue that measures taken, such as the EU's deal with Tunisia that includes assistance to better police the border and prevent migrants without papers from reaching Europe, have negatively impacted tens of thousands of migrants trapped in Tunisia, Sky News reported.On Sunday, the United Kingdom saw a record-breaking influx of more than 700 migrants crossing the Channel seaway to Britain in small vessels, marking the highest single-day arrival since Prime Minister Keir Starmer assumed office with a pledge to combat human trafficking.The Berlin Zoo has announced that its 11-year-old female giant panda Meng Meng is pregnant again with twins and, if everything goes well, could give birth by the end of the month.The announcement was made on Monday after zoo authorities conducted an ultrasound examination over the weekend that showed the developing fetuses. Giant panda experts from China arrived in Berlin on Sunday to assist with preparations for the ultrasound.Meng Meng was artificially inseminated in March. According to the zoo, female giant pandas are only fertile for approximately 72 hours each year."One heartbeat could initially be made out on the ultrasound equipment, and shortly thereafter a second as well," the zoo announcement said, adding that the fetuses are now 2.5 centimeters long, but will grow significantly by the end of the month.Gestation generally takes three to six months, but the zoo said that dormancy — a period of up to several months in giant pandas during which an egg remains suspended in the mother's uterus and does not continue to develop — was the reason for the delay in confirming Meng Meng's pregnancy.Zoo veterinarian Franziska Sutter told media that the pregnancy was still at a risky phase."Amid all the enthusiasm, we have to realize that this is a very early stage of the pregnancy and that a so-called resorption, or death, of the embryo is still possible at this stage," she said.If everything goes smoothly, the cubs will be the first in five years to be born at the Berlin Zoo after Meng Meng gave birth to twin cubs, Pit and Paule, in August 2019. They were the first giant pandas born in Germany and became stars at the zoo.Both Pit and Paule, whose Chinese names are Meng Xiang and Meng Yuan, returned to China in December to join the breeding program under an agreement with the Chinese government.Their parents, Meng Meng and Jiao Qing, arrived at the Berlin Zoo in 2017.In early July, Ouwehands Dierenpark, a zoo in the Netherlands, announced that its giant panda Wu Wen gave birth to a cub. A second cub that was born about an hour later died shortly after birth.The surviving cub is the second born at the Dutch zoo after Fan Xing was born in 2020. Fan Xing, a female, returned to China in September last year to join the breeding program.In Spain, the Madrid Zoo Aquarium formally introduced a new pair of giant pandas, Jin Xi and Zhu Yu, in May in a ceremony attended by Queen Sofia, who has been a giant panda advocate since the 1970s.The arrival came after panda couple Bing Xing and Hua Zui Ba, accompanied by their three Madridborn cubs Chulina, You You and Jiu Jiu, returned to China on Feb 29.In Austria, the Schonbrunn Zoo in Vienna is expecting the arrival of a pair of giant pandas from China under a 10-year cooperation agreement on giant panda conservation that was signed in June.The giant pandas Yuan Yuan and Yang Yang, who are now in Vienna, will return to China after the expiration of an agreement this year.The two sides have applauded their successful cooperation in giant panda breeding, scientific research, technical exchanges, personnel training and public education.Yang Yang, a female, and Long Hui, a male, have had four litters in Vienna totaling five cubs through natural mating, which is a European record.On Aug 8, giant panda twins Bao Di and Bao Mei in Belgium's Pairi Daiza zoo celebrated their fifth birthday in a ceremony attended by new Chinese Ambassador to Belgium Fei Shengchao.The twins and their elder brother Tian Bao, born in 2016, will leave for China this autumn to join the breeding program.Agencies contributed to this story.GENEVA -- The World Health Organization (WHO) declared on Wednesday mpox a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), sounding the alarm over its potential for further international transmission."Today, the emergency committee met and advised me that, in its view, the situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. I have accepted that advice," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference in Geneva.A PHEIC is the highest level of alarm under international health law, Tedros said. "This is something that should concern us all ... The potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying."Mpox cases reported so far this year have exceeded last year's total, with more than 14,000 cases and 524 deaths, according to WHO data. Investigators in Germany believe three Ukrainians sabotaged the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea in September 2022, according to news outlets including broadcaster ARD and newspapers Die Zeit and Suddeutsche Zeitung.The main suspect, a man named as Volodymyr Z, was living in Poland and working as a diving instructor when the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines were destroyed, the reports said, citing unnamed security sources. The sabotage, at a depth of 70 to 80 meters, severed three of the four undersea pipelines that carried Russian gas into Europe, seven months after the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The reports said the German authorities issued a Europe-wide arrest warrant for the 44-year-old, who Der Spiegel news magazine said had since left Poland. The two other suspects, a married Ukrainian couple who also worked as diving instructors, have not been named and do not have arrest warrants against them.Germany's prosecutor general has refused to officially comment on the reports.Germany, Denmark, and Sweden all have territorial waters that the Nord Stream pipelines passed through and all opened investigations into the sabotage. The investigations in Denmark and Sweden both closed without police pinpointing a suspect, although the Swedish investigation did find traces of explosives on objects recovered from the seabed that established the blasts were deliberate acts.Russia and the West blamed each other in the aftermath of the explosions, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has consistently denied his country was involved.According to the reports, police now believe Volodymyr Z and the two other suspects got the skipper of a German-flagged yacht docked off the northern island of Rugen to take them to the vicinity of the pipelines, where they put on wet suits and went under the water.The skipper later identified Volodymyr Z from photographs.Police reportedly also believe they have a photo of the suspect, captured by a traffic camera while he apparently drove a white van containing the diving equipment.Sky News said Poland has confirmed it received a request to arrest the Ukrainian suspect, but that he left the country in early July. The Reuters news agency said Poland complained Germany had failed to include the suspect's name on a database that would have alerted them of his status.Anna Adamiak, a spokesperson for Poland's National Public Prosecutor's Office, told Reuters: "Ultimately, Volodymyr Z was not detained, because, at the beginning of July, he left Polish territory, crossing the Polish-Ukrainian border. Free crossing of the Polish-Ukrainian border by the above-mentioned person was possible because German authorities ... did not include him in the database of wanted persons, which meant that the Polish border guard had no knowledge and no grounds to detain Volodymyr Z."earle@mail.chinadailyuk.comMOSCOW - The Belgorod region has declared a regional state of emergency due to the escalating situation, with authorities considering elevating the emergency status to the federal level, the region's governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on his Telegram channel on Wednesday."The situation in the Belgorod region remains extremely challenging and tense. Daily shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine has led to the destruction of homes, as well as injuries and fatalities among civilians," Gladkov said in a video address."Therefore, we have decided to declare a state of emergency across the entire Belgorod region starting today to provide additional protection to the population and offer further support to those affected," he said.The governor also indicated that the regional government would soon appeal to the federal commission to request declaring a federal-level state of emergency.German companies are increasing their direct investments in China this year, despite their government urging them to diversify.According to data from Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, shared with the Financial Times newspaper, German direct investments in China reached 2.48 billion euros ($2.71 billion) in the first quarter of 2024, increasing to 4.8 billion euros in the second quarter.The total investment in the first six months of 2024 amounts to 7.3 billion euros, surpassing the 6.5 billion euros invested throughout all of 2023.The surge in investment, largely fueled by major German automotive companies, continues despite warnings from Chancellor Olaf Scholz's administration about increasing geopolitical risks linked to the Chinese market and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urging businesses across the European Union to reduce their exposure to Asia's biggest economy.Major companies, particularly automakers, appear to be disregarding Berlin's warnings, continuing to concentrate their investments in the Chinese market.Audi launched an electric vehicle production base in January, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, in a joint venture, plan 1,000 supercharging stations by 2026, and optoelectronics manufacturer Zeiss has opened its largest quality center in Guangdong province.German companies are reinvesting a significant portion of their Chinese profits back into China, with the Cologne Institute for Economic Research reporting that more than half of last year's 19 billion euro earnings were reinvested there.The FT said the trend reflects a new "In China, for China" strategy adopted by companies like Volkswagen, which are increasing production in China to serve one of their largest markets directly."Companies saw a lot of bottlenecks forming during the pandemic and the blockade of the Suez Canal," Friedolin Strack, a China expert at Germany's main business lobby BDI, told the paper."They are determined to reduce all risks in their supply chains by reorganizing them on a regional basis, through localization. That is happening a lot in China, especially."Strong tiesThere was evidence that Germany's economic relations to China might remain strong when top executives from Siemens and Mercedes-Benz joined Scholz on a visit to the world's second-largest economy in April.A German Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey released in June revealed German companies have been increasingly optimistic about China's economy, with half of them planning to boost investments there.The survey showed that 53 percent of German companies intend to increase their investments in China over the next two years, with respondents representing diverse sectors, including 30 percent in machinery and industrial equipment, and others across automotive, mobility, business services, electronics, and chemical industries.A report from the American Chamber of Commerce in China in February revealed growing optimism among US investors, with most maintaining their operations in China.Analysts cited in the report noted that beyond China's vast market, its resilient supply chains and improving innovation capabilities continue to attract foreign investment.Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Ukraine's biggest attack on Russian territory since the start of the conflict was aimed at improving Kyiv's negotiating position ahead of the possible peace talks and at slowing the advance of Russian forces, and ordered his army to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops."One of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord, strife, intimidate people, destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society," Putin told a televised meeting with government officials."The main task is, of course, for the defense ministry to dislodge the enemy from our territories," he said.Kyiv launched a surprise offensive into southwestern Russia's Kursk region last Tuesday, capturing over two dozen settlements in the most significant cross-border attack on Russian soil since World War II.Putin, in his most detailed public remarks on the incursion to date, said Ukraine "with the help of its Western masters" was trying to improve its position ahead of possible talks.He questioned what negotiations there could be with an enemy he accused of firing indiscriminately at Russian civilians and nuclear facilities."The enemy will certainly receive a worthy response," he said, noting that he expected further Ukrainian attempts to destabilize Russia's western border.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine's cross-border assault was a matter of security for Ukraine and that Kyiv had captured areas from where Russia launched strikes.His top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Ukraine controlled 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory, far larger than the figures given by Russian officials.On Tuesday, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Georgiy Tykhy told a news conference that the sooner Russia agreed to a "just peace", the sooner it would stop its cross-border raids.Stretching troopsA Ukrainian official told AFP over the weekend that the operation was aimed at stretching Russian troops and destabilizing the country after months of slow Russian advances across the front line.Authorities in Kursk announced they were widening their evacuation area to include the Belovsky district, home to some 14,000 residents.The acting governor of Kursk, Alexei Smirnov, said Ukraine controlled 28 settlements in the region, and the incursion was about 12 km deep and 40 km wide.In the Kursk region alone, 121,000 people had already left or been evacuated and another 59,000 were in the process of being evacuated.Ukrainian forces in Kursk were trying to encircle Sudzha, where Russian natural gas flows into Ukraine, while major battles were underway near Korenevo, about 22 km from the border, and Martynovka.Video from social media and verified by Reuters showed Ukrainian soldiers raising their flag in the Russian village of Guevo, in Kursk.Smirnov also issued a missile warning, saying people needed to take shelter in rooms without windows and with solid walls.Temporary accommodation has been prepared, he said.As Russia is evacuating residents from a second border region, the Belgorod region which borders Kursk, some 11,000 civilians were evacuated.Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the whole region was under a missile alert, and told people to shelter in their basements.But he added he was "sure that our servicemen will do everything to cope with the threat that has arisen".Some statisticians believe artificial intelligence, or AI, can predict crashes in the economy before they happen and financial forecasting using advanced analytics combined with machine learning could soon identify early red flags in the economy before they lead to disaster.This would offer unprecedented grace periods where interventions could safeguard societies worldwide and systems that increasingly rely upon each other in an international market.By training AI on historical records, it has already been possible to anticipate natural disasters for many years. Whether this be the seismic activity required to spot impending earthquakes or air currents telegraphing a hurricane, AI, despite its infancy, already demonstrates a proven track record in its ability to be trained on large data sets to spot potential impending disasters in the natural world.Spotting a man-made crisis, however, relies upon identifying much more complex and unpredictable factors. Previous attempts to learn from historical patterns, such as the 2008 crisis or the Great Depression, relied on linear events and trends to identify risks. However, today’s complex and interwoven global financial system is even more volatile than its predecessors, meaning that hidden connections and factors can cause ugly surprises for analysts reliant on human brain power and computing alone.Financial crashes come in many forms. A bank may suddenly go under, a nation’s currency can have its value evaporate, war or debt can rear its ugly head to disrupt a previously stable system. These events all have data indicating problems that gradually get worse until an event triggers rapid deterioration. The trigger is relatively straightforward to spot, however it is the undercurrent of societal issues bubbling in the background beforehand making the system vulnerable to a single trigger that is both of interest and harder to spot.This is made all the more difficult when considering all economies tolerate ongoing societal issues as a reality of life.Distinguishing the benign from the insidious is where it is hoped AI can make a difference.AI algorithms can rapidly process such data and spot correlations deeply hidden in vast quantities of numbers. This can enable policies to be preemptively emplaced before a situation deteriorates.Producing AI data is one thing however; understanding it is another.Understanding why an AI algorithm has made its prediction is crucial, and difficulties in doing so will, no doubt, hamper trust in the system as well as lead to difficulties in applying appropriate remedies.It is also feared that inherent biases in data fed into the technology could also lead to inaccurate forecasts, along with errors inputted into the data sets themselves.The widespread implementation of AI in the finance sector means that any attempts to use the technology in a predictive manner must be tightly regulated for these reasons.Governments must ensure that AI systems are implemented transparently and with measures to guarantee accountability in order to protect the general public. The interconnected nature of international financial markets means that any mistakes could have severe knock-on effects for countless people around the world.Humans must be trained in the art of deciphering AI forecasts in a meaningful manner applicable to rapidly changing situations. It takes skill and experience to understand the nuance of exactly which solutions should be applied to safeguard the economy once AI has flagged an alert. Whether this be increasing cash flow to certain financial sectors or reducing interest or borrowing rates, having an independent body made up of experts from cross-discipline fields increases the chances of success.AI holds much promise in protecting us from economic harm. It can aid financial institutions and guide policymakers with greater situational awareness in what is becoming an increasingly volatile financial environment. Its development must, however, be closely scrutinized and applied with care. Poland has unveiled plans to make 48 M903 Patriot missile launchers, in a move it says will greatly strengthen its national security.Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz and representatives from United States defense giant Raytheon and Polish arms maker PGZ Huta Stalowa Wola announced the deal on Monday.The 48 missile launchers will be produced in Poland for the Polish army using technology provided by the US company. The equipment will be sufficient to form at least six Patriot missile batteries, the companies said as the agreement was inked in the town of Sochaczew, at the headquarters of the 3rd Warsaw Air Defense Missile Brigade.The first of the new weapons should be ready for use in 2027.Kosiniak-Kamysz said the agreement between the nations and some of their major defense contractors was the result of "our government betting so strongly on security" and that it was a product of Poland's decision to increase defense spending to around 4 percent of GDP."We are investing in the Polish defense industry, in the armed forces of the republic for the security of us and our allies," the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying. "Today's event is unprecedented in scale, taking place on Polish soil, involving Polish companies, utilizing American technology, and in collaboration with American firms and the US government."The deal was finalized after several Polish politicians, including Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, called for a greatly improved and upgraded military in the wake of the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and in light of its potential to spill over into nearby European countries, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.Reuters quoted US Ambassador to Poland Mark Brzezinski as saying the cooperation highlights the "intrinsic trust between Poland and America" and "enhances not only our ability to protect the skies above NATO territory, but also our military interoperability".The Patriot missile system was designed to intercept missiles and drones in the air and protect cities and critical infrastructure. Brzezinski said it will play a key role along Poland's 230-kilometre border with Russia.The 48 M903 Patriot missile launchers will be part of air defense systems in Poland worth $1.23 billion, Kosiniak-Kamysz added.Polskie Radio said the deal to produce the missile launchers marks the start of the second phase of what is known as the Wisla program, which opens the door to additional defense contracts being signed between 2027 and 2029.Poland and the US have already worked together on other aspects of Patriot missile systems and produced a range of components, including transport and loading vehicles, technical support containers, radar systems, launcher parts, and missile components.The latest phase will be supported by subcontractors including Zaklady Mechaniczne Tarnow and Wojskowe Zaklady Elektroniczne. MADRID -- Three people have died in Spain since Sunday due to heat stroke, as extreme temperatures continue to grip much of the country, emergency services reported on Tuesday.In Madrid, a 76-year-old man was discovered dead at his home by health services on Tuesday. He was found unconscious with a body temperature exceeding 40 degrees Celsius.Another incident in Madrid involved a 44-year-old man, who died on Monday. He was found semi-conscious, with a body temperature above 41 degrees Celsius, as reported by Spanish public television. The man has pre-existing medical conditions, which may have worsened his condition.On the Spanish island of Mallorca, in the Western Mediterranean Sea, a 70-year-old German tourist collapsed on Sunday while hiking in a remote area. His wife alerted emergency services, but despite their efforts, he could not be saved, the Spanish Civil Guard reported.Much of Spain has been on alert recently due to soaring temperatures and extreme or high risk of forest fires, as the fourth heatwave of this summer hit the country. Temperatures in many regions have exceeded 40 degrees Celsius.Spain recorded 608 deaths attributable to high temperatures in the first week starting August, almost double the previous week's total of 335, making it the worst week of the year, according to the Carlos III Health Institute.KYIV - Russia launched 38 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine overnight on Tuesday and the air defense intercepted 30 of them, the Ukrainian Air Force said in a statement.The projectiles were destroyed over eight regions in southern, northern and central Ukraine, the statement said.The Russian forces also fired two Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles at Ukraine from the Voronezh region, the air force said, without giving further details.Infrastructure facilities, including a gas pipeline and a hospital, were damaged. One person was injured in the attack in Ukraine's northeastern city of Sumy, the Sumy Regional Military Administration said in a statement.A nationwide air alert was issued in Ukraine on Tuesday morning after a MIG-31 fighter, a carrier of Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles, took off from an airfield in Russia.MOSCOW - About 11,000 people were evacuated from the Krasnoyaruzhsky district in Russia's Belgorod region due to increased activity by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Tuesday on his Telegram channel.Of the evacuees, approximately 1,000 are currently staying in temporary accommodation centers."Yesterday, residents of the Krasnoyaruzhsky district left their homes due to the operational situation. These evacuees are now provided with food, bedding, and essential supplies. I hope the situation will stabilize soon, allowing them to return home," Gladkov said.Large wildfires raging near the Greek capital Athens have forced thousands to evacuate, with flames reaching heights of 25 meters, as much of Europe contends with extreme heat conditions.Italy endured intense temperatures over the weekend and French authorities issued weather warnings for southern areas of the country.The United Kingdom was bracing for its hottest day of the year so far on Monday, with temperatures in some areas set to reach above 34 C.High temperatures and strong winds fueled a massive wildfire north of Athens, where more than 400 firefighters, supported by aircraft, battled flames that burned trees, houses and cars and sent smoke clouds billowing over the capital, Reuters reported.The fire brigade described attempts to combat the flames as "superhuman". Evacuation orders expanded on Monday, with at least five more communities instructed to leave, adding to the hundreds of people who had already fled from at least eight villages on Sunday, the BBC reported."The situation remains dangerous as the fire is spreading between residences," said fire brigade spokesperson Vassilios Vathrakogiannis, noting that the fire spread "like lightning" because of strong winds.In Varnavas, a village of about 1,800 people that is 35 kilometers north of Athens, flames swallowed up trees and shrub land.Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias cautioned that high temperatures, strong winds and drought conditions had put half of the country at significant risk for wildfires. Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis returned to Athens from his holiday to address the situation.The historic town of Marathon, east of Athens, was among those evacuated on Sunday."Everything is burning," Giorgos Tsevas, a resident of nearby Polydendri village, said. "I have 200 olive trees there, but now they are gone."Climate experts attribute the current extreme temperatures primarily to human-caused global warming.The World Health Organization has cautioned about the serious effects of increasing temperatures on European populations, noting that as the continent warms faster than any other, heat-related causes claim an estimated 175,000 lives annually.Rome has been experiencing a continuing heat wave since the beginning of last month, with temperatures persistently above normal levels.Cited by Euronews, meteorologist Lorenzo Tedici from Italy's Il Meteo weather forecasting service emphasized the link between fossil fuel use since 1850 and planetary heating."These 21st-century anomalous heat waves are unfortunately caused by the anthropogenic greenhouse effect," he said.The United Nations' nuclear watchdog said on Sunday that a fire near the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant had "no impact" on the facility's safety."No impact has been reported for nuclear safety," the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement. Both Kyiv and Moscow said there had been no rise in radiation levels.In a later statement, the IAEA said it had requested that its team get "immediate access to the cooling tower to assess the damage".Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for the blaze at the cooling tower outside the plant's perimeter, and the IAEA chief said the conflict between the two sides continues to imperil the Zaporizhzhia facility, which is one of the 10 biggest nuclear plants in the world."These reckless attacks endanger nuclear safety at the plant and increase the risk of a nuclear accident. They must stop now," IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement, without attributing blame for the attack.The Russian operator of the plant said Ukraine had caused the fire with a military strike but that the reactors were in cold shutdown.Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the plant, said the fire occurred "as a result of shelling of the city of Enerhodar by the Ukrainian Armed Forces".Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Zaporizhzhia administration, said in a Telegram post on Monday the blaze has been "completely extinguished".Russian nuclear corporation Rosatom said in a statement on Monday that the Ukrainian army's attack on the plant can be characterized as an act of nuclear terrorism.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine of "nuclear terror" following the attack and urged the IAEA to respond.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of starting the fire.He posted a video on Telegram on Sunday showing a large plume of smoke coming out of one of the towers on the plant's territory, saying radiation indicators were normal but blamed Russia for using the nuclear plant "to blackmail Ukraine, and all of Europe and the world".'Dislodging' enemyOn Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his army to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops."One of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord, strife, intimidate people, destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society," Putin told a televised meeting with government officials.Ukrainian forces rammed through the Russian border a week ago and swept across some western parts of Russia's Kursk region. Governor Alexei Smirnov said on Monday the civilian toll has risen to 12 dead and 121 injured.In the neighboring Belgorod region to the south, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said evacuations had begun from the Krasnaya Yaruga district because of "enemy activity on the border".Responding to a question on Ukrainian troops crossing into Russian territory, China's Foreign Ministry said it has noted the development."China's position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear," a ministry spokesperson said on Monday. "The Chinese side calls on all parties to observe the three principles for de-escalating the situation, namely no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no fueling the flame by any party."China will continue to maintain communication with the international community to play a constructive role for the political settlement of the crisis, the spokesperson said.Agencies contributed to this story.A 16 percent fall in the number of overseas students at United Kingdom universities has led to them lowering entry requirements in a bid to attract more British students.The drop in the number of overseas students was triggered by changes to the UK's visa rules, which make it harder for people to secure a student visa, and almost impossible for them to bring family members with them.With far fewer overseas students on campus, and with their fees, which are considerably more than the fees paid by local students, no longer fl owing into universities' coffers, the institutions have been looking for other ways to fill their classes. The situation has led to a dip in A-level grades considered acceptable for entry.The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, or Ucas, which handles applications on behalf of UK universities, told The Telegraph newspaper many students are aware of the situation and are holding out for places in elite institutions that they would not ordinarily be qualified to attend.Jo Saxton, chief executive of Ucas, told the paper many more students with firm offers appropriate for their qualifications have turned them down and are "in many cases trading up" to gain access to more exclusive institutions."Some of the vice-chancellors who I've had conversations with about this, they've definitely clocked that behavior, and some of the most selective institutions have talked to me about recognizing that and wanting to keep that option open for students," she told the paper.She said the situation could lead to exclusive universities filling their classes with slightly less qualified students, and lower-level universities losing potential students qualified to study in them, and therefore failing to fill their rosters.The UK government said last week changes to visa rules introduced by the previous Conservative Party government earlier this year has resulted in the number of dependents arriving in the UK alongside international students falling by 80 percent, from 32,900 in the first quarter of 2023 to 6,700 in the same period this year.The number of overseas students applying for visas to study in the UK fell from 39,900 in the first quarter of 2023 to 35,000 in the same period in 2024.Under the new rules, the only international students allowed to bring family members with them to the UK are those studying for a PhD.Additionally, overseas students are no longer allowed to switch a student visa into a work visa upon completion of their studies, which has also deterred many people from choosing the UK as the destination for their studies.The Labour Party government, which replaced the Conservative Party on July 4, has not yet said whether or not it intends to change the visa rules it inherited.MOSCOW -- Ukraine's attack on the Russian border will receive a "worthy response" and the Russian military's main task is to knock the Ukrainian forces out of Russian territories, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday."The enemy will certainly receive a worthy response, and all the goals facing us will undoubtedly be achieved," the Russian leader said at an operational meeting via videoconference on the situation in the border regions.Putin said it is obvious that the Ukrainian army will continue to try to destabilize the situation in the border zone in order to destabilize the internal political situation in Russia.The president called on the Russian Federal Security Service, together with the National Guard, to ensure the regime of the counter-terrorism operation and an effective fight against Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in the border regions.Ukrainian forces crossed the Russian border last Tuesday and broke into parts of Russia's Kursk region. Currently, the Ukrainian military holds 28 settlements in the region, according to Alexei Smirnov, the region's acting governor.The situation in the Kursk region is complicated, Smirnov said, adding that about 120,000 people had been evacuated.In the neighboring Belgorod region to the south, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov also said on Monday the region has begun relocating its residents in the Krasnoyaruzhsky District to safer places amid increased military activity near the Ukrainian border.MOSCOW -- The infrastructure of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has sustained serious damage for the first time since the start of the ongoing shelling and attacks by Ukrainian forces, ZNPP Director of Communications Yevgenia Yashina said on Sunday."The infrastructure of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has for the first time suffered serious damage as a result of a strike by the Armed Forces of Ukraine," Yashina was quoted by Russia's TASS News Agency as saying.She added that the Ukrainian forces carried out the attack using a kamikaze drone. Despite the damage and subsequent fire at the cooling system facilities, Yashina said that the plant's operations have not been affected."The cooling tower is used for cooling, but currently, the reactor units are shut down, so the tower is not in use. The sprinkler pools are sufficient for cooling at this time," she said.Earlier, Yevgeny Balitsky, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, said that the cooling systems of the ZNPP caught fire as a result of the Ukrainian strike. He assured that all six reactor units of the plant are in a cold shutdown, eliminating any risk of a steam explosion.While the Russian side accused Kiev of deliberately attempting to destroy the plant and incite "nuclear terror," Ukraine's state-run nuclear energy operator Energoatom said Russia's "negligence" or arson could have sparked the fire.Energoatom also claimed, without providing evidence, that Russia has been using the plant's cooling towers to store military equipment and explosives.PARIS — The success of the Olympic Games has surpassed the wildest dreams of many in France, but in the next weeks, President Emmanuel Macron still will have to face the reality of the deadlocked politics created by his calling of snap legislative elections.With the Games just around the corner, the polls left France with three major blocs in parliament — the left as the largest followed by Macron's centrist forces and the far right — with none of them close to mustering the numbers for an overall majority.The former government of Macron allies, under Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, has carried on in a caretaker capacity throughout the Games, but five weeks after the elections, the country still does not have a new prime minister.While the Games have lifted what was a morose mood in France, it is far from certain this will give a new impulse to the remaining three years of the president's mandate."The fact that things are going well, that we are seen as beautiful and successful abroad, has struck a chord in a country that was experiencing decline and was no longer capable of doing great things collectively," said political commentator Emmanuel Riviere.'Frustrated' voters"This changes the collective climate but not the political situation: The situation remains blocked, many voters are frustrated ... The French are putting things into perspective and remain very angry with Emmanuel Macron."Macron's approval ratings remain well under 30 percent, with the president keeping a low profile during the election campaign and the Games, spending most of the Olympics ensconced in the Mediterranean holiday residence of the French president.The number one priority for Macron will be naming, and winning approval for, a new prime minister and government, a process that appears to remain as blocked as it was before the Games.As visitors and Parisians gasp in awe for a last time at the Olympic cauldron tethered to a balloon, sources within the executive are playing down the prospects of a rapid breakthrough.Macron, known to use his vacations at the Fort de Bregancon holiday residence for deep reading and reflection, is "still thinking", according to a person close to him.Agencies Via XinhuaBarely a month after taking office, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing his first major challenge with violent protests raging in several cities across the country. Anti-immigration sentiments, fanned by the rise of the far right in the United Kingdom and compounded by the cost of living crisis, can be blamed for the current state of affairs, experts said.After a month-long honeymoon during which he made his international debut at the NATO summit in Washington and attended the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics, Starmer now has the grim task in hand of quelling social unrest at home.Violence broke out in a number of places after rumors circulated online that a Muslim immigrant was behind the July 29 stabbing in Southport, northwest England, which left three young girls dead.Protesters took to the streets and stormed mosques and hotels housing asylum-seekers in major cities, including London, Liverpool, Plymouth and Belfast."The rioting is politically driven," Danny Ewart, a Portsmouth resident, told China Daily. "I am frustrated by the direction this country is headed, but we need to come together and work on our differences. We also need to manage the immigration numbers as it's not sustainable."Starmer has condemned the riots, calling it "far-right thuggery".British monarch King Charles has called for unity and understanding after the riots, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said in a statement on Friday."It is the first major challenge facing Starmer," Xu Ruike, associate professor of British politics and foreign policy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, told China Daily."Although it is a rare event, it reflects the underlying issues in UK society, in particular the rise of the far right," Xu said."Rioting is entirely down to inept Conservative and Labour governments," Billy Bessey, who took part in anti-immigration demonstrations in Portsmouth last weekend, told China Daily.The rioting is wrong but the blood is on the hands of politicians, he added."Anti-immigration sentiment is just the trigger," Huang Fei, associate professor at the School of International Studies and research fellow at the School of Global and Area Studies of Renmin University of China, told China Daily.Huang said the financial burden of households worsened after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, sending inflation to more than 10 percent in 2022. Extra checks and tariffs after Brexit and the uncertainty of the talks on free trade thereafter have added to livelihood woes.The lackluster performance of the British economy in recent years also added to public dissatisfaction with the government. The GDP grew by 0.1 percent year-on-year in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics. The government declared at the end of July the country was "broke and broken".Net migration was unusually high in 2023, at 685,000, driven by an increase in non-European Union citizens coming to the UK, according to the Migration Observatory."The large number of migrants is putting great pressure on the society, leading to reduced social welfare for the general public, especially the ones in the lower income segment," Huang said.An increasing number of people are growing angry with the large number of illegal migrants coming to the country and anti-immigrant sentiment was a major factor in the Brexit referendum vote, Huang added."Reform UK is the only way we will ever get to control our borders," Bessey said.At the election last month, the Reform UK party led by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage won 14 percent of the votes, but only gained five seats."It is underrepresented in parliament as the UK's first-past-the-post voting system favors the bigger parties," Xu of Beijing Foreign Studies University said.The riots come amid a broader right-wing populist surge in European countries. During the European Parliament election in June, far-right parties made major gains. In France, President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the lower house of parliament in a bid to block the far-right National Rally party from coming to power."It reflects the political polarization, further complicating the political landscape, combined with a crisis of trust in government," Huang of Renmin University of China said.Police have blamed peddling of false information online, amplified by social media, for the violence."The misinformation that was widely circulated plays up to the insecurity felt by the public, fostering a willingness among individuals to instinctively believe the social media posts," Xu said.The Online Safety Act, designed to regulate social media companies, was passed in October but is not expected to be enforced until next year.Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas Symonds said on Friday the government would revisit the law's framework."We need to be mindful of what information we share. Otherwise, it sets a very dangerous precedent," Ewart said.Nick Ive contributed to this story.shaoxinying@chinadaily.com.cnOn July 4, the British public voted overwhelmingly to reject the Conservative government of Rishi Sunak and deliver the Labour Party's Keir Starmer to office, thus bringing Labour to power for the first time since 2010. After years of political instability, controversy and chaos that have beset the United Kingdom, as well as economic stagnation and decline, it is hoped that the new government will offer a spell of stability, sensibility and pragmatism in its policies both at home and abroad. With Starmer commanding a massive majority, he is sure to forge his own vision for the country.It is hoped that the UK will be able to earnestly and productively reengage with one of its key economic partners — China. The previous government is guilty of destroying the bilateral relationship with Beijing due to its mismanagement of Britain's foreign policy as a whole.It pursued a highly ideological path with Brexit, paid excessive subservience to the United States, and deliberately whipped up anti-China sentiment domestically to distract attention from its failures. Then there was opposition from certain parliamentary members' groups which were subject to the influence of foreign organizations.The new government, therefore, offers an opportunity for Britain to reset its relations with the world on more sensible terms. Although we should not expect geopolitical realities to change, and while Starmer is by no means a radical, having purged the "anti-war Left "from his party while in opposition, what we can realistically expect is a foreign policy based more on pragmatism, national interests and sensibility, as opposed to one premised on ideology, identity and short-termism.For example, the previous Conservative government was obsessed with pursuing a bilateral trade agreement with the US on the sole premise of Anglophone exceptionalism, as opposed to actual benefits.Even as a protectionist, Washington showed no interest in such a deal, and Downing Street happily sacrificed its other interests on a whim, especially those concerning China. Its routine weaponization of anti-China sentiment for short-term political gain also made it impossible to engage with Beijing even as Sunak professed that he wished to do so in certain areas, becoming a victim of internal party conflict.As a result, what we are likely to see from a Labour government is not a drastic change in policy, but certainly a rebalancing that will make it possible for London to have an amicable relationship with Beijing again and to compartmentalize disagreements and areas of cooperation. Already, Starmer's government is pursuing a "reset" with the European Union that has been described as an "end to the Brexit era"; in other words, an end to the theatrical nationalism and imperial-era nostalgia of the Conservatives and a return of cooperation-focused policies. When the time is right, we are likely to see this happen with China too.While the previous government was subjected to backbench rebellions frequently led by highly ideological anti-China members of Parliament, Starmer's large-scale majority and emphasis on party discipline will mean his agenda will not be disrupted, and therefore, backbench MPs cannot impose "costs" on the government for engaging with Beijing. For example, owing to factional conflict within the Conservative Party, individuals such as Iain Duncan Smith and Liz Truss held disproportionate influence over the government's positions on China and threatened rebellion constantly, which is what produced such jarring inconsistencies.However, Beijing should nonetheless be aware that US-funded groups and organizations, as well as the Taiwan region, will continue to press for influence among the new batch of MPs, as well as a hostile mainstream media, and thus the so-called "golden era" will not return. This, however, is preferable to the Cold War-style conflict that was actively sought by some in the previous administration. Ultimately, the UK continues to have significant interests in a cooperative, open and mature relationship with China, one which can be made to work despite ideological and geopolitical differences. As Britain enters a new era, it is time for a mature "reset "based on national interests.The author is a British political and international-relations analyst. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily. Far-right anti-immigrant riots that flared in several United Kingdom towns and cities earlier this month could ignite again, the country's justice secretary warned on the weekend, as Prime Minister Keir Starmer canceled a vacation in order to focus on overseeing the response.Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood wrote in The Observer newspaper on Sunday that the situation remained tense and that police officers will continue to work hard to identify and arrest rioters and online agitators in a bid to fully restore order."If you stoke fear, or take part in violence, the full force of the law will be brought against you. Justice will be done," she wrote. "The impact of these days of disorder will be felt for months and years to come."A spokesperson for the prime minister said on Thursday he had delayed his vacation in the wake of the riots, which began on July 30 and continued nightly until Aug 7.Starmer's decision followed a YouGov poll that found 70 percent of respondents thought it was not the right time for him to take a break.Starmer said on Friday it was clear many rioters had stopped attacking mosques and asylum seeker accommodation because of the lengthy prison sentences being handed to fellow agitators."We have to stay on high alert going into this weekend," he said. "We absolutely have to make sure that our communities are safe and secure and feel safe and secure."Stephen Parkinson, the UK's director of public prosecutions and head of the Crown Prosecution Service, told the Sunday Times newspaper sentences of up to 10 years could be dispensed to rioters in the coming days.By Saturday, police had arrested 779 people in connection with the unrest and formally charged 349 of them.Parkinson said many more arrests and charges were expected in the coming days."As well as seeing a more significant number of charges coming through the system in the next few days, (prosecutions are) going to include more serious charges with stiffer penalties," he added.The far-right riots began after three young girls were stabbed to death and several others were injured at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the northwestern England seaside town of Southport on July 29.The suspect in that attack was incorrectly identified online as a radical Islamist asylum seeker. Police quickly pointed out that their 17-year-old suspect was not known to have been a Muslim and was born in the UK, but the unrest continued for several more days.The riots seemed to ease last week due to a combination of online misinformation being countered, a huge police presence, counter-demonstrations from anti-fascist groups, and the deterring impact of long prison sentences.As the 2024 Paris Olympics draw to a close, all eyes are on the final medal count. And this year, the Olympic medals hold special significance, paying homage to one of France's most iconic landmarks — the Eiffel Tower.Charles Leung, CEO of French luxury jewelry brand Chaumet, shares the intriguing story behind the medal's striking appearance."The Olympic committee gave us a very special brief — to create a medal that has never been seen before in Olympic history, one that would make France shine on the global stage," Leung told China Daily.Chaumet's storied history with the French royal family made them the natural choice for this prestigious commission. "More than 240 years ago, when Napoleon was crowned, he came to Chaumet for his coronation crowns. We've had the honor of designing tiaras and crowns for the French royal court over the centuries," Leung explained. "So when there was something this important for France, the country turned to us again."Chaumet's opportunity to design the medal for the 2024 Paris Olympics was largely due to its parent company, LVMH Group, a premium partner of the global sporting event.Antoine Arnault, head of image and environment at LVMH, emphasized the significance of the 2024 Paris Olympics. "It's an exceptional event that hasn't been held in France for 100 years, one of the most closely followed in the world, and it's taking place in the city where most of our maisons were born," Arnault said. He added that as the leading French group, being involved in the Paris Olympics "was not only an obvious choice, but also a responsibility".Chaumet's design team set out to integrate the Eiffel Tower into the medal's structure, using recycled steel bars from the iconic landmark itself. "The Eiffel Tower was originally meant to be a temporary structure for the 1889 World's Fair, but it was such a sensation that Paris decided to keep it," Leung said."The issue was that the material was not good enough to last for so long. So what happened was that, over the years, little by little, bar by bar, section by section, the original metal framework has been replaced with stronger steel to ensure the tower's longevity."Chaumet's designers had the idea of cutting the Eiffel Tower steel into a hexagonal shape, as it holds deep symbolic meaning for the French."The hexagon represents the shape of France itself," said Leung, adding that it also evokes the image of the humble but hardworking bee, which the French have long associated with national unity and industriousness.Adding this slice of Parisian history into the medal's core was a delicate process. "We wanted each athlete to be able to bring home a piece of the Eiffel Tower, a tangible connection to the host city that would stay with them forever," Leung explained. The team carefully engineered the setting to showcase the recycled metal, surrounding it with a sunray pattern that radiates outward.Strict specificationsLeung also said the designers had to meticulously adhere to the Olympics' strict specifications. "The weight, thickness and other technical details had to be perfect. This is not just another piece of jewelry — it's a prize that carries immense meaning and prestige," he said.Additionally, the design incorporates France's rich history of world fairs. "The Eiffel Tower was actually built as a temporary structure for the 1889 World's Fair. That was the first time Chinese migrants came to Paris," he said.Leung reflected on the honor of crafting these unique medals. "This is one of the most prestigious orders we've ever received, second only to Napoleon's crown. However, that was for personal use. We believe these medals will become the most beautiful jewels ever crafted by human hands," he said."These medals can't simply be bought. They must be won, earned through an arduous journey filled with sweat, tears, successes and failures. It requires the love and support of an entire community to achieve."wangmingjie@mail.chinadailyuk.comThe newly elected Labour Party could be ushering in a positive new era between the British government and the European Union.Reporter: Julian SheaVideo：Brian ChangMOSCOW -- Russia has declared a state of emergency in the Kursk region due to the tense situation there, Russia's Ministry of Emergencies said on Friday."On August 9, an extraordinary meeting of the government commission for the prevention and elimination of emergencies and ensuring fire safety took place. On the agenda of the discussion was the situation in the territory of the Kursk Region due to the attack by the Ukrainian armed forces. A response at the federal level has been established in the region," the ministry said in a statement.Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry said on Friday that a military operation to defeat the Ukrainian forces in Kursk is ongoing, with the Ukrainian side suffering a loss of 945 troops and 102 military vehicles since their incursion into the region.A Polish woman who was afraid of needles since childhood has now studied acupuncture at the London Academy of Chinese Acupuncture for three years.

Will she be able to graduate successfully?Reporter: Xing YiVideo: Han JingRussian forces were battling Ukrainian troops for a third day on Thursday, after the latter smashed through the Russian border in the Kursk region, which introduced a state of emergency on Wednesday.In one of the biggest Ukrainian attacks on Russia in more than two years of conflict, about 1,000 Ukrainian troops rammed through the Russian border in the early hours of Tuesday with tanks and armored vehicles, covered in the air by swarms of drones and pounding artillery, Russian officials said.Shelling and drone attacks killed five Kursk residents, according to the Russian Health Ministry, and 31 people were injured, including six children.The governor of Kursk announced an "emergency situation" on Wednesday evening, a move that gives authorities the power to restrict movement to bring the situation under control.Russia's National Guard said it had beefed up security around the nearby Kursk nuclear power station and its four reactors.Ukrainian forces have pushed to the northwest of the border town Sudzha, nearly 500 kilometers southwest of Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry said."Attempts by individual units to break through deep into the territory in the Kursk direction are being suppressed," the ministry said.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday described the attack in Kursk as a "large-scale provocation".During a meeting with the heads of the Defense Ministry, General Staff and the Federal Security Service, Putin said, "Kyiv has undertaken another large-scale provocation, firing indiscriminately from different types of weapons, including rockets, at civilian buildings, residential houses and ambulances."Army Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov told Putin during the meeting via video link that Russian forces had halted a thrust by up to 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers — more than three times the figure that the Defense Ministry stated on Tuesday — and would push them back to the border."The enemy's advance deep into territory in the Kursk direction was stopped by the actions of the units covering the state border together with border guards and reinforcement units, with airstrikes, missile and artillery fire," Gerasimov said.Moscow also said its forces had destroyed a US-made Bradley Fighting Vehicle that Ukraine was using in the incursion.Kyiv's objectives remain unclear, with some analysts suggesting that it is an attempt to stretch Russia's army, forcing them to move units away from the eastern Donetsk region where they have been advancing, Agence France-Presse reported.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made no reference to the attack in his nightly video address on Wednesday, and exhorted Kyiv's soldiers to press on and weaken Russian forces.Several Ukrainian brigades stationed along the border region said they could not comment. Ukraine's Defense Ministry and General Staff also said they would not comment.'No violation of policy'In Washington, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the United States was in contact with Ukrainian authorities about their actions in Kursk.Miller said US rules on Ukrainian use of US weapons — authorized in areas over the Russian border — remained in effect, but that Ukraine's actions were "not a violation of our policy".There was fighting around Sudzha, the last transit point for Russian gas heading to Europe via Ukraine. The Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhhorod pipeline carried about 14.65 billion cubic meters of gas last year, about half of Russia's gas exports to Europe.A Russian TV station broadcast images from the city center showing destroyed buildings, debris strewn across the street and large craters in the ground from artillery hits.Russian energy giant Gazprom said on Thursday it would continue shipping gas through the Sudzha metering station.Ukraine's gas transmission operator said Russian natural gas was transiting to European consumers normally. Just 60 kilometers to the northeast lies the Kursk nuclear power station.Agencies contributed to this story.Thousands of people took to the streets across the United Kingdom on Wednesday to protest against anti-immigrant, far-right rioting that had flared throughout the previous week.The counter-demonstrations were peaceful and deterred far-right rioters, giving the country its first quiet night since July 30.Police chiefs said residents had effectively retaken their streets, while cautioning that far-right violence could return.Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley described it as a "very successful night" on which far-right violence had "abated", while Tiffany Lynch, acting chairwoman of the Police Federation, which represents 145,000 officers, said on Radio 4's Today program that officers were optimistic but still experiencing "heightened anxiety".Diana Johnson, UK minister of policing, fire and crime prevention, said on Today that many officers were exhausted after several long days battling rioters."That's why we needed to have a show of strength last night," she said on Thursday.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday vowed no "letup" in moves to prevent further far-right riots across England, after more anticipated street violence failed to materialize overnight."It's important that we don't let up here," Starmer told media outlets as he visited a mosque and met community leaders in Solihull, West Midlands.Wednesday's counter-demonstrations, badged under the slogan "Hope not Hate", took place in communities including Birmingham, Brighton, London, Newcastle, Sheffield and Southend.While they undoubtedly dissuaded far-right rioters, thousands of extra police officers also kept a lid on things, and troublemakers were also likely deterred by prison sentences of up to three years handed to those involved in earlier riots.Troublemakers may also have realized they had been manipulated by online misinformation that wrongly attributed a horrific knife attack in the northwestern town of Southport on July 29 to an Islamic extremist migrant.In the multiday violence that followed that incident, police made more than 400 arrests and charged 140 people.Johnson, the policing minister, said officers will continue to sift through video and online content seeking other participants and organizers of the trouble. Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer stated that a tragedy had been prevented following the cancelation of three Taylor Swift concerts scheduled for this week in Vienna.The performances, originally set for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, were called off after authorities arrested individuals suspected of planning an attack in the area, possibly targeting the concert venue itself.The decision to cancel Swift's three sold-out shows at Ernst Happel Stadium in the Austrian capital was made by government officials on Wednesday."Thanks to the intensive cooperation of our police and the newly established DSN (Austria's security agency) with foreign services, the threat was identified early on, combated, and a tragedy prevented," Nehammer said in a social media post.As many as 170,000 fans had bought tickets for the three concerts, and organizers promised to refund all ticket holders for the canceled shows.Many fans of the performer, who are known as Swifties, had spent thousands of euros on travel and accommodation to attend the shows, reported Associated Press.Swift's promoter, Barracuda Music, announced the cancelations of the three shows, part of Swift's Eras tour, in an Instagram post on Wednesday."With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety," it said.Nehammer emphasized the gravity of the situation in his statement, saying: "The situation surrounding the apparently planned terror attack in Vienna was very serious."Franz Ruf, Austria's general director for public security, announced on Wednesday that two people had been arrested on suspicion of planning attacks inspired by the Islamic State group on large events in the Austrian capital.He said the authorities had apprehended a 19-year-old Austrian citizen on Wednesday morning in Ternitz, Lower Austria, and that a second arrest occurred later in Vienna, but gave no further details."According to the current status of the investigation, the two suspects became radicalized via the internet," Ruf said. He noted that the 19-year-old had made "an oath of allegiance" to Islamic State last month.Police conducted a major operation in Ternitz, focusing on the residence of the 19-year-old suspect, where they said they found chemical substances."During our investigations, we identified preparatory actions and noted that the 19-year-old suspect had a particular focus on the Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna," Ruf said.In 2017, a suicide bomber killed 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena, in the United Kingdom. The attacker, Salman Abedi, detonated a bomb as fans were exiting the venue.In November 2020, an Islamic State sympathizer killed four and wounded 23 in a shooting rampage in central Vienna, before police fatally shot him.BRUSSELS - July 2024 is the second-warmest month worldwide in the data record, trailing slightly behind July 2023, the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service reported on Thursday.The average surface air temperature of July was 16.91 degrees Celsius, 0.04 degrees Celsius lower than a year ago, marking the end of a 13-month period where each month was the hottest on record for that time of year, according to a report released by Copernicus."The streak of record-breaking months has come to an end, but only by a whisker," said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the agency.Although July 2024 has narrowly fallen short of becoming the hottest month, the Earth still experienced two warmest days on record on July 22 and 23, with the global average temperature reaching 17.16 degrees Celsius and 17.15 degrees Celsius, the report said."The overall context hasn't changed, our climate continues to warm," Burgess said, adding that the devastating effects of climate change will continue until global greenhouse gas emissions reach net zero.While the year 2023 has been confirmed as the warmest year on record, the report suggested that the year 2024 is increasingly likely to surpass 2023 and become the new warmest year.From January to July 2024, the global temperature anomaly is 0.27 degrees Celsius higher than the same period in 2023. For 2024 not to surpass 2023 as the warmest year, the average anomaly for the remaining months would need to decrease by at least 0.23 degrees Celsius.This rarely occurred in the entire dataset, increasing the likelihood of 2024 becoming the hottest year, the report added.LONDON -- Thousands of anti-racism protesters took to the streets in many cities and towns of the United Kingdom on Wednesday to counter far-right demonstrations after days of unrest following Southport stabbing.By 11 pm (2200 GMT), most of the planned far-right demonstrations, numbering more than 100, didn't materialize after the British government deployed heavy police force to maintain order and large numbers of anti-racist protesters swarmed streets in cities and towns like London, Bristol, Brighton, Birmingham, Liverpool, Hastings and Walthamstow.Anti-racism protests held placards with words such as "Smash fascism & racism", "Refugees welcome. Stop the far-right" and "Love, not hate." In Brighton, only a small number of far-right protesters turned up and were outnumbered by huge anti-racism crowds.This came as a relief for the UK after days of far-right protests, targeting Muslims and the immigrant population in general, gripped the country, resulting in police officers being injured, stores being looted, hotels housing asylum-seekers being stormed.The unrest was sparked by online disinformation that wrongly claimed the suspect who killed three children in Southport, northwest England, at the end of July was a Muslim immigrant. It was a 17-year-old boy named Axel Rudakubana born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents that was later charged with murder.More than 100 rioters have been charged following the disorder and their cases have been swiftly processed in the court system. On Wednesday, three men were jailed, with one being given three years of prison time.UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was deeply alarmed by reports that a large number of communication devices exploded across Lebanon and in Syria on Tuesday and Wednesday, his spokesman said."The secretary-general is deeply alarmed by reports that a large number of communication devices exploded across Lebanon, as well as in Syria, on Sept. 17 and 18, killing at least eleven people, including children, and injuring thousands," said Stephane Dujarric, the spokesman, in a statement.Dujarric said the UN chief urged all concerned actors to exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation, and urged the parties to recommit to the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities to restore stability."The United Nations supports all diplomatic and political efforts to end the violence that threatens to engulf the region," said the spokesman.Lebanese officials reported that explosions targeting pagers and handheld radios killed at least 26 people, including two children, and injured more than 3,200 others across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday.In Lebanon's neighbor Syria, 14 Hezbollah fighters were injured when their communication devices exploded in the capital, Damascus, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor.BEIRUT - The death toll in explosions of wireless communication devices across Lebanon on Wednesday rose to 14, with injuries up to 450, said the Lebanese Health Ministry.Explosions were heard Wednesday afternoon in Beirut's southern suburb and several regions in southern and eastern Lebanon.Security reports indicated that a wireless communication device exploded in Beirut's southern suburb during the funeral of four Hezbollah members, with similar explosions igniting fires in cars and residential buildings, resulting in several injuries.Local media said the devices involved were identified as ICOM V82 models, walkie-talkie devices reportedly made in Japan. Emergency services were dispatched to the scene to transport the injured to local hospitals.Meanwhile, the Lebanese Army Command issued a statement urging citizens not to gather near the sites of the incidents to allow medical teams to enter.So far Hezbollah has not commented on the incident.The explosions followed an attack a day ago, in which the Israeli military allegedly targeted pager batteries used by Hezbollah members, resulting in the deaths of 12 individuals, including two children, and approximately 2,800 injuries.In a statement on Tuesday, Hezbollah accused Israel of being "fully responsible for the criminal aggression that also targeted civilians", threatening to retaliate. Israel has not yet commented on the explosions.Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border escalated on Oct 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack the day before. Israel then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced that Israel is at "the beginning of a new stage of the war" against Hezbollah.UNITED NATIONS - The UN General Assembly (UNGA) passed a non-binding resolution on Wednesday demanding an end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory within the next 12 months by an overwhelming margin.The resolution was adopted with 124 votes in favor, 14 against and 43 abstentions, during the UNGA's 10th emergency special session considering Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.The resolution demanding that Israel comply with all its legal obligations under international law, including advisory opinions by the International Court of Justice, was introduced by the State of Palestine on Tuesday and was co-sponsored by more than two dozen nations.By the newly adopted resolution, the UNGA "demands that Israel brings to an end without delay its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which constitutes a wrongful act of a continuing character entailing its international responsibility and do so no later than 12 months from the adoption of the present resolution".The UNGA also demands that Israel comply without delay with all its legal obligations under international law, including as stipulated by the International Court of Justice.In remarks before the vote, Mohamed Issa Abushahab, the permanent representative of the United Arab Emirates to the United Nations, said the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza must be addressed through unimpeded access to those in need, a ceasefire deal and the full implementation of all related Security Council resolutions.A credible peace process must be relaunched to work towards a two-State solution to diffuse this conflict, he said, expressing support for the State of Palestine's full statehood and UN membership. "The time has come to end the suffering," he noted.Introducing the draft resolution on Tuesday, Riyad Mansour, the permanent observer of the State of Palestine to the United Nations, called for the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.He said the Palestinian people have been steadfast in the pursuit of their inalienable rights, just like all other citizens worldwide who seek self-determination."The Palestinians want to live, not survive -- they want to be safe in their homes, they want their children to go to school without fear. They want to be free in reality as they are in spirit," said Mansour.BEIRUT -- Nine people were killed and more than 300 others injured in explosions of wireless communication devices across Lebanon on Wednesday, the Lebanese Health Ministry reported.Explosions were heard Wednesday afternoon in Beirut's southern suburb and several regions in southern and eastern Lebanon.Security reports indicated that a wireless communication device exploded in Beirut's southern suburb during the funeral of four Hezbollah members, with similar explosions igniting fires in cars and residential buildings, resulting in several injuries.Local media said the devices involved were identified as ICOM V82 models, walkie-talkie devices reportedly made in Japan.

We saw children and elderly people," Abiad said.AFPUnited Nations human rights experts have criticized Western countries for allowing Israel to go unpunished over its military operations in Gaza, which they said have now reached "alarming levels" as violence intensified in the West Bank to levels "not seen in two decades".They also questioned whether Israel's membership in the UN should be reconsidered, given its attacks on the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, and disregard for UN advisories as a whole.At a news conference on Monday, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese questioned Israel's membership at the UN for its "zero" respect for the organization.Albanese noted that Israel's "genocidal assault" has devastated entire families, razed neighborhoods and destroyed essential infrastructure.She said UNRWA is an "untouchable mechanism" that justifies the permanent responsibility of the UN toward the Palestinian people. According to the UN, at least 220 employees of the subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly have been killed in Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip since Oct 7.Arie Afriansyah, associate professor at the Faculty of Law at Universitas Indonesia, told China Daily there was no precedent to "unseat" a UN member state.He said the only matter now was "the support that mainly comes from the US to Israel".George Katrougalos, special rapporteur on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, said it was "clear now to everybody" that there is an evolving tragedy in Palestine."However, this tragedy is an issue not just for the Palestinians. It is immediately related to the future of multilateralism and the UN system of rules," said Katrougalos.Double standards"I think that it is important for the future of a fair, just, democratic, equitable international order, not with double standards regarding international crimes. But (to) have a uniform position based on principles, values, and the United Nations charter," said Katrougalos as he called for the immediate recognition of the state of Palestine.Tlaleng Mofokeng, special rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, said it was important to note that even before Oct 7, the situation for Palestinians "was already incompatible with the realization of the right to health".Abdalfatah Asqool, an international law lecturer at the University of Palestine in Gaza, said: "There are some countries that are still arming Israeli and also those countries also must face sanctions, as what happened to some other countries that even did not do anything close to what Israel (is doing) in the Gaza Strip," said Asqool."Therefore, if they do not want to spark a regional war, the international community must stop Israel now," he added.Meanwhile, Israel announced the expansion of its aims on Tuesday, widening its nearly yearlong fight against Hamas in Gaza to focus on Hezbollah along its northern border with Lebanon amid reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to replace his defense minister with a hawkish rival.Netanyahu's office said he laid out the aim in an overnight security cabinet meeting.Tens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the border by exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah. Israel has said it prefers a diplomatic solution that would see Hezbollah moved farther back from the border.Agencies contributed to this story.The United Arab Emirates said on Saturday it will not support Israel's "day after" plan in Gaza unless a Palestinian State is established, making its stance clear despite having signed the Abraham Accords in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel.UAE Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan reiterated this position in a post on X.In May, Abdullah also rejected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's suggestion the UAE could participate in the civil administration of the Gaza Strip, with security control under Israel.Abdullah said Netanyahu "lacks legitimate authority to implement this step, or take any similar measures". The UAE "refuses to be involved in any plan aimed at providing cover for the Israeli presence in the Gaza Strip", he added.The Abraham Accords are a series of agreements aimed at normalizing diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab countries."It is an assertion that for the UAE, the Palestinian cause is a critical issue and that was clear through utilizing the relationship with Israel to send humanitarian aid, initiate the vaccination campaign in Gaza, etc," Rasha Al Joundy, a senior researcher at the Dubai Public Policy Research Centre, told China Daily."There is no scenario that the region will enjoy peace without a Palestinian State. Any other temporary solution, the UAE doesn't have an interest to be part of."Signing the Abraham Accords doesn't mean that Israel gets to be arrogant in its proposals for the day after, especially (with) its neighbors."Almost a year into the conflict, Israel has yet to meet its objectives of eliminating Hamas in Gaza and securing the release of about 100 hostages still being held by the militant group, while Palestinian civilians continue to pay a heavy price.The Palestinian death toll has swelled to at least 41,226, while Netanyahu faced criticisms from citizens and the hostages' families over his prolonged efforts to reach a cease-fire deal.Recently, the Israeli military, after months of denial, admitted a high probability that three Israeli captives who died in Gaza in November might have been killed in its own strikes.Israel's military assault has also begun to spill over to other parts of the region, particularly against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthis in Yemen, and more recently Iran.On Sunday, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Houthi group, warned their military actions against Israel would intensify. This warning followed a missile attack launched by the Houthis earlier in the day targeting central Israel."Our operations will continue as long as the aggression and siege on the Gaza Strip continue," al-Houthi said in a televised address, Xinhua News Agency reported.In an interview with the BBC, the United Nations' Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator Sigrid Kaag said the international community is collectively failing innocent civilians in Gaza as it is not meeting the needs or creating prospects and hope for civilians in the besieged enclave. AMMAN -- Jordan's King Abdullah II instructed on Sunday Jafar Hassan to form new cabinet, state media Petra reported. JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday warned Houthi forces in Yemen that Israel would retaliate after a missile they launched struck central Israel, an area typically safe from projectiles."This morning, the Houthis launched a surface-to-surface missile from Yemen into our territory," Netanyahu told his cabinet ministers at the start of their weekly meeting. "Anyone who attacks us will not escape our wrath.""The Houthis should already know that we exact a heavy price for any attempt to harm us," he added, referring to an Israeli airstrike on the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port city of Hodeidah on July 20, which killed at least six people, injured dozens of others, sparked a large fire, and caused extensive damage to the port's infrastructure.Houthi forces claimed responsibility for the missile attack, saying in a statement on Sunday that they had launched a hypersonic missile targeting the area of Jaffa, in southern Tel Aviv. According to their statement, the missile reached "a military target deep" in Israel.The Israeli military reported that the missile was fired from Yemen at 6:21 am local time (0321 GMT). "An initial inquiry indicates the missile most likely fragmented in mid-air," the military said in a statement, adding that the attack triggered air raid sirens across central Israel and sent residents running to shelters."Several interception attempts were made by the Arrow and Iron Dome aerial defense systems, and the results are under review," the military added.Fallen fragments of interceptors were found in open areas and near the Paatei Modi'in railway station, close to Ben Gurion Airport. A fire also erupted in Kfar Daniel, another location in the area. Israeli Fire and Rescue Services were dispatched to extinguish the blaze.No injuries have been reported so far.The missile marked the second time a projectile from Yemen has reached central Israel, following a Houthi drone attack in July that killed one person in Tel Aviv.AMMAN -- The government of Jordan's Prime Minister Bisher Khasawneh submitted its resignation on Sunday after the parliamentary elections, the state-owned Al Mamlaka TV reported.UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations and its partners have vaccinated against polio more than 560,000 children under 10 in the Gaza Strip, UN humanitarians said on Friday.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the first round of the emergency vaccination campaign in the north, central, and southern zones of Gaza wound up on Thursday.OCHA said that during the final phase of the first round in northern Gaza, the United Nations and its partners reached more than 112,000 children with the vaccine over three days.The office said its partners are set to begin the second round of the vaccination campaign in about four weeks.The humanitarians said a new analysis by the WHO found 22,500 people injured in Gaza as of July 23 are estimated to have life-changing injuries that will require rehabilitation services now and for years to come. The injuries represent a quarter of the overall injuries the Ministry of Health reported in that period.OCHA said the report comes amid the decimation of the health system in Gaza, with just 17 of 36 hospitals partially functional, while primary health care and community-level services are often suspended or made inaccessible due to attacks, insecurity and repeated evacuation orders.The office said it has mobilized humanitarian partners to assess the needs of people affected by the latest two-day operation by Israeli forces in Tulkarm and Tubas in the West Bank. That operation concluded on Thursday, with nearly a dozen Palestinians reportedly killed.OCHA said dozens of families were displaced when their homes were damaged on Wednesday and Thursday during the operation, which involved Israeli air and ground troops, with exchanges of fire between Palestinians and Israeli forces."The use of lethal war-like tactics in these areas of the West Bank has raised concerns over excessive use of force which appear to exceed law enforcement standards," OCHA said.Saudi Arabia and China can complement each other by cooperating in R&D as well as in innovation and facilitate Saudi manufacturing and logistics in its vision for a new regional industrial hub, said Bandar Bin Ibrahim Alkhorayef, Saudi minister of Industry and Mineral Resources, in an interview with China Daily. (Reporting by Jan Yumul)UNITED NATIONS - Six staff members of the UN relief agency for Palestinians, known as UNRWA, were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.A school-turned-shelter for around 12,000 people was hit by Israeli airstrikes on Wednesday, and six UNRWA staff members were among those killed, Guterres said on X, formerly Twitter."What's happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable," he said. "These dramatic violations of international humanitarian law need to stop now."At least 18 Palestinians were killed and many others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a UN-run school sheltering displaced people in the central Gaza Strip on Wednesday, according to Palestinian sources.The sources told Xinhua that an Israeli warplane fired at least one missile at the shelter in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said that aid workers were among the victims.ABU DHABI - Premier Li Qiang arrived here Wednesday for an official visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the invitation of the UAE's Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.Upon his arrival, Li said that bilateral ties between China and the UAE have maintained strong growth momentum since the two countries established diplomatic relations 40 years ago, and their friendship has grown stronger and continues to flourish.Li noted that the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in May has drawn a new blueprint for China-UAE ties, charting the course and injecting strong momentum for advancing bilateral relations and cooperation.Li pointed out that under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, China-UAE relations have developed comprehensively, rapidly and in depth with practical cooperation in various fields going deeper and cultural exchanges becoming increasingly active.GAZA - Hamas on Wednesday reiterated its readiness to implement the ceasefire agreement based on the US proposal and rejected any new conditions on this agreement from any party.During a meeting with Qatari and Egyptian mediators in Doha, the Hamas negotiating delegation expressed its "continued positivity and flexibility" in reaching a ceasefire agreement for the Gaza Strip. They emphasized the requirement for the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the entire territory of the Strip, according to a statement released by Hamas.Hamas also emphasized that the management of the Strip is an internal Palestinian affair with an agreed-upon Palestinian vision. The statement noted that Hamas welcomes the holding of a national dialogue with all Palestinian factions and forces to agree on such a national vision.The statement came as negotiations mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States to secure a Gaza ceasefire have stalled. Despite objections from Egypt and Hamas, Israel insists on keeping its forces in the Philadelphi Corridor, a 100-meter-wide and 14-km-long buffer zone along the Egypt-Gaza border.US President Joe Biden revealed a three-phase proposal in late May, hoping it would lead to an end to the ongoing Gaza conflict and the release of all hostages.Hamas has repeatedly expressed its commitment to what was agreed upon during past talks, based on the US proposal and UN Security Council Resolution.GAZA - At least 14 Palestinians were killed and 10 others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a UN-run school sheltering displaced people in the central Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian sources on Wednesday.Palestinian security sources told Xinhua that an Israeli warplane fired at least one missile at the school-converted shelter in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. Medical sources said the strike killed 14 people and wounded 10 more, while the Hamas-run Gaza government media office confirmed that aid workers were among the victims.Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that the Israeli Air Force has conducted a precise strike on militants operating inside a Hamas command and control center in the al-Nuseirat area.It added Hamas militants "plan and execute attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel" using this center embedded inside a compound that previously served as the Al-Jaouni school.The attack came following a previous Israeli bombing of the UN-run school on July 6, which killed at least 16 Palestinians, most of them children and women.Also on Wednesday, the al-Nuseirat refugee camp saw a separate Israeli airstrike targeting a residential house, leaving at least four Palestinians dead, Palestinian security sources told Xinhua.The Israeli army also launched an airstrike on Wednesday on the Al-Qarra family home in the town of Khuza'a, east of the Khan Younis city in southern Gaza, killing at least 13 people from the family, including children and women, according to local sources and eyewitnesses.There has been no comment from the Israeli side on these two airstrikes.Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks in the strip has risen to 41,084, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Wednesday.TEHRAN - Iran would support any peace plan agreed by Russia and Ukraine, a top Iranian security official said on Wednesday, according to Iran's semi-official Fars news agency.Ali Akbar Ahmadian, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, made the remarks at the 14th meeting of the BRICS high-ranking officials responsible for security matters and national security advisors in St. Petersburg, Russia.Ahmadian proposed that BRICS should assign a group to follow up on achieving peace between Russia and Ukraine, Fars reported.He also suggested establishing a "BRICS Security Commission" to address common threats including narcotics, terrorism, and cybersecurity.The BRICS security meeting focused on in-depth exchanges on global security threats, counterterrorism, cybersecurity, global governance and other topics, making necessary preparations for this year's BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan.The BRICS is the acronym for an emerging-market cooperative mechanism that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Iran's full membership in the group took effect on Jan 1, 2024.China's development will provide a broader market and more investment opportunities for enterprises from Saudi Arabia and other countries, amid a sluggish global economic recovery and growing uncertainties around the world in relation to economic and trade cooperation, Premier Li Qiang said on Wednesday.Li arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday for the Fourth Meeting of the High-Level Chinese-Saudi Joint Committee and an official visit to Saudi Arabia. He is also scheduled to visit the United Arab Emirates.Speaking at a meeting on Wednesday with representatives from the Saudi business community, Li said that China welcomes more companies from the country to visit and explore opportunities in China in order to better share in its development dividends.As the country is advancing Chinese modernization on all fronts through high-quality development, China will continue to unleash its vast potential in terms of domestic demand as an ultra-large-scale market with more than 1.4 billion people, he said.China is Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner, and Saudi Arabia is China's largest trading partner in West Asia and North Africa, with bilateral trade exceeding $100 billion for two consecutive years.Noting that China and Saudi Arabia enjoy a stable political relationship and strong momentum in economic and trade cooperation, Li said it is hoped that Saudi enterprises will deepen their involvement in the Chinese market, and invest in and expand their businesses in China with greater confidence.As the country is transforming traditional industries with digital technologies to make them smarter and more eco-friendly, the premier said more new economic growth points and high-growth enterprises will be fostered in areas such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and biomedicine.He called on Saudi companies to expand and strengthen cooperation with their Chinese counterparts in traditional fields such as oil and gas, petrochemicals and infrastructure, while promoting cooperation in emerging and future-oriented industries.Li also reiterated the Chinese government's commitment to building a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based and internationalized.China will further ease market access, implement measures to lift restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector, and accelerate the opening-up of telecommunications and other services sectors, he said, assuring better services and guarantees for foreign enterprises to continue flourishing in China.The representatives from the Saudi business community expressed an optimistic outlook regarding the Chinese economy, saying that they are willing to seize the opportunities and keep investing in China.They said they will further leverage the two countries' complementary advantages, innovate cooperation models and deepen cooperation in areas such as energy, new energy, finance and electric vehicles.On Wednesday, the Chinese premier also held talks with Secretary General of the Gulf Cooperation Council Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi.Li spoke highly of the GCC's contribution to promoting regional integration and facilitating regional peace, stability and development, saying that China is ready to strengthen communication and coordination with GCC countries to further deepen cooperation for mutual benefits.Noting that China and GCC countries are natural partners, with their economies being highly complementary, Li called on the two sides to strengthen the alignment of their development strategies and speed up negotiations on free trade agreement.The Arab League has renewed its call on Israel to stop its aggression in Gaza and the West Bank as its secretary-general accused Tel Aviv of a year of "genocide of ethnic cleansing" supported by some Western powers.During the meeting of the 162nd Arab League Council at the Level of Foreign Ministers held in Cairo on Sept 10, Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, the Arab League’s secretary-general, accused some Western powers of providing a safety umbrella for Israel's crimes and political cover for the killings, leading to the prolongation of the conflict and its expanding repercussions, according to the Weibo account of China Central Television (CCTV) International News.Aboul-Gheit said the world had witnessed almost a year of genocide, a year of ethnic cleansing and of displacement, as he accused the international community of failing to take decisive action, which has enabled Israel to carry on its military activities with impunity."The great powers in the world today are either unwilling or unable to exert pressure on the occupation," he was quoted as saying by the UAE media outlet The National.The meeting, chaired by Yemen, was also attended by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, a first in 13 years, European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini, and UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag.Fidan urged his counterparts to unite and continue putting pressure on the international community to reject Israel’s aggression. He warned that those who continue to support Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be held accountable for it.Gokhan Ereli, Gulf studies coordinator at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies in Turkiye, told China Daily, the most significant takeaway from the Arab League meeting was the growing disconnect between regional countries and Western powers, particularly the United States."Despite the EU's efforts, the US has shown little to no willingness to take clear, serious, and realistic measures against Israel, which has further hardened the stance of regional countries," said Ereli."In this context, it is evident that the Arab League has taken an unusually firm and unequivocal position on the Palestinian issue, and we can expect this to evolve into not just a unified stance among Arab nations, but also one that includes key regional powerhouses like Turkiye. More importantly, this could translate into unified action," he added.The Arab League’s condemnation came on the same day Israel bombed the Al-Mawasi "safe zone" in Gaza, which killed 19 people and wounded 60 others, Al Jazeera reported. The report also noted that a US-made 2,000-pound (907kg) MK-84 bomb was used in the latest attack.Despite the uncertainties in safety, UNRWA, or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, said its vaccination drive for Gaza’s children against the poliovirus would continue."Despite the significant incident yesterday where the Israeli Army stopped a UN convoy with staff traveling to provide #polio vaccinations, our teams have been able to vaccinate thousands of children in north #Gaza today," said UNRWA on its X account on Sept 10."This is a race against time, the spread of polio is a very real threat. Our colleagues continue to do the impossible to reach every child under the age of 10 across the GazaStrip," it added.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres took to social media to condemn Israel’s air strikes on what was supposed to be an Israeli-designated zone for displaced people in Gaza.In a post on X, he noted that the Palestinians "had moved to this area in search of shelter and safety, after being repeatedly instructed to do so by the Israeli authorities"."I repeat my call for an immediate ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages still held in Gaza," said Guterres.Ahmed Ayesh Alnajjar, director-general of international relations at the Education Ministry in Gaza, who has been displaced many times over the past year, said there "is nothing called safe zone" as it "is a big lie".Alnajjar told China Daily of several families that have been victims of Israeli bombings across Palestinian territories from Rafah to the Al-Farouq Mosque in the Al-Bureij refugee camp, central Gaza Strip, and Tubas City in the northern West Bank —- "all in a few hours only".RAMALLAH - Regional countries, including Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, and Iran, on Tuesday strongly condemned the deadly Israeli attacks on a crowded tent camp housing displaced Palestinians in Khan Younis of southern Gaza.The continuation of the war against the Palestinian people and the US support have put the region at risk, Palestinian Presidency spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh said in a press statement carried by the official Palestinian news agency WAFA.The strikes on the designated safe zone on Tuesday killed at least 40 people and injured more than 60 others, according to the Hamas-run Gaza government media office. At the same time, local health authorities reported the arrival of 19 bodies at hospitals, saying more victims are likely being trapped under the rubble."If it were not for the unprecedented US support politically, militarily, and financially, the leaders of Israel would not have dared to commit such crimes, defying all resolutions of international legitimacy and international law by killing children, women and the elderly without accountability," said Rudeineh.The Palestinian Foreign Ministry warned in a press statement that the continued impunity of Israel and its leaders and the provision of protection for them gives them more time to commit the most heinous crimes of killing and displacing Palestinians.In a statement, Jordan's Foreign Ministry strongly condemned Israel's "systematic and continuous" targeting of civilians and shelters for displaced persons in Gaza.Ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah reaffirmed the kingdom's absolute rejection and denunciation of Israel's continued violations of international law and international humanitarian law, accusing Israel of committing "war crimes and genocide" against the Palestinian people in Gaza.He emphasized that the absence of a firm international stance to curb Israeli aggression and compel it to respect international law has led to unprecedented killing, destruction, and humanitarian disaster.Echoing a similar sentiment, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry stated that the absence of effective international action to put an end to the human suffering in Gaza has become a real challenge to the credibility of all humanitarian standards and values.Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani also called on international organizations, especially the UN Security Council, to take immediate and effective actions to deter Israel and curb its "unbridled crimes".The overnight airstrike took place in the Al-Mawasi area in Khan Younis, where a sprawl of tent camps has been erected along the Gaza coast to serve as a humanitarian zone for displaced persons. The Israeli military said the strike targeted senior Hamas leaders operating from a hidden command center in the area.Israel has launched a large-scale retaliatory offensive against Hamas in Gaza following a surprise attack by Hamas across the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages. The Israeli offensive has so far killed 41,020 Palestinians and injured 94,925 others in the coastal enclave, according to Gaza-based health authorities.GAZA -- The Palestinian death toll from the ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 41,020, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Tuesday.During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 32 people and wounded 100 others, bringing the total death toll to 41,020 and injuries to 94,925 since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out in early October 2023, it added.At least 40 Palestinians were killed and more than 60 others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Tuesday."Israeli warplanes launched rockets at tents housing displaced Palestinians at the entrance to Mawasi in Khan Younis, causing widespread destruction and resulting in numerous casualties," Palestinian medics told Xinhua.Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said that the attack targeted senior Hamas leaders operating from a hidden command center in a humanitarian area of Khan Younis.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage.GAZA - The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 40,988, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Monday.In the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 16 people and wounded 64 others, bringing the total number of deaths to 40,988 and injuries to 94,825 since the conflict began in early October 2023, according to the statement.Meanwhile, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said in a press statement that its teams in northern Gaza have faced a severe shortage of fuel supplies for nearly three weeks. The rescue organization indicated that it is now operating at minimum capacity, exacerbating the humanitarian and health crisis in the area.The Indonesian and Kamal Adwan hospitals in northern Gaza also warned of a potential suspension of services due to fuel shortages, amid the ongoing Israeli blockade and restrictions on fuel supplies. Both hospitals said that an imminent suspension of medical services would pose a major threat to the lives of the sick and injured within their facilities.Israel has been conducting large-scale military operations and imposing a severe blockade on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, in response to a surprise attack by Hamas on Israeli towns adjacent to the strip. GAZA -- At least 40 Palestinians were killed and more than 60 others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Palestinian and Israeli sources said Tuesday."Israeli warplanes launched rockets at tents housing displaced Palestinians at the entrance to Muwasi in Khan Younis, causing widespread destruction and resulting in numerous casualties," Palestinian medics told Xinhua.Dr. Mohammed Al-Mughair, director of supply at the Civil Defense, confirmed that rescue teams had recovered 40 bodies and come to the aid of more than 60 injured individuals.He said that the bombardment created craters up to nine meters deep, suggesting the Israeli use of explosive missiles. "We are facing one of the most horrific massacres committed in this war," he lamented.Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said that the attack targeted senior Hamas leaders operating from a hidden command center in a humanitarian area of Khan Younis.These individuals, he said, were involved in planning and executing "terrorist operations" against the army and Israeli civilians.Adraee added that the army took extensive measures to reduce civilian casualties.Hamas has not yet commented on these reports.Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage.BEIJING - Premier Li Qiang of the State Council will travel to Saudi Arabia to chair the Fourth Meeting of the High-Level Chinese-Saudi Joint Committee and visit Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from Sept 10 to 13, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning announced on Monday.Li is invited by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman and the UAE's Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Mao added.DAMASCUS -Israel carried out air strikes on a scientific research facility and an arms depot in central Syria on Sunday night, a war monitor reported.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack targeted sites in Masyaf, in western Hama province. Ambulances were seen rushing to the area, the Britain-based group said, adding that a large fire was seen near Wadi al-Oyoun in western Hama following the strikes.Syrian state television reported that air defenses responded to "Israeli aggression" in central Syria. The Observatory said several missiles were intercepted.The extent of casualties and damage was not immediately clear.Israel has conducted numerous strikes in Syria in recent years, often targeting what it says are Iranian-linked and Hezbollah positions.GAZA/JERUSALEM — The conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza entered its 12th month on Saturday with little indication of respite for the Palestinian territory as the humanitarian disaster deepens.Israeli military strikes across the Palestinian Gaza Strip killed at least 61 people in the space of 48 hours, medics said on Saturday.Airstrikes on two former schools that were housing displaced people, one in Gaza City and one in Jabalia, killed at least 12 people, Palestinian medics said.The Israeli military said the strikes targeted Hamas gunmen who were operating in the compound. Five more people were killed in a strike on a house in Gaza City, Palestinian medics said, with a total of 28 people killed on Saturday.International mediators have all been mediating to bring about a cease-fire in the conflict, which authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say has killed at least 40,939 people.Hamas' Oct 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, according to Israeli official figures.Tens of thousands of Israelis joined protests in Tel Aviv and other cities, demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government make a deal under which the remaining about 100 hostages would be released.Scores were released during a one-week truce in November.Hamas is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal, but Netanyahu insists troops must remain along the Gaza-Egypt border.International pressure to end the conflict was further underlined by Friday's fatal shooting in the occupied West Bank of Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, who was demonstrating against Israeli settlements in the territory.Eygi's family demanded an independent investigation into her death, saying her life "was taken needlessly, unlawfully, and violently by the Israeli military".The UN rights office said Israeli forces killed Eygi, 26, with a "shot in the head".Turkiye said she was killed by "Israeli occupation soldiers", while the United States called her death "tragic" and pressed Israel to investigate.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced Israel as a "barbaric" state and urged Muslim nations to forge an "alliance "against Israel, saying: "It is an Islamic duty for us to stand against Israel's state terror. It is a religious duty."Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded by saying that Erdogan "continues to throw the Turkish people into the fire of hatred and violence for the sake of his Hamas friends".A gunman opened fire on Sunday at the Allenby Bridge, a key crossing point between the West Bank and Jordan, killing three people before being shot dead by Israeli forces, Israeli officials said.The Israel Defense Forces described the incident at the crossing jointly controlled by Israel and Jordan as a shooting attack. Police confirmed the assailant had been shot dead.Fears have been raised over the widening of the conflict. Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement also exchanged fire.Hezbollah had announced a string of attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Saturday, while Israel's military said it had intercepted missiles detected crossing from Lebanon and struck a Hezbollah launch site in the country's south.Lebanon's health ministry said three emergency personnel were killed and two others wounded in an Israeli attack on a civil defense team putting out fires in south Lebanon.Hezbollah later announced retaliatory rocket fire targeting a town in northern Israel "in response to the enemy attacks … and particularly the attack" that killed the emergency workers.Despite the truce deadlock, the United Nations, in collaboration with local health authorities, has pursued a campaign to vaccinate 640,000 children in Gaza after its first polio case in around 25 years. Limited pauses in the fighting have allowed the campaign to proceed.UN officials said they were making progress, having reached more than half of the children requiring the drops in the first two stages in the southern and central Gaza Strip.On Sunday, the campaign is expected to move to the northern Gaza Strip. A second round of vaccination will be required four weeks after the first.Agencies - XinhuaSaudi Arabia is eyeing greater collaboration in research and development, as well as innovation with Asia as it looks to China for technology and automotive advancement in its mining sector transformation push, according to a senior government official.The plans are part of the country's grander economic diversification plan — Vision 2030 — introduced by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud in 2016 and includes mining as the third pillar of national industrialism. Saudi Arabia's abundant mineral wealth is estimated at $2.5 trillion.Saudi Arabia's Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Bandar bin Ibrahim AlKhorayef, told China Daily in an interview in Hong Kong on Saturday that his country could complement the Asia region in providing greater opportunities for relocating most of the manufacturing to his country with cooperation in R&D and innovation."We've all seen the challenges that had been faced in supply chain disruptions and we believe that Saudi Arabia can be a great place to solve these challenges," he added."There's a lot of commonalities between the two regions and (one of) Saudi Arabia's ambitions is to grow its manufacturing base, to explore its mining capabilities. This is not only to satisfy our local market but also to participate in the global market," said AlKhorayef.The minister was wrapping up his trip to the Greater Bay Area, following a weeklong visit to Asia, including Singapore, where he said the purpose was to help large players look to Saudi Arabia as their next production location.Exactly a year ago, AlKhorayef visited the Chinese mainland where he met with senior government officials and visited factories and companies."China is a big country and last time we visited five cities. This time, we visited Guangzhou. There's a different flavor in each one of these cities and we try to capture the value and what each region of China can offer to Saudi Arabia," said AlKhorayef."We aim to focus on two areas. One is to help large players look to Saudi Arabia as their next production location or logistics location because we can offer a mixture of enablers from the raw material to the energy prices to infrastructure, great location," he added.Business modelsAnd the other side, "which is interesting", he said, was innovation and the adaptation of new business models, such as "Industry 4.0" and "Industry 5.0", and artificial intelligence, other than manufacturing.During his visit, AlKhorayef invited Chinese companies to invest in Saudi, which was highlighted by the National Industrial Strategy during a roundtable meeting organized by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce in Guangzhou.In Hong Kong, AlKhorayef met with senior officials of the Trade and Industry Department, the Innovation and Technology Commission and the Commerce and Economic Development of Hong Kong, among others, according to the Saudi Press Agency.China is Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner. According to the Ministry of Finance of Saudi Arabia, the volume of trade between the two countries reached more than $100 billion in 2023."We believe Saudi Arabia can offer many opportunities for many global players from different countries. China is definitely the number one trade partner to Saudi so it's only logical that we find areas of collaboration and bring some local content also to Saudi Arabia. Localization is key also to our strategy," said AlKhorayef.When it comes to the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China, the minister said Saudi was greatly located in an area where it can serve to help many regions connect with each other."Definitely we are also positioned in a way that allows us to access markets that are growing and have high potential to grow," said AlKhorayef."It's great to be here. I used to be a businessman visiting China, also Singapore. It's great to be here with an official eye. I've been really welcomed very well and by everyone, both private sector and government. So, it's overwhelming and I think (there are) great opportunities that we can bring together," he added.The United States' criminal charges against Hamas leaders for their role in the Oct 7 attacks on Israel are "politically motivated", aimed at reducing pressure on Israel even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is accused of being the "main obstacle" in the cease-fire talks.Former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz has accused Netanyahu of being an obstacle in negotiations and for prioritizing the Philadelphi Corridor over the return of hostages after the death of six Israeli captives whose causes of death have yet to be determined as violence rages on in Gaza, most recently the West Bank.Ayman Yousef, a professor of international relations at the Arab American University in Jenin in the West Bank, told China Daily that the timing of the US announcement "is part of their negotiation strategy"."I think the US wants to put more pressure on Hamas to surrender a part of their demands," said Yousef.They are still unable to have a deal or to negotiate a deal, he added.Rami Khouri, a distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut, questioned the US decision to charge Hamas' top leaders in an interview with Al Jazeera and said Washington was behaving like an "imperial colonial power" over its refusal to apply the law equally on all parties accused of violations.Further, he noted the US was keen to hold Hamas responsible for its actions but has no similar desire to hold Israel accountable for its actions. The International Criminal Court Prosecutor had earlier sought arrest warrants for both Hamas and Israeli officials, including Netanyahu.It was announced on Tuesday that the US Justice Department in February launched criminal charges against Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and other senior militants over their involvement in the attack on Oct 7 last year.Netanyahu said at a news conference on Tuesday that the Philadelphi Corridor between the Gaza Strip and Egypt "will not be evacuated". If Israel gives up control, he said, Gaza "will become a terrorist enclave".But countries such as Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iraq have condemned Netanyahu's remarks alleging Hamas was receiving weapons through the corridor.In a statement, Jordan's Foreign Ministry said the allegations were "baseless" and were intended to obstruct the ongoing cease-fire negotiations, in which Egypt is a key mediator.Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, Secretary General of the Gulf Cooperation Council, stressed GCC's "full rejection of such irresponsible statements, which do not serve peace in the region but rather contribute to increasing tension and exacerbating the situation".Meanwhile, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, posted on his X account that what the Israeli army is doing in Jenin and other locations in the West Bank "is a continuation of the extermination campaign".On the battlefield, Israeli forces killed at least 35 Palestinians across Gaza on Tuesday, Palestinian officials said, but brief pauses in fighting allowed medics to conduct a third day of polio vaccinations for children, according to Reuters.A shipment of 350,000 polio vaccine doses arrived in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. A total of approximately 1.6 million doses are expected to arrive, enough to vaccinate all children from birth to 10 years old with two doses each, Xinhua News Agency reported.JERUSALEM -- Rallies and a partial strike continued across Israel for the second day in a row on Monday, as the discovery of the bodies of six hostages in a Gaza tunnel over the weekend has intensified national outage.Protesters descended on Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and other cities, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure the return of remaining hostages by negotiating a ceasefire with Hamas.Protesters blocked the Ayalon Highway in the city of Tel Aviv, Israel's main freeway, for several hours, as well as entrances to railway stations in Tel Aviv and Herzliya, a city north of Tel Aviv.Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that thousands of protesters gathered outside Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, urging him to sign a hostage release deal. Some of them carried coffins wrapped in the Israeli flag, the report said.Nisan Kalderon, brother of Ofer Kalderon, one of the 101 remaining hostages in Gaza, said Netanyahu's decisions "are killing hostages", the report said.According to a police statement, at least 19 people have been arrested in rallies throughout the country.Meanwhile, a partial strike that involved the shutdown of cinemas, theaters, restaurants, cafes, and pubs Sunday evening in Tel Aviv returned on Monday, affecting kindergartens, primary schools, universities, hospitals, and banks in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and other cities.Public transportation, airports, and chain stores also slowed or paused operations across Israel.The strike was then called off at 14:30 local time (1130 GMT) following a court ruling that inadequate notice had been given.On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said six bodies, including two women and four men, were discovered on Saturday in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area, southern Gaza.According to an initial assessment by the IDF, the hostages were estimated to be murdered by Hamas about 48 to 72 hours before the Israeli troops reached them.All six were taken hostage during Hamas' surprise attack on Oct 7, 2023, which left around 1,200 people dead and approximately 250 others captured.Meanwhile, Hamas confirmed in a press statement that the bodies were found by the Israeli army in a tunnel in Rafah but noted that they "were killed by Israeli shelling".Many Israelis have been blaming Netanyahu for failing to secure the hostages' release through a ceasefire deal.JERUSALEM -- Hundreds of thousands of Israelis rallied across the country on Sunday, demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas to secure the return of hostages held in Gaza.According to Israel's Ynet news site, around 700,000 people participated in demonstrations on main roads and at junctions nationwide, with 550,000 attending the central rally in Tel Aviv. The protests began in the morning after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced the recovery of six hostages' bodies and continued through the night.In Tel Aviv, an emotional demonstration took place outside the Kirya military base, the IDF's headquarters. Protesters waved Israeli flags and chanted "A deal -- Now!" Many carried posters featuring the hostages. There are still 101 hostages in Gaza, with about half presumed dead due to either Hamas attacks or Israeli bombings.Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, addressed the crowd, claiming that there is "a deal proposal on the table" but that Netanyahu refuses to accept it to avoid losing support from his coalition of pro-settler leaders.Later in the night, thousands of protesters in Tel Aviv set fire on the Ayalon Highway, temporarily blocking the main freeway. Police said they dispersed the crowd and reported at least 12 arrests nationwide.By nightfall, cinemas, theaters, museums, universities, restaurants, cafes, pubs, and other businesses across the country closed in solidarity with the protest.The demonstrations are expected to continue into Monday with a general strike. Arnon Bar-David, secretary-general of the Histadrut, Israel's largest workers' organization, announced the strike on live television, accusing Netanyahu of hindering the deal due to "political considerations".The protests followed the recovery of the bodies of two women and four men from Gaza. The IDF said they were killed in a Hamas tunnel shortly before soldiers arrived.The six had been captured alive on Oct 7, 2023, during Hamas's surprise attack on Israeli communities, which killed about 1,200 people and resulted in the capture of approximately 250 others.The United Nations, in collaboration with Palestinian health authorities, began to vaccinate 640,000 children in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, with Israel and Hamas agreeing to brief pauses in the conflict to allow the vaccination campaign.The campaign began in areas of central Gaza, and will move to other areas in the coming days. Fighting will be paused for at least eight hours on three consecutive days, CNA News reported.Rik Peeperkorn, head of the World Health Organization office for the West Bank and Gaza, said 2,180 workers in 295 teams would administer the oral vaccines to 640,000 children under 10 years of age at 392 sites. The vaccine is to be delivered in two doses about four weeks apart.Sam Rose, senior deputy director of the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA in Gaza, said the lack of access to aid, services, water and healthcare creates a situation under which polio has recently reemerged in Gaza "with a small number of cases that could spread very rapidly"."It's really that perfect storm of conditions that created the environment in which polio can occur," he said in a video released on the UNRWA website.Juliette Touma, communications director at UNRWA, told Reuters on Sunday that the vaccination campaign was massive and "one of the most complex in the world"."Today is test time for parties to the conflict to respect these area pauses to allow the UNRWA teams and other medical workers to reach children with these very precious two drops. It's a race against time," Touma said."Children continue to be exposed. Every child must be vaccinated in Gaza and Israel to curb the risk of this vicious disease spreading."WHO officials have said at least 90 percent of the children need to be vaccinated twice with four weeks between doses for the campaign to succeed, but it faces huge challenges in Gaza, which has been largely destroyed by the continuing conflict.The Health Ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that at least 40,738 people have been killed in the conflict, now in its 11th month. The toll includes 47 deaths in the previous 24 hours.Meanwhile, families of Israeli hostages have called for a nationwide general strike starting on Sunday night to force the government to reach a deal to secure the release of captives still held in Gaza.The call came after the Israeli military found the bodies of six hostages in a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, sparking outrage and anger among their families.Xinhua and Agencies contributed to this story.SANAA -- Yemen's Houthi group claimed responsibility on Saturday for an attack on a cargo ship named Groton in the Gulf of Aden."In support of the Palestinians and Hamas, we carried out a military operation targeting the ship Groton in the Gulf of Aden because of its company's dealings with Israel," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a statement aired by Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV.He said bomb-laden drones and missiles were used in the attack and that "the hit was accurate."Sarea added that it was the second time his group had targeted the vessel in August, with the first attack occurring on August 3, and warned of more attacks on cargo ships.The UK Maritime Trade Operations reported on Friday on social media platform X that it had received a report of an attack on a cargo ship 130 nautical miles east of Yemen's southern port city of Aden. It said two missiles exploded near the vessel, and all crew members were safe and proceeding to the next port of call.Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted what they describe as "Israeli-linked" cargo ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden to show solidarity with the Palestinians amid the ongoing Gaza conflict.The Houthis have controlled much of northern Yemen since late 2014, forcing the internationally recognized government out of the capital, Sanaa.China's envoy to the United Nations on Thursday "strongly condemned" Israel's large-scale military operation in the northern West Bank, one of the largest assaults in the Israeli-occupied territory for months.Israel launched a large-scale raid across the northern West Bank early Wednesday. The Palestinian Health Ministry has confirmed that 16 people have been killed in the raids. "China strongly condemns it," said Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN.Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz posted on social media platform X on Wednesday, describing the large-scale operation as part of a "full-fledged war". He compared the situation to the Gaza Strip, saying that "we need to address the (terror) threat exactly as we deal with terror infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian civilians and any other step needed."Deeply concernedGeng said China is "shocked and deeply concerned by such outrageous statements". "Gaza has already become a living hell. We must not allow the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza to be repeated in the West Bank, turning it into another living hell," he said at a Security Council meeting on the Palestinian question."China opposes any actions or rhetoric that escalate tensions and condemns all attacks against civilians. We call on all parties, particularly Israel, to remain calm and exercise restraint to prevent further escalation of the situation," Geng emphasized.In the West Bank, Israel continues to violate international law and Security Council resolutions by expanding settlements and intensifying searches, arrests and attacks against Palestinians. Since October last year, more than 620 Palestinians have lost their lives in the region, said Geng.On Wednesday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also urged Israel to halt its military operation in the West Bank immediately.UNITED NATIONS -- Israel and Hamas have agreed to halt hostilities in the Gaza Strip for a World Health Organization (WHO)-led polio vaccination campaign, a WHO official said on Thursday.Rik Peeperkorn, head of the WHO office for the West Bank and Gaza, told reporters in a video briefing that the UN health agency, the Hamas health ministry and the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees, known as UNRWA, would launch the campaign on Sunday.He said the first two rounds of the vaccines would be administered from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time in Gaza's central region for three days, followed by three days in the southern region and finally three days in the north. The pause in hostilities for each three-day campaign may be stretched to a fourth day if necessary.The WHO official said 2,180 workers in 295 teams would administer the oral vaccines to 640,000 children under 10 years of age at 392 sites. The vaccine is to be delivered in two doses about four weeks apart.Peeperkorn said if some children could not be brought into the planned 392 sites in hospitals and other medical points, "we will try to get to them."After a 10-month-old girl was found to have contracted polio, partially paralyzing her left leg, the WHO announced plans for the Gaza vaccination campaign.Also in Gaza, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Israeli authorities announced that displaced people could return to specific areas in Deir al-Balah, the first time where return is officially allowed to an evacuated area.OCHA said the evacuation orders are also severely constraining aid efforts. Recently, they have displaced many humanitarian colleagues and lost access to warehouses, water wells, other critical facilities and humanitarian routes."UN colleagues assessed the water, hygiene and sanitation conditions in two sites hosting over 1,200 families in Rafah," the office said. "People are struggling with drinking water as no trucking is currently available. They report skin diseases being the main morbidity among women and children, with no treatments available when they go to the medical points."OCHA also said sea water floods the tents of those living directly on the beach in Mawassi.In the West Bank, the office said there are reports of displaced families, particularly in urban areas where Israeli forces have repurposed homes as military positions. In multiple locations, military bulldozers have heavily damaged infrastructure and electricity and telecommunication outages continued."Military operations near hospitals also continue, effectively besieging these facilities and limiting the movement in and out, including that of medical staff," OCHA said.The office said the UNRWA clinic in the Al Far'a refugee camp had to suspend operations on Wednesday, resuming on Thursday only when Israeli forces left the area. UN agencies warned of the risk of unexploded munition in some areas.RAMALLAH -- The Israeli army on Thursday killed five Palestinians, including a commander, in an exchange of fire in the Tulkarm refugee camp in the West Bank, Palestinian and Israeli sources said.Mohammed Jaber, also known as Abu Shujaa, a commander of Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), was killed after exchanging fire with Israeli forces who besieged the building he was in with other Palestinian militants, Palestinian sources told Xinhua.Avichai Adraee, the spokesperson of the Israeli army, said in a press statement that under the direction of the Shin Bet, and after an exchange of fire, members of the special police unit eliminated five militants, including Abu Shujaa, who were hiding in a mosque in Tulkarm.Abu Shujaa was involved in several operations and "directed the shooting operation in June that resulted in the death of the Israeli Amnon Mukhtar," Adraee said.He added that one of the members of the police unit sustained minor injuries and was transferred to a hospital in Israel for treatment.For the second day in a row, the Israeli army has launched a large-scale military operation in Tulkarm, Jenin and Tubas refugee camps in an attempt to arrest wanted persons accused of involvement in operations against Israel.Iran says its potential retaliation against Israel for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh will be "unpredictable", while an analyst points to varied actions."For the time being, (Israel) must remain in a state of anxiety and panic as it awaits our revenge, but what is certain is that the response will be unpredictable," Iran's Deputy Defense Minister Seyed Hojatollah Ghoreishi was quoted by Iran's Tasnim News Agency as saying on Tuesday.Reacting to the killing of Haniyeh on July 31 in Teheran, high-ranking Iranian officials have vowed to give a strong response, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying that Israel has prepared the ground for harsh punishment for itself through the assassination, Mehr News Agency reported.On Tuesday, in a video broadcast on state television, Khamenei indicated that there was "no barrier" to discussions with the "enemy", possibly about civil use of nuclear energy and economic sanctions.It is the US administration led by Donald Trump that pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was signed in July 2015 and limits Iran's nuclear development.The United States also reintroduced more sanctions against Iran. Such sanctions, among others, have made it difficult for Iran to purchase medicine and health supplies from abroad, including COVID-19 vaccines.White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday the US remains committed to defending Israel in the event of a possible Iranian attack.Kirby told Israel's Channel 12 that it was tough to predict the chances of an attack but the White House takes Iranian rhetoric seriously."We believe that they are still postured and poised to launch an attack should they want to do that, which is why we have that enhanced force posture in the region," he said."Our messaging to Iran is consistent, has been and will stay consistent. One, don't do it. There's no reason to escalate this. There's no reason to potentially start some sort of all-out regional war. And number two, we are going to be prepared to defend Israel if it comes to that."Some other US officials are also constantly issuing statements about potential retaliatory strikes on Israeli targets over the violation of Iranian sovereignty.Patrick Ryder, spokesman for the US Department of Defense, said on Monday that the Pentagon continues to assess that there is a threat of attack by Iran and resistance groups against Israel.Possible actionsNagapushpa Devendra, a West Asia analyst and research scholar at the University of Erfurt in Germany, told China Daily that Iran may undertake "direct but more indirect" retaliatory actions against Israel.Iran's actions may include supporting or encouraging proxy groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon or other military forces in the region to launch attack on Israeli targets, Devendra said. Iran might also engage in cyber operations or other asymmetric tactics in response to the killing of Haniyeh, she said.Regarding the reason for Iran's potential actions, she said: "Under the leadership of Iran's newly elected president, Iran is attempting to regain its security influence and capabilities that were undermined by sanctions imposed by the US.Given this scenario, it is likely that Iran's response may also be a way to assert its position as a key player in regional politics."Agencies contributed to this story.The United States continues to display its "bizarre" hypocrisy over its support for Israel's self-defense while allowing massacres to happen in Gaza, experts said, as the United Nations noted that the month of August saw the most evacuation orders issued, fueling demoralizing conditions there.Hanan Ashrawi, former executive committee member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said in a post on her X account that nothing could be more bizarre than the US "showering Israel with billions" by supplying Tel Aviv with unlimited lethal weapons, munitions, and deploying its own warships to fight for Israel's "wars of self-defense" and then claiming the US was "doing everything to prevent the escalation and expansion of the "conflict". The US, she said, also threatens Israel's victims should they dare retaliate.Farhan Mujahid Chak, visiting faculty at the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, told China Daily that the US "is in direct complicity" to all the crimes against humanity and the flagrant violation of the "most basic norms of international law" and society. This "needs to be stopped and called out"."(On) the negotiations that are ongoing, there's no better way to explain them as a charade. A charade of constantly edging the world to inform them that they're on the brink of the breakthrough when in reality, the intensity of the violence directed toward an overwhelming women and children population continues unabated," said Chak.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned on Aug 27 that humanitarian operations are "ongoing where feasible" after reports of a halt made rounds due to risks amid the Israeli military's repeated orders.OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke said there has been no decision to halt operations and there "never has been", noting the aid workers have "been there for 10 months"."I want to remind you that only 11 percent of the territory of the Gaza Strip is not under evacuation orders…so we're trying to work with that number and keep the operation going," said Laerke, adding that a total of 16 evacuation orders had been issued for the month of August alone, creating much upheaval for Gazans already uprooted multiple times.Since Aug 23, the Israeli military has issued three new evacuations covering 19 neighborhoods in northern Gaza and in Deir al-Balah, affecting more than 8,000 people sheltering in these areas.The OCHA said the total number of evacuation orders issued in August was now 16, directly impacting approximately 258,000 people, or around 12 percent of Gaza's population."In Deir al-Balah, the orders have displaced UN humanitarian staff, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and service providers, along with their families. These relocations took place at short notice and in dangerous conditions," according to an update on Aug 26."OCHA is particularly worried about the order issued yesterday (Aug 25) for a part of Deir al-Balah. It affected 15 premises hosting UN and NGO aid workers, four UN warehouses, Al Aqsa hospital, two clinics, three wells, one water reservoir and one desalination plant. All of these are either in or near the designated area," it added.Arie Afriansyah, associate professor at the Faculty of Law at Universitas Indonesia, told China Daily that Israel's repeated issuance of evacuation orders are not to minimize civilian casualties but "are only for Israelis"."Considering the actions committed by Israel lately, it is hard to believe that Israel starts to listen to the world's concerns in Gaza… Nevertheless, we should not stop hoping and praying for a better situation," said Afriansyah.The orders also encompass the UN's aid hub in the central city of Deir al-Balah. Previously, the UN and humanitarian response partners had been based in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah. But the Israeli military incursion there in May resulted in an exodus, effectively shrinking the humanitarian zone at the coast.US Jewish activist and co-founder of the anti-war organization CodePink, Medea Benjamin, has also called for an end to US support for Israel, calling it a "betrayal of American values", Turkiye's Anadolu Agency reported, citing a documentary produced by TRT World."It is truly a mockery of everything that people who stand for the rule of law, for the rights of noncombatants," said Chak from Georgetown University."I think for strategic geopolitical purposes in the near future, this will prove even more dangerous for the global world order in which particularly the Global South is coming to the realization that there is absolutely no commitment coming from the G7 countries, in particular, the Western countries, to abide by the human rights' law," he added.Chak said it "is going to pose even greater dangers and exacerbate tensions and the likelihood of conflict will be increased".jan@chinadailyapac.comIn between bombings and shootings, cries and hunger in devastated Gaza Strip, Ahmed Ayesh Alnajjar clings on to his life amid continuous displacements and a shrinking safe zone across the occupied narrow Strip, struggling to find scarcest safety and hope from international community.Video by Jan Yumul and Mike GuRAMALLAH - The Israeli army began on Wednesday a large-scale military operation in the Jenin, Tulkarm, and Tubas camps in the northern West Bank, according to Palestinian and Israeli sources."The Israeli forces have begun military operations in Jenin, Tubas, and Tulkarm to thwart terrorism," Avichai Adraee, spokesman of the Israeli army, said in a statement.Palestinian sources told Xinhua said that large forces, along with huge bulldozers, are involved in the Jenin operation.The sources added that Israeli military vehicles stormed the city from multiple directions, penetrating its neighborhoods and the refugee camp.According to the Ramallah-based health ministry, two Palestinians were killed and two others wounded by Israeli army gunfire in northern Jenin.Wiam Bakr, director of Jenin Governmental Hospital, said that the Israeli forces surrounded the hospital and prevented medical staff from entering.In Tubas and the Far'a refugee camp, Israeli forces clashed with Palestinian gunmen as they stormed the area. Tubas governor Ahmed al-Asaad told Xinhua that the scale of the operation suggests that Israel is following through on threats of a military campaign in the northern West Bank.Meanwhile, the Israeli forces clashed with Palestinian gunmen as they stormed the city of Tubas and the Far'a refugee camp.Ahmed al-Asaad, the governor of Tubas, told Xinhua that the scale of the operation suggests that Israel is following through on threats of a military operation in the northern West Bank.Similarly, Israeli forces stormed the Nour Shams refugee camp east of Tulkarm, where Palestinian sources told Xinhua that the forces besieged Thabet Thabet Governmental Hospital and seized a Palestinian ambulance.Palestinian armed groups said that their members were fighting Israeli forces with explosive devices and gunfire in Jenin, Tulkarm and Tubas.Since Oct 7, the northern West Bank have witnessed a major escalation, with over 650 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire across the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.RIYADH - Saudi Arabia is set to host the third edition of the Global AI Summit from Sept 10 to 12, aiming to establish the kingdom as a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and to emphasize the role of governments in leveraging AI for economic growth, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported on Tuesday.The summit, themed "Leveraging AI for the Betterment of Humanity", will take place in Riyadh. It will address topics such as ethical AI development and AI applications in urban life, focusing on transportation, urban design, mental health, and resource management. It will also address the role of AI in governance, according to SPA."The summit will delve into AI's current capabilities, its future, and the ethical boundaries we must establish to ensure its beneficial impact on society," said Abdullah bin Sharaf Alghamdi, president of the Saudi Data & Artificial Intelligence Authority, the organizer.The summit will gather over 300 experts and speakers from 100 countries and feature more than 120 interactive sessions and workshops. These will explore diverse aspects of AI, including generative AI and its integration into smart cities, as stated by the organizer.JERUSALEM - The Israeli military announced on Tuesday that its forces had rescued an Israeli hostage from an underground tunnel in the southern Gaza Strip when combing the area.Qaid Farhan Alkadi, 52, was found alone in a tunnel, without any guards or other hostages, said the military in a statement. Being held by Hamas militants since Oct 7, 2023, Alkadi is the eighth hostage freed through a military operation and the first Israeli Arab hostage to be rescued alive. He is also the first hostage rescued from the underground.The military added that Alkadi came from Karkur, a Bedouin village south of Rahat city in southern Israel, and was kidnapped from his workplace, a packing house in Magen, during Hamas' attack on the kibbutz.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that military troops, along with agents from the Shin Bet security agency, scanned the tunnel in recent days to search for hostages, Hamas militants, and explosive devices, while noting that they had no specific information about Alkadi's whereabouts.According to state-owned Kan TV news, Alkadi heard the soldiers and shouted for help, then his guards fled the area. The man told his relatives that he survived mainly on small amounts of bread. His family reported that Alkadi lost approximately 20 kilograms during his captivity.Shlomi Kadosh, the hospital director, stated that Alkadi had undergone a medical examination and was in stable condition.In a press briefing, IDF Spokesman Daniel Hagari described the rescue as "a complex mission," saying that "commandos rescued Alkadi from an underground tunnel upon accurate intelligence."In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized the government's commitment to bringing all hostages home. "We are doing this in two main ways: negotiations and rescue operations," Netanyahu said. He also underscored the necessity of maintaining Israel's military presence in Gaza.A government official confirmed to Xinhua that an Israeli delegation is set to depart on Wednesday to continue indirect talks in Doha over a potential deal that includes a ceasefire and the exchange of hostages and prisoners between the two warring sides.Approximately 250 hostages were taken during the Oct 7 Hamas assault, with 108 still held by Hamas, and many of them are believed dead, official Israeli figures indicated.UNITED NATIONS - Despite Gaza's deadly violence and several recent Israeli evacuation orders further disrupting aid operations, the head of UN security said on Tuesday that relief deliveries are continuing."The United Nations is determined to stay in Gaza to deliver life-saving aid for and with Palestinian civilians," said Gilles Michaud, the undersecretary-general for safety and security. "Humanitarian aid delivery continues -- a tremendous feat given that we are operating at the upper-most peripheries of tolerable risk."Michaud said that humanitarians have been in the crosshairs throughout the crisis, "by far the deadliest on record for the UN."He called the several recent mass evacuation orders the latest in a long list of unbearable threats to the UN and humanitarian personnel."Like most Palestinians in Gaza, we are running out of safe spaces for our own staff," Michaud said. "The timing could hardly be worse, with the start of a massive polio vaccination campaign scheduled for next week, for which large numbers of staff will need to enter the (Gaza) Strip."He said the Israeli Defense Forces' series of evacuation orders this past weekend compound existing security threats and seriously impact the pace of safe aid deliveries."These constraints are beyond our control," the undersecretary-general said.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that they could distribute some tents as temporary shelters in response to the evacuation orders on Monday. However, the stock is running low and limited.OCHA said the World Food Programme (WFP) staff had to relocate to other UN premises, leaving behind their offices and guest houses in Deir al Balah. Despite these challenges, the agency continues to deliver food assistance."In addition to the loss of warehouses and other humanitarian premises due to evacuation orders, it remains difficult to move around the south of the Gaza Strip due to the severe overcrowding and continuous displacement," OCHA said.The office said access of UN humanitarian partners to northern Gaza is particularly challenging as it requires coordination with the Israeli authorities and passage through an internal checkpoint.OCHA said plans to fuel hospitals in the north of Gaza have now resulted in access being denied five times in the past week, leaving some hospitals without new provisions for fuel for over 10 days. The dependency on fuel to run backup generators is complete, as the Israeli authorities cut electricity provision from the Gaza Strip back in October.Following the delivery of polio vaccines into Gaza, UN staff on the ground are now positioning them in 11 health centers. Beginning this weekend, they are training over 1,000 medical workers and volunteers to participate in the campaign.Also, Stephane Dujarric, chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, attempted to counter some disinformation about the vaccine being administered."The safest and the most effective way to protect children against the polio virus, regardless of the variant, is to vaccinate them," Dujarric told reporters at a regular briefing. "This vaccine is safe. It is effective and it offers top-quality protection. It is a vaccine globally recommended for variant type 2 poliovirus outbreaks by the World Health Organization."He said that since 2021, more than 1.2 billion vaccine doses have been used to protect children in over 40 countries.The spokesman said the UN Children's Fund, the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees, known as UNRWA, and the World Health Organization plan to roll out the campaign in Gaza this weekend. It will be done in two rounds, each consisting of two drops of oral polio vaccine type 2, for more than 640,000 children under 10 years of age, to reach at least 95 percent of the children in each round.The United States is seen as seemingly trying to downplay the immediate threat of a broader conflict in the Middle East even after two of its air carriers are now ready for attacks in the region while Israeli strikes continue in both Gaza Strip of Palestine and Lebanon.Israeli attacks on Gaza — mainly in Deir el-Balah and Khan Younis in the south — have killed at least 20 people, Al Jazeera reported on Aug 27.The attacks came just days after Israel and Hezbollah exchanged strikes along the Israel-Lebanon border on Aug 25.Hezbollah unleashed hundreds of missiles against Israel in retaliation for the killing of its top military commander, Fouad Shokor, in Beirut in late July.Tel Aviv reported it had conducted a series of "preemptive airstrikes" targeting Hezbollah's rocket launchers in southern Lebanon.Despite this, United States Air Force General Charles Q. Brown, Jr, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Reuters that the near-term risk of a broader conflict in the Middle East had eased "somewhat".However, he urged caution over a possible response from Iran, adding that Teheran's regional allies also posed a risk.Yet recently the US has deployed its warships to the Middle East amid concerns of a regional escalation after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Teheran on July 31.The Pentagon has extended the deployment of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group after a largely failed attack by the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah on Israel over the weekend, according to a report by Defense News website.The Theodore Roosevelt arrived in the Middle East in early July, replacing the carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose deployment to the region had itself been extended multiple times, earlier this summer. Just last week fellow carrier Abraham Lincoln steamed into the region. Now two carriers and their warships are "available for US Central Command amid the threat of a full regional war erupting", said the report.While many have viewed the exchange of fire at Lebanon border as a significant escalation in the longstanding Israel-Hezbollah conflict, Ayman Yousef, an international relations professor at the Arab American University in Jenin in the West Bank, told China Daily Hezbollah's response was "nothing extraordinary".He said that he thinks Washington "is watching the behavior of Hezbollah", which so far has proved to be "very much within the rules of confrontation"."Hezbollah did not hit any civilian targets. It did not hit any Israeli city or civilian settlements but instead the focus was on some military posts, establishments, and installments," said Yousef, adding that Washington was not ready for any kind of regional confrontation where Israel and Iran would face off.On the ground, Yousef said he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will "keep on moving militarily in Gaza", taking advantage of weak opposition at home."The opposition forces in Israel are not united. They failed to neutralize this government led by Netanyahu," said Yousef, adding that this scenario may continue until the US presidential elections in November.According to Yousef, Netanyahu will be watching the outcome of those elections to see who wins between former US president Donald Trump and current US Vice-President Kamala Harris."I think Netanyahu's going to continue bargaining with the US, as he's bargaining with Hamas, as [he is] with the mediators including the Egyptians and Qataris," he said."So this is part of his strategy and vision to carry on with this war. I think the war is serving him at the political level and personal level. At all levels," said Yousef.On Aug 26, Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani met Iranian Foreign Minsiter Abbas Araghchi in Tehran on Monday, a day after the latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations ended without an agreement, Iran International reported.Further, the report said Iran would support any cease-fire deal agreed by Hamas, Araghchi told his Qatari counterpart.TEHRAN - Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Monday called on Muslim states to take joint actions to force Israel to stop its "crimes and genocide" in Gaza.He made the appeal during talks with visiting Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Tehran, according to a statement by his office."Muslim states and all those countries that are committed to international law and frameworks stand together and, through taking joint actions, manage to force the supporters of Israel into reining it in and stopping its crimes and genocide in Gaza," said Pezeshkian.Applauding Qatar's efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, he said that while all legal international regulations were constantly being violated in Gaza, the countries "claiming to be advocating human rights" chose to remain silent in the face of those "crimes" and even supported the ones perpetrating the violence.Tensions in the region have been heightened recently as Iran and its allies vowed to take revenge for the killings of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah's military commander Fouad Shokor last month.Haniyeh, who was in Iran to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Pezeshkian, was killed on July 31 along with his bodyguard when their residence in Tehran was attacked, one day after the death of Shokor in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut.Hezbollah unleashed hundreds of missiles and drones against Israel early Sunday morning in vengeance for the killing of Shokor while Israel claimed conducting a series of "preemptive airstrikes" targeting Hezbollah's rocket launchers in southern Lebanon.Iran has not made its retaliation yet, but a response to the assassination of Haniyeh will be "definitive, measured and well calculated", Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi said on X on Sunday night."We do not fear escalation, yet do not seek it," he added.Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Mohammad Baqeri also vowed on Monday that the revenge is "definite", semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.Baqeri said Iran would decide about its revenge for Haniyeh's assassination itself, and the resistance axis, as was seen on Sunday, would act separately and independently.He described the "cowardly" assassination of the Hamas chief in Tehran as an "unforgettable" incident, saying Iran would not fall into the trap of the enemies' media "provocations".During talks with Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Brown on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, "Iran's aggression has reached an all-time high."To counter this, Israel and the United States "must work together to achieve and project groundbreaking capabilities in all arenas", a readout of his office quoted Gallant as saying.The latest round of Gaza cease-fire talks ended with no deal, raising suspicions of delaying tactics and a diplomatic smoke screen of a joint "Israel-US project serving Israel's campaign of destruction", experts say.Despite optimistic statements from the United States, the resumption of weeklong talks in Cairo, Egypt- and earlier in Doha, Qatar — ended on Sunday with neither Hamas nor Israel reaching an agreement.Majd Abuamer, a researcher at the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies in Doha, said the US cannot be seen merely as a supporter of Israel or a mediator in the cease-fire talks, noting that talks are focused on technical and logistical details."The real objective behind the ongoing negotiations in Doha and Cairo … is to divert attention from the situation in Gaza and to give Israel more time to complete its campaign of destruction," Abuamer said.Israel had sustained its retaliatory military operations amid talks even throughout the Paris Olympics, issuing evacuation orders as it continued bombing schools and refugee camps.The health ministry in Gaza said on Monday that at least 40,435 people have been killed in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants, now in its 11th month.Abuamer said it should not be forgotten that reaching a cease-fire agreement does not necessarily entail ending the military campaign."Despite reaching agreements, Israel often fails to adhere to them and instead continues with its policy of assassinations and bombings, which reignites the conflict," he said.Hamas said its delegation demanded that Israel accept what had been agreed upon on July 2, based on US President Joe Biden's proposal and the United Nations Security Council resolution, Xinhua News Agency reported.Furthermore, the delegation reportedly stressed that any agreement must include a permanent cease-fire, Israel's complete withdrawal from Gaza, the return of residents to their homes and prisoner-hostage exchange.Intense pointOne of the intense points of contention was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demand that the Israel Defense Forces continue to be deployed along the Philadelphi Corridor that stretches the entirety of Gaza's border with Egypt, US media outlet Axios reported.On Friday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby, speaking to reporters, denied that the cease-fire talks were on the verge of collapse. Israeli authorities have said they will join the talks on their terms."The cease-fire talks in Cairo seem less about peace and more about power plays, with progress being announced but nothing concrete emerging," Arhama Siddiqa, a research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan, told China Daily.Negotiations have become "a well-worn tool in the US-Israel strategy" that gives the appearance of diplomacy but the situation on the ground tells a much different story, Siddiqa said.The "narrative of progress" allows Israel to continue its operations, with each passing day bringing more destruction to Gaza, she said."It's hard to ignore the suspicion that this is a delaying tactic, a diplomatic smoke screen behind which Israel carries out its military objectives."The US speaks of progress, but the lack of tangible results suggests the talks are more about stalling than stopping the violence."The question of the Philadelphi Corridor only deepens the deadlock, with its future tied to broader strategic goals rather than immediate peace, she said.Furthermore, the delay seems to work in Israel's favor, she added. "Each day the talks stretch out, more ground is covered, more homes are destroyed, more lives are lost."Late on Sunday, Israel issued new evacuation orders for Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, forcing more families to flee, saying its forces intended to act against Hamas and others operating in the area.Recently, Israel has issued several evacuation orders across Gaza, the most since the beginning of the conflict, prompting an outcry from Palestinians, the UN and relief officials over the reduction of humanitarian zones and the absence of safe areas.The Deir al-Balah municipality says Israeli evacuation orders have so far displaced 250,000 people.Agencies contributed to this story.UNITED NATIONS - A recent spate of Israeli evacuation orders has forced a shutdown of UN agency humanitarian aid operations in Gaza, a senior UN official said on Monday.However, two officials in Gaza for the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees, known as UNRWA, told reporters its organization continues providing services, albeit constrained while preparing for the beginning this weekend of a massive anti-polio vaccine campaign.Stephane Dujarric, chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said that "UNRWA is, given the way they're embedded with the population, is able to operate in situ with people who are already there."He said the senior UN official was referring to moving about by UN officials and UN humanitarian staff trying to get to places with aid when the opportunity arrives."If humanitarian workers are embedded with a certain population in a certain area, and they have the tools to operate and to share and to distribute, they will do so," the spokesman said. "But it is half a drop in a barrel."Dujarric said there were 16 evacuation orders so far in August, three of them since Friday.The UN official who briefed earlier said that what happened over the weekend just brought the agencies to the point where they couldn't continue to operate because of conditions not under their control."This is not a decision that we're saying we're stopping to operate but practically, we cannot operate," he said, but added, "we are not leaving."Following the UN official by less than an hour, Louise Wateridge, senior communications officer, and Sam Rose, senior deputy field director for UNRWA in Gaza, briefed from a guest house "in the middle of Gaza".Rose said UNRWA is continuing to deliver directly through 5,000 staff at 90 health points, mostly schools turned into shelters.He described Gazans' decrepit living conditions, ripe for the polio virus, and the population fleeing one site for another on an evacuation order.Wateridge said conditions are so bad and such a limit on what can be brought into Gaza, there is no chlorine for the water, and Gazans can't even buy a bar of soap for washing.Rose said polio vaccines have arrived in Gaza and will be administered this weekend to 640,000 children in two doses.Humanitarian partners of the world body reported at least 50,000 children born since the Gaza conflict erupted in October are highly unlikely to have received any immunizations due to the collapsed health system.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that since Friday, the Israeli military's three new evacuation orders were for more than 19 neighborhoods in northern Gaza and in Deir al Balah, with more than 8,000 people staying in the areas, many sheltering in 29 displacement sites."In Deir al Balah, the orders have displaced UN humanitarian staff, NGOs (nongovernmental organizations), and service providers, along with their families," OCHA said. "These relocations took place at short notice and in dangerous conditions."The humanitarians are worried about the order issued on Sunday for a part of Deir al Balah, affecting 15 premises hosting UN and NGO aid workers, four UN warehouses, Al Aqsa hospital, two clinics, three wells, one water reservoir and one desalination plant in or near the designated area."This effectively upends a whole lifesaving humanitarian hub that was set up in Deir al Balah following its evacuation from Rafah back in May, and it severely impacts our ability to deliver essential support and services," the office said.OCHA said World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reported that nearby health facilities risked becoming non-functional. Many patients and staff have left the Al Aqsa hospital, reducing healthcare capacity as hostilities intensify.The office said water production in Deir al Balah was reduced by 85 percent due to the loss of access to water sources in areas designated for evacuation."As we have reported earlier, only about 11 percent of the Gaza Strip has not been placed under evacuation orders," OCHA said. "Most people in Gaza are now squeezed in this small, overcrowded, polluted area where services are poor, and which is unsafe, just like the rest of the Gaza Strip."OCHA said the World Food Programme (WFP) reported that its operations were severely hampered by intensifying conflict, a limited number of border crossings, and damaged roads.The office said that in the last two months, the WFP brought in only half of the 24,000 metric tons of food aid required for operations serving 1.1 million people in Gaza. The WFP also had to reduce the contents of food parcels.The WFP warned that shell craters and debris made driving slow and challenging for truck drivers even in dry weather. Rain and flooding in two months will make most roads unusable.The agency also reported that aid workers grappled daily with slow authorizations and frequent refusals from Israelis when they asked for permission to move. Looting and public order problems were frequent, especially when convoys wait hours at holding points.BRUSSELS -- Several major airlines in European countries announced the suspension of flights to and from Israel and Lebanon Sunday following escalating hostilities between the two Mideast countries.According to French news channel BFMTV, Air France has decided to suspend its flights to Israel's Tel Aviv and Lebanon's Beirut until at least Monday due to growing tensions in the region."Today's and tomorrow's flights are canceled," an Air France spokesperson said, noting that the suspension could be extended after the company conducts a new assessment on Monday.Similarly, British Airways announced a suspension of flights to and from Israel's Tel Aviv until Wednesday."Due to the escalating situation in the region, Wizz Air is temporarily suspending flights to and from Israel on the 25th of August," Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air also posted on its website.Greek flag carrier Aegean Airlines canceled several flights to Israel and Beirut on Sunday. Its official website listed three flights to Tel Aviv and two flights to Beirut, including one scheduled for Monday, as canceled.German airline giant Lufthansa extended its suspension of flights to Beirut until Sept. 30, and to Tel Aviv and Tehran until Sept. 2.Israeli and Hezbollah forces engaged in extensive exchanges of fire early Sunday morning along the Israel-Lebanon border, marking a significant escalation in their longstanding conflict.Hezbollah claimed that it had launched hundreds of missiles into Israel in retaliation for the killing of its commander, Fouad Shokor, in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut last month. In response, Israel reported conducting numerous preemptive airstrikes targeting Hezbollah's rocket launchers in southern Lebanon.Following the most severe exchange of fire between the two sides in the Middle East, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defense Secretary John Healey both called their respective counterparts in Israel on Sunday, urging for an immediate ceasefire in the region, according to their posts on X, formerly known as Twitter.In early August, as tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border began to mount, many European countries urged their citizens to leave Lebanon. Meanwhile, some European carriers, including Air France and Romania's national airline TAROM, suspended their flights, although they later resumed services before this latest escalation.JERUSALEM/BEIRUT - About 100 Israeli warplanes struck and destroyed "thousands" of Hezbollah rockets and missile launcher barrels to be launched at northern and central Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Sunday.The strikes targeted more than 40 launch areas in southern Lebanon, which began before dawn, the IDF said, adding that most of the launchers were aimed at northern Israel, with some directed toward central Israel."Whoever hurt us -- we hurt them," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement.During the strikes, one person was killed in the town of Khiam in southern Lebanon, Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported.Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service reported that a woman in northern Israel was lightly injured by shrapnel. Video footage circulating on social media showed that a residential home in Acre was hit and sustained heavy damage.IDF Spokesman Daniel Hagari said during a press briefing that the military had "identified extensive preparation by Hezbollah to fire toward the Israeli home front" and launched the strikes as "a self-defense act to remove threats."Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has declared a "special situation on the home front" nationwide. New security guidelines were issued for residents from the north to Tel Aviv, banning large gatherings and urging people to stay close to shelters or safe rooms.Ben Gurion International Airport was temporarily shut down for incoming and outgoing flights, the Airports Authority announced, adding that full operations would resume during the morning hours.Hezbollah said on Sunday that it had fired more than 320 rockets at 11 Israeli army sites in retaliation for Israel's attack on Hezbollah's senior military commander, Fouad Shokor, the Lebanese National News Agency (NNA) reported.The NNA further reported that a series of Israeli air strikes on Lebanon began in the early hours of Sunday, causing serious damage to property, crops, and infrastructure, especially electricity and water systems. It was the heaviest since the start of the Hezbollah-Israeli conflict late last year.The attacks occurred amid escalating tensions in the region, including cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah since Oct 7, 2023, as well as ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, aimed at preventing a broader conflict in the Middle East.BEIRUT -- Israel launched "a string of airstrikes" in Lebanon on Sunday morning, targeting positions held by the Lebanese Hezbollah group in a pre-emptive move, Israel Defense Forces Spokesman Daniel Hagari said."Dozens of warplanes" participated in the attack, Hagari told a press conference, describing the attack as "a self-defense act to remove threats."Shortly afterward, Hezbollah announced it had launched a large-scale drone attack on Israel in retaliation for the killing of one of its senior commanders in Beirut, triggering air raid sirens in northern Israel.GAZA — The Israeli military has issued so many evacuation orders in 10 months of conflict that many Gaza civilians no longer heed them, despairing of finding space or safety in the enclave.Over the first three weeks of August, the Israeli army sent out 11 evacuation orders via flyers dropped from planes, text messages or social media.They called on 250,000 Gazans, almost all of whom had been displaced at least once already, to leave their place of shelter."For your safety, we urge you to evacuate immediately," read one such order sent out on Thursday in the southern province of Khan Younis."Every time we arrive somewhere, we get a new evacuation order two days later. This is no way to live," Haitham Abdelaal told Agence France-Presse.Amneh Abu Daqqa, 45, said she saw no point in moving again, when there are so few options for safe haven. "To go where?" the displaced mother of five asked."There is nowhere safe, there are airstrikes everywhere."The United Nations said tens of thousands of civilians have been on the move again this week from Deir al-Balah and the southern city of Khan Younis after Israeli military evacuation orders, which precede military operations.The conflict has displaced about 90 percent of Gaza's population, often multiple times, leaving them deprived of shelter, clean water and other essentials as disease spreads, the UN says."Civilians are exhausted and terrified, running from one destroyed place to another, with no end in sight," Muhannad Hadi, a humanitarian coordinator of the UN, said on Thursday.The proliferation of Israeli evacuation orders also severely complicates relief distribution by United Nations agencies in a blockaded territory where aid trickles in via Israeli-held entry points.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied reports on Thursday suggesting that Israel is considering agreeing to the deployment of an international force along a narrow border strip between Gaza and Egypt known as the Philadelphi Corridor."Prime Minister Netanyahu insists on the principle that Israel will control the Philadelphi Corridor to prevent the rearmament of Hamas, which would allow them to repeat the atrocities of Oct 7," his office said in a statement.Ongoing fightingPalestinian health officials said Israeli strikes have killed at least 16 people in the Gaza Strip. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital received the bodies, which were counted by an Associated Press reporter and included the remains of a woman and three children, after strikes overnight and into Thursday.US and Israeli delegations started a new round of meetings in Cairo on Thursday aimed at resolving differences over a truce proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, two Egyptian security sources said.Egyptian and US officials had met to seek compromises over plans for providing security on the border between Egypt and Gaza following an Israeli military withdrawal demanded by Hamas, the sources said.The proposals were due to be presented to Israeli officials later on Thursday, with a Qatari delegation due to join on Friday, they added.Egypt, along with the United States and Qatar, has been a mediator in months of stop-start negotiations to secure a cease-fire in Gaza, as well as the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.Agencies Via XinhuaGAZA - The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 40,265, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Thursday.During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 42 people and wounded 163 others, bringing the total death toll to 40,265 and injuries to 93,144 since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, it added.There are still a number of victims trapped under the rubble and scattered on roads, as ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them, it said."Critical water wells and sanitation infrastructure have been repeatedly damaged throughout the war," the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said on social media platform X on Thursday."With overcrowding, lack of hygiene and unbearable heat, access to clean water continues to be a struggle in the Gaza Strip," it added.Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage. Though far away, Palestinians displaced by the ongoing conflict in Gaza have found some comfort in the help extended by Chinese organizations to the besieged enclave.Ahmed Ayesh Alnajjar, director general of international relations at the Education Ministry in Gaza, who is among thousands of those displaced in Khan Younis, conveys his message of thanks to China.JERUSALEM - Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that Hamas' Rafah Division in Gaza has been "defeated" and signaled that the military was shifting its focus to the fighting against Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border.Gallant made the remarks during a tour of the Philadelphi Corridor, an area that runs along the Gaza-Egypt border and which Israel seeks to maintain control even after a potential ceasefire. The Israeli Defense Ministry released a photo of Gallant, clad in a bulletproof vest and surrounded by commanders, in a Palestinian building that Israeli troops had seized and converted into a headquarters.He said that Division 162 of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had "defeated" Hamas' Rafah Division. During the assault on Gaza's southernmost city, the IDF destroyed 150 tunnels, according to figures revealed by Gallant. He added that "a small number" of tunnels remained intact and he had "given an immediate order" to destroy them.In May, the IDF launched a large ground offensive in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza that had been designated as a "safe zone" and was sheltering over one million displaced Palestinians.Israeli security officials have recently claimed that most potential military targets in Gaza have been exhausted. Gallant indicated that the military was now shifting its focus."The most important thing, in my view, in terms of strategy, is to achieve all the war's goals regarding Hamas and the hostages, and now to look northward," he said, referring to northern Israel, where ongoing conflict with Hezbollah has intensified since Oct 7, 2023.The cross-border tensions have heightened in recent weeks following the Israeli assassination of a senior Hezbollah official in Beirut at the end of July.Dubai is stepping up efforts to foster robust partnerships with China in key sectors such as logistics, trade, high technology and green energy, as industry insiders see huge potential in China's economic growth.The Dubai Business Forum — China, hosted by Dubai Chambers on Wednesday in Beijing, aims to attract high-growth companies to Dubai and support Chinese businesses in leveraging opportunities for regional and global expansion.In the opening remarks, Mohammad Ali bin Rashed Lootah, president and CEO of Dubai Chambers, said: "Dubai has become increasingly attractive to Chinese investors with global ambitions."According to him, by the end of the first quarter of this year, there have been about 5,400 Chinese companies registered as active members of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce.According to Dubai Chambers, China is Dubai's largest trading partner, with a non-oil trade volume of $67.8 billion in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 4 percent and an increase of 83 percent compared with 10 years ago.Abdulla Al Hashmi, chief operating officer of Parks & Zones, DP World GCC, a logistics company based in Dubai, underscored some key factors behind Dubai's achievements in international trade."We have made bold investments when we created the infrastructure that is needed to stimulate trade, whether it is the Jebel Ali Port or Al Maktoum Airport," he told China Daily.Besides, he highlighted the importance of simplifying business processes."We've established a single trade window, called Dubai Trade, where traders, manufacturers, and all supply chain participants can conveniently conduct their transactions," he said. "So the ease of doing business is extremely important and this is what Dubai excels at."Beijing Xiaocheng Technology, a company that works on integrated circuits and electric energy meters, is among those looking for business expansion and are interested in Dubai's favorable policies."We already established our own office in Dubai, and we are planning to further expand our business in Dubai in the future," Liu Hang, deputy general manager of the company, told China Daily.Stephen Hurst, managing director and head of the China Management Office at HSBC China, also sees "a massive opportunity" between Dubai and China."The Middle East is a very important region for us in terms of our strategy in supporting clients," Hurst told China Daily. He is now based in China and helps clients with banking solutions."China and the Middle East are long-standing trading partners, and Dubai in particular, so I see there is a huge opportunity for Chinese corporates that are going overseas, and Dubai can be the platform for them," he added.As China and the United Arab Emirates celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations, their economic ties have significantly strengthened. China has maintained its position as the largest trading partner of the UAE for many years. Last year, the non-oil trade between the two countries reached nearly $81 billion. The two countries also look forward to a bilateral trade volume of $200 billion by 2030, according to a joint statement issued by China and the UAE on May 30.When asked about the UAE's BRICS membership, which took effect on Jan 1, Al Hashmi said: "We are an advocate of open market, trade without border, so we believe that this membership will enhance the multilateral trade relationship between the UAE and BRICS countries, we believe there is an opportunity to strengthen that through dialogue among the BRICS nations."Wang Haoran contributed to this story.China, rather than the United States, is better positioned to be a negotiator and mediator among countries in the Middle East, a US expert says."The Chinese government talks to everybody in the region," said Jack Midgley, principal of the global consultancy Midgley & Co and an adjunct associate professor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University. "China's role as a convener, an advocate, a sponsor of all sides will be much stronger as time goes by."The US military said on Aug 11 that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Georgia, a nuclear submarine, to the Middle East. The Pentagon said in a statement that Austin issued the order after speaking with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant."It's unbelievably powerful," Midgley said of the ship, whose complement includes 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, each of which can carry a 200-kiloton nuclear warhead."The move of the USS Georgia into central command is the clearest possible signal that the US will defend Israel with nuclear weapons if necessary," he said, pointing out that the Pentagon's announcement was a public signal that the firepower could be used to defend Israel and also "a very powerful deterrent signal to the Iranians".Since October, the US position "has moved toward unconditional support for Israel and away from a more balanced position" that it took in the past, Midgley said.The US government and officials have repeatedly made statements supporting a two-state solution.However, since the recent escalation of the conflict in Gaza, "there is no discussion about any topic really by the US other than how much military support Israel needs", Midgley said."The Americans used to be the convener. They used to be the authority that everyone could talk to in the Middle East."Meanwhile, China's position is "a balanced one", he said, adding the country is "better able to address all the parties" than the US is."China is calling attention to the need of the Palestinians. At the same time, China has maintained its position that the key to success is restraint, negotiations and a two-state solution."So the Chinese government talks to everybody in the region. However, the US remains an essential military partner for everyone in the Middle East. That won't be changed anytime soon."'Hardly achieved anything'On Tuesday night, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken left Qatar, concluding his ninth tour to the Middle East. As with his previous eight trips, this one has hardly achieved anything, Xinhua News Agency commented."Despite the declared optimism from the American side, American mediation could not solve the problem between Hamas and Israel, because reaching an agreement will not be easy due to the fundamental differences between them," said Kheir Diabat, a professor of the International Affairs Department at Qatar University.Mostafa Amin, an Egyptian researcher on Arab and international affairs, said the failure of US mediation in the Middle East and its inability to solve the problem from the outset until now arise from the lack of real pressure from Washington on Israel to stop the war, while it continues to supply Israel with weapons to kill Palestinians.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right officials in the Israeli government had realized that the Joe Biden administration is unable to apply meaningful pressure on Israel because of its preoccupation with the upcoming presidential election and its unwillingness to jeopardize relations with Israel, Amin said.Midgley said the two-state solution currently is "much farther away than it ever has been", as none of the three requirements for the solution — cease-fire, agreement at some level on borders, and governance for Palestine — are met."And I think China's voice for a two-state solution and China's economic influence in the region can help keep this idea alive," he said."The US has already taken a position in favor of Israel and is providing unlimited military assistance to the Israelis."The second fact is that China maintains good relationships with all of the countries in the region, including Israel."This represents an opportunity for China to consolidate and improve its relationships in the Pacific while the United States is busy elsewhere. And I'm sure that Chinese policy will reflect that opportunity."China is one of several countries that has continued to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to alleviate the unprecedented humanitarian crisis.From November last year until July, about 400 Palestinians a day in Khan Younis City were among the beneficiaries of education and food and aid from mainly China and Malaysia among others, Ahmed Ayesh Alnajjar, director general of international relations at the Education Ministry in Gaza, told China Daily.Among the Chinese donors are civic organizations such as Beijing One Heart Sphere Charity Foundation (BOHS), China Pak Youth Exchange Community, and Lok Sin Charity.JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told hostage families on Tuesday that he is uncertain whether a deal with Hamas will be reached, emphasizing that Israel will not relinquish control of two corridors in the Gaza Strip, a key demand by Hamas, state-owned media reported."Israel will not withdraw under any circumstances from the Philadelphi Corridor and the Netzarim Corridor, despite enormous pressure to do so," Netanyahu told Gvura Forum and Tikva Forum, two groups representing families of hostages, as reported by Kan TV news.The Philadelphi Corridor is a border area between Egypt and Gaza, while the Netzarim Corridor divides the enclave into northern and southern zones. Israeli forces currently control both, but Hamas has insisted on Israel's withdrawal as part of a ceasefire agreement.Netanyahu's office did not deny the comments reportedly made during his meeting with the hostage families. In a statement, Netanyahu pledged to "preserve our strategic security assets despite significant pressures."Israeli officials involved in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations accused Netanyahu of attempting to sabotage efforts to reach a deal after a new bridging proposal was presented in Qatar over the weekend."Netanyahu's remarks were intended to derail the negotiations," officials told Kan TV. "The prime minister knows we are at a critical juncture, working on solutions for the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors ahead of the next summit. He is aware of the progress made, yet his statements contradict what was agreed upon with mediators."The remarks came a day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after meeting with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Monday, said Israel had accepted the bridging deal proposal. The proposal, advanced by Qatari, Egyptian, and U.S. mediators, was described by Blinken as a last-ditch effort to reach an agreement, which aims at securing a ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.Hamas has demanded that the deal include a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire.Outside the Kirya base in Tel Aviv, the Israeli military's headquarters, dozens of hostage families and supporters rallied on Tuesday, urging the government to sign a deal. Similar demonstrations took place across the country.The rallies were triggered by the retrieval of six hostages' bodies from a tunnel in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis during a military operation. They were kidnapped by Hamas fighters on Oct 7, 2023, during their assault on Israeli communities.Netanyahu praised the operation, stating, "Israel will continue to make every effort to bring our hostages back."However, military spokesman Daniel Hagari said at a press conference that "there are currently 109 hostages held by Hamas," and added, "We won't be able to rescue all of them through military operations." He added that the National Institute of Forensic Medicine is still determining the cause of their death.Meanwhile, Israel's Channel 13 TV reported that officials from the Israeli delegation expressed doubt over the resumption of talks in Cairo this week. Major General Nitzan Alon, representing the Israeli military in the delegation, may not attend due to Netanyahu's refusal to compromise on the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors. "If there is no compromise on the main issues, what is the point of going to Egypt?" officials told the channel.Hamas fighters took about 250 hostages during their Oct 7, 2023 assault on southern Israeli communities. While dozens have since been released in deals, Israeli security officials, speaking to Xinhua on condition of anonymity, said only about 60 hostages are believed to be alive.Israel's response to the attack has resulted in a massive onslaught, killing more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly civilians, and causing widespread destruction across the enclave, according to health authorities in Gaza.Dubai aspires to serve as a gateway for Chinese companies to broaden their presence in the Middle East, a senior official has said, hoping for joint efforts between China and the United Arab Emirates to capitalize on the progress over the past 40 years, fostering an even more fruitful future.The UAE holds a crucial position as a strategic partner in advancing the Belt and Road Initiative. From the onset of the BRI, the country has functioned as a vital trade portal connecting the Middle East with the global community, Mohammad Ali Rashed Lootah, president and CEO of Dubai Chambers, said in an interview with China Daily.He made the remarks before departing for Beijing to attend the Dubai Business Forum-China on Wednesday, when more than 50 Dubai-based companies and 350 Chinese ones will participate.Calling China "a priority market", Lootah said the event aims to showcase the diverse investment opportunities in the emirate; attract Chinese multinational companies, unicorns and fast-growing startups to Dubai; and support Chinese investors and businesses to establish partnerships with their counterparts in the Middle East."It will explore economic synergies, new frontiers in innovation and technology, as well as investment opportunities in high-potential sectors, such as green tech, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, healthcare and renewable energy," he said.Last year, Dubai remained the world's top destination for greenfield foreign direct investment projects for the third consecutive year.The Middle East hub is home to modern airports, seaports, logistics facilities and a well-developed transportation network with numerous free zones that provide businesses with world-class infrastructure and access to incentives, Lootah said."Dubai's strategic geographical location, combined with its world-class hard and soft infrastructure, numerous free zones and its ability to attract diverse high-quality talent, creates a dynamic ecosystem that is highly conducive for business growth," he said.This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the UAE. Their mutually beneficial cooperation has set a model for partnerships and different civilizations coexisting in harmony.Last year, amid a challenging global economic environment, the volume of China-UAE trade nearly reached the milestone of $100 billion, with more than 8,000 Chinese companies having invested and started business in the UAE, said Zhang Yiming, China's ambassador to the UAE, in May.The state visit to China by UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in late May has paved the way for further strengthening China-UAE ties, as the two countries' joint statement vows a bilateral trade volume of $200 billion by 2030.The Gulf country is also home to nearly 400,000 Chinese, Lootah said, adding that more than 5,100 Chinese companies had been registered by the end of the first quarter with Dubai Chamber of Commerce.China is also the largest trading partner of Dubai with non-oil bilateral trade worth $67.8 billion last year, a 4 percent year-on-year rise and a more than 80 percent growth compared with a decade ago, according to Dubai Chambers.Last month, the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee held its third plenum, focusing on advancing China's modernization, outlining comprehensive reforms and proposing more than 300 measures. Lootah said this sent a strong signal to the world that China will continue to deepen its reform and opening-up.Remarkable success"We see China as a global economic powerhouse and believe that its remarkable success story is set to continue," he said. "This is one of the reasons of why we have three international offices in China alone, in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Hong Kong, which is the highest in any other region around the world."As China has emerged as one of the world's largest digital economies and a leading global center for advanced technologies, Lootah emphasized Dubai's eagerness to enhance cooperation in AI, blockchain and the internet of things."We admire China's deep-rooted commitment to innovation and are excited about the vast trade and investment opportunities that can be leveraged to empower tech startups," he said, adding that the UAE's digital economy is expected to reach a value of more than $140 billion by 2031.Last year, Dubai unveiled the Dubai Economic Agenda, known as D33, to double the size of its economy to $8.7 trillion over the next decade. Lootah said this strategy and the BRI can be aligned to explore innovative, green and prosperous future, pointing out that the UAE's entry into BRICS is attracting more Chinese investors to Dubai."For us, China is a market of great strategic importance. ... We will serve as a catalyst for collaboration and mutual prosperity," he said.Pan Jie in Beijing contributed to this story.JERUSALEM - Israel has accepted a new proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.During a press conference in Tel Aviv, Blinken said that Netanyahu "confirmed that Israel approves" the new US-backed bridging proposal. The proposal was presented to Israel and Hamas by Qatari, Egyptian, and US mediators over the weekend.Blinken urged Hamas to approve the bridging proposal, emphasizing the urgency of addressing the suffering in Gaza, where more than 40,000 have been killed in Israeli assaults, and the need to release the hostages still held by Hamas.Blinken visited Israel amid ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, before heading to Egypt and Qatar, key mediators in the negotiations.Netanyahu released a video statement during Blinken's press conference, referring to his meeting with Blinken as "good and important", but did not explicitly voice support for the bridging proposal.The prime minister said the United States "showed understanding to our vital security needs amid joint efforts to release our hostages".Hamas had previously dismissed the bridging proposal, claiming it was too aligned with Israel's demands, particularly concerning Israel's insistence on maintaining military forces within the Palestinian enclave, and accused Israel of introducing new demands.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' planned visit to Gaza has been welcomed amid worsening humanitarian conditions in the enclave, including fears of a polio outbreak, despite the resumption of cease-fire talks led by mediators.Dina Yulianti Sulaeman, director of the Indonesia Center for Middle East Studies, said although Abbas' desire to come to Gaza is "a little bit late", it is "worthy of appreciation"."This new development is related to the unity agreement of the Palestinian factions in Beijing (last month) and the escalation that is happening due to the killing of Ismail Haniyeh," said Sulaeman, referring to the July 31 assassination of the Hamas leader in Teheran."I hope that Mr Abbas, who has been known to have a more accommodating position toward Israel when meeting directly with the resistance factions in Gaza, will increasingly provide support to take a firm stance against Israel, namely demanding that Israel stop its attacks on Gaza and open up humanitarian aid channels."Abbas announced his planned trip at the Turkish parliament during a visit on Thursday, the same day that the death toll in Gaza amid Israel's military campaign surpassed 40,000.There are also fears of a polio outbreak in Gaza.On Friday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to all parties for a ceasefire so that humanitarians can safely vaccinate more than half a million children in Gaza against polio.'Restoring unity'Palestine's Wafa news agency reported that Abbas and his government are preparing to travel to Gaza to "restore national unity" and emphasize that the State of Palestine and the Palestine Liberation Organization are the mandate holders responsible for the entire State of Palestine.Abbas was in communication with the UN, Arab countries and Israel to ensure the success of the trip, Wafa reported. But UN spokesman Michele Zaccheo said the idea that the UN could provide security "is probably not so realistic at this stage".He added that the principal responsibility for providing security in the occupied territories "lies with the occupying powers", Turkiye's state-run Anadolu Agency reported.Negotiations on a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel are set to resume on Wednesday in Cairo, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing Egyptian officials.Also on Friday, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said in a statement that their countries "share a common interest in the security of the State of Israel" and the "stability of the region as a whole" and they have a responsibility to support ending the current escalation and securing a lasting peace to the benefit of Israelis, Palestinians and the whole region.Muslim Imran, director of the Asia Middle East Center for Research and Dialogue in Malaysia, said the joint statement is "self-defeating" because it reads as if Israeli security is at stake, not the fact that Israel is "currently perpetrating one of the most heinous genocides in modern history".On her X account, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese called out Western powers on Friday for omitting civilian deaths in their statements.Referring to a joint statement by the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom last week, she said after 10 "catastrophic months", the three Western countries wrote a 21-line statement on the Middle East with "not a single word about the millions scarred by the ongoing atrocities".RAMALLAH - Preparations are taking place for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's planned visit to the Gaza Strip as the Palestinian officials have reached out to countries worldwide for support, according to a statement published by Palestinian official news Agency WAFA on Sunday.The visit aims to demonstrate solidarity with Gaza's residents, assert that the State of Palestine and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) are the legitimate authorities over all Palestinian territories, and promote national unity, said the statement.The statement noted that "the Palestinian leadership" is engaging with the UN agencies, UN Security Council members, Arab and Islamic countries, the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the EU, the African Union, and other global powers to ensure the initiative's success and garner support.Israel has also been informed, it added.In a speech delivered at a Turkish parliamentary assembly, Abbas said he decided to travel to Gaza with all members of the Palestinian leadership, emphasizing his commitment to stand with the Palestinian people, WAFA reported.CAIRO — Israeli strikes killed 19 people in Gaza on Sunday, including six children, Palestinian health authorities said, ahead of a visit to the region by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to try to push forward cease-fire talks.The children and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in the central town of Deir al-Balah, health officials said.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, but they said the strike destroyed rocket launchers used to hit Israel from the southern city of Khan Younis, the scene of intense fighting in recent weeks, and killed 20 Palestinian fighters.Diplomatic efforts to halt the current conflict and secure a deal to return hostages held in Gaza have intensified in recent days. Talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States are set to continue this week in the Egyptian capital Cairo, following a two-day meeting in Doha last week.Blinken is making his 10th trip to the region since the conflict began, days after the US put forward bridging proposals that the mediating countries believe would close gaps between the warring parties.He is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials.Netanyahu's office said on Saturday there was "cautious optimism" a deal could be reached and US officials have also been positive, while cautioning there was still work to be done.However, Hamas said optimistic US comments were "deceptive" and accused Netanyahu of making new conditions in an attempt to "blow up" the negotiation.Agencies via Xinhua MANILA -- Filipinos staying in Lebanon have been advised to leave the Middle East country as early as possible as tension escalates due to the threat of an all-out war between the Iran-backed group Hezbollah and Israel.In a social media advisory Friday night, the Philippine Embassy in Lebanon urged Filipinos to leave when the airport remains operational."We advise all Filipino nationals to prioritize their safety and depart the country as soon as possible," the advisory read.To Filipinos who cannot leave Lebanon, the Embassy "strongly recommended" that they evacuate to safer areas outside capital Beirut, south of Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley.There are approximately 17,500 Filipinos staying in Lebanon, and around 3,000 are in southern Lebanon.In early October last year, tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border spiked in the wake of Hamas' attack on Israel from Gaza and Israel's subsequent military campaign.The heightening tension on southern Lebanon's border forced the Philippines to raise the alert level to 3 on a scale of 4 and urge its citizens to leave.In July this year, the Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) renewed its appeal for Filipinos to avail of the government's voluntary repatriation program as tensions in Lebanon continue to escalate.However, the DFA said that only about 300 Filipinos have been repatriated since the Philippine government raised the alert level to 3.Alert level 3 or voluntary repatriation is issued "when violent disturbances or external aggression occur in a limited area."JERUSALEM -- The Israeli army's fighting in the Gaza Strip has ended, Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported late Friday night.Citing senior security officials, the TV said that Israel can return and re-enter Gaza "when there is new intelligence," but in general the Israeli military's activity in the Palestinian enclave is over.According to the channel, the Israeli army told the decision-makers that the Rafah Brigade of Hamas had been defeated and that it practically did not exist.It added that these things were said at the political level during the security situation assessment discussions in the last few days.Israeli senior defense officials also told the political echelon that this is the time to start a hostage deal when most of the fighting units of Hamas are disbanded, Kan TV noted.The channel also reported that the Israeli delegation that participated in the negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza on Friday did not arrive in Qatar by flight for fear of an Iranian attack. The delegation landed in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and proceeded to Doha, not by flight.A joint statement from the United States, Egypt, and Qatar released on Friday said that "over the last 48 hours in Doha, senior officials from our governments have engaged in intensive talks as mediators aiming to conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees." Palestinian death toll in Gaza exceeds 40,000: health authoritiesIran has stressed its right to self-defense in possibly retaliating against Israel and urged Western powers to pressure Tel Aviv into a cease-fire in Gaza instead of dictating to Teheran what it should do.Iran has accused Israel of the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Teheran on July 31, which has escalated tensions in the Middle East. Israel has yet to publicly confirm carrying out the attack.Nasser Kanaani, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iran, criticized on Tuesday the joint statement by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom on the contentious Middle East issue, accusing the Western countries of ignoring Israel's crimes against the Palestinians while dictating to Iran what response measures it should or should not take following the assassination of Haniyeh.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned on Monday evening that some Western states' continued support to Israel has emboldened it to keep threatening peace and security at the regional and global levels, according to the IRNA news agency.Iran also rejected the United States' accusations over its alleged involvement in the Gaza peace talks.Meanwhile, Hamas slammed Washington for approving a multibillion-dollar arms deal to support Israel amid a surge in Palestinian civilian death tolls in recent months."The situation in the Middle East is highly volatile and if global powers aren't cautious, it could escalate into a world war," Abdul Wahed Jalal Nori, an analyst and lecturer at the Department of Fundamental and Inter-Disciplinary Studies at the International Islamic University Malaysia, told China Daily.The advice from US allies came just as US President Joe Biden's administration approved more than $20 billion worth of arms sales to Israel, including new F-15 fighter jets and tens of thousands of tank and mortar shells, US news outlet Axios reported.Abdul Wahed said the timing of the announcement could reflect broader geopolitical calculations, where the US aims to maintain its influence in the Middle East.Increasing turmoilGiven the increasing regional turmoil, he said Washington may be reaffirming its commitment to Israel's security and military superiority, not peace."They don't want peace. The situation is very dangerous. … Genocide is taking place. Not one is talking about it (to stop the genocide)," said Abdul Wahed."A multibillion-dollar arms deal to support Israel doesn't contribute to regional peace; it only fuels more killing and destruction. Instead, Washington could leverage its influence to pressure Israel to end the war, stop the killing of civilians, and invest those funds in rebuilding peace," he added.Belal Alakhras, a political analyst and Palestinian researcher at the University of Malaya in Malaysia, noted that the US approval of the arms to Israel contradicts its public statements on a cease-fire and "aligns it with Israel against other regional players".For months, he said, the US has "tried to isolate the war on Gaza", but Israel's inability to defeat Hamas has "led to recent escalations in Iran and Lebanon, including the assassination of Haniyeh in Teheran, further muddying the waters"."The US is not acting as a rational power considering its global interests, instead allowing itself to be influenced by Israel's actions which appears to be marching to the beat of its own drum without strategic foresight," Alakhras told China Daily, adding that the critical moment highlights the need for other major powers to "step up to the plate"."The other concerned actors could potentially join forces to turn the tide and work toward ending the regional conflict comprehensively. Without such efforts, the situation risks snowballing based on US actions in lockstep with Israel, potentially setting the region ablaze if left unchecked," he added.BEIRUT - Hezbollah attacked the Mount Neria base, a battalion leadership headquarters of Israel's Golani Brigade forces, with volleys of Katyusha rockets late Tuesday night, according to Lebanese TV channel al-Manar.Earlier, Hezbollah had launched over 20 rockets from southern Lebanon at the Meron base in northern Israel, both al-Manar and Al Jazeera have reported.Al-Manar reported that heavy rocket fire, explosions, and sirens were heard in Western Galilee.Hezbollah announced that its fighters targeted an Israeli deployment at the Jal Al-Deir site with a barrage of rockets at 10:00 pm on Tuesday, hitting them directly, according to the National News Agency (NNA).Israeli warplanes launched airstrikes targeting the Lebanese villages of At Tiri, Haddatha, and Rchaf around midnight, NNA added.Israeli warplanes also conducted airstrikes on the Lebanese villages of Kafr Kila and Khiam, as well as the municipality of Kunin, it noted.Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border escalated on Oct 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the day before. Israel then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.The situation escalated further after Israel's attack on Dahieh in Beirut's southern suburbs, killing a Hezbollah senior military commander, Fouad Shokor, and seven civilians. Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah threatened a definite and painful response to the Israeli raid at the appropriate time and place.GAZA - Nearly 84 percent of the Gaza Strip is under evacuation orders issued by the Israeli army, a UN relief and human development agency said Tuesday."People run for their lives, grabbing what they can and leaving everything else behind. They are exhausted and have nowhere safe to go," the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said on social media platform X.Since the onset of the Gaza war, the Israeli army has demanded that residents in Gaza leave their homes in preparation for military operations. Displaced individuals have been forced to seek refuge in UNRWA shelters, stay with relatives, or set up tents in streets and schools.According to data from the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, 2 million people out of a total population of 2.3 million in the enclave have been displaced due to the current conflict.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a Hamas attack on Oct 7, 2023, which resulted in approximately 1,200 deaths and around 250 hostages being taken.The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 39,929, the Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Tuesday.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations recently warned that the entire Gaza Strip is at high risk of famine.According to Palestinian organizations active in the enclave, many diseases, including skin conditions, have been reported in overcrowded shelters in Gaza.Palestinian militant group Hamas is pushing for implementing a Gaza cease-fire plan previously backed by the United Nations Security Council rather than holding further rounds of talks for a fresh pact, ahead of a meeting on Thursday proposed by negotiators.In a statement on Telegram, Hamas said it wanted a deal based on United States President Joe Biden's May 31 cease-fire proposal, the framework for which was laid out by mediators Qatar and Egypt on May 6, and adopted by the UN Security Council Resolution 2735, Al Jazeera reported on Sunday.The mediators should enforce the deal on Israel instead of pursuing further rounds of negotiations or new proposals as the process prolongs the killing of Palestinian civilians, Hamas said in the statement, as Israel continues its deadly airstrikes on Gaza.Jawaid Iqbal, chairman of the Department of West Asian and North African Studies at Aligarh Muslim University in India, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to eliminate Hamas, instead of negotiating a cease-fire with it.Netanyahu had been firm on his position of destroying Hamas and getting all hostages being held by the group, Iqbal said.Gaza officials told Agence France-Presse on Monday that they had identified 75 of 93 Palestinians killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school building in Gaza, while Israel's military said the weekend raid had "eliminated" 31 militants.Iqbal said Israel "uses the smokescreen of endless negotiations to continue the war"."The recent Tabeen school massacre demonstrates this opposition to cease-fire," he said.Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a video published on IDF's X account that they took numerous steps to mitigate the risk to civilians after receiving "clear intelligence" of the threat posed by "terrorists".'Precision strike'The IDF conducted a precision strike on one specific building where, according to their intelligence, no women and children were present, he said.Hagari blamed Hamas for abusing civilians and civilian infrastructure to attack Israel. These include underground tunnels that run under towns, hospitals, schools, mosques and UN facilities, he said.However, Hassan Ben Imran, a board member at nonprofit Law for Palestine, told China Daily that Israel's bombing of schools is claiming the lives of "mostly children, with no military targets"."What Israel announced is complete nonsense; even the 'targets' they used to justify the bombing with are actually not legal targets," he said.Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, said on X that just in the past few days, more than 75,000 people have been displaced in southwest Gaza.The International Committee of the Red Cross made a call on X to make the Geneva Conventions a political priority."Seize every chance to de-escalate," said Mirjana Spoljaric, president of ICRC, on the 75th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions on Monday."The faithful application of international humanitarian law can bolster peace initiatives. We must reduce suffering and protect humanity from further destruction."Meanwhile, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered a guided missile submarine to the Middle East and is asking the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to sail more quickly to the area, the Pentagon said on Sunday, as mounting tensions raise fears of a region-wide conflict.Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder said Austin, who spoke with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant on Sunday, had also ordered the USS Georgia guided missile submarine to the area.The US military had already said it will deploy additional fighter jets and navy warships to the Middle East as Washington seeks to bolster Israeli defenses.Agencies contributed to this story.Iran and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah's apparent restraint since Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh's assassination on Iranian soil underscores the region's commitment to de-escalation and has nothing to do with Washington's show of force, analysts said.They also said Iran and Hezbollah, despite being painted as "rogue" by Israel and the United States, are also trying to encourage to put "an end to the ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians" and urged Washington and Tel Aviv to stop behaviors that defy international consensus.Even as the region is bracing for Iran and Hezbollah's response, Al Jazeera reported that Khan Younis faced a heavy bombing campaign with nearly 30 air attacks, destroying buildings and infrastructure in the span of a few hours and eastern Khan Younis becoming uninhabitable, "turning gradually into a wasteland".Thousands fled on Thursday, carrying essentials like small gas cylinders, mattresses, tents, backpacks and blankets.Officials from Israel and the US said they believe Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' newly named political chief and one of the architects of the Oct 7 attack on Israel, could be hiding in tunnels under Khan Younis.Mehran Kamrava, a professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar, said Iran's restraint "so far has nothing to do with the US show of force".US media outlet Axios first reported on Aug 4 that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his G7 counterparts that Iran and Hezbollah may attack Israel in the next 24 to 48 hours.Iran and Hezbollah had earlier vowed to respond to Haniyeh's assassination, which they said was Israel's doing.Diplomatic toneWhile Iran's acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani told the emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on Wednesday that Iran has the right to self-defense, the joint communique of the 57-member Muslim bloc firmly held on to its diplomatic tone."One of the things we've seen consistent in the strategic behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran is its unwillingness or inability to respond positively to threats," Kamrava told China Daily."The restraint that Iran has shown so far has a number of reasons, but none of those reasons have anything to do with the supposed show of US strength, which has been quite minimal so far or fears of an Israeli reprisal, which the Iranians fully expect and anticipate."Rasha Al Joundy, a senior researcher at the Dubai Public Policy Research Centre, told China Daily that Iran "is gaining from this delay" and is able to show how much it has changed regarding its relations with Saudi Arabia and consequently other Arab leaders in the region."This was notable through the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement and the OIC meeting and final statement. This demonstration of solidarity with Iran after (Haniyeh's assassination) gave diplomatic weight to Iran as a victim of aggression, not as a rogue state like Israel and US like to paint Iran," Al Joundy said.She said Iran and the other Gulf Arab countries do not want an allout war, so the OIC meeting called on the Security Council to fulfill its role in managing conflicts, "which the Security Council is not doing due to the US backing of Israel".Palestinian presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said on Thursday that Israel had entered the stage of being internationally isolated and rejected, "thanks to its aggressive policies and total disregard of the United Nations resolutions and international law", Palestine's WAFA news agency reported.Abu Rudeineh slammed the measures as "provocative behaviors" that were intended to defy the international community and called on the US to compel Israel to halt the fighting against Gaza.Various media outlets reported that cease-fire talks are expected to resume next week with the Israeli delegation in attendance.A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Friday confirmed this, saying that pursuant to the proposal by the US and other mediators, Israel "will, on Aug 15, send the negotiations team to a place to be determined in order to finalize the details of the implementation of the framework agreement".Mike Gu in Hong Kong and agencies contributed to this story.jan@chinadailyapac.com  JERUSALEM -- Israel replied to Qatari, Egyptian and US mediators early Friday, saying that it will send a delegation to resume talks on a Gaza ceasefire deal on Aug 15.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that the negotiation team will be dispatched "to finalize the details for implementing the framework agreement."The announcement was made after mediators of the three countries released a joint statement, calling on Israel and Hamas to restart the talks on Aug. 15 to close all remaining gaps in the proposed deal and begin implementing it without further delay.Editor's note: There are no signs of letup in violence in Gaza as the conflict enters the 11th month. China Daily looks at the international community's efforts in finding a solution as well as humanitarian crisis on the strip.With both the death toll and humanitarian situation rapidly worsening in Gaza, the international community has made continued efforts to end the conflict, with the UN Security Council adopting at least four resolutions, namely Resolution 2712, 2720, 2728 and 2735.The resolutions call for an immediate cease-fire, the immediate and unconditional release of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas, the need to expand the flow of humanitarian goods into the Gaza Strip, and reinforce the protection of civilians in the conflict zone.However, until now, there have been no signs of a letup in the conflict despite the diplomatic efforts, not even after the Paris Summer Olympics torch was lighted on July 26.The desperate appeals from the families of Israeli hostages, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to bring their loved ones home, have fallen on deaf ears.An advisory from the International Court of Justice, published on July 19, declared that Israel's laws and measures violate the international prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid.The court also demanded that Israel end its occupation of Palestinian territories, dismantle its settlements in the West Bank, provide full reparations to Palestinian victims and facilitate the return of displaced people.But all these consolidated efforts, legal advice and international opinion continue to be ignored.A series of international condemnations and resolutions largely aimed at preventing Israel's military strikes on the Gaza Strip have done little to improve the conditions of aid worker Nebal Farsakh and her colleagues, as well as the 2 million Palestinians struggling for survival in their homeland.Despite the existence of international humanitarian laws, "our teams have been strategically and repeatedly targeted", which has resulted in the killing of 19 Palestine Red Crescent Society members up to this moment, Farsakh, a spokesperson for the group, told China Daily.Farsakh noted that while several United Nations resolutions have been passed to restrain Israel since the conflict in Gaza began, these have had no direct impact on their work — in terms of ensuring the aid workers' safety.She said the group's objective is to ensure "the protection of our staff, the humanitarians, medical personnel and medical facilities" so they can continue to provide lifesaving work.On Aug 3, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies confirmed the death of one of their own — Tamer Jalal Muhammad Saqr — who died after he was shot during an Israeli raid on the Balata refugee camp east of Nablus in the West Bank on July 27. He was helping the wounded civilians after a blast killed two people and injured more than 20 others.On Aug 8, the US-based food aid charity World Central Kitchen said on its X account that Nadi Sallout, an integral member of the warehouse team from the early days in Rafah and a humanitarian at his very core, was killed near Deir al-Balah, Gaza.On April 1, seven of its staff, which included citizens from the US, Australia, Britain and Poland, were killed after the Israeli military attacked their three-vehicle convoy despite being clearly marked with logos of the organization.The schools in Gaza are not safe either. On Aug 4, at least 25 Palestinians were killed when an Israeli airstrike hit the al-Nasr and Hassan Salama schools in Gaza City, Xinhua News Agency reported. Many of the victims were children and women. Israeli Army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said the attack was aimed at militants operating inside Palestinian schools.Editor's note: China Daily presents the series Friends Afar to tell the stories of people-to-people exchanges between China and other countries. Through the vivid narration of the people in the stories, readers can get a better understanding of a country that is boosting openness.China has spent many years developing its automation and robotics industries, and it is now the appropriate time to bring that expertise to the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC, said Saleh Al Tunaib, co-founder and CEO of btr.tech.The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman."We've been working with Chinese companies for a while and we found there are huge opportunities," Al Tunaib said, noting there was "ease of working and efficiencies" in the way the Chinese companies do business."Usually, when we try to bring technologies from Europe to the Middle East, it takes between nine and 12 months to bring them here," Al Tunaib said. In contrast, Chinese companies take three months to come in and deploy their technologies, he added.Al Tunaib noted he has been working in the retail industry for almost 15 years, and said he sees a huge need for automation in the sector. For instance, the value of e-commerce can be expected to reach $40 billion in the next couple of years, in his view.When his team built their first automated warehouse, they went through a process of trying to choose the right technology. "We dealt with mainly US and European technologies, as the access to Chinese technology was very difficult… in 2020," he said.It was only when his team gained more exposure to the Chinese market that they realized the existence of many Chinese technologies that they could bring to the Middle East region.In the Middle East, there was not enough access to Chinese technology, he said. Al Tunaib's team seeks to bridge the gap between China and the Middle East as there is a "huge opportunity" for bringing Chinese e-commerce technology to the region.Al Tunaib's team, which runs a logistics hub out of Kuwait, operates its own software to integrate the use of robotics in the retail industry.After operating AutoStore, an innovative automated material handling solution, for a few years, his business gained a better understanding of the Chinese market, he said. Then, with the help of eWTP Arabia Capital, which provides access to technology from mature global markets, Al Tunaib's team visited China in January.They visited four cities in China, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, where they interacted with multiple robotics companies.According to Al Tunaib, his company is setting up clients with auto parts and e-commerce warehouses in Kuwait across 35,000 square meters with the help of robotics technology from China. One of the companies involved in the project is Quicktron Robotics, a Shanghai-based firm in robotic logistics solutions. His team has been working with other Chinese manufacturers such as Megvii and Senad since its visit in January, he said.There's no need for any data to prove the need to connect Asia with the GCC and Europe. The integration of cross-border operations will bring in more business and connect us even further, he added.Such an integration of cross-border operations will "take us to another level. It will change the way we do business", Al Tunaib said.According to Al Tunaib, there is great growth momentum in Saudi Arabia as the nation plans to spend $27 billion over the next four years to help improve logistics and the ports sector.The investment is part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 and aims to connect Asia through Saudi Arabia to Europe by becoming a global logistics hub.Expertise in automationBy leveraging the Chinese company's expertise in automation, Al Tunaib's company aims to transform the logistics operations of e-commerce businesses throughout the GCC region."Today we represent Quicktron, Shenzhen DBL Technology, and many other Chinese companies in the Middle East region," he added.Al Tunaib said an obvious advantage of Chinese companies is their focus on a niche area in the logistics sector."Although there are different segments of robotics, including drones or electronic vehicles, within each segment of robotics every Chinese company has its own focus, such as the Automated Case-handling Mobile Robot. The Chinese companies want to be the best in a specific technology."In many other countries, what we've seen is that they try to do something of everything," he noted. In this process, "sometimes you lose focus", Al Tunaib added.Al Tunaib collaborates with Chinese companies in two ways. One is by bringing technology to the region and adopting these for the public and private sectors. The other way is bringing relevant technologies and manufacturing partially or entirely in the GCC."So, there are ways for us to innovate together, bring our minds and resources together," he said.According to Al Tunaib, the people of Gulf countries and China share similar traits. "I love China and its people," he said. GAZA -- Hamas announced on Tuesday the selection of Yahya Sinwar as its political bureau chief, replacing late chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran last week."We announce the selection of leader Yahya Sinwar as head of the movement's political bureau, succeeding leader Ismail Haniyeh," Hamas said in a statement.Sinwar, 61, has been the Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip since 2017. He spent more than 20 years in Israeli prisons and was released under a prisoner exchange deal with Israel in 2011. He is considered by Israel as one of the main planners of the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel.Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on July 31, which Hamas attributed to a "treacherous" Israeli raid on his residence.BEIRUT - An Israeli airstrike Tuesday hit a house in the village of Maifadoun in southern Lebanon, killing four people, the National News Agency reported.ISLAMABAD - Pakistan will emphasize the urgency of peace and provision of relief assistance for Gaza in the upcoming Organization of Islamic Cooperation's (OIC) meeting, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry has said.Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will attend the Extraordinary Meeting of the OIC convened at the request of Palestine and Iran in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah on Wednesday, the ministry said in a statement on Monday.He will present the South Asian country's serious concerns about the dire situation in Gaza and the wider Middle East region, it added."As one of the staunchest supporters of the Palestinian cause, Pakistan has always been at the forefront in raising its voice at all international fora, including the OIC," the statement said.GAZA - At least 25 Palestinians were killed by Israeli airstrikes on the schools of al-Nasr and Hassan Salama in Gaza City, Palestinian security and medical sources said Sunday.Israeli warplanes bombed with several missiles at the two schools, security sources said. Medical sources told Xinhua that at least 25 Palestinians were killed and dozens of others wounded as a result of Israeli air raids.Most of the victims are women and children, the Civil Defense Authority in Gaza said in a statement.Meanwhile, Israeli Army Spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a statement that Israeli warplanes attacked militants operating inside Hamas command and control complexes that were hidden inside the Hassan Salama and al-Nasr schools in Gaza City.Since Oct 7, 2023, Hamas and the Israeli army have been involved in a large-scale war, right after Hamas carried out its unprecedented attack on the Israeli towns adjacent to the besieged coastal enclave.The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip has risen to 39,583, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Sunday.RAMALLAH - China on Thursday donated $3 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to support its emergency humanitarian efforts in Gaza.Zeng Jixin, head of Office of the People's Republic of China to the State of Palestine, signed the contribution agreement with Deputy Commissioner General (Operational Support) of the UNRWA Antonia Marie De Meo, the office said in a statement.China has always supported the UNRWA's active performance of its duty, and called on the international community to support the agency's work, Zeng said, adding that China had provided emergency cash assistance to the agency after the outbreak of the Gaza conflict last year.China will continue to implement the Global Security Initiative and work with the international community to end the fighting in Gaza at an early date, ease the disastrous humanitarian situation, and implement the two-state solution, Zeng said.De Meo, on behalf of the UNRWA, expressed gratitude for China's consistent support and said that China's contribution was critical.She also expressed willingness to strengthen cooperation with China to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.TEHRAN -- Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said on Saturday that Hamas Politburo Chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated by a "short-range projectile loaded with an almost 7-kg warhead.""In view of the conducted investigations, the terrorist operation has been carried out through firing from outside the guests' residence a short-range projectile loaded with an almost 7 kg warhead, causing an intense explosion," the IRGC said in its third statement about Haniyeh's assassination in an alleged Israeli attack in the Iranian capital Tehran, according to the armed force's official news outlet Sepah News.The statement added the "terrorist" attack had been designed and carried out by Israel with the US government's support.The IRGC stressed that "the revenge for Haniyeh's blood will be definite," adding the "adventurist and terrorist" Israel would receive a "decisive response to this crime, which is a harsh punishment, at the appropriate time and place and with the appropriate quality."Haniyeh, who had been invited to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday, was killed along with his bodyguard early Wednesday when their residence in Tehran was hit.Iran held funeral processions on Thursday for Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh after he was killed in a strike in Teheran blamed on Israel, while United Nations Security Council countries called for stepped-up diplomatic efforts to avert a wider Middle East conflict.Thousands of mourners paid respects to Haniyeh as the Israeli military confirmed that an airstrike in Gaza last month killed the Hamas military chief, Mohammed Deif.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh ahead of his burial in Qatar, with President Masoud Pezeshkian standing next to him. State television later showed the coffins placed in a truck and moved on the street toward the Azadi Square in Teheran and people showering flowers at them.The assassination of Haniyeh, who went to Teheran to attend Pezeshkian's inauguration on Wednesday, sparked threats of revenge against Israel and fueled concerns that the Gaza conflict is turning into a wider Middle East war.It occurred just hours after a top Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr, was killed in an Israeli strike on Lebanon's capital Beirut in retaliation for a deadly weekend rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.At a news briefing on Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said the country is deeply concerned that the assassination may plunge the region into further turmoil and stressed the necessity of a permanent cease-fire in Gaza as soon as possible."There should be no more escalation of conflict and confrontation," he said. "China is always committed to safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East and is opposed to external interference. We stand ready to work with relevant parties toward lasting peace and security in the region."Charter principle stressedFu Cong, China's permanent representative to the UN, said the assassination was "a blatant attempt to sabotage peace efforts and wantonly trampled on the fundamental UN Charter principle of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states".The Gaza conflict has been going on for 300 days, resulting in nearly 40,000 deaths and an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe, Fu said.The UN Security Council adopted a resolution in early June aimed at reaching a comprehensive Gaza cease-fire deal in three phases.However, Fu said negotiations have yet to yield any progress, "while the spillover effects of this conflict are increasingly visible, with the tensions between Lebanon and Israel, between Syria and Israel, and in the Red Sea sounding the alarm frequently".Failure to achieve a cease-fire in Gaza was responsible for worsening tensions, he said. "Countries with major influence must put more pressure and work more vigorously ... to put out the flames of war in Gaza."Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran's UN ambassador, said Teheran has consistently exercised maximum restraint but reserves its right to respond decisively. He called on the Security Council to condemn Israel and punish it with sanctions.Iran's first vice-president Mohammad Reza Aref said his country has no intention of escalating the Middle East conflict, state media reported.Robert Wood, the United States' deputy ambassador to the UN, called for members of the Security Council with influence over Iran "to increase pressure on it to stop escalating its proxy conflict against Israel and other actors".Israel has declined to comment on the Teheran strike, but experts said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is likely to benefit domestically from the killing, Agence France-Presse reported."It's a tactical, not a strategic victory (for Netanyahu), he scored points but that could change very quickly", said Asher Cohen, a political science professor at Israel's Bar Ilan University.Agencies and Mo Jingxi in Beijing contributed to this story.JERUSALEM -- The Israeli army announced Thursday that Mohammed Deif, the commander of Hamas' military wing, was killed by Israeli airstrike in Khan Yunis area in the Gaza Strip on July 13.GENEVA — The UN human rights office issued a report on Wednesday saying Palestinians detained by Israeli authorities since the Oct 7 attacks faced waterboarding, sleep deprivation, electric shocks, the release of dogs and other forms of torture and mistreatment.The report said Israel's prison service held more than 9,400 "security detainees" as of the end of June, and some have been held in secret without access to lawyers or respect for their legal rights.A summary of the report, based on interviews with former detainees and other sources, decried a "staggering" number of detainees, including men, women, children, journalists and human rights defenders, and said such practices raise concerns about arbitrary detention.Often, they were blindfolded and shackled before being transported to Israel and placed in "cage-like" military centers and forced to wear nothing but diapers for prolonged periods, it said. The report said 53 detainees died in custody.Agencies via XinhuaHamas said on Wednesday its political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike in Teheran and vowed the act "will not go unanswered".Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed in a statement the death of Haniyeh, hours after he attended a swearing-in ceremony for the country's new President Masoud Pezeshkian.The statement said Haniyeh's residence in Teheran was hit and he was killed along with a bodyguard, adding the attack is under investigation and details will be released later.Iran declared three days of mourning.An "official and public" funeral ceremony for Haniyeh would be held in Teheran on Thursday before his body is flown to Qatar, his base in recent years, for burial on Friday, Hamas said.Israel declined to comment on the strike, which came after it struck a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut on Tuesday, targeting a senior commander of the Lebanese militant group it blamed for a deadly weekend rocket strike on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.Speaking in an interview with Channel News Asia in Singapore, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was "not aware of or involved in" the strike that killed Haniyeh.Haniyeh was elected head of the Hamas political bureau in 2017 to succeed Khaled Meshaal.The killing has caused wide concerns and condemnation, with many warning of "chaos" in the Middle East.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened "harsh punishment" for Haniyeh's killing, saying, "We consider it our duty to seek revenge for his blood as he was martyred in the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran."Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned Haniyeh's killing as a "cowardly act". "He urged our people and their forces to unite, remain patient, and stand firm against the Israeli occupation," his office said.Palestinian factions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank called for a general strike and protest marches across the territory.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said China firmly opposes and condemns the assassination of Haniyeh. "We feel worried that the issue may cause further turbulence in the region," Lin told a regular news conference on Wednesday.Noting that China always believes that regional disputes should be settled through negotiations and dialogue, he called for an early, comprehensive and permanent cease-fire in Gaza to avoid further escalation of conflicts.Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani cast doubt on the success of future mediation between Israel and Hamas following the killing of Haniyeh."Political assassinations & continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side? Peace needs serious partners," Sheikh Mohammed, who has led Qatar's mediation efforts, wrote on X.Russia, Turkiye and Iraq also condemned it.Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles also warned of "profound "risks for further escalation in the Middle East after Israel was blamed for the assassination of Haniyeh on Iranian soil. "I think all of us look at what's occurring in the Middle East and want to see an end to the catastrophe that is playing out," he said.No sign of an endHaniyeh's assassination came as Israel's military campaign in Gaza approaches the end of its 10th month with no sign of an end to a conflict that has threatened to spiral into a wider regional conflict. Ceasefire talks brokered by Egypt and Qatar appear to have faltered.At the same time, the risk of a war between Israel and Hezbollah has grown following the strike in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights that killed 12 children on Saturday and the subsequent killing of the senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr.Hezbollah has not yet confirmed Shukr's death, but said he was in the building hit by an Israeli strike.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its Oct 7 attacks on Israel, which sparked the conflict in Gaza.The attacks resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally. Israel's campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,400 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's Health Ministry.Agencies and Wang Qingyun in Beijing contributed to this story.MIKE GU in Hong Kongmikegu@chinadailyhk.comTEHRAN/GAZA -- Hamas Politburo Chief Ismail Haniyeh and one of his bodyguards have been killed in the Iranian capital of Tehran, Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said on Wednesday.Haniyeh and his bodyguard were killed early Wednesday when their residence was hit in Tehran, according to a statement published on the IRGC's official news outlet Sepah News.The statement said the attack was under investigation and the results would be announced later.The Islamic Hamas movement confirmed the death of its leader, saying Haniyeh was assassinated by an Israeli attack in Iran.In a press statement, Hamas said that it "mourns to the Palestinian people, the Arab and Islamic nation, and the free people of the world," after their leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli raid on his residence in Tehran.Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday.He was also expected to discuss with the Iranian president the political and field developments related to the Palestine-Isreal conflict in the Gaza Strip, a source close to Hamas told Xinhua.The Israeli army has no comment on the issue yet.Since Oct. 7 last year, Israel has been launching a large-scale strike on Hamas.According to Gaza health authorities, the Israeli offensive has led to the killing of over 38,000 Palestinians in the enclave, while the UN estimated that nearly 2 million people there have been displaced. Iran's new President Masoud Pezeshkian, who was inaugurated on Tuesday in the presence of dignitaries from more than 80 countries, promised to continue to support Palestine and increase exchanges with other countries while boosting domestic development.Peng Qinghua, special envoy of Chinese President Xi Jinping and vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attended the inauguration ceremony held in the hall of the Iranian Parliament in Teheran.Two presidents, 11 speakers of parliament, four deputy parliament speakers, four prime ministers, along with special envoys, ministers and deputy ministers were among the foreign guests who attended the ceremony, official news agency IRNA reported.Exchanging views by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Pezeshkian discussed the revival of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a 2015 nuclear deal between Teheran and world powers, and the removal of sanctions, Xinhua News Agency reported.The United States reimposed many sanctions against Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from the deal in 2018.In the one-hour call, Pezeshkian expressed his readiness to improve ties with France based on honesty and mutual confidence building, said a statement issued by the president's office.While meeting on Monday with Ziad al-Nakhalah, secretary-general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, Pezeshkian said, "Supporting the cause of the oppressed Palestinian nation will continue with strength and nothing can disrupt our will and resolve on this issue," IRNA reported.In a message to Pezeshkian, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN eagerly waits for cooperation with the new government of the Islamic republic, IRNA reported.Iran will also enhance exchanges with other countries, especially the Islamic ones, to create synergy among Islamic societies, Pezeshkian told guests.Dina Yulianti Sulaeman, director of the Indonesia Center for Middle East Studies, told China Daily she is optimistic that Pezeshkian will maintain a firm stance on the Palestinian issue.During his inauguration speech before Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the new president said he "will follow the path of the martyrs", which Sulaeman said can be interpreted as signaling Iran's resistance against the US and Israel.Sulaeman said Pezeshkian will continue the late president Ebrahim Raisi's policy of enhancing trade and investment ties with regional countries, and leveraging regional organizations such as BRICS and Shanghai Cooperation Organization.Nagapushpa Devendra, a West Asia analyst and research scholar at the University of Erfurt in Germany, said: "Regionally, the new president is likely to continue seeking strategic involvement ... (In) hindsight, there may be efforts to reduce regional tensions through diplomatic channels especially with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia."Domestically, Pezeshkian may focus on mitigating the effect of sanctions, especially those imposed by the US, Devendra said."Since Pezeshkian is a reformist, there is definitely some expectation in terms of introducing some incremental changes to improve freedom of expression and political participation," he said.Seyed Mostafa Khoshcheshm, a former professor at the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Faculty of International Relations, said: "Iran's foreign policy will more or less move ahead in similar ways to the policies exercised by president Raisi.""Iran will continue to develop ties with the neighbors and enhance strategic cooperation with Russia and China. And Iran will continue to develop its ties with Africa and Latin America," he added.JERUSALEM/BEIRUT -- Israel's army announced on Tuesday that it killed Hezbollah's top military commander, Fouad Shokor, in an airstrike in Beirut, saying the assassination was a retaliation for a cross-border rocket that killed 12 youngsters on Saturday.Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party, did not immediately confirm his condition. Earlier Lebanese media reports said the attack targeting Shokor was missed."Tonight, IDF (Israel Defense Forces) conducted a targeted strike in Beirut, eliminating Fouad Shokor, also known as 'Sayyid Muhsan,' the most senior military commander and head of the Strategic Unit of Hezbollah," IDF's Spokesperson Daniel Hagari told a press briefing in Tel Aviv.Hagari said that Shokor served also as Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah's "right-hand man" and was Nasrallah's adviser for planning and directing wartime operations.In a press release, IDF blamed Shokor for being responsible for the deadly rocket on Saturday that hit a football pitch in Majdal Shams, a Druze town in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.The commander "was responsible for the majority of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets, and UAVs. He was responsible for force build-up, planning, and execution of terror attacks against the State of Israel," IDF said.A strong blast was heard in the Lebanese capital on Tuesday night, and video footage on social media showed mass destruction of a residential building, with rubble scattered in the street.Lebanon's Al Manar TV cited the Lebanese health ministry as reporting 74 people injured along with three killed in the attack around Hezbollah's Shura Council.Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack, saying Lebanon preserves its right to take all necessary measures that contribute to deterring the aggression.Lebanese Foreign Affairs Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said Lebanon will submit a complaint to the UN Security Council over the attack.TEHRAN -- Masoud Pezeshkian was sworn in as Iran's ninth president on Tuesday in a ceremony held at Tehran's parliament, the official IRNA news agency reported.The ceremony was attended by high-ranking officials, military commanders, and representatives from 88 countries and 10 international organizations.Following his oath-taking before parliament, Pezeshkian outlined his administration's goals, focusing on Iran's economic development, national interests, and improving citizens' lives.He highlighted key foreign policy objectives aimed at safeguarding national security and enhancing economic prosperity within the framework of "dignity, wisdom, and expediency."Pezeshkian also condemned Israeli actions in Gaza, criticizing bombings that affected civilians, including women and children, and those who supported such actions.Pezeshkian, 69, emerged as the winner on July 6 in the country's presidential elections and was officially endorsed by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei as Iran's ninth president on Sunday.He now has 15 days to submit his proposed cabinet to parliament for approval.TEHRAN - Iran and The Gambia resumed their diplomatic ties on Monday almost 14 years after the latter cut them.According to a joint statement released by the Iranian Foreign Ministry, the decision was made in a meeting between Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani and Gambian Foreign Minister Mamadou Tangara in the Iranian capital Tehran, in line with the interests of both countries.The Gambian Foreign Minister has traveled to Tehran to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, which is scheduled for Tuesday.According to the statement, the two governments agreed to expand bilateral cooperation covering the political, economic, investment, trade and cultural spheres.The statement added that the two countries' embassies in Senegal's capital Dakar agreed to serve as diplomatic contact points to help resume official diplomacy.The Gambia cut diplomatic and economic relations with Iran in November 2010 and ordered all Iranian representatives to leave within 48 hours.The Gambia cited no reason for cutting ties with Iran. Tehran, however, attributed the action to pressure from the United States.TEHRAN - Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York has rejected claims by US intelligence officials that Tehran sought to influence the US presidential election, the official news agency IRNA reported on Tuesday.The remarks were made in a statement released on Monday after US intelligence officials earlier in the day claimed that Iran was working to "influence the US presidential election and undermine Donald Trump's bid to regain the White House", the report said.Iran's permanent mission stressed that Tehran had no objective or activity to influence the US election, adding a major part of such accusations were within the framework of the "psychological operations designed to artificially pep up election campaigns" in the United States.The US presidential election is scheduled for Nov 5, 2024.The international community has urged Israel not to escalate tensions in the Middle East after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was authorized to decide how the country should respond to a rocket strike that killed 12 youngsters in the annexed Golan Heights.Israeli officials and Lebanon-based Hezbollah group have accused each other of launching the fatal attack on Saturday at a soccer field in the predominantly Druze community in Majdal Shams.The tragedy has prompted Lebanon's Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib to demand an international investigation into the incident.On Sunday, Israel's security cabinet authorized Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to decide on the manner and timing of a response to the strike.Visiting the site of the deadly attack on Monday, Netanyahu vowed Israel would deliver a "severe response" to the rocket fire."These children are our children... The State of Israel will not, and cannot, let this pass. Our response will come and it will be severe," he said at the site of the attack, according to a statement issued by his office.The incident has added to concerns that months of cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah could spiral into a broader, more destructive war.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for restraint and warned against escalating violence in the region.European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned "this bloodbath" and "unacceptable incident", as he called for utmost restraint.French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned in the strongest terms the rocket attacks in his phone call with Netanyahu, saying that France was fully committed to avoid a new escalation in the region, The Times of Israel reported.British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said both he and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati agree that widening of conflict in the region "is in nobody's interest".The Syrian Foreign Ministry has accused Israel of the "brutal massacre" in Majdal Shams, stressing that holding Hezbollah responsible for the crime was part of Israel's "blatant attempts to fabricate pretexts" to continue aggression on the region as a whole, Syria's SANA News Agency reported.Caught up in violenceHaydar Oruc, a former researcher at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies in Turkiye, told China Daily the Druze people in Golan Heights, who are "not Israeli citizens", find themselves caught up in the violence in the region."It is considered to be part of Israel's attempt to draw the US into the field," Oruc said.The Golan Heights is Syrian territory occupied by Israel in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. Israel captured it in the Six-Day War in 1967, and annexed the territory in 1981. The Druze community in Israel is recognized as a separate religious entity whose culture is mostly Arab, according to the Jewish Virtual Library.In an interview on Sunday with local broadcaster Al-Jadeed, Bou Habib said the United States, France and others were trying to contain the escalation."Israel will escalate in a limited way and Hezbollah will respond in a limited way... These are the assurances we've received," he said.After Israel threatened reprisals, Air France and the German airline group Lufthansa said on Monday they were suspending flights to Beirut. Royal Jordanian also announced the suspension of flights, with at least two of its regular trips to Beirut canceled.The strike has raised fears of a wider conflict in the region, where tensions have intensified because of Israel's military assault in Gaza, which began more than nine months ago.Furkan Halit Yolcu, a researcher at Sakarya University Middle East Institute in Turkiye, said the prolonged Palestinian struggle to "merely survive on its inherited soil continues", and warned that if any major new conflict between Hezbollah and Israel starts, both parties will suffer huge losses involving "several dimensions".Agencies contributed to this story.JERUSALEM -- Israeli officials have called for retaliation against Hezbollah following a rocket attack on a football pitch in Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed at least 12 children and youths on Saturday. The Lebanese Shiite militant group has denied involvement.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Hezbollah "will pay a heavy price for this attack, one that it has not paid so far," according to a statement from his office. The attack "will not go unanswered," it added.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Spokesperson Daniel Hagari described the attack as the most severe on civilians since the October 7 assault by Hamas."Hezbollah is behind this disaster and is responsible for its consequences. We embrace the families of the dead and wounded," Hagari stated on social media platform X.However, Hezbollah denied any involvement, stating it had "absolutely nothing to do with the incident."Israeli military and security officials have presented Defense Minister Yoav Gallant with various options for action against Hezbollah. The Defense Ministry confirmed that Gallant has determined the courses of action but did not provide further details.A security cabinet meeting is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon in Tel Aviv, shortly after Netanyahu is set to arrive from Washington.Israeli President Issac Herzog called the rocket attack "heartbreaking," adding "Israel will firmly defend its citizens and its sovereignty."The Lebanese government also condemned "all acts of violence and aggression against civilians," calling the attack a violation of international law and humanity. The statement also urged an "immediate cessation of hostilities" following recent cross-border exchanges.The rocket struck a football pitch in Majdal Shams, causing around 30 injuries in addition to the fatalities. Magen David Adom, Israel's emergency service, reported that six of the injured were in serious condition.Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border have escalated since Oct. 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the previous day. Israel retaliated with heavy artillery fire into southeastern Lebanon.JERUSALEM -- Ten people, including children, were killed on Saturday in a rocket attack struck a football pitch in the Druze town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, according to Israeli media outlets.Helicopters, ambulances, and intensive care vehicles were dispatched to the scene, evacuating the injured to Ziv Medical Center, where at least 30 casualties were the result of the attack, reported Israeli state-owned broadcaster Kan."We arrived at the field and saw destruction and objects burning. Casualties were lying on the ground, and the sights were difficult to see," said Idan Avshalom, a senior medic at the Magen David Adom, the country's emergency medical service.Israeli media said that the rocket was fired from Lebanon by the Hezbollah militant group, while Hezbollah denied on Saturday evening that the Shiite group had "absolutely nothing to do with the incident."Following Hezbollah's denial, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that "following assessments carried out in the IDF and the intelligence available to us, the rocket fire at Majdal Shams was carried out by Hezbollah."Israel's Minister of Defense Yoav Galant, army chief Herzi Halevi, and other senior defense officials conducted an operational situation assessment following the attack, according to Kan.Israeli Prime Minister's Office said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, currently visiting the United States, has been informed of the incident's details and is holding security consultations with senior security officials.Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border have escalated since Oct. 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the previous day. Israel retaliated with heavy artillery fire into southeastern Lebanon.WASHINGTON -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid out a vague vision for post-conflict Gaza during his speech to the US Congress on Wednesday."The day after we defeat Hamas, a new Gaza could emerge," Netanyahu said. "My vision for that day is of a demilitarized and deradicalized Gaza.""Israel does not seek to resettle Gaza. But for the foreseeable future, we must retain overriding security control there to prevent the resurgence of terror, to ensure Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel," he told a joint meeting of the Congress."A new generation of Palestinians must no longer be taught to hate Jews but rather to live in peace with us," he added.Roughly 70 Democrats from the House and Senate boycotted Netanyahu's speech. The most notable was the absence of US Vice President Kamala Harris, who serves as president of the Senate.Outside the US Capitol and at Washington's Union Station, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in protest against Netanyahu's visit to the United States, demanding Washington stop military aid to Israel.As the war in Gaza enters its 10th month, at least 39,090 Palestinians have been killed and 90,147 others injured. Israel and Hamas have failed to reach a complete ceasefire agreement and a hostage release deal after multiple rounds of negotiations.People in the Gaza Strip have become exhausted by ongoing displacement and unlivable conditions, and are trapped in increasingly small and overcrowded areas, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said on Wednesday.The UN agency estimates that clearing the Gaza Strip of the 40-million-tonne rubble caused by Israel's war on the Palestinian enclave will take 15 years."Debris poses a deadly threat for people in the Gaza Strip as it can contain unexploded ordnance and harmful substances," it said.Maged Refaat Aboulmagd, an ambassador member of Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, said the fact that China has recently brought Palestinian factions to Beijing and managed to convince them to work together, is the kind of soft power that China needs to export to the world and exercise more and more. "We would love to have China more active also in these fields and beyond," he said.GAZA - The signing of a declaration on ending division and strengthening unity by 14 Palestinian factions in Beijing is "an additional positive step" toward achieving Palestinian national unity, Hamas said on Tuesday.The declaration's importance comes from the host country, said Hossam Badran, a member of Hamas's political bureau, in a statement."We are talking about the People's Republic of China with its international weight and its firm position in support of the Palestinian cause," Badran said.He expressed his "high appreciation for the great efforts made by China to reach this declaration", noting that this announcement came at an important time as Palestinians are facing an ongoing conflict, especially in the Gaza Strip.The solution represents "the ideal and most appropriate national solution" for the Palestinian situation after the conflict, he said.At China's invitation, senior representatives of 14 Palestinian factions held reconciliation talks in Beijing from July 21 to 23.International aid agencies and Arab nations have slammed the Israeli Parliament for giving preliminary approval for a bill labeling the United Nations agency serving Palestinian refugees as a "terrorist organization" — a move that will exacerbate the already dire conditions of humanitarian and other essential workers in Gaza.According to the Knesset website, the Knesset Plenum voted to approve on first reading the bill for "Cutting Off the State of Israel's Relations with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and Declaring it a Terrorist Organization, 2024".The bill proposed that the State of Israel "sever its relations with UNRWA, both directly and indirectly", and also strip off its personnel's immunity and privileges.Another bill proposes to prohibit the UNRWA from operating any mission, providing any service or conducting any activity within Israel's sovereign territory, accusing the agency of working in collaboration with Palestinian militant group Hamas for the "cruel massacre" that took place in Israel on Oct 7.The bills will be returned to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee for deliberation as two more readings are required for them to become effective.Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories, said on her X account that Israel's "disrespect and abuses against the UN" should have been addressed long ago. She said it had "gone too far" and called for unseating Israel at the UN.Jordanian Foreign Ministry spokesman Sufyan Qudah slammed the Israeli decision as an "attempt to kill the agency, assassinate it politically" and target its symbolism, which affirms the right of Palestinian refugees to return and get compensation under international law.'Premeditated hostility'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of Palestine said the Israeli Knesset's classification of the UNRWA as a "terrorist organization" is a "premeditated hostility that aims to dissolve the Palestine refugee issue and a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2730 (2024)". The ministry also described the latest development as part of a "systemic incitement campaign" carried out by Israel.A case in point, highlighted by UNRWA personnel, was the targeting of a UN aid convoy by the Israeli Defense Forces.Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of UNRWA, said on his X account that a UN vehicle received "at least five bullets while waiting just ahead of the Israeli Forces' checkpoint south of Wadi Gaza" on Sunday.Like all other similar UN movements, he said this one "was coordinated and approved by the Israeli authorities", adding that those responsible "must be held accountable".In February, Israeli forces said they had discovered a tunnel network hundreds of meters long and running partly under the UNRWA's Gaza headquarters. The Israelis said the network was new evidence of Hamas' exploitation of the aid agency for Palestinians. Israel had also accused some UN staff members of involvement in the Oct 7 attack.The allegations prompted several countries to halt funding to the UNRWA earlier this year. But a UN-backed independent review found that Israel had not provided credible evidence for its claims, and most donors, like Japan, Germany, Italy, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, have since reinstated funding.Arie Afriansyah, associate professor at the Faculty of Law at Universitas Indonesia, told China Daily that Israel's policy to categorize the UNRWA as a terrorist organization is "highly unusual in the context of international law".He said Israel's policy could endanger UNRWA's humanitarian workers. By labeling the UNRWA a terrorist organization, Israel "could effectively legitimize actions against its workers, making them targets for arrest, harassment, or worse".A new round of reconciliation talks among Palestinian groups was held in Beijing from Sunday to Tuesday, and a closing ceremony of the talks was held on Tuesday morning, according to the China Central Television.JERUSALEM - The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday that an Israeli delegation will visit Qatar later this week to resume negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange deal.Netanyahu held a lengthy discussion on Sunday with members of the negotiation team and senior security officials regarding the Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip, according to his office.The delegation, headed by Mossad chief David Barnea, will arrive in Doha on Thursday and engage in indirect negotiations brokered by Qatar and Egypt and supported by the United States.The new round of negotiations had been delayed for about a week after Hamas halted the talks in protest over an Israeli attack on Khan Younis on July 13, which killed at least 90 Palestinians.Previous rounds of talks in Qatar have so far failed to produce an agreement to end the more than nine months of conflict in Gaza, with both sides blaming each other for the deadlock."Mom, if I excel in my exams next year, could we visit the United Arab Emirates?" asked 11-year-old He Yuda at the May Fourth Square in downtown Qingdao on Saturday.The boy was among Chinese tourists taking pictures with UAE performers showcasing the traditional Al-Razfa dance, a popular art featuring about 20 performers clad in white robes, brandishing delicate bamboo canes and replica rifles, moving in sync to the rhythmic beat of drums."Sure we can," said the mother as her son enters sixth grade in September. They are interested in the UAE's exotic culture and intrigued by such content on Douyin, she said.Omar Alshehhi, an Emirati performer, said: "Everyone I met in Qingdao was nice; it will be an unforgettable experience. I like the cool weather in this modern city with many skyscrapers."Their performance marked one of the festivities commemorating the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the UAE, with Qingdao as the inaugural venue. The three-day event concluded on Sunday.The UAE has emerged as China's largest trading partner in the Arab region. Since 1984, the two countries have made significant advancements across various sectors, with non-oil trade soaring nearly 800-fold, according to the UAE embassy."Qingdao, a captivating coastal city, holds a special allure for Emiratis," said Hussain bin Ibrahim Al Hammadi, the UAE's ambassador to China. He highlighted the extensive exchanges between the UAE and Qingdao in trade, tourism and culture.The state visit by UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to China in late May has paved the way for further strengthening UAE-China ties, he said, as the joint statement vows a bilateral trade volume of $200 billion by 2030.He credited the countries' successes to visionary leadership, efficient governance and the unwavering commitment of both people toward a prosperous future."Our collaboration has reached unprecedented heights, with these shared values serving as the pillars of our achievements and future partnership," he said. He also said similar celebrations will be held this year in various Chinese cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing.Noting that both countries are participants in the Belt and Road Initiative, Zhang Hui, deputy secretary of the Communist Party of China Qingdao Municipal Committee, said Qingdao will leverage its status as a cultural and tourism hub to bolster exchanges with the UAE.With the strengthening ties, there has also been a growing enthusiasm among Emiratis for Chinese culture.Zhuo Jiameng, chief representative of Dubai Chamber's Shanghai office, noted a growing trend of her UAE colleagues studying Chinese and using it on social media platforms such as WeChat."We aim for a sustainable exchange and such mutual cultural understanding is vital for our business endeavors," she said.The International Court of Justice's historic decision ruling Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories as "illegal" has been widely welcomed by Middle East, Asian and Western leaders, strengthening the case to end the conflict and work toward a two-state solution.However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – currently facing domestic pressure at home to reach a cease-fire deal before departing for the United States this week – has slammed it as "absurd", adding that no opinion from The Hague "can deny the historical truth or legal right of Israelis" to live in their "ancestral home".The court's 83-page report titled "Legal Consequences Arising From The Policies And Practices Of Israel In The Occupied Palestinian Territory, Including East Jerusalem" issued on July 19 concluded that Israel's broad policies in its "capacity as an occupying power" constituted systemic discrimination against the Palestinians.The decision also came just a day after the Knesset, or Israel's parliament, rejected a resolution establishing Palestinian Statehood, which itself was criticized widely.The ICJ also considered that Israel's policies and practices obstructed the right of the Palestinian to determine its political status and to pursue its economic, social and cultural development. It also ruled that Israel's occupation of the West Bank is in violation of international law.In a statement, Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, said that the ICJ's legal opinion "confirms and reinforces the Palestinian people's attainment of their legitimate and legal rights in accordance with international and United Nations resolutions to regain the Palestinian territories seized by the Israeli occupation forces."He pointed out that the settlement decisions and attempts to change the geography carried out by the Israeli army are illegitimate measures that do not enjoy any regional or international recognition, stressing that the seized Palestinian territories will "remain Palestinian and an inherent right of the Palestinian people".Albudaiwi also reiterated the GCC's support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state within the borders of June 4, 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The GCC comprises the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait.Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said in a statement that the ICJ's advisory opinion constituted "a key legal pillar in supporting the Palestinian narrative and boosting its legitimacy and credibility".He also said it helped counter Israel's attempts "to blur the lines around the nature and origin of the conflict to tighten its grip on the Occupied Palestinian Territory".In its statement, the European Union said the ICJ's conclusions "are largely consistent with EU positions", which were themselves "fully aligned on UN resolutions regarding the status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory"."In a world of constant and increasing violations of international law, it is our moral duty to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to all ICJ decisions in a consistent manner, irrespective of the subject in question," the statement said."The ICJ Advisory Opinion will need to be analyzed more thoroughly, including in view of its implications for EU policy," it added.Countries who backed the ICJ's decision included Belgium, Iceland, Norway, Ireland, Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt.Omar Awadallah, Palestine's assistant foreign minister for the UN and Specialized Agencies and part of the delegation to the court sessions, said that the "historic" advisory opinion was "not only for the question of Palestine, but for justice and for all the legal system" as he believed that this determination "will help in achieving justice and stability in the region if it's implemented".He stressed this was why it was important to work with the international community, with the UN, and other states toward imposing a mechanism toward ending this Israeli occupation."Our move will be toward countries bilaterally. That means that we will be working with states toward taking irreversible steps, toward taking actions by putting consequences on this illegal occupation by not assessed or render aid or recognizing the illegality that Israel is doing and consolidating in the occupied Palestinian territories," Awadallah told China Daily.He said there were many things to be done whether at the UN General Assembly or the UN Security Council level or any other organ within the UN Human Rights Council, and other bodies in the UN toward implementing this important and significant and landmark advisory opinion."We believe that the court said that they did what they had to do on moral and legal basis and it's time for the international community to act on these moral and legal bases to end this illegality," said Awadallah.Hassan Ben Imran, board member at Law for Palestine, a nonprofit human rights organization, praised the court's advisory opinion as "good" as it offered several legal grounds for Palestinians "to further their legal struggle for freedom and liberation"."However, it should be noted that there is no expectation that Israel would comply with it. Israel has given absolutely no reason to believe in a fraction of that," Imran told China Daily."Therefore, the only way forward is imposing sanctions, economic, political and military ones, on Israel. Israel's membership at the UN and other international fora, like the FIFA for instance, should be suspended," he added.RAMALLAH - Palestine has rejected an Israeli-US proposal to temporarily reopen the Rafah border crossing, calling instead for an Israeli withdrawal and the establishment of Palestinian sovereignty, an official source told Xinhua on Wednesday.A meeting was held last week involving representatives from Palestine, the United States, and Israel to explore the possibility of operating the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, according to the source who requested anonymity.The Israeli side proposed that six Palestinian employees participate in managing the crossing without uniforms or police, and without raising the Palestinian flag, said the source in a statement sent to Xinhua.The source explained that the proposal was rejected because it aimed to open the crossing temporarily without Palestinian sovereignty, which contradicts the Palestinian position and international agreements.According to the source, the Palestinian stance is in line with the 2005 agreement on the Rafah crossing, which requires Palestinian sovereignty, European participation, and a full Israeli withdrawal from the crossing.The meeting concluded after the Israeli-US proposal was rejected by the Palestinians, and there has been no further dialogue following the meeting, said the source.The meeting is considered the first between Israel and representatives of the Palestinian Authority to discuss the future of Gaza after the ongoing conflict.On May 7, the Israeli army announced the imposition of "operational" control over the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, which led to the cessation of aid delivery from Egypt into Gaza through the crossing.GAZA - The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said Wednesday that it is struggling to prevent the spread of diseases among displaced people in the Gaza Strip."High temperatures, severe overcrowding, water scarcity, and a severe shortage of personal hygiene and cleaning supplies such as soap, shampoo, and disinfectants lead to an increase in skin infections and bacterial contamination among the displaced," the UNRWA said on social media platform X.The UN agency said it is making great efforts to control the spread of this infection and prevent the exacerbation of similar cases through its health centers, despite the limited resources and lack of treatments in its warehouses.The agency stressed the necessity to reach a ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible.During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 81 people and wounded 198 others, bringing the total death toll to 38,794 and injuries to 89,364 since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out in early October 2023, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Wednesday.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage.Arab leaders are rallying for the need to activate international accountability mechanisms in the face of Israel's continued aggressions, including the bombing of UN agency-aided schools and "safe zones", as they renewed calls for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.In the last 24 hours, Israel's military had bombed a UN-run school as well as a "safe zone" it designated in the Gaza Strip, leaving at least 42 Palestinians dead while wounding dozens.The attacks on Tuesday hit the UN's Al-Razi School in the central Nuseirat refugee camp and a main street lined with market stalls in the southern Al-Mawasi area, where thousands of displaced Palestinians had sought shelter.At least 25 people were killed in Al-Razi while 17 were killed in Al-Mawasi, according to Gaza's government media office while more than 70 people were injured in the attacks.Earlier, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, noted that 70 percent of its schools in Gaza have been hit and bombed since the start of the conflict on Oct 7.Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of UNRWA, said on his X account that at least eight schools were hit in the last 10 days, including six UNRWA schools."All rules of war have been broken in Gaza. Losing our common humanity must not become the new norm," said Lazzarini.The Israel Defense Forces said on X that based on precise intelligence, the IDF "struck terrorists who operated in a UNRWA school in the area of Nuseirat".International organization Save the Children said on its X account that the recent attacks on schools and hospitals in Gaza were "horrific" as the "healthcare and education systems are being decimated before our eyes". It said children "cannot continue to be at the forefront of this conflict" and reiterated that hospitals and schools should never be targets.The Saudi Cabinet, led by Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, condemned the "continuation of genocidal massacres against the Palestinian people", reiterating the demand for an immediate and permanent cease-fire and protection of unarmed civilians, the Saudi Press Agency reported.Necessity stressedFurther, it stressed the necessity of activating international accountability mechanisms.Speaking to reporters at a joint news conference during his visit to Luxembourg on Tuesday, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi urged the United States, the European Union, and the global community to "come together and stand by international law, international humanitarian law, and by the rights of all peoples to live in peace and security, including the Palestinians".Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi briefed his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on Tuesday on Egypt's mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas, while he stressed the need for uniting international efforts to ensure the success of mediation and to deliver adequate humanitarian aid to the battered enclave.Egyptian and Qatari mediators, as well as US negotiators, reconvened over the past week in hopes of reaching a cease-fire agreement, which would include the prisoner swap deal between Israel and Hamas, but blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the delay over his "new conditions".Belal Alakhras, a political analyst and Palestinian researcher at the University of Malaya in Malaysia, said the "issue" was that the world "has treated Israel as more than just an occupying force"."We're on the edge of global chaos. This situation shouldn't be left to the calculus of the United States on whether it will allow Israel to continue this war or not. Other major global powers need to step up and ramp up pressure before it's too late," Alakhras told China Daily.Contact the writers at jan@chinadailyapac.com. TEHRAN - Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani said Tuesday that the new administration's foreign policy would emphasize promoting multilateralism in line with the United Nations Charter and international law.Speaking at a UN Security Council meeting in New York, Bagheri Kani outlined the diplomatic stance of Iran's President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian, according to a statement from Iran's foreign ministry.The Iranian top diplomat stressed that Pezeshkian's administration aims to "open new horizons and expand friendly relations with other governments based on dialogue, cooperation, equality, and mutual respect".Pezeshkian was declared Iran's next president on July 6 after winning a runoff against Saeed Jalili, a former chief nuclear negotiator.Bagheri Kani added that Iran supports initiatives promoting multilateralism, respect for international law, and the goals of the UN Charter.Describing multilateralism as key to addressing global threats and challenges, Bagheri Kani criticized unilateral sanctions, calling them "extreme and inhumane" manifestations of unilateralism.He insisted that the United States and its Western allies should be held accountable for the suffering caused by these sanctions, including in Iran.Bagheri Kani headed a delegation that left Tehran for New York on Monday to attend UN Security Council meetings focused on the escalating situation in the Middle East.Palestinian militant group Hamas has dismissed reports that it has withdrawn from Gaza ceasefire negotiations amid continued Israeli attacks, which killed about 90 civilians in strikes over the weekend, with the excuse it is targeting Hamas military commanders.Meanwhile, families of Israeli hostages have slammed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for putting the progress of truce talks at risk, following the massive strike that was directed at the Al-Mawasi area near Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Saturday.Israel and Hamas have been trying to reach a cease-fire deal for months through mediators Egypt, Qatar and the United States. The parties reconvened in Doha and Cairo last week.Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said in a statement on Sunday that reports of a decision to stop negotiations in response to the Al-Mawasi massacre were "baseless", accusing the Netanyahu government of "trying to obstruct reaching an agreement to stop the aggression on Gaza".The Times of Israel reported that thousands of people rallied outside Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem on Saturday, calling for a hostage deal. Einav Zangauker, mother of 24-year-old hostage Matan Zangauker, accused Netanyahu of "time after time, trying to separate me from Matan".Netanyahu's office released a statement on Saturday reiterating the prime minister's conditions before halting the fighting with Hamas."Victory will be achieved when we eliminate the military and governing capabilities of Hamas, bring all of our hostages back home, ensure that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel, and return our residents in the south and the north securely to their homes," Netanyahu said.He appealed to the families of the hostages for their patience and understanding, while acknowledging their "suffering".The Israel Defense Forces confirmed in a post on X that Rafa'a Salameh, whom they said was one of the masterminds of the Oct 7 attack against Israel, has been "eliminated". It was also reported that 90 Palestinians were killed and 300 others were wounded in the process.Among the casualties initially reported were Mohammed Deif, commander of Hamas' military wing, and Salameh, commander of Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade. Both were said to have been the target of the strikes. But a Hamas official insisted that Deif was "fine".Shocked by lossFollowing the deadly weekend strikes, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Saturday that Guterres was "shocked and saddened by the loss of lives".Dujarric noted reports that the attack had taken place in a densely populated area "designated as a humanitarian zone sheltering displaced people", underscoring there was nowhere safe in Gaza.Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, denounced in a statement "the brutal bombardment by the Israeli occupation forces on the Al-Mawasi area", stressing that this shelling is "evidence of the series of systematic and ongoing Israeli crimes against the brotherly Palestinian people".The Organization of Islamic Cooperation said the "massacre "on Saturday was "a continuation of the crime of genocide the Israeli occupation has been carrying out against Palestinian civilians in flagrant defiance of the UN resolutions and the injunctions of the International Court of Justice". It renewed calls on the UN Security Council and the international community to assume their responsibility toward ending the nine-month conflict."The war has reached a point where there is a universal desire for peace. ... Mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United States have thus far failed to secure an agreement for the release of hostages," Arhama Siddiqa, a research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan, told China Daily.She said Netanyahu's recent call for Israel to retain control along the Gaza-Egypt border, in the belief that Hamas is weakening, "is seen as an irresponsible move likely to squander a potentially unrepeatable opportunity for peace"."Such tactics are viewed as diversionary efforts to stall the peace process and force Hamas into submission, allowing Netanyahu to save face and possibly retain some semblance of political clout," Siddiqa said.TEHRAN - Iran "looks forward to more extensive" cooperation with China, said President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian in an article published on Saturday.Pezeshkian said China, along with Russia, had consistently stood by Iran during challenging times, adding, "We deeply value this friendship."The article titled "My Message to the New World" is published in Iran's English language daily Tehran Times.Pointing to a long-term comprehensive cooperation agreement signed between Iran and China in March 2021, Pezeshkian noted, "Our 25-year roadmap with China represents a significant milestone towards establishing a mutually beneficial comprehensive strategic partnership, and we look forward to collaborating more extensively with Beijing as we advance towards a new global order."He hailed China for its "constructive vision and forward-thinking approach to international affairs", stressing that in 2023, China played a "pivotal role" in facilitating the normalization of relations between Tehran and Riyadh after a seven-year diplomatic freeze.In the article, Pezeshkian vowed that his administration would pursue an "opportunity-driven policy" by creating balance in relations with all states, consistent with the country's national interests, economic development, and requirements of regional and global peace and security."We will prioritize strengthening relations with our neighbors," he said, adding that his administration's other foreign policy priorities would include fostering mutually beneficial relations with emerging international players in the Global South, especially African nations, as well as Latin American states.Pezeshkian was announced as Iran's next president on July 6 following his victory in a runoff against Saeed Jalili, a former chief nuclear negotiator.SANAA - Yemen's armed Houthi group on Sunday claimed responsibility for missile and drone attacks against an Israeli ship in the Gulf of Aden and the Israeli city of Eilat."The armed forces targeted the Israeli ship, MSC UNIFIC, in the Gulf of Aden," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a televised statement aired by the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV.The group also attacked "military targets" of the Israeli city of Eilat with drones, he added.The spokesman reiterated that the group will continue attacking Israeli targets until the war on Gaza stops.Meanwhile, the US Central Command said its forces had destroyed two drones and one unmanned boat in the Red Sea in the past 24 hours, according to a statement on social media platform X.Earlier in the day, the Houthi television reported that the US-British naval coalition conducted two airstrikes against the Hodeidah airport in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah.Last November, the Houthis began to launch anti-ship ballistic missiles and drones targeting what they said were Israeli-linked ships transiting the Red Sea to show solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi said in a televised speech last week that his group had targeted "a total of 166 ships linked to Israel, US, and Britain".In response, the US-British naval coalition stationed in the waters has since January conducted air raids and missile strikes against Houthi targets to deter the group, but this only led to an expansion of Houthi attacks to include US and British commercial and military ships.DAMASCUS - The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates cautioned on Sunday that Israeli attacks on Syrian soil could lead to uncontrollable consequences and serious repercussions.In a statement released hours after Israeli missile attacks on a residential neighborhood in the Syrian capital of Damascus and military sites, the ministry reaffirmed Syria's legitimate right to defend its sovereignty and liberate its occupied land through all legitimate means guaranteed by international law.The ministry warned against the escalation of Israeli attacks on Syrian soil, adding that persistent international silence regarding such attacks would undermine the ability of the international system to confront violations of its charter and international laws.Israeli strikes in Damascus earlier in the day resulted in casualties among the Syrian military and fires in the targeted areas, as reported by the Syrian Ministry of Defense and relevant sources.The Defense Ministry said a military personnel was killed, and three others were injured during the attacks.The ministry added that the attacks were launched from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan and aimed at several military sites in the southern region and a residential building in the Kafr Sousa area of Damascus.The Syrian air defense systems responded to the "enemy's missiles" and shot down a considerable number of them, the ministry said.GAZA - At least 71 Palestinians were killed and 289 others injured on Saturday by an Israeli airstrike that attacked tents of displaced people in the Mawasi area of the Khan Younis city in the south of Gaza, the Gaza health authorities said.With three missiles, Israeli jets bombed the tents housing displaced people in Khan Younis, and then a civil defense vehicle was targeted, local and security sources told Xinhua.Dozens of bodies of the killed and wounded people were lying on the ground, locals told Xinhua.The Israeli raid targeted a large gathering of displaced people in Mawasi, the Gaza Civil Defense Service reported in a brief statement.Meanwhile, Israeli state-owned Kan TV news said that the target of the Israeli attack on the Mawasi area was Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, noting that the army was awaiting the results of the raid.Hamas rejected the claim, saying it comes in the context of covering up Israel's crimes. BEIRUT -- A Hezbollah member was killed and two civilians injured on Friday in Israeli airstrikes and artillery shelling targeting several border areas in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanese military sources.The sources, who spoke anonymously, said Israel's drones and warplanes carried out eight airstrikes on six border towns and villages, while its artillery bombed 14 other towns and villages with more than 45 shells.One of the raids targeted a house in the village of Taybeh, killing a Hezbollah member named Ali Hassan Nahla, said the sources, adding that a worker of Bangladeshi nationality was wounded in the Israeli shelling of Al-Wazzani village.They continued that an Israeli drone fired two air-to-surface missiles at a motorcycle traveling on the road between Al-Wazzani and Rachaya Al-Fakhar in the eastern sector of the border area, seriously injuring its driver, who was then sent to hospital.Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border escalated on Oct. 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the day before. Israel then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.The violent confrontations between Hezbollah and the Israeli army have intensified recently, as the latter announced "its approval of operational plans for an attack on Lebanon."Meanwhile, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah warned that no place in Israel "will be safe" from his party's missiles in the event of an outbreak of war.A group of independent experts and special rapporteurs of the United Nations have said famine was now gripping the Gaza Strip as children die from malnutrition amid Israel's alleged starvation campaign as bombings of schools continued."We declare that Israel's intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence and has resulted in famine across all of Gaza. We call upon the international community to prioritize the delivery of humanitarian aid by land by any means necessary, end Israel's siege, and establish a cease-fire," said experts for the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in a statement on Tuesday.Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva slammed the famine statement, saying the UN experts were as much accustomed to spreading "misinformation" as they were to supporting "Hamas propaganda", the Times of Israel reported.Israel's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories, or COGAT, which implements the government's civilian policy within the territories of Judea and Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, posted on its X account on Monday that they were committed to collaborating closely with international partners to meet urgent humanitarian needs of civilians "despite our war with Hamas".The independent experts highlighted the deaths of Fayez Ataya, who was barely 6 months old when he died on May 30, and 13-year-old Abdulqader al-Serhi, who died at the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah on June 1. These were followed by the death of Ahmad Abu Reida, 9, on June 3 in the tent sheltering his displaced family in Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis.All three died from malnutrition and lack of access to adequate healthcare. With the deaths of these children from starvation despite medical treatment in central Gaza, there is "no doubt that famine has spread from northern Gaza into central and southern Gaza", the experts said.Further, they noted that the death of a child from malnutrition and dehydration indicated that the health and social structures "have critically weakened".Al Jazeera reported on Wednesday that at least 30 Palestinians were killed in Gaza after Israel struck a school housing civilians in Khan Younis. The report noted it was the fourth attack on schools in as many days and following Israel's most recent mass evacuation orders for parts of Khan Younis and Gaza City. The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating from within the schools, which Hamas denied.Acute malnutritionThe UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees on June 15 had earlier said that more than 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition.The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification's acute food insecurity analysis conducted in December 2023 had warned of a risk that famine may occur by the end of May 2024, affecting an estimated 1.11 million people.It noted in its latest report on June 25 that the amount of food deliveries and nutrition services provided to the northern governorates increased, temporarily alleviating conditions there. In this context, the report said, available evidence does not indicate that famine is currently occurring.But it said a high risk of famine persists across the entire Gaza Strip "as long as the conflict continues and humanitarian access is restricted". It said about 96 percent of the population in the Gaza Strip, or 2.15 million people, face high levels of acute food insecurity through September 2024."While the whole territory is classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), over 495,000 people (22 percent of the population) are still facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 5)," the report said.Maysa Saleh, the Norwegian Refugee Council's Education Officer in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, in her update on Monday said that food remains "the number one worry".She noted that only last week, there were no vegetables on the market besides some aubergines, tomatoes and onions. Tinned food was diminishing in both quality and quantity.European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on his X account that it "is imperative to immediately reach a cease-fire to bring respite to hundreds of stranded civilians, free all the hostages, deliver the needed humanitarian aid".Special rapporteurs, independent experts and working groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent of any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity. RAMALLAH -- Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa on Wednesday called for a unified Palestine under a single authority and government once a ceasefire is reached in Gaza.During a meeting with UN officials, consuls, and ambassadors in Ramallah, Mustafa emphasized the need for unity and cooperation."The day after the war ends, Palestine must be unified under one authority and one government, working with partners as one team with one plan. There can be no undefined transitional period that would create more complexity and chaos," Mustafa said, according to a statement from his office sent to Xinhua.Mustafa urged international partners, donors, and UN institutions to closely coordinate with the Palestinian government to ensure swift recovery and address urgent humanitarian needs resulting from the conflict in Gaza and its repercussions in the West Bank.He highlighted the Palestinian Authority's longstanding responsibility for providing essential services such as healthcare, education, water, and electricity to Gaza residents despite Israeli deductions from Palestinian funds.Delegations from Egypt, the United States, Qatar, and Israel met on Wednesday in Qatar's capital Doha to resume the Gaza truce talks.Also on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed his country's commitment to a potential ceasefire agreement during a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden's special envoy to the Middle East, Brett McGurk, in Jerusalem.Netanyahu assured McGurk of his "commitment to the deal as long as Israeli red lines are maintained," according to a statement from his office.Iran's new administration looks forward to enhancing relations with China and others as the country rides on fruits of cooperation from the first year of membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, or SCO, according to officials and diplomats.Nasser Kanaani, spokesman for Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in Monday's news conference that Iran would continue to pursue mutual relations with China, one of the most important countries in the world.Commenting on the future of the relations between Teheran and Beijing in view of Masoud Pezeshkian's election as Iran's new president, Kanaani expressed hope that Iran's relations with friendly countries, including China, would be further promoted.He said Iran's foreign policy was based on promoting constructive interaction with all those countries that were ready to, in a reciprocal and constructive approach while observing mutual respect, work toward the expansion of bilateral ties, Xinhua News Agency reported."China and Iran are both important developing countries and both adhere to true multilateralism," Chinese Ambassador to Iran Cong Peiwu said in an article in the Tehran Times on Monday."Since Iran successfully joined the SCO one year ago, it has actively participated in various cooperation under the SCO framework and achieved fruitful results," Cong said.Iran's entry into the SCO has injected new vitality into it, which is in line with the expectations of the international community and the common interests of emerging market countries and developing countries, he said.China stands ready to work with Iran and other SCO partners under the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, enhance solidarity and mutual trust, build consensus on cooperation, expand cooperation across the board, actively participate in global governance, and advance the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative to "contribute more SCO strength to the lasting peace and common prosperity" of the world, according to Cong.Speaking at the SCO Green Development Forum held in Qingdao on Monday, Ali Salajegheh, head of Iran's Department of Environment, said that SCO members using their capacities can make a difference for green development in the region, as well as become a perfect model for environmental cooperation at the global level, according to IRNA news agency."Developing countries should make sure of their social and economic development as the main priority, because the fight against poverty and the development of health and the provision of housing and energy is still a significant part of the developing world," Salajegheh said.Spokesman Kanaani further spoke about promoting cultural, trade and political relations with neighboring countries, and resuming ties with some regional states with which the country's relations had been severed.Pezeshkian, a reformist and former health minister, was declared president on Saturday following a runoff election against principlist Saeed Jalili.Xinhua contributed to this story.GAZA - At least 25 Palestinians were killed and some others wounded in an Israeli airstrike targeting a school in the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources said Tuesday.Security sources told Xinhua that Israeli aircraft targeted the gate of the Al-Awda School, which houses hundreds of displaced people in the town of Abasan al-Kabira, east of Khan Younis, using at least one missile.The videos shared by Palestinian activists on the social media platform Facebook showed dozens of bodies lying on the ground, covered in blood.Medical sources said the Israeli airstrike killed at least 25 people, including women and children, and wounded dozens in varying degrees.The sources told Xinhua that the number of victims is expected to rise due to the overcrowding in the area.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Wednesday that using precise munition, the Israeli Air Force struck a terrorist from Hamas' military wing who took part in the Hamas rampage in southern Israel last year, among other terrorist activities.The IDF is looking into the reports that civilians were harmed, adjacent to the Al-Awda School, which is located near the location of the strike, it added.Israel has been launching a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage.The Hamas-run health authorities said on Tuesday the total Palestinian death toll in Gaza has climbed to 38,243 since the outbreak of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.TEHRAN - Iran's President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday exchanged views on the promotion of bilateral relations, according to the official news agency IRNA.In a phone call, the two sides voiced their countries' readiness to sign a comprehensive cooperation agreement on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit in Russia's Kazan in late October.Pezeshkian said Iran attached great importance to its relations with friendly and neighboring countries and would undoubtedly strengthen such ties.He added his administration would be focused on following up on and implementing the bilateral agreements reached during the term of Iran's late President Ebrahim Raisi, who lost his life in a helicopter crash on May 19.Pezeshkian described it as important cooperation between the two countries within the frameworks of regional and international organizations, coalitions and treaties, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS and the Eurasian Economic Union.He said the documents pertaining to the comprehensive cooperation agreement between Tehran and Moscow had been finalized and Iran was prepared to sign them on the sidelines of the upcoming BRICS summit.For his part, the Russian president congratulated Pezeshkian on his election as Iran's ninth president, wishing him success in fulfilling his new responsibility.Putin said the bilateral relations were at the highest level, hoping that bilateral ties would continue during Iran's next administration by implementing the agreements reached between the two sides in Raisi's term.He pointed to expanding bilateral relations, especially in the energy and transportation sectors, inviting Pezeshkian to attend the upcoming BRICS summit.Putin assured that Russia was ready to sign the comprehensive cooperation agreement with Iran on the sidelines of the Kazan summit.Pezeshkian was announced as Iran's next president on Saturday following his victory in a runoff against Saeed Jalili, a former chief nuclear negotiator.GAZA - Hamas has made urgent contacts with mediators, warning that the Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip would return the ceasefire negotiating process to point zero, the movement said on Monday.Considering the ongoing threats by the Israeli army to large neighborhoods of Gaza City, and the killings and displacement it is carrying out, the head of Hamas's political bureau Ismail Haniyeh has made urgent contacts with mediators, Hamas said in a statement.Haniyeh warned of the repercussions of Israel's operations in Gaza City, Rafah and other areas across the Strip, noting that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli army would bear full responsibility for the collapse of the negotiation path, the statement added.On Sunday and Monday, the Israeli military instructed tens of thousands of people residing in 19 blocs in Gaza City to immediately evacuate, according to a report published by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Monday.As of Monday, Al Ahli Baptist Hospital and the Patients Friends Association Hospital were evacuated, in fear of intensified military activities that would render them inaccessible or non-functional, and critical patients were transferred to the Indonesian and Kamal Adwan Hospitals in North Gaza governorate, it added.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Monday that following intelligence indicating the presence of Hamas and Islamic Jihad infrastructure, operatives, weapons, and investigation and detention rooms in Gaza City, the army began an operation in the area overnight."With the start of the operation, the IDF called on and warned civilians about the operational activity in the area, and a defined route will be opened to facilitate the evacuation of uninvolved civilians from the area," it added.Hamas signaled last week that it had dropped a key demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before the group would sign an agreement, raising hopes for progress in the internationally brokered negotiations, according to media reports.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage.During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 40 people and wounded 75 others, bringing the total death toll to 38,193 and injuries to 87,903 since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Monday.UNITED NATIONS - UN humanitarians said on Monday 90 percent of Gazans were displaced, some multiple times, as more evacuations ordered and poor or no security hampers aid and fuel deliveries.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the Israeli military instructed on Sunday and Monday tens of thousands of people living in 19 blocs of apartments in Gaza City to evacuate immediately. On Sunday, some residents were ordered to evacuate to western Gaza City, while the order on Monday included areas that people had fled to a day earlier and instructed them to evacuate to shelters in Deir al Balah."The two directly affected areas encompass 13 health facilities that were recently functional, including two hospitals, two primary healthcare centers and nine medical points," OCHA said, adding that 13 out of 36 hospitals in the Gaza Strip are only partially functional.The office said that with nine out of every 10 people estimated to be displaced in Gaza, new waves of displacement are mainly affecting people who have already been displaced multiple times, only to find themselves forced to flee again under shelling. They were forced to reset their lives repeatedly without any of their belongings or any prospect of finding safety or reliable access to essential services."People, especially children, spend long hours queueing to collect water each day," OCHA said. "Access to emergency health care is also a challenge, particularly given limited communications coverage to contact emergency services, high transportation costs to reach hospitals (26 US dollars roundtrip) and the long walking distance of at least 3 kilometers to reach the nearest medical point."In northern Gaza, the aid partners especially highlighted the lack of safe shelters for up to 80,000 IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons) who were forced to hastily flee from Shuja'iyeh and other parts of eastern Gaza City following evacuation orders in late June. Many were found sleeping amid solid waste and rubble, with no mattresses or enough clothing, and some had sought shelter in partially destroyed UN facilities and residential buildings.The Israeli military designated these same areas as evacuation zones, forcing many of the same families, including young children and the elderly, to go through successive waves of displacement over the past two weeks, the office said.OCHA said that insecurity, damaged roads, the breakdown of law and order, and access limitations continue to hamper movement along the main humanitarian cargo route between Kerem Shalom crossing and Khan Younis and Deir al Balah."This has resulted in critical shortages of fuel and aid commodities to sustain humanitarian operations, in addition to increasing the risk of spoilage and infestation of stranded supplies (especially food) due to extremely high temperatures," the office said.The humanitarians said the Food Security Sector (FSS) reports that the shortages forced partners to provide reduced food rations in central and southern Gaza in June and undermined their ability to keep bakeries and community kitchens running.According to OCHA, only seven out of the 18 bakeries supported by humanitarian partners remain operational in Gaza, all in Deir al Balah, and six bakeries already working at partial capacity have now been forced to completely cease operations due to the lack of fuel.The office said that in the absence of cooking gas and a stable flow of food supplies, community kitchens are also struggling to operate, resulting in a reduced number of cooked meals prepared throughout Gaza. As of the end of June, about 600,000 cooked meals prepared in 190 kitchens were distributed daily to families across the strip, compared to more than 700,000 in the first half of June.OCHA said it meant that displaced households rely on burning wood and plastic from furniture and waste to cook, exacerbating health risks and environmental hazards.As for cooking, humanitarian partners said they continue to distribute wheat flour and canned food that enter northern Gaza through the Erez West crossing. No commercial trucks have been entering the area for months.A joint assessment by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the UN Satellite Centre estimated that about 57 percent of Gaza's cropland and one-third of its greenhouses were damaged.The FSS reported a near-total lack of protein sources, such as meat and poultry, on the local market, and only a few types of locally produced vegetables are available at unaffordable prices.The sector reported that continued military operations in Rafah and recent displacement from eastern Khan Younis, where significant agricultural production was concentrated before the war, have resulted in additional damage to greenhouses. It forced more people to leave their farms unattended, further destabilizing food systems.OCHA said that on Friday, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) reported that its teams at Nasser Medical Complex were "running on emergency medical stocks" and all departments were overwhelmed by patients, far exceeding available bed capacity.MSF said the Nasser Medical Complex is the main site on which field hospitals rely to sterilize their equipment, and if the facility is left without electricity, several field hospitals will also cease functioning.It said the hospital has been unable to bring any medical supplies into Gaza since the end of April, including most recently on Wednesday when the Israeli authorities denied trucks carrying MSF medical aid entry into the Gaza Strip due to ongoing hostilities.The cease-fire talks between Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel have seen its momentum dented after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a list of "nonnegotiable" conditions in relation to Israel's objectives in Gaza, despite international calls amid heavy casualties and humanitarian disasters.The news came after Hamas delivered its acceptance of three-phase arrangements to negotiator countries, the United States, Egypt and Qatar, while Israel continued its bombardment in Gaza, with Palestinian families fleeing their homes and hospitals and Israeli settlers bulldozing the northern entrance of Palestinian city Salfit in the occupied West Bank, Wafa News Agency reported.Late on July 7, Netanyahu presented a list of Israeli demands just as the Israeli negotiating team was preparing to depart for further talks in Cairo and Doha expected later this week.According to a statement published on the Israeli prime minister's website, it was Netanyahu's "steadfast position" against the attempt to halt Israel Defense Forces' action in Rafah that "led Hamas to enter negotiations".It noted that any deal would allow Israel to resume fighting "until all of objectives of the war have been achieved". There would also be "no smuggling of weapons to Hamas from Egypt to the Gaza border" and no return of "thousands of armed terrorists to the northern Gaza Strip".Also, Israel would "maximize the number of living hostages who will be released from Hamas captivity"."The plan that has been agreed to by Israel and which has been welcomed by (United States President Joe Biden) will allow Israel to (retrieve) hostages without infringing on the other objectives of the war," said the statement.Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, on his X account, questioned the timing of what he referred to as "provocative messages" from the Netanyahu government, pointing out that all parties were in "a critical moment in the negotiations" and that "the lives of the (Israeli) abductees depend on it".Losing faithSoon after Netanyahu's announcement, The Times of Israel reported that Sharon Alony Cunio, a freed hostage whose husband was still being held in Gaza, said she was "losing faith"."I was very optimistic, but as the days pass you suddenly notice that the messages that come out are more focused on the gaps (between the sides)," she was quoted as telling Army Radio. "Don't jeopardize the deal with statements."Cunio, along with her 3-year-old twin daughters, was freed from Gaza in November following an Israel-Hamas prisoner swap deal.The Times of Israel also reported that the statement from Netanyahu's office was met with anger by Israeli security officials and mediators who reportedly accused the prime minister of trying to sabotage the deal.It was widely reported over the weekend that Hamas had dropped a demand that Israel first commit to a permanent cease-fire before signing the agreement, and accepted a proposal from Washington to resume talks on releasing Israeli hostages, including soldiers.Abdul Wahed Jalal Nori, an analyst and lecturer at the Department of Fundamental and Inter-Disciplinary Studies at the International Islamic University Malaysia, told China Daily that the tough stance taken by Netanyahu might "risk derailing the talks "because Hamas will view the new conditions as "unacceptable"."The more Netanyahu insists on continuing the conflict, the deeper the enmity grows," said Abdul Wahed.He said Hamas' willingness to enter the negotiations is aimed at ending the hostilities, with an initial cease-fire followed by discussions on issues like blockade-lifting and reconstruction aid."If those things are not achieved, the conflict will continue. Therefore, a more balanced strategy, incorporating security concerns with genuine humanitarian considerations and diplomatic flexibility, might offer a better path toward lasting peace and stability," said Abdul Wahed.jan@chinadailyapac.comGAZA/JERUSALEM — Israel carried out deadly airstrikes in the Gaza Strip as the conflict entered its 10th month on Sunday, with Hamas reportedly having accepted a US proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages.A senior Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday that Hamas has accepted a US proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages, including soldiers and civilians.The militant group has dropped a demand that Israel first commit to a permanent cease-fire before signing the agreement, and would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.Hamas is waiting for a response from Israel on the cease-fire proposal, two officials from the militant group said on Sunday."We have left our response with the mediators and are waiting to hear the occupation's response," one of the two Hamas officials told Reuters, asking not to be named.The three-phase plan for the Palestinian enclave was put forward at the end of May by US President Joe Biden and is being mediated by Qatar and Egypt.Another Palestinian official, with knowledge of the cease-fire deliberations, said Israel was in talks with the Qataris."They have discussed with them Hamas' response and they promised to give them Israel's response within days," the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters on Sunday.Israel has said it will send a delegation in the coming days to continue truce talks with Qatari mediators that began recently in Doha.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said "gaps" remained with Hamas on how to secure a cease-fire and hostage release deal."It was agreed that next week Israeli negotiators will travel to Doha to continue the talks. There are still gaps between the parties," the spokesman said in a statement on Friday.US Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns will travel to Qatar soon for negotiations, a source familiar with the matter said.Fighting continuesMeanwhile, the fighting in Gaza continued unabated, with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society saying on Sunday that the bodies of six people, including two children, who were killed in Israeli strikes, had arrived at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah.Paramedics also said on Sunday that six people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a house in the northern area of Gaza City.The day before, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said 16 people had been killed in a strike on a school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees that was sheltering displaced people in Nuseirat, in central Gaza.The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted "terrorists" operating around the Al-Jawni school.The military earlier said it had conducted operations across much of the Gaza Strip, including Shujaiya in the north and Deir al-Balah and Rafah in the south.Shujaiya is among the areas the military had previously declared to be cleared of Hamas, but where fighting has since resumed.There has been no truce since a one-week pause in November when 80 Israeli hostages were freed in return for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.Pressure has mounted domestically for another hostage release deal, with regular protests and rallies in Israel."It's important that we reach a deal so that all the mothers can embrace their children and husbands, just as I hug my mother every morning now," rescued hostage Almog Meir Jan said in a recorded message to a rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday.Israeli protesters blocked roads in the city for a second day on Sunday, demanding the government secure a hostage deal with Hamas as the Gaza conflict entered the 10th month.The conflict started on Oct 7 when Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to official Israeli figures.At least 38,153 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military onslaught, according to Gaza health officials, and the coastal enclave has largely been reduced to rubble.Also, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement have exchanged cross-border fire almost daily since the Gaza conflict began.Agencies via XinhuaGAZA -- Hamas's Undersecretary of the Ministry of Labor Ehab al-Ghussein was killed in an Israeli airstrike west of Gaza City on Sunday, said Palestinian sources. GAZA -- At least 16 Palestinians were killed, most of them children and women, in an Israeli bombing of a school sheltering displaced people in the Nuseirat area in the central Gaza Strip on Saturday afternoon, the Palestinian official news agency WAFA reported.The Al-Jaouni school was bombed for the third time since the onset of the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict, WAFA said.The Israeli military said it was looking into the report about the incident, according to Israeli media.In a statement on Saturday, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said the attacked school sheltered about 7,000 displaced people, adding that since the outbreak of the conflict, the Israeli army has bombed more than 17 schools and displacement and shelter centers inside the Nuseirat refugee camp.UN statistics estimated earlier this week that the number of people internally displaced within Gaza has risen to 1.9 million people, or about nine out of ten people in the Strip.During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 29 people and wounded 100 others, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Saturday morning. Among those killed were five local journalists, raising the death toll of journalists since Oct. 7 to 158, according to the media office.The Palestinian death toll in the Gaza Strip has reached 38,098, with 87,705 injuries since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out in early October 2023, according to health authorities in Gaza.UNITED NATIONS - The United Nations expressed grave concerns on Friday about intensified clashes along the Lebanon-Israel frontier, known as the Blue Line.The world body highlighted the mounting tensions following an increase in exchanges of fire between Lebanese and Israeli forces.This recent surge in hostilities, which occurred on Thursday, "heightens the risk of a full-scale war," according to a note from the office of the spokesperson for the UN secretary-general.The note underscored the necessity of restraint, noting, "Escalation can and must be avoided. We reiterate that the danger of miscalculation leading to a sudden and wider conflagration is real," and emphasized that "a political and diplomatic solution is the only viable way forward."On the same day, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, engaged with key Lebanese officials including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Najib Mikati to discuss the urgency of de-escalation along the Blue Line.The UN note also reiterated calls from the UN Interim Force in Lebanon for an immediate cessation of hostilities and renewed commitment to Security Council resolution 1701, which was adopted in August 2006 to seek a full cessation of hostilities shortly after a month of deadly warfare between Israel and Hezbollah ended with a fragile truce.TEHRAN - Masoud Pezeshkian, Iran's former health minister, won the country's 14th presidential election, Iran's Election Headquarters Spokesperson Mohsen Eslami announced on Saturday.Eslami made the announcement while disclosing the results of the runoff held on Friday between reformist Pezeshkian and principlist Saeed Jalili, Iran's former chief negotiator in the nuclear talks with world powers.Eslami put the total number of votes cast in the runoff at 30,530,157, adding that according to the number of the used ballots, which stood at 30,573,931, the turnout reached 49.8 percent.Of all the votes, Pezeshkian secured 16,384,403, whereas Jalili garnered 13,538,179, said Eslami.The runoff began at 8:00 am local time (0430 GMT) at nearly 59,000 polling stations nationwide and abroad. It was scheduled to end at 6:00 pm local time (1430 GMT) but was extended three times, with each extension lasting for two hours.Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei cast his ballot at a polling station in Tehran immediately after the voting began and made a brief speech, calling the election "an important political affair of the country".Pezeshkian, 69, is a cardiac surgeon and currently a lawmaker in the country's parliament. He was the parliament's first deputy speaker from 2016 to 2020 and health minister between 2001 and 2005 in the government of former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.He ran for president in 2013, but withdrew, and failed to qualify for the presidential race in his second attempt at the presidency in 2021.Pezeshkian managed to secure 10,415,991 votes, over 42 percent of the total, in the first round of the presidential election.Jalili, 58, is currently a member of Iran's Expediency Discernment Council. He was the secretary of the country's Supreme National Security Council from 2007 to 2013 and was a chief negotiator in the nuclear talks between Iran and world powers.He was a candidate in Iran's 11th presidential election in June 2013, but finished in third place. He also ran for president in 2021, but withdrew in favor of late President Ebrahim Raisi before the election.Jalili managed to garner 9,473,298 or over 38 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential election.CAIRO/GAZA/JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told US President Joe Biden on Thursday he has decided to send a delegation to resume stalled negotiations on a hostage release deal with Hamas, their administrations said.A source from the Israeli negotiating team, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was a real chance of achieving agreement after Hamas made a revised proposal on the terms of a deal."The proposal put forward by Hamas includes a very significant breakthrough," the source said.The Israeli response to the Hamas proposal, submitted via mediators, was in marked contrast to past instances during the nearly nine-month conflict in Gaza, where Israel has said the conditions attached by Hamas were not acceptable.An Israeli official said the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency would lead the Israeli delegation for talks.Netanyahu was scheduled later on Thursday to have consultations with his negotiating team, and then discuss the hostage release talks with his security cabinet.Israel received Hamas' response on Wednesday to a proposal made public at the end of May by Biden that would include the release of about 120 hostages held in Gaza and a cease-fire in the enclave.A Palestinian official close to the mediation efforts told Reuters that Hamas has shown flexibility over some clauses that would allow a framework agreement to be reached should Israel approve.Two Hamas officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hamas has said any deal must end the conflict and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel maintains it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until Hamas is eradicated.It was not clear where the Israeli delegation would go to resume talks. Prior efforts to end the Gaza conflict were mediated by Egypt and Qatar, with talks held in both locations.In Gaza, Palestinians reacted cautiously to the prospect of renewed talks."We hope that this is the end of the war, we are exhausted and we can't stand more setbacks and disappointments," said Youssef, a father of two, now displaced in Khan Younis in the south of the enclave.On Thursday, Gaza's health ministry said the Palestinian death toll in the nearly nine months of conflict had passed 38,000, with 87,445 wounded.Ongoing strikesAn Israeli strike hit a school in Gaza City and the Civil Emergency Service said five Palestinians were killed and others wounded, while other Israeli strikes on Gaza City's old town on Thursday killed a woman and wounded several others, medics said.The Israeli military said it had been operating to dismantle Hamas' military and administrative capabilities. It said it was acting in accordance with international law and taking feasible precautions to minimize civilian casualties.In another development, Israel's regulatory body has approved plans for building 5,295 new settler homes throughout the occupied West Bank, a settlement monitoring group said on Thursday.Peace Now, a settlement watchdog based in Israel, stated in a news release that the Higher Planning Council of the Civil Administration approved the new construction during a two-day discussion on Wednesday and Thursday.The approval of the new settler housing units came a day after Israeli authorities approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers of land in the West Bank, marking the largest single appropriation in about three decades.These moves are likely to stoke further tensions in the region, which is already experiencing increasing violence.XinhuaThe Council of the Arab League has demanded freezing Israel's participation at the United Nations General Assembly as Tel Aviv continued to defy the UN Charter and international laws in its military offensive to destroy Hamas in Gaza.The Permanent Representative of Palestine to the League of Arab States Ambassador Muhannad Al-Aklouk led the appeal during the extraordinary session at the level of permanent delegates, headed by Yemen, at the request of the State of Palestine in Cairo, Egypt, on July 4.Al-Aklouk pointed out that during the past eight months of the crime of genocide, the League held two summits, four councils of foreign ministers, and six councils at the delegate level, and one temporary committee of permanent delegates was tasked last January with formulating practical measures that could be taken to force Israel to stop its atrocities.At least 38,000 Palestinians have been killed to date in the Gaza Strip since Israel launched its ongoing retaliatory strikes in October last year over revenge for Hamas' killing of 1,200 Israeli citizens and taking in over 200 hostages.The Arab nations are also pushing for the implementation of a resolution demanding the inclusion of a list of Israeli "extremist organizations" and groups associated with "Israeli colonial settlement activities" that "intrude upon the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the national Arab terrorism lists", as well as boycotting companies "operating in colonial settlements".The Council discussed the policy of confronting the "crimes of genocide and Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people, in addition to colonial expansion", the Union of News Agencies of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (UNA) reported.According to the UNA report, Al-Aklouk called for freezing Israel's participation in the UNGA because of its lack of commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, viewing it a threat to international peace and security, and for Tel Aviv's "failure to fulfill its obligations that were a condition for accepting its membership in the UN".Further, the report also noted that international law has proven that it alone "is unable to stop the greatest crime possible" as it accused Israel of "genocide while enjoying immunity".Al-Aklouk stressed the need to submit Arab referrals and complaints to the International Criminal Court, and to direct Arab civil society organizations, federations and unions to begin filing cases against Israeli officials in national and international courts.In May, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor sought arrest warrants for Israel and Hamas leaders on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity as a result of their fighting in Gaza.Israel stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice with a ruling that ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its military operation in Rafah, which it launched on May 6.Gokhan Ereli, Gulf studies coordinator at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, in Turkiye, told China Daily that the recent actions taken by the Arab League marked a significant shift in the region's geopolitical dynamics.He said the unity displayed by the Arab nations enhance their collective diplomatic and political leverage, signaling a rare moment of cohesion in addressing the brutal Israeli assaults on Palestine."By strategically employing international law and diplomatic channels, the Arab League aims to delegitimize Israeli actions and hold it accountable through global institutions such as the UN and the ICC," said Ereli."This approach not only seeks to increase international scrutiny on Israel but also to apply economic pressure through the endorsement of the BDS movement and boycotting companies involved in illegal settlements," he added.The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, launched in 2005, works to end international support for Israel's oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law, according to the BDS website.Al-Aklouk reaffirmed the Arab countries' to support the Palestinian question "with firm political positions supportive of the issue, whether in the League's decisions or in international forums".The Council reaffirmed that any Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories since 1967, whether de facto or through invalid legislation, "constitutes a new Israeli war crime".It demanded the international community to exert pressure and implement punitive measures to compel Israel to halt its illegal annexation and settlement practices, which the Council said undermined the prospects for peace and a two-state solution, Palestine's WAFA News Agency reported.Al-Aklouk lamented the children who have been killed, gone missing, lost limbs or had been orphaned, as well as the more than 10,000 women that have been killed, including putting 60 pregnant women at huge risk of death before or after child birth as the health system had collapsed."At the core of these efforts is the push for the establishment and recognition of an independent Palestinian state, preventing further annexation of Palestinian territories, and supporting the Palestinians' right to self-determination," said Ereli."The Arab League's actions highlight the importance of a just resolution to the conflict, aiming for an independent Palestinian state as a cornerstone of regional stability and peace," he added.UNITED NATIONS -- China on Tuesday called on Israel to fulfill its obligations under international humanitarian law and heed the international community's call to ensure the rapid and safe entry of humanitarian supplies into Gaza.In remarks at the UN Security Council briefing on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, China's permanent representative to the United Nations Fu Cong highlighted the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by extreme shortages of essential supplies and dire health conditions.He noted that "millions of people are struggling with hunger, disease, pain, and despair," describing the situation as a man-made humanitarian disaster and a serious breach of international law.Fu pointed out that Gaza has been under blockade for nine months, with over 2 million people living in an "open-air prison" without adequate access to water, electricity, food, medication, and fuel.He criticized the closure of the Rafah crossing due to Israeli military operations, which has left thousands of trucks loaded with humanitarian supplies waiting in long lines."The existing crossing points are far from being able to meet the demand for humanitarian aid," Fu said, emphasizing that land transport routes are key to expanding humanitarian access.Fu also addressed the obstruction of humanitarian supplies and the challenges faced by humanitarian workers, who encounter unreasonable difficulties and accusations.He condemned the repeated attacks on facilities of humanitarian agencies and noted that over 200 humanitarian workers have died in the conflict, calling this "unprecedented in history and shocking."Reiterating that "hunger cannot be weaponized, humanitarian issues cannot be politicized," Fu said the man-made exacerbation of the humanitarian disaster is "unacceptable."Fu urged Israel to ensure the "rapid and safe entry of humanitarian supplies at scale into Gaza," and to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations.The council's adoption of resolution 2720 aimed to expand humanitarian access, but its implementation has fallen short.Fu called for an examination of the reasons behind this and urged the concerned parties to work harder to remove obstacles to the large-scale entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.Fu concluded by emphasizing that the fundamental way to alleviate the humanitarian disaster is through a lasting ceasefire and the early relaunch of the two-state solution.He called on the international community to continue efforts toward this end and supported the council in taking further necessary action.JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that his country is in "the final stage" of eliminating Hamas' armed force in the Gaza Strip."We are advancing towards the completion of the elimination" of Hamas, Netanyahu said during a meeting with cadets from Israel's National Security College, according to a statement released by his office.Netanyahu's estimate came a day after he toured the Gaza Division and held a security assessment meeting, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the army's senior command, on Israel's nine-month-long offensive in Gaza, "with emphasis on the fighting in Rafah, as well as the continuation of military pressure on Hamas," according to Netanyahu's office.Also on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered a mass evacuation of civilians from the eastern Khan Younis, signaling that ground forces might soon resume their offensives in the southern Gazan city, presumably to fight Hamas forces that have regrouped in the area.Israel completed a large-scale attack in Khan Younis in early April and subsequently withdrew most of its forces.RAMALLAH - The Palestinian presidency on Sunday rejected any foreign presence on Palestinian lands, in response to Israeli statements calling for the handover of the Gaza Strip to international forces.In a declaration carried by the official news agency WAFA, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for the presidency, said that "there is no legitimacy for any foreign presence on Palestinian lands, and only the Palestinian people can decide who governs and manages their affairs."He stressed that the Israeli government "is delusional if it thinks it can decide the fate of the Palestinian people and cement the occupation by bringing in foreign forces".The spokesperson called the Palestine Liberation Organization the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, which "has legal authority over all of Palestine's territory, including Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem".He emphasized that "the Palestine issue is about land and statehood, not just humanitarian aid; it is a sacred issue and the central cause for Arabs."On Friday, Israeli public radio Kan reported that Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant discussed the transitional phase plan for Gaza during his visit to the United States days ago.The plan would be overseen by a steering committee led by the US and involving moderate Arab countries, according to the radio.The international forces, possibly including soldiers from Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco, would oversee security in Gaza while the American side would handle leadership and logistics from outside the strip, likely in Egypt, it reported.The plan will be implemented in stages from north to south Gaza and aims for the gradual transfer of local security responsibilities to Palestinian forces, the report said.It noted that the plan assumes that Hamas's military capabilities have been sufficiently reduced, rendering the group unable to conduct large-scale attacks.Israel's National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi stated last Tuesday during a conference at the Reichman University in Herzliya that "the post-war plan for Hamas and Gaza has been prepared in recent weeks, and we will soon see practical steps towards this."He added, "We do not have to wait for Hamas to disappear, as it is a long process," explaining, "We cannot eliminate Hamas as an idea; we need an alternative idea."Hanegbi believes that establishing an alternative to replace Hamas is essential for achieving long-term victory, saying that the alternative should be a government supported by local residents who wish to live alongside Israel, with backing from moderate Arab countries.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had faced widespread criticism from within and outside Israel for not presenting a clear post-war plan for Gaza.Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage.CAIRO -- Egypt denied reports suggesting that it agreed to relocate the Rafah crossing bordering the Gaza Strip or build a new terminal near Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, Egypt's Al-Qahera News TV channel reported Sunday.There were no Egyptian discussions regarding the relocation of the Rafah crossing or Israeli supervision over the crossing, said the TV channel, citing a high-ranking security source who stressed Egypt's adherence to the Israeli army's complete withdrawal from the Palestinian side of the crossing.Egypt also rejected the entry of any Egyptian forces into Gaza, the source said, adding that the post-war arrangement of the strip is a Palestinian affair.On May 7, the Israeli army announced the imposition of "operational" control over the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, which led to the cessation of aid delivery from Egypt into Gaza through the crossing.GAZA/JERUSALEM — Airstrikes and gunfire rattled northern Gaza over the weekend, where Israeli military operations have uprooted tens of thousands of Palestinians and compounded what the UN called "unbearable" living conditions in the territory.Explosions were heard from the Shujaiya area near Gaza City, and Israeli forces advanced further on Sunday.The armed wings of both Hamas and the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said they were engaged in fighting with Israeli forces there.Israel's military on Saturday reported two soldiers killed and two severely wounded in combat in northern Gaza.The Israeli forces also pushed deeper into western and central Rafah in the south.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a week ago the "intense phase" of the assault was winding down after almost nine months, but experts see a potentially prolonged next phase.Mediators' efforts have failed to conclude a truce, with both sides blaming each other for the impasse.Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said on Saturday there had been no progress in cease-fire talks with Israel over the conflict.The Palestinian group is still ready to "deal positively" with any cease-fire proposal, Hamdan told a news conference in Beirut.Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh on Saturday discussed with Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel the course of the negotiations to achieve a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.The call came after Israel's Hebrew public radio Kan reported that the US administration presented a revised version of a prisoner exchange deal that includes a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.The Israeli offensive has killed at least 37,877 Gazans, in response to Hamas' surprise attack in Israel on Oct 7, which killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.At a Tel Aviv mass rally against Netanyahu's government on Saturday, a former hostage said "we must do everything to bring them back home", referring to the hostages in Gaza.The United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA estimated that "about 60,000 to 80,000 people were displaced" from the area last week. Louise Wateridge, spokeswoman for UNRWA, said: "It's really unbearable."The conflict has also uprooted people on the Israel-Lebanon border, where the Hezbollah movement and Israeli forces have engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire.Agencies - XinhuaTEHRAN - Iran's 14th presidential election on Saturday entered a runoff vote, with former Health Minister Masoud Pezeshkian and former chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili leading in the first round but no one gets minimum threshold of 50 percent of votes, Iran's Election Headquarters Spokesperson Mohsen Eslami said.The spokesperson said turnout of the voting stands at 40 percent, adding that the runoff election will be held on next Friday.According to Eslami, Pezeshkian got 10,415,991 of votes, accounting for over 42 percent of the total votes counted, while Jalili got 9,473,298, or over 38 percent.Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf got 3,383,340, or 13.8 percent, and Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a former interior minister and justice minister, got 206,397, or 0.8 percent, Eslami said.TEHRAN - Voting for Iran's 14th presidential election started at 8 am local time (0430 GMT) on Friday, after President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash last month."We start the elections" for the country's 14th presidential election, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said in a televised address.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Tuesday for "high participation" in Friday's presidential election to replace Ebrahim Raisi, who died last month in a helicopter crash."We emphasize the importance of high participation (in the election) because it is the pride of the Islamic republic," Khamenei, 85, said in a televised speech. "In every election where the turnout was low, the enemies of the Islamic republic have denounced us."Voters have the choice between six candidates, who were selected by the Guardian Council from 80 hopefuls.AGENCIES VIA XINHUAIsrael kept up its bombardment of Gaza on Tuesday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out ending its eight-month-long fighting in the enclave any time soon, as experts call for the implementation of the United Nations cease-fire resolution.Netanyahu said late on Sunday that he would only accept a partial cease-fire deal that would not end the conflict in Gaza.He said he was ready to make a partial deal to bring back some of the 120 hostages still held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, but "we are committed to continuing the war after a pause, in order to complete the goal of eliminating Hamas".Since the UN resolution's adoption on June 10, Hamas has notified mediating parties Qatar, Egypt and the United States that it welcomes the adoption and stated its readiness to implement the resolution.Although the White House keeps talking of Israeli acceptance, Israel, however, has so far failed to officially announce it would carry out the resolution that requires an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, release of all hostages and no hindrance to the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.Hamas noted Netanyahu's position is "a clear confirmation of his rejection of the recent Security Council resolution and the proposals of US President Joe Biden", according to The Palestinian Information Center.The US has pressured Hamas to agree unconditionally to its proposals for the three-phase Gaza cease-fire. Biden announced the proposal in May.The US proposal holds Hamas responsible for the delay, rather than making Israel accept the UNSC resolution.Abdalfatah Asqool, an international law lecturer at the University of Palestine in Gaza, told China Daily that what the US is doing is to give Israel more time to continue the conflict.Three phases for peaceThe UNSC Resolution 2735 specifies three phases for peace, the first of which would include an immediate, full and complete cease-fire with the release of hostages and the return of the remains of some hostages who have been killed, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the populated areas in Gaza.Ayman Yousef, a professor of international relations at the Arab American University in Jenin, told China Daily there are questions regarding the US and Israel's differing views of the cease-fire proposal.Yousef said the US has failed to differentiate between a temporary or permanent cease-fire, with the latter effectively meaning an end to the conflict.This confusion has been passed to both Hamas and Israel, Yousef said, and Netanyahu is exploiting the gap between the different definitions of cease-fire.Meanwhile, Israeli forces killed at least 24 Palestinians in three separate airstrikes early on Tuesday in Gaza City and the dead included a sister of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, Gaza health officials and medics said.Israeli tanks also pressed deeper into the western areas of Rafah overnight, blowing up homes, residents said.Two Israeli airstrikes hit two schools in Gaza City, killing at least 14 people, medics said. Another strike on a house in the Shati (Beach) camp, one of the Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps, killed 10 others.The house in Shati belonged to the extended family of Haniyeh, who is based in Qatar, killing one of his sisters along with other relatives too, family members and medics said.Haniyeh, who leads Hamas' diplomacy and is the public face of the group that has been running Gaza, has lost many relatives in Israeli airstrikes since Oct 7, including three sons.The health ministry in Hamasrun Gaza said Tuesday that at least 37,658 people have been killed during more than eight months of war between Israel and Palestinian militants.Agencies contributed to this story.mikegu@chinadailyhk.comEgypt narrowly escaped colonization by France and Britain, the two great European powers of the 18th and 19th centuries. Instead, Egypt experienced French and British "cultural imperialism".French engineering built the Suez Canal, the French Napoleonic Code became the basis of the Egyptian legal system, the children of Egypt's upper classes studied French language and literature, and Cairo's architecture reflected French styles. The spread of British culture came later, after the militarization of the Suez Canal, with administrative, commercial and financial influence. British tourists traveled the Nile and upper-class Egyptians began to play English sports.After World War I, Egypt gradually came more under the cultural influence of the United States, the new great power. In 1956, when the US stopped the British-French-Israeli seizure of the Suez Canal, the prestige of the European powers collapsed. As the US seemed to care less about dominating Egypt than controlling the oil resources of the Gulf, Egyptians came to view it as benign, less self-interested than the Europeans.The US quickly achieved a similar reputation across most of the Middle East. As Arab countries emerged from British or French colonial rule, they readily identified with Americans who had also escaped an empire. Moreover, in the final decades of the 20th century, the US' economic achievements and prowess in space suggested there was much to learn from it. The atheism of Soviet communism made it easier for Muslims to side with the Americans; Hollywood movies and American television familiarized Arab elites with American culture; and friendly American tourists were popular as they toured the region's historic sites.The US, the sole superpower after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the uncontested leader of the global economy, dominated the region. It was not only US naval strike groups or American influence over global economics that impressed the Arab elite. Many accepted the US' claimed "exceptionalism" and even its self-image as the "indispensable nation", the only power capable of managing international conflicts. Many were also attracted by the American political and social model, viewing it as the best template for the gradual modernization of their own societies and the advancement of their poor. They saw much to gain from learning from the US.By the end of the 20th century, it was common to speak of the US' "soft power" — non-coercive means of co-opting support through the appeal of its values and the attraction of its example. The assertion of such cultural power, it was suggested, would minimize US dependence on its military.In the new century, however, the US aggressively exercised its hard power, first in Afghanistan, then in Iraq and Libya. US prestige waned as each military venture failed to achieve its stated aims. In those years, also, the US was gradually losing its absolute preeminence in the global economy and the appeal of its institutions was being sullied by its increased political and social dysfunction. The American example no longer seemed so worthy of emulation.Policy failures and strategic incoherence hastened a decline in American soft power. Washington pursued inconsistent policies toward the great rivals, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Russia, not the US, was the decisive player in the murderous Syrian civil war. President Obama punctured Egyptian belief in a friendly US by abandoning the Hosni Mubarak regime for the Muslim Brotherhood.The Middle East awoke to China's version of soft power in the second decade of the 21st century. Governments and elites, astounded that tens of millions of Chinese were escaping poverty every year, saw much to admire, perhaps to emulate, in China's economy and its win-win approach to problem-solving. Chinese diplomacy amazed the region by brokering an accommodation between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Some began to think that the West was in terminal decline, and that the future would belong to the Global South in a multipolar world.Unlike the US, but in the tradition of other great powers of history, China understands that the Middle East is the bridge between the Mediterranean world and Asia. Moreover, in contrast with US policies, which had dealt with the region on a country-by-country basis, China announced an ongoing relationship with the whole Arab world.President Xi Jinping indicated that the Chinese-Arab relationship, building on historic Silk Road contacts, would involve enhanced exchanges and mutual understanding between two great civilizations. His recognition that Chinese and Arab civilizations are historic peers is in significant contrast to Western attitudes that privileged the achievements of the Pharaohs while neglecting those of the Arab past.President Xi described China's relationship with the Arab world as "a strategic partnership of comprehensive cooperation and common development". The economic promise of the partnership is to link China's market of 1.4 billion people with the Arab world's 475 million.The lodestar or guiding principle for "a closer China-Arab community with a shared future" is the Belt and Road Initiative. China puts Egypt and the Suez Canal at the center of its 21st Century Maritime Silk Road for Asian trade with Europe.Egypt is home to huge BRI engineering projects, including major power plants and a new Canal Economic Zone for industry, trade and logistics. Egypt's New Administrative Capital, now being created in the desert east of Cairo, will house 6.5 million people in skyscrapers projected to be among the tallest buildings in Africa. These projects support Egypt's national development plan targeted for completion in 2030.Breaking with America's laissez-faire doctrine of modernization through private investment and market forces, China has integrated its BRI projects with the national development plans of other Middle Eastern governments, including Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, Oman's Vision 2040 and Morocco's Emergence plans. China has also supported several Arab governments in developing port infrastructure and coastal economic zones, and improving logistics and supply chains.The West never built anything on the scale of the BRI projects. Indeed, in physical terms, only the architectural monuments of the ancient empires in Egypt — the Ptolemies, Romans, Arab dynasties and Ottomans — are comparable. And those ancient monuments were built over centuries, not in a decade or two.But soft power achieves its persuasive influence over hearts and minds — not physically, but gradually through countless human interactions. After two centuries, the cultural impression of the West remains strong in the Middle East. China's soft power faces formidable cultural competition from the English language, Western ideas about economics and politics, and long habits of interaction between Western and Arab elites.People-to-people connectivity, identified by President Xi as a primary BRI goal, will add to China's soft power by producing mutually profitable deals between Chinese and Arab businesses. He also emphasized the importance of cultural mutual respect and mutual learning.Today, however, both Chinese and Arab commercial elites are largely ignorant of the other society, either its historic achievements or its contemporary culture. Chinese-Arab business — indeed the whole Chinese-Arab relationship — will never achieve its potential until that deep cultural divide is bridged.The future of China's soft power in the region depends on Chinese and Arabs getting to know one another better, and more fully understanding each others' lives, hopes and struggles. It will be decided by individual Chinese and Arabs discovering mutual goals as they talk, work and play together.The author is a former senior Egyptian diplomat, most notably as consul general to London and Hong Kong and ambassador to Slovakia.JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Monday that Israel is "committed" to the deal proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden for a ceasefire in Gaza in return for the release of hostages."We are committed to the Israeli proposal that President Biden endorsed," Netanyahu said during a special plenum session of the Knesset (parliament) summoned by the opposition, noting "Our position has not changed."Biden first presented the deal proposal to end the ongoing conflict in late May, referring to it as "the Israeli proposal". Netanyahu's remarks marked the first time the Israeli side has confirmed that Israel has approved and supports the proposal.Netanyahu told the Knesset that Israel will not end the conflict "until we bring back all the hostages, all 120 of them -- both the living and the fallen" and until Hamas is "eliminated" and the residents in southern and northern can safely return to their homes.Israel has been carrying out a massive offensive in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a Hamas rampage on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.The Israeli assault caused a severe humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave and killed more than 37,600 people, according to the health authorities in Gaza.UNITED NATIONS - UN Humanitarians said on Monday that access and security constraints hinder food aid delivery to hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and the medical evacuation of 10,000 patients.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the inability to transport aid commodities from the Kerem Shalom crossing safely and the continued closure of the Rafah crossing compounded the challenges facing aid operations.OCHA said fewer than half of the 86 coordinated humanitarian missions to northern Gaza planned for this month were facilitated by Israeli authorities. More than a quarter were impeded, 12 percent were denied access and 12 percent were canceled due to logistical, operational or security reasons."A humanitarian mission returning to southern Gaza after delivering fuel and medical supplies to Gaza City in the north was delayed for more than 13 hours at an Israeli military checkpoint, putting the convoy in danger of being caught in crossfire," the office cited as just one example of the challenges in aid delivery. "Planned humanitarian missions requiring coordination to areas in southern Gaza also continue to face impediments and access denials."The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that more than 10,000 people need medical evacuations to outside Gaza. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appealed for their sustained medical evacuation and timely passage using all possible routes."Pediatric patients are among those who need to leave Gaza for specialized care," OCHA said. "WHO and partners transferred five of these patients -- four with cancer and one with second-degree burns -- from Al-Ahli hospital to Nasser Medical Complex, where they will continue to receive care until they can depart Gaza."The humanitarians said the WHO team also delivered medical supplies to cover the health needs of 20,000 patients at Al-Ahli and As-Sahaba hospitals and 19,000 liters of fuel.In short supply in Gaza, fuel is necessary for electricity generators and to power smaller vehicles transporting aid and personnel.JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that intense fighting against Hamas is "very close" to an end.In an interview with Israeli Channel 14 TV news, Netanyahu said that "the intensive phase of the war in Rafah is about to end", and the Israeli forces were "very close" to concluding the "intensive phase" in the entire Gaza Strip.However, he said, this does not mean an end to the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip, and operations will persist with the fighting against Hamas targets.After the conclusion of the "intensive phase" in Gaza, "we will continue northward," Netanyahu said, referring to Israel's warnings of launching a full-fledged war against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.He said that any agreement to secure a ceasefire along the Israel-Lebanon border, where Israeli and Hezbollah forces have traded fire since Oct 7, 2023, "will have to meet our terms".He stated he would only agree to a deal that would see Hamas removed from power in the Gaza Strip and the release of about 100 hostages who are still held in the Palestinian enclave.GAZA/JERUSALEM — Dozens of people were killed in Israeli attacks on districts of Gaza City in the north of the Palestinian enclave on Saturday, as food continued to pile up at a Gaza crossing amid warnings from agencies that they are unable to deliver aid.One Israeli strike on houses in Al-Shati, one of the Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps, killed 24 people, Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run government media office, told Reuters. Another 18 Palestinians were killed in a strike on houses in the Al-Tuffah neighborhood.The Israeli military issued a statement saying: "A short while ago, IDF fighter jets struck two Hamas military infrastructure sites in the area of Gaza City."Hamas said the attacks targeted the civilian population and that the perpetrators "will pay the price for their violations against our people"."People were going about their business" when, suddenly, "the whole area was wiped out" in an airstrike, said Abu Mahmud al-Kariri, a witness in Al-Shati.The European Union's foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, on Saturday called for an "independent investigation" into the shelling that damaged the office of the International Committee of the Red CrossLate on Friday, the committee said 22 dead and 45 wounded were taken to a Red Cross field hospital after shelling with "heavy caliber projectiles" near its southern Gaza office.Gaza's health ministry blamed the shelling on Israel.The Israel military said on Saturday that an initial inquiry found "there was no direct attack carried out by the IDF against a Red Cross facility", but that the matter was being looked into.The conflict has led to dire humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip and repeated warnings by the United Nations of famine.Desperation among Gaza's 2.4 million people has increased as fighting rages, bringing warnings from agencies that they are unable to deliver aid."The breakdown of public order and safety is increasingly endangering humanitarian workers and operations in Gaza," the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Friday.With civil order breaking down in Gaza, the UN says it has been unable to pick up any supplies from Kerem Shalom since Tuesday, leaving crucial aid in limbo.A deputy UN spokesman said last week that the crossing "is operating with limited functionality, including because of fighting in the area".Tel Aviv protestsOn Saturday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced what organizers said was the biggest anti-government protest since the conflict began.Tens of thousands rallied in Tel Aviv. One demonstrator's sign accused Netanyahu of being an "Enemy of Israel".Supporters and families of the Gaza hostages also rallied, holding their pictures aloft.Netanyahu said on Sunday that a dispute with the United States over weapons delays relating to the Gaza conflict would be resolved soon.Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant flew to Washington to discuss the next phase of the war and escalating hostilities on the border with Lebanon.Exchanges of fire across the Lebanese border between Israel and Hezbollah have also escalated, raising fears of wider conflict.On Saturday a security source said a leader of the Lebanese group Jamaa Islamiya was killed in an Israeli strike on a vehicle in eastern Lebanon.Hezbollah said it had targeted a military position in northern Israel "with an attack drone" in response to the killing of a commander of the Jamaa Islamiya group.The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said cross-border hostilities must not turn Lebanon into "another Gaza"."One rash move — one miscalculation — could trigger a catastrophe that goes far beyond the border and, frankly, beyond imagination."Violence has also soared in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Israeli troops tied a wounded Palestinian man to a military vehicle during a raid in the city of Jenin on Saturday, the army said on Sunday, acknowledging that soldiers had violated operational procedures.Footage of the incident on the internet shows a Jenin resident strapped to the hood of a military jeep as it passes through a narrow alley."The incident will be investigated and dealt with accordingly," the military said, adding that the wounded man was transferred to the Palestinian Red Crescent for treatment.Agencies via XinhuaSANAA -- Yemen's Houthi group on Sunday claimed responsibility for attacking two cargo ships in the Red Sea and the western Indian Ocean."The naval forces of our armed forces carried out a second targeting operation for the ship TRANSWORLD NAVIGATOR in the Red Sea with an unmanned boat, which resulted in a direct hit on the ship," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a statement aired by Houthi-run al-Masirah TV."The missile force of our armed forces carried out an operation targeting the ship STOLT SEQUOIA in the Indian Ocean with several cruise missiles, and the operation achieved its objectives successfully," he said.The attacks come in response to what Houthi claimed their owner companies' violation of the group's entry ban into Israeli ports, according to the spokesman.Speaking of the U.S. aircraft carrier Eisenhower, which had just left the region, Yahya claimed that a series of Houthi attacks drove the vessel away.He reiterated that his group's attacks would continue until Israel stops its war in the Palestinian enclave of the Gaza Strip.Earlier in the day, a Yemeni government official told Xinhua that the merchant vessel TRANSWORLD NAVIGATOR, flying the Liberian flag, was struck twice by the Houthi group successively on Saturday in the Gulf of Aden, and on early Sunday, in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen's port city of Hodeidah.The official said the ship was damaged but was still proceeding to its destination with no injuries reported from the crew.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) confirmed receiving a report of an incident approximately 65 nautical miles west of Hodeidah.The UKMTO's statement indicated that the master of a merchant vessel reported an impact from an uncrewed aerial system, which resulted in ship damage. All crew members were reported safe, and the ship was said to be proceeding to its next port of call.These attacks are part of a broader campaign by the Houthis, which began in November 2023, targeting ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab Strait. The group claims to be targeting vessels associated with Israel or en route to Israeli ports, citing the ongoing Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip as justification.The ongoing conflict along the vital shipping lanes of the Red Sea and surrounding waters continues to raise concerns about maritime security and global trade implications. TUNIS -- The death toll among Tunisian pilgrims who performed Hajj in Saudi Arabia has risen to 53, Tunisia's state television Wataniya 1 reported."Until this Saturday, the number of Tunisian pilgrims who died in holy places in Saudi Arabia while performing the Hajj rituals, increased further from 49 to 53," said the report.The Tunisian diplomatic mission in Riyadh and the consulate general in Jeddah are currently coordinating to monitor the situation of Tunisian pilgrims who are missing, deceased, or hospitalized in Saudi Arabia, according to the report.On Friday, Tunisian President Kais Saied sacked Ibrahim Chaibi, the minister of religious affairs, without specifying the reason for the dismissal.Chaibi headed the official Tunisian delegation to Saudi Arabia during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The delegation was tasked with supporting and assisting Tunisian pilgrims during the Hajj.Chaibi attributed the loss of human life to factors including the extreme temperatures surpassing 50 degrees Celsius, a significant presence of elderly pilgrims, and a high number of pilgrims with pre-existing illnesses.Hajj, a key pillar of Islam, is annually performed in Mecca, by pilgrims from all over the world. The number of pilgrims exceeded 1.8 million this year, according to Saudi authorities.GAZA - At least 42 Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes on residential houses in two areas of Gaza City, according to Palestinian security and medical sources."About 18 were killed and dozens of others wounded in al-Shati refugee camp after the Israeli warplanes attacked a residential square," Palestinian medical sources told Xinhua.The medical sources noted that the number of victims is likely to increase as the civil defense teams were still trying to pull out the victims from the rubble, adding that the residential square had become "a huge amount of ruins".Palestinian security sources said that Israeli warplanes launched several raids on al-Shati refugee camp, destroying seven inhabited homes.Also on Saturday, at least 24 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed during Israeli airstrikes on houses in the al-Tuffah neighborhood in the northeast of Gaza City, the Hamas-run government media office said in a press statement.The Israeli army said on Saturday in a press statement that its warplanes had attacked two Hamas military infrastructure sites in Gaza City.According to the Times of Israel, the Israeli army targeted Raed Saad, a senior commander of Hamas in Gaza. So far, there has been no official Palestinian confirmation of his death.Saad, identified as a chief of Hamas operations, was reportedly believed to have been at Gaza City's al-Shifa Hospital during an Israeli raid in March, although he was not found there at the time.Israel launched a large-scale war on the Gaza Strip since Oct 7, 2023, after Hamas carried out a military attack on Israeli towns near the Strip, killing about 1,200 and capturing around 250 others.The health authorities in Gaza said in a press statement that as of Thursday, the Palestinian death toll from Israeli military operations has risen to 37,431 people, with 85,653 others wounded. UNITED NATIONS -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday voiced "profound concern" over escalating violence and "bellicose rhetoric" between Israel and Hezbollah militants across the frontier with Lebanon.Speaking to the press at the UN headquarters in New York, the UN chief warned that one false move could trigger a catastrophe for the whole region and beyond."One rash move -- one miscalculation -- could trigger a catastrophe that goes far beyond the border, and frankly, beyond imagination," he said.He underscored that a widening of the conflict in the Middle East must be avoided."Let's be clear: The people of the region and the people of the world cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza," he stressed.The UN chief noted that on both sides of the Blue Line, many people have already lost their lives, and tens of thousands of people have been driven from their homes, with their livelihoods destroyed.He urged both sides to urgently recommit to the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1701 and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities.Adopted in 2006, the resolution set in motion a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and the establishment of demilitarized zone."The world must say loudly and clearly: immediate de-escalation is not only possible -- it is essential," Guterres said, declaring that "there is no military solution.""It is time for reason and rationality. It is time for practical and pragmatic engagement by the parties to the diplomatic and political avenues available to them," he stressed, noting that the cessation of hostilities and progress toward a permanent ceasefire is the only durable solution.The UN chief also underscored the need to protect civilians, ensure that children, journalists and medical workers are not targeted, and ensure the displaced can return to their homes.The United Nations is actively engaging to promote peace, security and stability, in line with resolution 1701, he said."UN peacekeepers, UNIFIL, are on the ground working to de-escalate tensions and help prevent miscalculation, in an extremely challenging environment," he said, adding that the United Nations fully supports diplomatic efforts to end the violence, restore stability and avoid even greater human suffering in the region."And we do so as we continue to press for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages and a real pathway to a two-state solution," Guterres concluded.YEREVAN - Armenia officially recognized the State of Palestine, the Armenian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday."On various international platforms, we have always advocated a peaceful and comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian question and support the two-state principle of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We are convinced that this is the only way to ensure that Palestinians and Israelis can realize their legitimate aspirations," the ministry said."Based on the above and reaffirming its commitment to international law and the principles of equality, sovereignty and peaceful coexistence of peoples, the Republic of Armenia recognizes the State of Palestine," read the statement.Norway, Ireland and Spain made a coordinated announcement on May 22, declaring their recognition of Palestine as a state effective as of May 28. But their decision was condemned by Israel.On June 3, over 20 UN experts and special rapporteurs called on all countries to recognize a Palestinian state. So far, over 140 countries have already recognized a Palestinian state, representing more than two-thirds of the United Nations' membership.RIYADH -- The China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) on Wednesday announced that it has completed the 2024 Hajj operation of the Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro Line in the city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.Over the seven days, 2,206 trains have been dispatched, serving about 2.094 million passengers, CRCC said in a statement.The Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro Line operates for seven days a year, used exclusively as a shuttle train for pilgrims between holy sites in Mecca to reduce congestion during the Hajj.This marks the 10th year that the CRCC successfully managed the Hajj operation, added the statement.The Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro Line, starting operations in 2010, marks not only Saudi Arabia's first light rail but the first light rail built by a Chinese company in the Middle East, said CRCC."Over a decade ago, this place was a desert. Now, we have left a convenient pilgrimage route for Muslims worldwide," said Zhang Long, project manager of the metro line, adding that the project is a testament to Chinese enterprises' commitment to high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative.Also on Wednesday, the Saudi Health Ministry announced there were no outbreaks of disease or other threats to public health during the current Hajj season, despite the significant number of pilgrims and the challenges posed by high temperatures.Minister of Health Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel specifically acknowledged the Central Hajj Committee's recommendation for pilgrims to avoid performing rituals during peak temperatures, which significantly contributed to safeguarding pilgrims' health and minimizing heat stress injuries.The Israeli military's approval of operational plans for offensive attacks against Lebanon in defiance of Lebanese and US warnings is seen as a major escalation of the regional conflict, while continuing the bloodshed in the Gaza Strip.The Israeli threat raised the fears of the Palestinian leadership and United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk, who called for the de-escalation of violence along the Israel-Lebanon border to avert a full-scale war.The Israel Defense Forces said on Tuesday that the generals held an assessment, during which "operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved", as part of preparations to engage in combat with Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border, The Times of Israel reported.Before the IDF announcement, Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati told US envoy Amos J. Hochstein that stopping the persistent Israeli aggression on Lebanon "is required immediately so as to maintain calm and stability in the south of Lebanon", Qatar News Agency reported.Hochstein, who visited Tel Aviv before Beirut, said during the meeting with Mikati that it was in everyone's interest to resolve the conflict along the blue line between Israel and Hezbollah quickly and diplomatically, noting it is "both achievable and urgent".Muslim Imran, director of the Asia Middle East Center for Research and Dialogue in Malaysia, told China Daily that the Israeli military and political leadership are "very delusional"."Now going into war with Lebanon … only shows that Israel's leadership has lost its mind," Imran said.Imran said the Israeli plan against Lebanon before ending the Gaza conflict is proof that the current Israeli leadership is only interested in day-to-day political and administrative survival.Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes and clashes between IDF troops and Palestinian militants rocked Gaza on Wednesday. Witnesses and the civil defense agency in Gaza reported Israeli bombardment in western Rafah, where medics said drone strikes and shelling killed at least seven people.In a video recording, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized close ally Washington for "withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel", in remarks rejected by the White House.Apart from "one particular shipment of munitions" that US officials were looking into closely, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said there are no other pauses. "None," she said.Imran said the United States is being dragged down the same hole as Israel, with the upcoming presidential elections making it very difficult for the US to engage in conflict.At the 56th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council on Tuesday, Turk said he is extremely worried about the escalating situation between Lebanon and Israel.The IDF may have repeatedly violated fundamental principles of the laws of war in a series of prohibited indiscriminate attacks on Gaza, according to a report issued by the UN Human Rights Office on Wednesday.Xinhua and Agencies contributed to this story.JERUSALEM - The Israeli military announced Tuesday that it has approved "operational plans" for an offensive against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.In a statement, the military said Ori Gordin, commander of the Northern Command, and Oded Basiuk, head of the Operations Directorate, "approved the plans and held a joint situation assessment in the Northern Command" as part of preparations for the continuation of combat against Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border.The military added that "decisions were made on the continuation of increasing readiness of troops in the field".The announcement came amid increasing tensions between the two sides, also at a time when US envoy Amos Hochstein, during his visit to Beirut, called for urgent de-escalation of confrontations on the Israel-Lebanon border.In his meeting with Israeli leaders on Monday, Hochstein also urged relevant sides to soon resolve the conflict along the Blue Line, the border demarcation between Lebanon and Israel, via diplomatic means, which he said would serve everyone's interest and is "achievable and urgent".Tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border escalated on Oct 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the day before. Israel then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.Internal divisions in Israel's government and the dissolution of its war cabinet have cast doubts on Tel Aviv's objectives in Gaza, amid delays in agreeing on a cease-fire deal and the distribution of aid.The war cabinet was dissolved as the Israel Defense Forces announced a "local, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes" between 8 am and 7 pm daily from Sunday until further notice.The IDF said this was to increase the volume of humanitarian aid entering Gaza following discussions with the United Nations and international aid organizations.Analysts said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's latest move and its timing aimed to deflect international criticisms and pacify domestic woes, which are further delegitimizing his embattled government.On Monday, The Times of Israel and other media reported that Netanyahu had disbanded Israel's six-member war cabinet. Netanyahu formed the emergency government on Oct 11 to manage the response to Palestine's Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah following Hamas' surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7.The decision was announced amid pressure from his far-right coalition partners to form a new "war cabinet" and the threats of expanding the Gaza conflict to Lebanon. The announcement came soon after the resignation of Benny Gantz, a retired general and member of Israel's Knesset, on June 9.Nagapushpa Devendra, a West Asia analyst and research scholar at the University of Erfurt in Germany, said dissolving the war cabinet "reflects a shift in Israel's security priorities", with Netanyahu possibly reevaluating the approach to dealing with Hamas and Hezbollah.She said this may be seen as a tactical maneuver by Netanyahu aimed to further consolidate power within the prime minister's office and centralize the decision-making processes, especially now that his political rival Gantz has quit the emergency government."Netanyahu's decision to disband the war cabinet may be a strategic ploy to deflect criticism from the international community and the Israeli public," Devendra told China Daily, noting that Netanyahu may be seeking to enhance his political standing and bolster his reputation on the global stage.She said this could also serve to placate domestic critics who have raised concerns about the government's handling of security issues.'Political maneuver'The timing is "evidence of a calculated political maneuver" with Israel facing mounting pressure from the international community, the West, regional leaders, as well as the Jewish community, Devendra said.Meanwhile, anti-government protesters took to the streets of Jerusalem on Monday amid growing discontent over Netanyahu's handling of the bombardment in Gaza, demanding the freeing of hostages and even calling for elections.By sundown, a crowd of thousands had gathered outside the Knesset before marching to Netanyahu's private home in the city.Separately, the IDF's announcement of a pause in fighting has been called into question with Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, saying that this has not happened.He said hostilities were ongoing in Rafah and in the south of Gaza and that "operationally, nothing has changed yet", Al Jazeera reported.In the south, Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday killed at least 17 Palestinians in two of the Gaza Strip's historic refugee camps and Israeli tanks pushed deeper into the enclave's southern city of Rafah, residents and medics said.In central Gaza, witnesses reported gunfire and artillery shelling near Nuseirat refugee camp, where the civil defense agency said at least 13 people died in two separate strikes on a family home and a commercial building.Witnesses and the Hamas government media office said there were some strikes and fighting elsewhere in northern and central Gaza."The current situation reflects Israel's strategic delaying tactics amid internal turmoil. It is no secret that Israel has long been engulfed in internal conflicts, and now lacks both international and domestic legitimacy," Arhama Siddiqa, a Middle East analyst and research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan, told China Daily.She said the 11-hour pause in hostilities offers a little reprieve, with Israeli atrocities reaching new levels daily and children dying every hour, illustrating the "dire choices between death by bullet or starvation".Agencies contributed to this story.ADEN, Yemen -- A merchant vessel struck by the Yemeni Houthi group days ago has sunk in the Red Sea, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations reported Tuesday.GAZA/JERUSALEM — In tents in the stifling heat and in bombed-out mosques, Gazans marked the start of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha on Sunday, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dissolved the six-member war cabinet.Israeli media reported on Monday that Netanyahu told the security cabinet on Sunday night that the war cabinet, which was created on Oct 11, has been officially disbanded.Netanyahu is now expected to hold consultations about the Gaza conflict with a small group of ministers, including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer who had been in the war cabinet, Reuters reported.The prime minister had faced demands from partners in his coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, to be included in the war cabinet, a move which would have intensified strains with international partners, including the United States.Former general Benny Gantz left the government last week, over what they said was Netanyahu's failure to form a strategy for the Gaza operation.After more than eight months of a devastating Israeli offensive that has flattened much of Gaza, displaced most of the besieged territory's 2.4 million people and sparked repeated warnings of famine, Eid this year is a day of misery for many."There is no joy. We have been robbed of it," said Malakiya Salman, who is now living in a tent in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip."I hope the world will put pressure to end the war on us, because we are truly dying, and our children are broken."Palestinians used to celebrate the holiday by decorating streets and alleys, slaughtering sacrificial animals, exchanging visits to offer greetings, and children and young people by visiting parks and playgrounds in the Strip with their families to have fun.Holiday rituals absentAll the holiday rituals, however, were absent from the family of Ahmed Mansour, who was displaced from his home in Gaza City after October. "I was not able to buy new clothes for my children and we could not prepare the cakes. In short, this holiday came without joy," the 35-year-old father of three told Xinhua News Agency.The Israeli military announced on Sunday morning a "tactical pause of military activity" around a Rafah-area route to facilitate the delivery of desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gazans.The pause "for humanitarian purposes will take place from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm every day until further notice along the road that leads from the Kerem Shalom crossing to the Salah al-Din road and then northward", a military statement said.The United Nations welcomed the Israeli move, although "this has yet to translate into more aid reaching people in need", said Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA.But Netanyahu criticized the plans announced by the military."When the prime minister heard the reports of an 11-hour humanitarian pause in the morning, he turned to his military secretary and made it clear that this was unacceptable to him," an Israeli official said.More than 37,347 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military offensive on Gaza since Hamas' surprise attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed.Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators have been pushing for a new Gaza truce, so far without success.The only previous truce lasted one week in November and saw many hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, while increased aid flowed into Gaza.Hamas has insisted on the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a permanent cease-fire — demands Israel has repeatedly rejected.Agencies - XinhuaJERUSALEM, - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his wartime cabinet, which was created on Oct 11, 2023, an Israeli government official confirmed to Xinhua.The wartime cabinet was established days after the beginning of Israel's conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, in order to discuss Israel's operations in the enclave and along the northern border against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, a Hamas ally in the region.Netanyahu announced the decision during a security cabinet meeting on Sunday, according to the official.The disbanding of the wartime cabinet came as Itamar Ben-Gvir, a right-wing extremist minister of internal security, demanded to join it. His request came following the resignation of Benny Gantz, leader of the only centrist party in Netanyahu's coalition government, on June 9.The wartime cabinet consisted of three members - Netanyahu, Gantz, and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who together made important decisions regarding the military campaign in Gaza.The Group of Seven nations is being urged to do more to end Israeli atrocities in Gaza as Tel Aviv has yet to publicly accept a US-backed United Nations Security Council resolution despite the bloc's claim that it welcomes Israel's acceptance of the proposal.The Islamic Relief group urged the G7 countries Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States to end arms sales to states in which there "are serious risks of international law being violated, such as Israel's actions in Gaza".Military spending was at "record levels" while humanitarian aid to help people affected by wars and disasters had been cut, even as more than 1 million Palestinians are starving, it said.Israel's continued offensives are reported to have killed at least 37,337 Gazans, in response to Hamas' attack on Israel in October, in which about 1,200 people were killed.Eight Israeli soldiers were killed in a blast in southern Gaza on Saturday, the military said.In Rafah, witnesses reported clashes between militants and Israeli troops in the city's west and artillery fire toward a refugee camp in the city center.Abdalfatah Asqool, an international law lecturer at the University of Palestine, told China Daily: "They announce a deal, which is originally an Israeli deal, and they ask Hamas only to say yes to the deal without any comments. This proves that the US is acting as a representative of Israel. They announced that Israel accepted the deal, but we did not hear it from the Israelis themselves."So it is better for the US to stop playing the two faces role, because this will make them keep losing on both the local and international level."Abdul Wahed Jalal Nori, an analyst and lecturer in the Department of Fundamental and Inter-Disciplinary Studies at the International Islamic University Malaysia, told China Daily that what the G7 said at its summit was "insufficient and overly cautious". G7's reliance on US President Joe Biden's proposed deal "places too much responsibility on Hamas to accept terms without significant leverage or guarantees", he said."This is seen as somewhat one-sided, failing to adequately pressure Israel to make concessions necessary for peace, such as easing the blockade on Gaza or addressing settlement activities in the West Bank."At the G7 summit in Apulia, Italy, from Thursday to Saturday, the bloc called on Hamas to accept and implement UN Security Council Resolution 2735 while reaffirming support to Israel and its "right to defend itself", according to a G7 communique published on Friday.Though demanding an increase in humanitarian aid flow, the G7 said it wanted "Israel's security interests and safety for Palestinian civilians in Gaza assured".However, the government of Israel has yet to publicly acknowledge or accept the proposals even though the US has given assurances that Tel Aviv has accepted the conditions.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "faces significant pressure from various domestic political factions", Abdul Wahed said, and acknowledging international calls for a cease-fire or concessions to Hamas "might be seen as a sign of weakness or a betrayal of national security interests"."This could erode political support within right-wing and conservative segments of the Israeli electorate, who favor a hard-line stance against Hamas and other Palestinian factions."Though G7 leaders in their communique reiterated a commitment to a two-state solution, the outcomes "expressly show the double standards of the international community in dealing with the issues", said Asqool of the University of Palestine.The G7 agreed on the right of Ukraine to resist but ignored the Palestinian right to defense against occupying forces and did little for the thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians killed after the Hamas attack in October, Asqool said.Agencies contributed to this story.jan@chinadailyapac.comGAZA -- At least nine Palestinians were killed by an Israeli airstrike on the Al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza on the first day of Eid al-Adha, Palestinian medical sources said on Sunday.The airstrike targeted two residential houses, killing nine people, including six children, and injuring several others who were then taken to the hospital, said medical sources who require anonymity.As of Sunday, the Palestinian death toll from the ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 37,337, with 85,299 injuries, the Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza said.Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a statement on Sunday that fighting continued in the southern Gaza Strip, including in the southernmost Gazan city of Rafah.He also confirmed that the road through which goods pass will be open during daylight hours for the passage of humanitarian aid only.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct. 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage.AMMAN -- Jordan on Sunday confirmed the deaths of 14 citizens and the missing of 17 others who were performing Hajj rituals in Saudi Arabia.Sufian Qudah, the spokesperson for the Jordanian Foreign Ministry, said in a statement that the Jordanian side is following up with concerned Saudi authorities on burials or home returns of the deceased at their families' request.The Saudi authorities were also continuing the search for the 17 missing pilgrims, according to the statement.The statement did not detail further nor disclose the cause of the tragedy, but the Jordanian Foreign Ministry reported a day earlier that six Jordanians had died of heat stroke during the Hajj pilgrimage.Gaza -- About 625,000 children have been denied an education in the Gaza Strip as schools have been forced to remain closed due to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a UN body said on Saturday.The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said in a statement on social media platform X that its crews continue to support Palestinian children through activities that help them return to learning, but this is not enough, stressing the necessity of a ceasefire now.The war robbed the children in Gaza of their childhood, and the survivors are suffering from deep trauma, as their schools were destroyed and they lost an entire academic year without education or play, it added.Children are the first to suffer the most in conflicts and wars, pointing out that a very large number of them have been killed and others injured, and many of them will have scars for life, the statement said.As of Friday, the Palestinian death toll from the ongoing conflict has risen to 37,296, with 85,197 others wounded, Hamas-run health authorities said in a press statement.Also on Saturday, Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a statement that eight Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers were killed in fighting in the southern Gaza Strip.In a separate statement, Adraee said the IDF forces are moving forward with defeating the military wing of Hamas and stripping its Rafah Brigade of its capabilities."The forces in the field daily kill many terrorists and destroy weapons, platforms, and rockets, thus preventing Hamas from returning to action against Israel as it was on Oct. 7," Adraee added.Since last Oct. 7, Israel has been waging a large-scale war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which has led to massive casualties and destruction of homes and infrastructure after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, which claimed the lives of about 1,200 Israelis.JERUSALEM -- The Israel Defense Forces announced on Saturday evening that its eight soldiers were killed in a blast in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah in the morning.MANILA -- The Philippines on Friday said Filipino sailors were among the crew on board a commercial ship attacked by Houthi militants in the Red Sea on June 12."The Philippine government will take all necessary measures to secure the safety and well-being of the Filipino crew on board and ensure justice. We call on all UN member states to protect the human rights of seafarers," said the Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).The DFA did not say how many Filipinos were on board, but Xinhua sources said over 20 Filipino crew members were working on the ship.Yemen's Houthi militants launched a boat-borne bomb attack on Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier MV Tutor in the Red Sea on Wednesday.Filipino sailors have been killed or abducted in Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. The rebels are still holding a number of the kidnapped victims.In April, the Philippines banned the deployment of Filipino seafarers on passenger and cruise ships transiting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden due to the risk of sailing in those regions.The Philippines is among the biggest suppliers of maritime labor in the world, providing almost one-fifth of the 1.2 million seafarers worldwide, according to the International Labor Organization.SANAA - Yemen's Houthi group on Thursday claimed responsibility for missile attacks against three ships in the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea."The first attack targeted the vessel Verbena in the Arabian Sea, causing damage and a fire on board," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a televised statement, adding the other two attacks struck Seaguardian and Athina ships in the Red Sea."All attacks were carried out with several ballistic and naval missiles and drones and achieved their goals successfully," he noted.Since last November, the Houthi group, which controls much of northern Yemen, has initiated the launch of anti-ship ballistic missiles and drones targeting what it said were Israeli-linked ships transiting the Red Sea, to show solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.In response, the U.S.-British naval coalition stationed in the area has since January conducted air raids and missile strikes against Houthi targets to deter the group, which, however, only led to an expansion of Houthi attacks to include U.S. and British commercial vessels and naval ships.Urgent actions are imperative to achieve an immediate, permanent cease-fire and to accelerate humanitarian aid delivery to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to a leaders' statement on Tuesday, as the conflict is triggering wider spillover effects in the region.The "Call for Action: Urgent Humanitarian Response for Gaza" conference in Sweimeh, Jordan, was co-organized by Jordan, Egypt and the United Nations on Tuesday to address the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, where about 1 million civilians are in hunger and forcibly displaced.The statement called for establishing an immediate, permanent cease-fire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and civilians who are being illegally held captive, demanding their safety, well-being and humane treatment in compliance with international law."We cannot abandon Gaza," King Abdullah II of Jordan said at the conference.The leaders expressed grave concerns at the enormous loss of life, the unprecedented civilian casualties and the unfolding man-made humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, caused by the continuing lack of humanitarian access to civilians in need, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs."Humanitarian aid to the Palestinians in Gaza is imperative", said Haoliang Xu, under-secretary-general and UNDP associate administrator, on behalf of UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner, as stated on the United Nations Development Programme website.In his remarks at the conference, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi welcomed the entry of sufficient and sustainable humanitarian aid into Gaza, as well as Resolution 2735 adopted on Monday by the UN Security Council.On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to Qatar for talks after Hamas submitted a response to a US-led proposal for a cease-fire.Blinken, on a four-country tour around the Middle East to push Hamas to accept the truce proposal, will meet the top leadership of Qatar, which has been in communication with the Palestinian militant group.Amendments proposedHamas, responding to the plan laid out late last month by the United States, proposed amendments late on Tuesday, including a ceasefire timeline and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, according to a source close to the talks.Egypt and Qatar said they had received Hamas' response, but did not disclose the content.Hamas' response to a proposed Gaza cease-fire deal "opens up a wide pathway" to reach an agreement, Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said on Wednesday.The movement's response is "responsible, serious and positive", al-Rishq added.The US said Israel accepted its proposal, but Israel has not publicly stated this. As Israel continues its assaults in central and southern Gaza that are among the bloodiest in the conflict, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said Israel would not commit to an end of its assault in Gaza before Hamas is eliminated.As the fate of a cease-fire hangs in the balance, Hezbollah fired a massive barrage of rockets into northern Israel on Wednesday to avenge the killing of a top commander, further escalating regional tensions.Hezbollah said it fired missiles and rockets at two military bases in retaliation for the killing of Taleb Sami Abdullah, 55. Known within Hezbollah as Hajj Abu Taleb, he is the most senior commander killed since the fighting began eight months ago.Hezbollah has traded fire with Israel nearly every day since the Israel-Hamas conflict began and says it will only stop if there is a truce in Gaza.As air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel, the military said about 160 projectiles were fired from southern Lebanon, making it one of the largest attacks since the fighting began. There were no immediate reports of casualties.Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story. KUWAIT CITY -- The death toll from a fire early Wednesday morning in a residential building in the Mangaf area, south of Kuwait City, rose to 49, according to a statement released by the Interior Ministry.Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah ordered an immediate investigation into the cause of the fire, and vowed to hold those responsible accountable, Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported.The emir, Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah Al-Khaled Al-Sabah, and Prime Minister Sheikh Ahmad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah have sent condolence messages to the families of the victims, the KUNA said.Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Al-Sabah, Kuwait's first deputy prime minister, defense minister, and interior minister, ordered the detention of individuals involved, including the building owner, until the forensic evidence team completes its investigation.He also instructed relevant government departments to inspect and address violations in the construction sector to avoid similar accidents.Local newspaper, citing anonymous sources, reported that the fire started in the guard's room, spread to a lounge on the first floor, followed by a storage area containing gas cylinders, and eventually engulfed the rest of the building. A large number of residents near the building had been evacuated.According to the sources, around 160 workers were inside the building, with many of the fatalities being of Indian nationality.JERUSALEM - About 160 rockets were fired from Lebanon at northern Israel on Wednesday morning, said the Israeli army, after Israeli airstrikes killed four Hezbollah officials, including a senior commander.The barrage marked the largest rocket attack by militants in Lebanon on Israel since the beginning of the new round of Israel-Hamas conflict on Oct 7, 2023.In the early morning, the military said approximately 90 projectiles were identified launched from Lebanon. The National Fire and Rescue Authority said that the rockets caused fires in several areas.Later in the morning, a barrage of some 70 rockets was fired toward Western Galilee and Mount Meron in Upper Galilee region, where a key aerial defense control unit is located."A number of the projectiles were intercepted, most of them fell in open areas, and several fell in a number of locations in northern Israel," the military said, adding that the details were still under review.So far, no injuries have been reported by the Israeli side.In response to the latest barrage, Israeli aircraft struck the launcher in the area of Yaroun.The Upper Galilee Regional Council called on residents to reduce outdoor activities to essential ones only, citing fear of additional barrages.With the United Nations Security Council adopting a resolution on Monday for a comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza, the international community is calling on Israel to urgently implement the consensus and halt the military campaign that is causing untold suffering to millions of besieged Palestinians.According to a statement published by WAFA news agency, the Palestinian presidency welcomed the adoption of Resolution 2735 by the UN Security Council, calling for an immediate and complete ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, as "a step in the right direction to stop the ongoing war of genocide against the Palestinian people".It also reiterated its call for the implementation of the two-state solution. Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour, who spoke to the media after the vote in New York, said Palestine is "determined with our friends to make a long-lasting, permanent cease-fire".On Tuesday, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri, who is based outside Gaza, said it accepted the cease-fire resolution and was ready to negotiate over the details.It is up to Washington to ensure that Israel abides by it, he added. He said Hamas accepted the formula stipulating the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a swap of hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel.Belal Alakhras, a political analyst and Palestinian researcher at the University of Malaya in Malaysia, told China Daily that the resolution endorsing a cease-fire in Gaza reflects the international consensus that "continuing the genocidal war is illegitimate and that restoring stability in the region is urgently needed".US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the fighting could "stop today if Hamas agrees to the deal now endorsed by the Security Council".But Reut Shapir Ben-Naftaly, political coordinator of the Israeli mission to the UN, said her country's goals have been "very clear "since Oct 7, namely to bring all Israeli hostages home and dismantle Hamas and its capabilities, ensuring that Gaza "does not pose a threat to Israel in the future".She also said Israel "will not engage in meaningless and endless negotiations which can be exploited by Hamas as a means to stall for time".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday following the rescue of four Israeli hostages that Israel would not relent "until we complete the mission and return all our hostages home, both the living and the deceased".Last week, Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich issued calls to "expand the war in Gaza" and to invade southern Lebanon.Turkiye welcomed the UNSC resolution as "an important step toward putting an end to the massacre", and lauded Hamas' "constructive and positive approach" to the cease-fire plan. "It is imperative that Israel announces its commitment to the implementation of a permanent cease-fire and fully implements all elements of the resolution," the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement.Alakhras noted that the US vetoed three cease-fire proposals while enabling Israel's conflict in Gaza for more than eight months, leading to unprecedented killing and destruction that impacted the entire region and swayed the US' and international public opinion.Dire need"This inconsistency highlights the world's dire need for a system not confined to one major power that can rapidly reverse course on matters of self-inflicted consequence. The priority now is implementing this resolution, though Palestinians seek guarantees that the war will truly end, while Israeli leaders publicly want to achieve all objectives of their total war," he said.Further, he said emerging powers on the Security Council "should take the initiative to promote stability proactively, not just react after massive lives and interests are impacted".In a social media post, Francesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the West Bank and Gaza, welcomed the cease-fire resolution, but shared what she called "some critical observations".She said the UNSC "cannot infringe people's right to self-determination" as it lacked the authority to determine who will or should rule over Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory, and underscored that only Palestinians will have to choose via "free and democratic elections".Agencies contributed to this story.DOHA/CAIRO - Qatar and Egypt have received a response from Hamas regarding the proposal for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, according to a statement by the Qatari Foreign Ministry on Tuesday.Hamas and other Palestinian factions responded Tuesday to "the most recent proposal for a ceasefire deal and the exchange of prisoners and detainees", it said.The two countries confirmed that they are mediating alongside the United States until an agreement is reached, but did not disclose details, according to the statement.The mediators "will examine the response and coordinate with the parties concerned regarding the next steps", it added.The Egyptian Foreign Ministry also announced on Tuesday that it had received a response of Hamas and the Palestinian factions to the latest ceasefire proposal and prisoners-detainees swap deal.In a joint statement sent to Xinhua, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Islamic Jihad said that a delegation from the two movements delivered the Palestinian factions' response on Tuesday to Qatar during a meeting with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, and the response was also delivered to the Egyptian side.The statement added that the response prioritizes the interests of the Palestinian people and emphasizes the necessity of completely stopping the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.It noted that the delegation expressed its readiness to engage positively to reach an agreement that would end this war against the Palestinian people.The submission of the response follows the adoption by the UN Security Council on Monday of an American draft resolution aiming to reach a comprehensive agreement for a three-phase ceasefire to end the war in Gaza.The resolution was adopted with 14 votes in favor and Russia abstaining. According to the resolution, the first phase includes an "immediate and complete ceasefire with the release of hostages and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners".The second phase will see a permanent cessation of hostilities "in exchange for the release of all other hostages still in Gaza and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza".In the third phase, a "major multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza" will begin, and the remains of any hostages who were killed and are still in Gaza will be returned to Israel.The resolution stated that Israel has "accepted" the agreement and "calls on" Hamas to do the same.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage. JERUSALEM -- An Israeli official said on Tuesday that Israel had received Hamas's response to the US-drafted proposal for a ceasefire-hostage release deal and the movement had rejected it, Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported.Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad said in a joint statement earlier in the day that they had delivered their response to the proposal to Qatari and Egyptian mediators, expressing a "willingness to deal positively in order to reach an agreement." They emphasized their priority of stopping the war in the Gaza Strip and ensuring the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory.Israel has yet to formally announce its position, although both US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had endorsed the proposal.White House spokesman John Kirby said the US had received Hamas's response and was evaluating it.As tensions rise on the Israel-Lebanon border, Iran hopes the situation can be de-escalated and there is no new full-blown war in the region, with Israel urged not to launch any actions that infringe on Lebanon's territorial integrity.Israel's actions have led to instability and insecurity in the region, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said at a press conference on June 10 in Teheran. The United Nations should take Israel's threats against Lebanon seriously, and any provocative actions that infringe on Lebanon's territorial integrity should be strongly condemned, Kanaani added.Israeli military have said they are ready for cross-border attacks while Lebanon resistance forces said they will counter possible Israeli offensives, according to local media.Mehran Kamrava, a professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar, said that Iran considers Hezbollah to be a strategic ally and Lebanon to be a part of Iran's strategic steps. Any attack to Lebanon from Israel might be detrimental to Iran's military and strategic objectives."As a result, Iran wants to ensure that the genocide in Gaza does not extend to Lebanon. That's why, for the various reasons, Iran doesn't want to see an expansion of the conflict and war to Lebanon," he added.The Israeli military said on June 10 that it has established a new battalion solely focused on operating the country's "Iron Dome" aerial defense system to better intercept the growing number of drones from Lebanon.Lebanese armed group Hezbollah said on June 10 that it shot down an Israeli drone over southern Lebanon. The Iran-backed group said in a statement that its fighters ambushed a Hermes 900 drone armed with missiles and targeted it with air defense weapons before the drone could carry out its attack, Xinhua News agency reported.A Lebanese military source told Xinhua that a surface-to-air missile launched from southern Lebanon struck an Israeli drone, causing it to catch fire before landing in the vicinity of al-Rehan mountain in Jezzine District, situated deep in southern Lebanon.Arhama Siddiqa, a Middle East analyst and research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan, said global protests and statements condemning Israel's actions are testament to their eroding legitimacy. The region teeters on the brink, unable to bear another full-scale conflict, she said."Any significant response from Hezbollah or other actors will likely come only after a consensus is reached among the various factions. The region is delicately balanced, and while a strategic response may occur to curb Israeli provocations, the broader aim remains to avoid an all-out conflict," Siddiqa told China Daily."The complex web of alliances and the potential for widespread destabilization act as significant deterrents against a full-blown war," she added.A social media user said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on June 11: "Israel shouldn't make its wish come true, because Lebanon is supposed to be a sovereign country. All-out war with Hezbollah would draw Iran into the conflict, then who knows which Arab countries might want to side with them."Earlier, on June 9, two members of Hezbollah were killed and three civilians injured on June 9 in Israeli airstrikes on Lebanese villages, Lebanese military sources said, according to Xinhua.Israel's widespread use of white phosphorus in south Lebanon on June 4 has put civilians at grave risk, contributing to civilian displacement, non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch said.Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story.JERUSALEM/GAZA — A key member of Israel's war cabinet quit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on Sunday, heaping domestic pressure on the Israeli leader as the conflict in Gaza rages.Benny Gantz, a former Israeli general and defense minister, announced his resignation from the emergency body after failing to get a postwar plan for Gaza approved by Netanyahu, which he demanded in May.Although his departure is not expected to bring down the government, it marks the first political blow to Netanyahu eight months into the Gaza assault against Palestinian Hamas militants."Netanyahu is preventing us from progressing to a real victory. That is why we are leaving the emergency government today with a heavy heart," Gantz said.Netanyahu responded within minutes, saying: "Benny, this is not the time to abandon the battle — this is the time to join forces."It came after Israeli special forces fought gunbattles with Palestinian militants over the weekend in central Gaza's crowded Nuseirat refugee camp area as they swooped in to free the four captives.The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said 274 people were killed and 698 wounded, in what it labeled the "Nuseirat massacre".Among those were at least 64 children, 57 women and 37 elderly people, the ministry said."People were screaming — young and old, women and men," said Nuseirat resident Muhannad Thabet, 35."Everyone wanted to flee the place, but the bombing was intense and anyone who moved was at risk of being killed due to the heavy bombardment and gunfire."Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh on Sunday condemned the "horrific massacre" in Nuseirat and insisted that "any agreement reached must include a permanent cessation of aggression, a complete withdrawal from the strip, an exchange deal and reconstruction".On Monday, Palestinian residents said tanks had been trying to thrust deeper toward the north in the early hours of Monday, edging Shaboura, one of the most densely populated and militant stronghold neighborhoods at the heart of the city.Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 37,124 people in Gaza, in response to Hamas' surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7, which has killed about 1,200 people.Domestic discontentAdding to the domestic discontent over Netanyahu's handling of the eight-month conflict, a senior military commander, Brigadier General Avi Rosenfeld, also resigned on Sunday over what he called his failure to prevent the Oct 7 attack.National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir demanded to join the war cabinet in place of Gantz.Netanyahu is also under growing pressure from his far-right coalition allies, who have threatened to quit the government if he goes ahead with a hostage release deal outlined by US President Joe Biden last month.Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have insisted that the government should not enter into any deal and continue the assault until the end goal of destroying Hamas has been achieved.A senior Hamas official urged the United States on Monday to pressure Israel to end the conflict in Gaza, ahead of a planned visit on Monday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the region to push forward cease-fire efforts."We call upon the US administration to put pressure on the occupation to stop the war on Gaza and the Hamas movement is ready to deal positively with any initiative that secures an end to the war," senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said.Blinken arrived in Egypt on Monday at the start of a regional tour to push for a much-awaited Gaza ceasefire. He also aims to ensure the conflict does not expand into Lebanon.Two members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah were killed and three civilians injured on Sunday in Israeli airstrikes on Lebanese villages, Xinhua reported, citing Lebanese military sources.In his eighth visit to the region since Oct 7, Blinken met Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo before heading to Jerusalem later on Monday to meet Netanyahu.Agencies—Xinhua GAZA -- The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) announced on Monday that it welcomes a resolution adopted by the UN Security Council earlier in the day aimed at reaching a comprehensive ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza.Hamas expressed in a statement its readiness to cooperate with the mediators to engage in indirect negotiations to implement resolution principles "that are consistent with the demands of our people and resistance," including a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces, prisoner-hostage exchange and reconstruction.The movement reiterated its commitment to continuing its "endeavor and struggle" for the Palestinian people's national rights.The Palestinian presidency hailed the adoption of the resolution as a step in the right direction to stop the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian News Agency WAFA reported.The Palestinian presidency also called on all parties to fulfill their responsibilities to implement the resolution.The UN Security Council on Monday adopted a resolution aimed at reaching a comprehensive ceasefire deal in three phases to end the war in Gaza.Adopted by a large majority with 14 votes in favor and Russia abstaining, the resolution also urges both parties to the conflict to fully implement the terms of the proposal "without delay and without condition."GAZA/CAIRO — Israeli forces pounded central Gaza anew on Sunday, a day after killing 274 Palestinians during a hostage rescue raid, and tanks advanced further into areas of Rafah in a bid to seal off part of the southern city, according to residents and Hamas media.Palestinians remained in shock over Saturday's death toll, the worst over a 24-hour period of the Palestine-Israel conflict for months that included many women and children, Palestinian medics said.In an update on Sunday, Gaza's Health Ministry said 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 were injured when Israeli special force commandos stormed into the densely populated Nuseirat refugee camp to rescue four hostages held since October by Hamas militants."My child was crying, afraid of the sound of the plane firing at us," Hadeel Radwan, 32, said, recounting how they fled the intense combat as she carried her 7-month-old daughter."We all felt that we wouldn't survive," she told Agence France-Presse, condemning "this brutal occupation that will not let us live".Israel's military said a special forces officer was killed in the exchange of fire with militants emerging from cover in residential blocks, and that it knew of "under 100" Palestinians killed, though not knowing how many of them were militants or civilians.Egypt condemned "with the strongest terms" Israel's attacks on the Nuseirat camp, with its Foreign Ministry calling it a "flagrant violation of all rules of international law".Jordan also condemned it.The rescued hostages were taken to hospital for medical checks and were in good health, the Israeli military said. They were all kidnapped during the attack by Hamas militants on Israeli towns and villages near Gaza on Oct 7, which precipitated the devastating offensive on Gaza.Hamas' raid killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities, and Israel's retaliatory bombardment and assault of Gaza has killed at least 37,084 Palestinians, Gaza's Health Ministry said on Sunday.Abu Ubaida, spokesperson for Hamas' armed al-Qassam Brigades, said some hostages were killed during the rescue operation."It's a blatant lie," Israeli military spokesman Peter Lerner told CNN, refuting the claim.On Sunday, three Palestinians were killed and several hurt in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Bureij in the central Gaza Strip, while tanks shelled parts of nearby Maghazi and Nuseirat. All are built-up, historical refugee camps. JERUSALEM -- Israel's centrist War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz announced on Sunday that he was resigning from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's emergency government and called for new elections. He accused Netanyahu of prioritizing narrow political considerations over the return of hostages and victory over Hamas.GAZA - The death toll in the Israeli military operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on Saturday has risen to 274, with 698 injured, Hamas-run health authorities said in a press statement on Sunday.The statement noted some victims remained under the rubble amid heavy bombardment and a lack of rescue crews.During the operation, Israeli forces rescued four hostages from the refugee camp, namely Noa Argamani, 25, Shlomi Ziv, 40, Almog Meir Jan, 21, and Andrey Kozlov, 27, all of them among the about 250 Israelis abducted last October by Hamas while attending the Nova festival, an outdoor music event, in a rural area near the Gaza-Israel fence.After the Hamas rampage, which killed about 1,200 according to Israeli tallies, Israel launched a retaliatory large-scale offensive in Gaza, which so far has killed 37,084 and injured 84,494 others, according to Gaza's health authorities.GAZA -- During its operation to release four hostages in the central Gaza Strip, the Israeli army had killed several other hostages held there, Hamas armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said on Saturday.In a statement, Al-Qassam denounced the Israeli military operation in the Nuseirat area in central Gaza as "a complex war crime," saying "the first to be harmed by it" were Israeli hostages."The operation will pose a great danger to the enemy's prisoners and will have a negative impact on their conditions and lives," Abu Obaida, spokesperson for Al-Qassam, said in the statement.At least 210 Palestinians were killed and more than 400 others injured in Israeli airstrikes on Saturday in central Gaza, where the Israeli forces rescued four hostages kidnapped by Hamas into the strip last October.The Israeli army, police, and intelligence body Shin Bet said in a joint statement that their fighters had attacked "a terrorist structure" in the region and freed four Israeli hostages.It noted that the kidnapped persons were rescued alive from two separate areas in the heart of Nuseirat.Following the rescue of the four, 120 Israeli hostages remain held in Gaza, including 43 feared dead, according to the Israeli army.Israel's attacks on central Gaza are the latest development of the deadly conflict between Israel and Gaza-ruling Hamas which began on Oct. 7, 2023, after Hamas militants stormed southern Israel from Gaza in a surprise attack, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to the Palestinian enclave.ISTANBUL -- The extraordinary meeting of foreign ministers of Developing 8 (D-8) countries held in Turkiye's Istanbul called on Saturday for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip."We demand an immediate, permanent, and unconditional ceasefire in Gaza and a halt to Israel's attacks on the Palestinian people," the ministers stated in a declaration after the meeting, Turkiye's state-run Anadolu news agency reported.The declaration noted that D-8 member states would offer unwavering support for Palestine's pursuit of full membership in the United Nations (UN) and its struggle for self-determination.At a press conference after the meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said D-8 countries will not remain silent in the face of Israeli atrocities in Gaza."We will work with all our strength to end the Israeli occupation and achieve the two-state solution," Fidan added.Advocating for the acceptance of Palestine's UN membership, the minister stressed that "Palestine's full membership in the UN is hindered by the US veto.As D-8 countries, we demand an immediate end to this injustice." D-8, established in 1997, is an organization for development cooperation among Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkiye. GAZA -- At least 210 Palestinians were killed and more than 400 others injured on Saturday by Israeli airstrikes in the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said. JERUSALEM -- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Saturday said that it rescued four Israeli hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas in the Gaza Strip on Oct 7, 2023.The four, Noa Argamani, Shlomi Ziv, Almog Meir Jan, and Andrey Kozlov, were located in two places in the center of Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp, in proper medical condition.The IDF conducted the operation with the Israel Security Agency and a police elite unit. GAZA -- At least 55 Palestinians were killed and dozens of others injured on Saturday in Israeli airstrikes on the Nuseirat camp and some other areas in the central Gaza Strip, according to medical sources.Khalil Al-Dakran, director of Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, told Xinhua that a large number of wounded Palestinians were sent to the hospital due to the intense Israeli bombing on the Nuseirat camp and the city of Deir Al-Balah, some of whom have been confirmed dead.Wounded Palestinians were still being sent in, overwhelming the hospital amid a severe shortage of beds, medicines, medical consumables, and fuel to run the main emergency generator, said Al-Dakran.Palestinian eyewitnesses told Xinhua that Israeli aircraft targeted the area with intensive firepower, and local civil defense and ambulances were unable to reach some injured people in time.Meanwhile, Palestinian security sources said deadly clashes broke out on the ground between Palestinian militants and Israeli troops raiding the Nuseirat camp under the cover of artillery and aerial bombardment.The Israeli army, police, and intelligence body Shin Bet said in a joint statement that "our forces are attacking a terrorist structure" in the region and freed four Israeli hostages.It noted that the kidnapped persons were rescued by Shin Bet fighters and the Special Police Unit from two separate areas in the heart of Nuseirat.The statement confirmed that the health condition of the hostages was good, and they were transferred for medical examinations to Tel Hashomer Hospital in Israel.JERUSALEM - Israel's General of the Northern Command Ori Gordin said Thursday that the deployment for a major offensive against Hezbollah has been "completed".Speaking in a ceremony to mark 18 years of the 2006 Lebanon War, which was fought between Israel and Hezbollah, mainly on Lebanese soil, Gordin said that the army's mission is "returning security to northern Israel"."We don't have a choice but to continue the fight until achieving this mission," he said, adding that the preparations were completed over the past week.Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire along the Israel-Lebanon border since Oct 7, 2023, but Israel has threatened to launch a full-fledged war against Hezbollah if calm is not restored.SANAA - The Houthi group in Yemen said it carried out two joint operations on Thursday with Iraq's Islamic resistance groups targeting the port of Haifa in Israel.GAZA -- At least 35 Palestinians were killed and dozens of others injured in an Israeli air strike targeting a school housing displaced people in the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, the Palestinian official news agency WAFA reported on Thursday.An Israeli fighter jet bombed at least three classrooms with several missiles, medical sources told Xinhua.Hamas-run media office in Gaza condemned Israel's attack on the school as a "terrible massacre" in a statement, calling it "clear evidence of the crime of genocide committed against civilians."The office said that Israel and the United States "should bear full responsibility for these crimes that endanger humanity and violate international law."Israel Defense Forces attacked a Hamas compound inside a school in the Nuseirat area during the night, eliminating many saboteurs who participated in an attack on Oct. 7, 2023, said Avichay Adraee, Israeli military spokesperson, in a statement on Thursday.The International Labour Organization (ILO) said that economic activity in all regions has returned — in varying degrees — to levels seen during the pre-pandemic period, but warned that some crises, like the Gaza conflict, could jeopardize these gains.This was revealed by ILO Director-General Gilbert F. Houngbo during his opening address at the 112th International Labour Conference (ILC) in Geneva, Switzerland, on June 3. In his speech, he expressed "ambivalence" where "we are making remarkable, positive and encouraging progress", but also "facing a never-ending chain of challenges and crises".Houngbo noted that global macroeconomic prospects were "stable", citing the International Monetary Fund's growth forecast in global gross domestic product (GDP) of 3.2 percent in 2024 and 2025.He lauded the "effective action taken by central banks" to bring inflation under control, which has also made a positive contribution to the global economy."In this sense, the surges in inflation should abate, with inflation decreasing from 5.8 percent in 2024 to 4.4 percent in 2025. I sincerely hope that this could relieve the purchasing power of workers, which has been badly affected," said Houngbo.As regards the labor market, Houngbo said the ILO is forecasting a global unemployment rate of 4.9 percent in 2024 and 2025, which was a slight fall in relation to 2023, when it stood at 5 percent. It is also a downward revision of the previous forecast of 5.2 percent, which was made in November 2023. The unemployment rate of 4.9 percent translates to "a total of 183 million unemployed persons throughout the world".As he warned of the challenges, the ILO chief cited the conflicts in Yemen, Sudan, Ukraine, among others, but said the "appalling situation in the Middle East" – referring to Gaza – has "added to the existing crises" as the global sources of tension "have intensified"."The absolutely awful conflicts in Gaza", Houngbo said, continued to be major problems for humanity and more especially for multilateralism.In a report published by the United Nations Development Programme in May, titled "Gaza war: expected socioeconomic impacts on the State of Palestine", it noted that the unemployment rate in the occupied Palestinian territories (Gaza, East Jerusalem and West Bank) is estimated to have reached 46.1 percent "after six months of war, compared to 25.7 percent before the war", and could get worse by the ninth month.Further, the report, citing the ILO, stated that 160,000 workers from the West Bank have either lost their jobs in Israel and the settlements, at least temporarily, or are at risk of losing them as a result of restrictions imposed on Palestinians' access to the Israeli labor market and the closures of crossings from the West Bank into Israel and the settlements."Only 8,000 temporary permits have been issued by Israel for workers from the West Bank since the current war began," the report stated.The report also noted before the conflict, Gaza was already grappling with a "hyper-unemployment" rate of 45 percent, with youth unemployment at nearly 62.6 percent in 2022. The freeze of work permits in Israel and the destruction of physical assets, personal injuries, internal displacement, and the halt of economic activity have compounded the situation.The ILO estimated as of January this year, 507,000 jobs had been lost across the occupied Palestinian territory. This included 201,000 jobs lost in Gaza, with an estimated loss of 12.3 million new Israeli shekels ($3.3 million) in total daily labor income.But as the conflict marks its eighth month, several international humanitarian organizations have witnessed the collapse of Gaza's infrastructure, including its healthcare system as the International Rescue Committee noted that "100 percent of the Gazans" are currently facing a crisis level of food insecurity — the highest share ever classified for "any area or country".The group cited Israel's blockade of food, water, fuel and essential medicines and supplies that is "inflicting immense suffering on Palestinians". Forced displacement had already pushed over a million people away from Rafah, according to the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency on June 3.In May, more than 50 international rights groups called for an official declaration of famine in Gaza, blaming Israel's alleged use of starvation as a "weapon", which contravenes international law.Israelis and Palestinians have been locked in heavy combat since Oct 7 last year after a rampage by Palestinian militant group Hamas inside Israel killed 1,200 people, and more than 200 people were taken hostages. Eight months of Israeli retaliation have left the Gaza Strip in ruins and at least 36,000 Palestinians dead.The ILO annual conference brings together worker, employer, and government delegates from 187-member states to address a wide range of issues that have a long-term impact on the world of work.jan@chinadailyapac.comA group of United Nations experts have called for global recognition of a Palestinian state, reiterating that a two-state solution remains the only internationally agreed path to lasting peace. Their appeal came as some countries expressed support for the latest US-initiated Gaza cease-fire plan.Over a dozen UN experts — including UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese — issued a news release on Monday.The statement said recognition of a Palestinian state "was an important acknowledgment of the rights of the Palestinian people and their struggles and suffering toward freedom and independence".This is a precondition for lasting peace in Palestine and the entire Middle East — beginning with the immediate declaration of a ceasefire in Gaza and no further military incursions into Rafah, the experts said, noting that 146 UN member states now recognize the State of Palestine, Xinhua reported."A two-state solution remains the only internationally agreed path to peace and security for both Palestine and Israel and a way out of generational cycles of violence and resentment," said the UN experts.Norway, Ireland and Spain made a coordinated announcement on May 22, declaring their recognition of Palestine as a state effective as of May 28.Israel has continued with its offensive in Gaza, where Al Jazeera reported on Tuesday that 45 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours.Meanwhile, the Gaza media office announced that more than 3,500 children under the age of 5 in the Palestinian enclave were at risk of death, blaming Israel for its alleged starvation policy.The foreign ministers of Egypt, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates on Monday underscored the importance of dealing with the US-authored cease-fire proposal "seriously and positively" as they reiterated that achieving the two-state solution is the only way to ensure security and peace in the entire region.Omar Awadallah, head of the UN organizations department in the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, told China Daily that a multilateral world where countries can live together is becoming an example.Awadallah said talks between Chinese and Arab leaders at the 10th ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing in May set a new example of a relationship based on a shared future.International consensusHe noted that the international consensus on the Palestinian question is the two-state solution "based on international law, based on ending the Israeli occupation".Bringing peace, stability, and security to the region needs one thing, Awadallah said. "That means the establishment and materializing the State of Palestine and the independence of Palestine, without the Israeli occupation based on the 1967 border, and with the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination."On May 10, the UN General Assembly adopted a historic resolution, which saw 143 votes in favor of the Palestinian bid to become a full UN member, with nine voting against, including the US and Israel, and 25 members abstaining, including the United Kingdom.The US had vetoed a similar move at the UN Security Council on April 18.In the latest US-backed peace proposal, President Joe Biden announced a three-phase plan between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday.The offer calls for a cease-fire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the reconstruction of Gaza.Israel's continued offensives killed at least 36,550 people in Gaza, in response to Hamas' surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people.Militants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, Agence France-Presse reported.Four more hostages were declared dead by the Israeli military on Monday.Hundreds of people, including relatives of the captives, gathered outside Israel's Defense Ministry and military headquarters in central Tel Aviv late on Monday, calling for a peace deal. Smaller protests also took place across the country.Ayman Talal Yousef, a professor of international relations at the Arab American University in Jenin in the West Bank, noted that the Biden administration's cease-fire proposal was also aimed "to neutralize the pressures being exercised internally on the Biden administration itself"."There is a growing anger among many people within the Democratic Party regarding the policies and decisions taken by the Biden administration to resolve this conflict and to end atrocities and aggression exercised by Israel in Gaza," Yousef told China Daily."The US public opinion is also changing in favor of the Palestinian narrative," he said.Yousef noted that those now speaking up in the US include "large segments of the public, mainly university students, intellectuals, media, and civil society organizations".Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story.SANAA -- The US Navy said late Tuesday that the Yemeni Houthi group launched two anti-ship ballistic missiles into the Red Sea in the past 24 hours."In the past 24 hours, Iranian-backed Houthis launched two anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM) from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen into the Red Sea. There were no injuries or damage reported by the US, coalition, or commercial ships," the US Central Command said on X."This continued malign and reckless behavior by the Iranian-backed Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden," it said.The Houthi group, which controls much of northern Yemen, began last November to launch anti-ship ballistic missiles and drones targeting what they said were Israeli-linked ships transiting the Red Sea to show solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.In response, the US-British naval coalition stationed in the waters since January has conducted air raids and missile strikes against Houthi targets to deter the group, but this only led to an expansion of Houthi attacks to include US and British commercial vessels and naval ships. GAZA/JERUSALEM -- Israeli fighter jets targeted Hamas positions in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, with ground forces simultaneously operating in the area based on intelligence, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on Tuesday.In a separate statement, Adraee reported that Israeli forces conducted a "precise raid operation" in Gaza City's Sabra neighborhood last week, discovering rocket warheads hidden in bags belonging to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The UN agency, which plays a critical role in providing humanitarian aid in Gaza, has not commented on the Israeli claims.Adraee also announced the completion of the destruction of a 1.5-kilometer-long and 23-meter-deep underground tunnel on Monday. The tunnel, used by Hamas, bypassed areas where Israeli forces are stationed. The exact location of the tunnel was not disclosed.On May 7, the Israeli military expanded its operations in Rafah, directing over 1.5 million Palestinians to move to Khan Younis and other central Gaza areas. The UNRWA estimates that these areas now shelter approximately 1.7 million people.Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation for the group's October assault on southern Israel, which resulted in around 1,200 deaths and over 200 hostages taken.RAFAH/JERUSALEM — Fresh strikes were reported across the Gaza Strip overnight into Monday, as doubts were growing about a plan for a Gaza cease-fire and hostage release deal outlined by the United States.US President Joe Biden on Friday presented what he labeled an Israeli three-phase plan that would end the conflict, free all hostages and the reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian territory.Israeli media have questioned to what extent Biden's speech and some crucial details were coordinated with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's team, including how long any truce would hold and how many captives would be freed when.Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir accused Netanyahu on Monday of trying to "whitewash" the deal to wind down the Gaza assault and repeated a threat to quit the government.Mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States said they called "on both Hamas and Israel to finalize the agreement".White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Sunday that "we have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal … that Israel would say yes".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken "commended" Israel on the plan in a phone call with War Cabinet member Benny Gantz and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the State Department said.Hamas has said it "views positively" the deal while the Palestinian National Liberation Movement on Sunday expressed its hope that the proposal will end Israeli aggression in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.But the bombardments and combat show no sign of easing, with the conflict soon entering its ninth month.On Monday, the Israeli military said over the past day its forces had struck "over 50 targets in the Gaza Strip".Fighting has continued to rock Gaza, with hospitals there reporting at least 19 killed in overnight strikes into Monday morning.Airstrikes and shelling were reported in Gaza City as well as in Rafah.Crossing reopening talksEgyptian state-linked Al-Qahera News said a Sunday meeting in Cairo with Israeli and US officials to discuss reopening the crossing had ended, without saying whether an agreement was reached.Quoting a senior official, Al-Qahera said Egypt reiterated its demand that "Israel withdraw from the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing so it can resume operations".The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said Sunday that all 36 of its shelters in Rafah "are now empty" after at least a million people fled the city.Adding to the region's tension, Israeli airstrikes after midnight Monday killed 12 pro-Iranian militias in Syria's northern province of Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.The attack hit several sites in the countryside of Aleppo. Several explosions were heard across the area.Meanwhile, the Maldives government will ban Israelis from the Indian Ocean archipelago, the office of the president said on Sunday, announcing a national rally in "solidarity with Palestine".Israel's Foreign Ministry said in response that the ministry recommends Israelis avoid any travel to the Maldives, including those with foreign passports, and those currently there to consider leaving.Agencies - Xinhua CAIRO -- The foreign ministers of Egypt, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Monday stressed the importance of dealing seriously and positively with the US President's proposal leading to a deal that guarantees a permanent ceasefire and the adequate delivery of aid to the Gaza Strip.In a joint statement issued after a virtual meeting, the foreign ministers of the five Arab countries said they had discussed developments in the mediation efforts undertaken by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States that will lead to a permanent ceasefire, the release of hostages and detainees, and the adequate entry of aid into Gaza.The foreign ministers of Jordan, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia affirmed their support for the mediation efforts, according to a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry.The ministers also highlighted the need to stop the aggression against Gaza and end the humanitarian catastrophe it has triggered, the return of the displaced to their homes, and the complete withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from the Gaza Strip.They reaffirmed that achieving the two-state solution is the only way to achieve security and peace for the entire region, and to this end, implementing relevant UN Security Council resolutions with clear timelines and binding guarantees.The international community has slammed Israel's plan to designate the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA, as a "terrorist organization", calling the proposal "outrageous" and warning that it would have "terrible consequences" in worsening the already dire situation in Gaza.The Knesset, the unicameral parliament of Israel, on May 29 passed a preliminary reading of a bill designating UNRWA a terrorist organization. The bill will abolish immunity and privileges for UNRWA personnel, the Jerusalem Post reported.Further, if the bill passes the final reading, the Anti-Terrorism Law will also apply to UNRWA, enabling Israel to cease all ties with the UN agency, and leading to closure of the humanitarian agency's operations in Israeli territory.Mohammad Abualrob, director of the Palestinian Government Communications Center in the West Bank, told China Daily that Israel's allegations against UNRWA "are fundamentally baseless"."Most donor countries supporting UNRWA have resumed their funding after recognizing the inaccuracy of Israel's claims. However, the Israeli Knesset's vote to designate the UN agency as a 'terrorist organization' will undoubtedly impact its operations in the Palestinian territories," said Abualrob.This designation, he said, would affect the entry of UNRWA's foreign staff into Palestine, as "their access is controlled through Israeli crossing points"."It will also hinder the agency's ability to pay salaries to its staff, procure aid, and distribute it to the 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem who rely on this support," he added.Christopher Lockyear, secretary general of Medicins Sans Frontieres International (MSF), said in a statement that the bill is an "outrageous attack on humanitarian assistance" and an act of collective punishment against the Palestinian people."Not only is humanitarian aid being obstructed, but if the bill passes a final reading, it will also be criminalized under Israel's Anti-Terrorism Law, in contradiction with international humanitarian law," said Lockyear.He said it would have terrible consequences as it could amount to a "free license" to attack UNRWA facilities and its humanitarian personnel, and would further endanger civilians seeking the protection of the UN agency.The MSF urged Israel's allies, which "are all members of the UN", to "stop the bloodshed" and "stand against this move to criminalize humanitarian assistance and ensure that UNRWA can continue its essential work".Saudi Arabia and Qatar condemned the Israeli parliament's move, with the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying in a statement that such classification "aims to lift the diplomatic immunity of UNRWA employees who are doing their duty to alleviate the severity of the humanitarian catastrophe that the Palestinian people are going through"."The Kingdom stresses that Israel, as an occupying state, must abide by international humanitarian law and stop obstructing the work of international organizations," the Saudi ministry said.Qatar's foreign ministry said in a statement that attempting to classify the UNRWA as a terrorist organization is "an extension of the systematic campaign aimed at dismantling the agency" at a time when the need for its humanitarian services is dire "due to the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip"."The Ministry of Foreign Affairs renews the State of Qatar's call for the international community to stand firmly in the face of Israeli plans aimed at liquidating the agency and depriving millions of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon of its necessary services," the statement said.Also weighing in was the European Union, which said it was deeply concerned about the terrorist designation and the Israeli Land Authority ordering UNRWA to vacate its East Jerusalem premises within the next 30 days."We recall the crucial and irreplaceable role of UNRWA in the humanitarian response in Gaza. UNRWA provides vital services to millions of people in Gaza, the West Bank, as well as across the region, including in Lebanon and Jordan," the EU said in a statement on May 31."The EU is a firm supporter of the United Nations, and the multilateral and rules based global governance system, of which UNRWA, as a UN agency, is a part. We urge the Israeli authorities to allow UNRWA to continue carrying out its crucial work in line with its mandate," it added.Last month, the International Crisis Group designated Gaza as "currently the most dangerous place for aid workers in the world". This was after the Aid Worker Security Database (AWDS) - a platform that tracks attacks on aid workers globally - documented a staggering 308 incidents that targeted aid workers in Gaza, causing 234 deaths since Oct 7 last year.DAMASCUS - Israeli airstrikes after midnight Monday killed 12 pro-Iranian militias in Syria's northern province of Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.The militias, consisting of Syrian and non-Syrian nationals, have a significant presence in the area surrounding the city of Aleppo, it said.The attack hit several sites in the countryside of Aleppo, mainly in the town of Hayyan northwest of Aleppo. Several explosions were heard across the city.The observatory noted that the attack comes as part of an escalation of Israeli attacks on positions held by the Lebanese Hezbollah and Iranian militias in Syria since last month.Meanwhile, the Syrian Defense Ministry confirmed that several individuals were killed in the Israeli aggression targeting points near Aleppo.DAMASCUS -- Israeli missiles struck areas in the countryside of the northern Syrian city of Aleppo after midnight Monday, local media and activists said.The attack hit several sites in the countryside of Aleppo, mainly in the town of Hayyan northwest of Aleppo.

Eisenhower, another US warship and four commercial cargo vessels in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea.That marks the group's second strike against Dwight D. Eisenhower in less than 24 hours, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said.There was no immediate comment from the US Navy or the targeted shipping companies.Sarea vowed further attacks until "Israel stops its war and blockade against the Palestinians in Gaza".Agencies—Xinhua JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Saturday that he accepted the invitation to address a joint meeting of the US Congress in Washington.In a statement, the Israeli prime minister said he plans to speak to both Houses of Congress and "present the truth" about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The Israeli prime minister was invited on Friday in a letter signed by the leaders of the US Senate and House of Representatives.Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported that Netanyahu's speech in Washington is expected to take place within the next eight weeks.Meanwhile, the channel also reported that Israel and Egypt have agreed on reopening the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip to transfer humanitarian aid to the Strip.The television reported that Israel has told Egypt that it is ready to withdraw the military forces from the crossing and station them in a more distant location under "operational considerations." DOHA -- Qatar, the United States, and Egypt have jointly called on Hamas and Israel to finalize an agreement based on the principles of a US proposal, according to a statement from the Qatari foreign ministry on Saturday.The three countries jointly call on both Hamas and Israel to do so "as mediators in the ongoing discussions to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages and detainees.""These principles brought the demands of all parties together in a deal that serves multiple interests and will bring immediate relief both to the long-suffering people of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families," the statement said."This deal offers a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and ending the crisis," it added.US President Joe Biden delivered a speech on Friday, in which he revealed a three-phase Israeli proposal that would lead to an end to the ongoing Gaza conflict and the release of all hostages.CAIRO -- Officials from Egypt, Israel and the United States are scheduled to hold a meeting on Sunday in Cairo to discuss the reopening of the Rafah crossing in Gaza, Egypt's Al-Qahera News TV channel reported.China and Arab states have adopted a joint declaration calling for a cease-fire in Gaza as soon as possible as well as a "comprehensive, just and lasting" solution to the Palestine question amid ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza.In the joint declaration on the Palestine question released on Friday, one day after the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum was held in Beijing, both sides condemned Israel's attacks on Gaza.They also condemned Israel's military offensive in Rafah, a city on the southwestern border of Gaza, days after an Israeli airstrike reportedly killed more than 40 people at a camp for displaced Palestinians in the area.This round of the Palestine-Israel issue has dragged on for nearly eight months. Gaza has seen as many as 125,000 casualties of Palestinian civilians, most of whom are women and children, according to the joint declaration.Palestinians in Gaza are subject to "fatal famines and blockades", and Israel is responsible for the humanitarian plight there, it said.Both China and Arab states said they oppose the implementation of any plan, intention and behavior forcing Palestinian people to move from their land.They urged the United Nations Security Council to adopt resolutions that are more binding to achieve an immediate, comprehensive and lasting cease-fire, stop the forced migration of Palestinian people and guarantee the provision of rescue supplies to Gaza.Niu Xinchun, executive director of the China-Arab Research Institute of Ningxia University, said the joint declaration reflects the consistent position shared by China and Arab states over the conflict in Gaza.The international community has been concerned by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Niu said, adding that "an unconditional ceasefire is the most important way" to solve the crisis."China is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a major country, while the Arab world is among the most influential external forces over the Gaza conflict," Niu said. Such a joint declaration will serve to place "great pressure on Israel", thus helping to promote a cease-fire, he said.In the declaration, both sides voiced their support for Palestine becoming an official member state of the UN, and condemned the United States for using its veto power to stop it from becoming a UN member state.They also welcomed the recent trend in which many countries have recognized as the State of Palestine, and urged countries that haven't made the recognition to do so as soon as possible.Norway, Spain and Ireland formally recognized the State of Palestine on Tuesday, less than three weeks after the UN General Assembly convened an emergency special session and overwhelmingly adopted a resolution urging the Security Council to reconsider Palestine's full UN membership.The two-state solution is receiving increasingly extensive support in the world, Niu said, adding that more than 140 of the 193 UN member states have recognized Palestine as a sovereign state.China stands on the side of justice by always calling for an implementation of the two-state solution and decrying all forms of violence against civilians, he said.The country has played "a leading role" in the international community's efforts to promote an immediate cease-fire in Gaza by making its voice heard at many multilateral and bilateral occasions, including in the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council and BRICS summits, Niu added. JERUSALEM/GAZA -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has authorized the Israeli negotiation team to present an outline for the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, according to a statement by Netanyahu's office on Friday.The statement was issued following U.S. President Joe Biden's speech, in which Biden revealed a three-phase Israeli proposal that would lead to an end to the ongoing Gaza conflict and the release of all hostages."The Israeli government is united in the will to return our hostages as soon as possible and is working to achieve this goal," the Israeli statement said.It added that "the prime minister authorized the negotiation team to present an outline for achieving this goal while insisting that the war will not end until all of its goals are achieved, including the return of all our hostages and the elimination of Hamas' military and governmental capabilities."The statement noted that the outline, including the "conditional transition from phase to phase," allows Israel to "maintain these principles."According to Biden, the first phase of the Israeli proposal includes a six-week "complete" ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli military forces from populated areas of Gaza, and the release of women, the elderly and the wounded being held hostage in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.At the same time, the Palestinian civilians will return to their homes and neighborhoods in "all areas of Gaza," including in the north, and 600 aid trucks will enter the enclave daily, according to the U.S. president.During the first phase, the second phase will be discussed, and terms of a permanent end to hostilities will be negotiated. Biden said the six-week ceasefire will last as long as negotiations continue.In the second phase, all living hostages will be released, and the temporary ceasefire will become permanent, while the third phase will see the return of the bodies of the deceased hostages to their families and the start of a major reconstruction plan in Gaza.In his remarks on Friday, Biden also noted that the Israeli proposal had been transmitted by Qatar to Hamas.On Friday night, Hamas, in response, confirmed its readiness to deal positively and in a constructive manner with any proposal for a permanent ceasefire.The Gaza-ruling Palestinian faction said in a statement that it held a positive view of Biden's speech while stressing that the truce proposal should be based on the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the reconstruction of the strip, and the return of the displaced to their places, along with the fulfillment of a genuine prisoner swap deal if Israel clearly announces commitment to such deal."They understand us and know what's the solution for us, giving us more resilience," said Palestinian Ambassador to China Fariz Mehdawi, sharing his takeaway with China Daily reporter Peng Yixuan during the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, adding, "these days are very, very tough".GAZA - The Israeli army has withdrawn from the Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip after nearly three weeks of military operation there, Palestine TV reported on Friday.The civil defense agency in Gaza said that rescuers found a large number of bodies in the area from which the Israeli army has withdrawn, and the search and rescue work is still ongoing.The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 36,224, according to a statement released by health authorities in the Palestinian enclave on Thursday. GAZA -- Hamas announced on Thursday that it has informed mediators of its readiness to reach a "full agreement," including a comprehensive hostages-prisoners exchange deal, if Israel stops its war in the Gaza Strip, according to a statement from the Gaza-ruling Palestinian faction.Hamas said it has showed flexibility and positivity in response to the efforts of the mediators throughout all previous indirect negotiating rounds, but Israel used these negotiations "as a cover for the continuation of aggression" against the Palestinian people, citing military operations in Rafah and seizure of the crossing as evidence.Hamas and other Palestinian factions will not accept to be part of this policy by continuing negotiations in light of "aggression, killing, siege, starvation and genocide of our people," it added.Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported on Tuesday that Israel had handed over a document with the Israeli proposal to Qatar and Egypt to resume negotiations for the exchange of detainees with Hamas and a ceasefire in Gaza.The last round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, hosted by Egypt for two days earlier this month, stalled after the Israeli attack on Rafah city in southern Gaza Strip.Hamas's inclination to seek an agreement came amid continued fighting in Rafah city despite international condemnations of the Israeli attack.Israel launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct. 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage.TEHRAN - Registration for Iran's 14th presidential election began on Thursday morning under the directive of Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi.The registration process will continue for five days until June 3, and those who want to be candidates must come to the Iranian Interior Ministry in Tehran to submit their registrations, according to a statement published on the ministry's website.Vahidi stated that the vetting process would take seven days, starting from June 4, after which qualified candidates would have 14 days to conduct their electoral campaigns. The election is scheduled for June 28.Iran's Election Headquarters issued a statement on Sunday specifying the conditions and qualifications required for candidacy. Candidates must be between 40 and 75 years old, of Iranian origin, hold Iranian nationality, and have a good track record and reputation. They must also be committed to Iran's principles and the official religion, Islam.Additionally, candidates must possess at least a master's degree and have a minimum of four years of experience in senior official, state, managerial, or military positions. They must also be in good health and have the necessary capabilities to perform presidential duties.The 14th presidential election was originally slated for 2025 but was moved earlier due to the unexpected death of President Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage in a helicopter crash on May 19 in the northwestern province of East Azarbaijan.According to Article 131 of Iran's Constitution, the first vice president assumes the executive role if the president is unable to perform duties. The interim president, currently Mohammad Mokhber, is required to organize a new presidential election within a maximum of 50 days.People in the Iranian holy city of Mashhad held a ceremony to mark the first week since the deaths of president Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage.The ceremony took place at the holy shrine of the eighth Shia imam where the late president was laid to rest last week, according to Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). A group of top Iranian officials also attended the ceremony on Wednesday.Raisi and his companions lost their lives on May 19 when their helicopter crashed in mountains of Varzaqan region, in the northwestern province of East Azarbaijan. The president and his accompanying team were heading to the provincial capital Tabriz from a border area where Raisi and his companions had inaugurated a joint dam project. Raisi was buried at the shrine of Imam Reza – the eighth Imam of Shia Muslims – in northeast Iran on May 23.On the same day of the ceremony, the General Staff of Iran's Armed Forces released the second report into the helicopter crash of president Raisi. No evidence of sabotage or cyberattack is found behind the crash, according to the report."The occurrence of an explosion as a result of an act of sabotage during the flight and moments before the helicopter crashed into the mountain is ruled out", the report said. "Also, no signs of an act of electronic warfare was detected on the helicopter."There were no signs of any cyberattack carried out against the presidential helicopter, the report said. Additionally, investigators carefully examined the vast majority of the documents related to the maintenance of the helicopter and found no issue that could have played a role in the accident.Such findings have successfully helped allay the various speculations and doubts that had previously suggested Raisi and his companions may have been deliberately targeted.The investigation found that the helicopter's capacity in terms of the maximum standard load it could carry at the point of take-off, and throughout the flight path and the return route, was within the "permissible limit", according to Mehr News Agency, another Iranian media organization.The military investigators also ruled out any disruption in the communication system or frequency interference with the helicopter. They revealed that during the flight and up to 69 seconds before the crash, contact with the aircraft had been maintained on the specified frequencies, Mehr reported.The recorded conversations between the flight crew show that the last contact with the pilots up to the time of the incident and when they stopped responding lasted 69 seconds, and no emergency declaration was recorded during that time.The General Staff, which issued its preliminary report on the incident on May 24, said the investigation will continue until the main cause of the crash is determined and the results will be made public, according to the IRNA report.Meanwhile, the Islamic City Council of Teheran decided to rename a long section of the Be'sat Highway in south of the city and a section of East Pasteur Street in central city after Raisi.The Koushk-e Mesri Street in downtown Tehran, where the Iranian Foreign Ministry is located, will be renamed after late foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, it said on Tuesday.Mike Gu in Hong Kong and agencies contributed to this report.TEHRAN - Iran on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of a sabotage explosion leading to the helicopter crash that resulted in the deaths of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage, local media reported.The General Staff of Iran's Armed Forces released the second report on the causes of the helicopter crash on Wednesday, the official news agency IRNA reported.The report said given the results of the tests on the helicopter's wreckage and remaining parts and the way the remains had been scattered at the scene of the incident as well as their distance from the fuselage, the possibility of an explosion caused by an act of sabotage during the flight or moments before the chopper's crash into the mountain was dismissed.No sign of an act of electronic warfare was detected on the crashed helicopter, it said, adding that the weather conditions on the way back to Tabriz, the capital of East Azerbaijan province, would need further investigations.According to the report, the total weight of the passengers and equipment onboard was proportionate to the helicopter's maximum load limit at the time of takeoff and during the flight.In addition, during the flight and until 69 seconds before the incident's occurrence, contact had been maintained with the crashed helicopter's flight crew on the specified frequencies, which dismisses the possibility of any disruption in the communication system or frequency interference.The first report of the investigation committee of the General Staff of Iran's Armed Forces was released on May 23.Questions are being asked on how many deaths it would take to make the United States change its policy of backing Israel amid increasing outcry over the traumatic civilian deaths in Israel's bombing of the Rafah "safe zone".Recent deaths in Rafah have tested US President Joe Biden's promise to withhold weapons from Israel if a major assault on Rafah would put displaced people there at risk.The Biden administration said on Tuesday it was closely monitoring the probe into a deadly Israeli airstrike it called "tragic", but that the recent deaths in Rafah did not constitute a major ground operation that crosses any US red lines."The Israelis have said this is a tragic mistake," US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters at the White House, when asked about whether the events over the weekend qualified as the type of "death and destruction" US officials have warned could result in the withholding of more aid to Israel.The US does not have "a measuring stick here or a quota", Kirby said.When asked whether Israel's strikes could put Biden in a difficult position, Kirby told reporters that there was a real danger instead that Israel could become further isolated from the international community with the manner in which it is conducting operations.Israel, ignoring international voices and disregarding the order of the International Court of Justice, has rolled more tanks into the heart of Rafah and prepared more ground troops after the United Nations Security Council emergency meeting on Tuesday.Speaking at a ceremonial event in Washington, US Vice-President Kamala Harris said "the word tragic doesn't even begin to describe" the Israeli strike that killed 45 people.Harris' remark, in response to a reporter's question, also followed an Israeli tank shelling of a camp in an evacuation area west of Rafah that killed at least 21 people on Tuesday.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Wednesday that China is gravely concerned over Israel's military operation in Rafah.Concerns expressed"We strongly call on Israel to listen to the overwhelming appeal from the international community and stop pushing ahead its offensive in Rafah," Mao said at a regular news briefing.Noting that the latest round of the Palestine-Israel conflict has made the humanitarian situation extremely dire in Gaza, Mao said China calls on relevant parties to make the cease-fire a reality at once and do everything possible to prevent casualties of innocent civilians, so as to prevent an even worse humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.Mao also said China is always committed to promoting talks for peace and de-escalation."We hope relevant countries can work together for this end," she said.Palestinian rights advocates argue that the Biden administration is redefining what it considers to be an invasion of Rafah so as to be able to deny that an offensive is happening, Al Jazeera reported.Yasmine Taeb, legislative and political director for advocacy group MPower Change Action Fund, called Biden's "red line" on Rafah "absolutely meaningless and merely a continuation of his callous and indefensible Gaza policy".More than 36,171 Palestinians were killed in Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip since Hamas' surprise attack on Oct 7, which caused about 1,200 Israeli deaths, data from Palestinian and Israeli sources showed. More than 1 million Palestinians are displaced, starved and threatened by bombs.Agencies and Mo Jingxi in Beijing contributed to this story.BEIJING -- Moses Masika Wetangula, speaker of Kenya's National Assembly, will lead a delegation to visit China from Sept 21 to 26, at the invitation of Zhao Leji, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee.While the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation has greatly impacted the China-Africa relationship since its establishment 24 years ago, becoming a key platform for collective dialogue and an effective mechanism for practical cooperation between the two parties, experts believe there is more room to further strengthen the ties.The experts expressed the need for improvement in people-to-people exchanges, trade and technology transfer among others.Maria Nzomo, professor of international relations, diplomacy and governance at the University of Nairobi, said technological transfer could help Africa industrialize and increase manufactured goods for export.Social-cultural exchanges between China and Africa should be increased to enhance people-to-people exchanges, Nzomo said.She said China's collective level dealing with Africa should not end at the FOCAC summit. Instead, discussions should continue to make sure both China and African countries collectively come up with action plans to ensure impactful projects are implemented.Nzomo said implementation of infrastructure projects like railways connecting several countries in Africa would be more impactful and aid regional integration.Cavince Adhere, a scholar of international relations with a focus on China-Africa cooperation, applauded the bilateral relations, which have boosted bilateral trade that benefited both sides, adding that African countries should make better use of their available resources to increase exports to China.Bilateral trade between China and Africa reached $282.1 billion last year, making China the top trade partner for Africa for 15 consecutive years.Africa should also think of services as the next frontier of trade with China like e-commerce and online jobs as opposed to only focusing on goods to improve exports, he said.African countries should also utilize provisions from China, like duty-free access to China for 33 countries in Africa, to increase their exports to the Asian powerhouse, Adhere said.He also suggested harmonization of development programs like Kenya Vision 2030 with China's Vision 2035, as well as the African Union's Agenda 2063.Partnership valuedHe noted the recent surveys by the Ichikowitz Family Foundation and Gallup Organization indicated that Africans greatly value the China-Africa partnership.The Ichikowitz Family Foundation report said that African youth consider China to be the most influential power in Africa, polling 82 percent, compared to the United States at 79 percent.Gallup indicated that China's approval among Africans rose from 52 percent in 2022 to 58 percent in 2023, while Washington's popularity fell from 59 percent in 2022 to 56 percent in 2023.Anita Kiamba, senior lecturer in the Department of Diplomacy and International Studies at the University of Nairobi, said just like Africans have China markets in different countries across Africa, there should also be markets in Chinese cities offering beaded jewelry, handicrafts and many other goods from Africa.Kizito Sabala, another senior lecturer from Kiamba's department, emphasized the need for technology transfer, both hard and soft.He appreciated the scholarships that China has been offering to African students but suggested the need for a follow-up on the beneficiaries to ensure that the acquired skills are utilized back in their home countries to avoid educational wastage.Tanzania's Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation Mahmoud Thabit Kombo lauded the outcomes of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, highlighting its significant role in fostering development and strengthening their relationship.In an interview with China Daily, Kombo spoke about the benefits of China-Africa cooperation for Tanzania and the entire continent, as well as the potential for increased collaboration on the path to modernization."The just-ended FOCAC provides a clear vision on how China and Africa are going to benefit from their cooperation. China's vision for China-Africa cooperation is based on equality, human-to-human touch and people-to-people development. It's not just China benefiting, and we are the evidence because we see tangible development from collaborating with China," he said.China has been Tanzania's largest trading partner for eight consecutive years. Last year, bilateral trade volume of goods reached $8.78 billion, marking an 8.9 percent year-on-year increase, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs."China is not only our No 1 trading partner but also the No 1 investor in Tanzania, with investments spanning industrial, agricultural and infrastructure sectors," Kombo said.He reminisced about the historical significance of the TAZARA Railway, built by China in the 1970s, which links Zambia with the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam."At that time, China was not a rich nation, yet it spent an amount equivalent to 5 percent of its GDP to build the TAZARA Railway. It's not easy," he said."This railway, after it was opened, significantly boosted the economies of Tanzania and Zambia, especially since Zambia is a landlocked country that relies on Tanzania for the transport of oil, fuel, goods, minerals and crops."The railway has had a profound effect on the social, economic, industrial, agricultural and energy sectors of both countries, he said. "This railway contributed so much to the development of these two countries. So, it stands as one of the biggest commitments in the history, an iconic project that China has done for these two nations."During the FOCAC summit earlier this month, leaders from China, Tanzania and Zambia witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding on the revitalization project of the TAZARA Railway, aimed at improving the rail-sea intermodal transport network in East Africa."We understand when China invests in our countries, we can benefit from that Chinese investment," Kombo said. "When China supports our infrastructure, the real aspect is a mutual respect and beneficial relationship with both sides reaping the benefits."Citing soybean cultivation, he said boosting soybean productivity and its exports to China requires mechanization, modernization and infrastructure, all areas where partnership with China is crucial."In producing soybeans, we need mechanization and modern agricultural technology, which China already possesses. We also need infrastructure to transport the soybeans from the farm to the port."If you visit Tanzania today, you will see a lot of infrastructure developed and built by the Chinese," Kombo said, adding that Chinese loans have enabled Tanzania to develop its infrastructure. "These loans enable us to develop, produce more and to be able to pay back the loans."Looking to future China-Africa cooperation, Kombo pointed to the 10 partnership actions announced at the FOCAC summit, which address Africa's critical needs such as trade prosperity, industrial chain, connectivity, health, agriculture, livelihood and green development.He particularly emphasized the potential for cooperation in green development."China leads the world in the battery industry in terms of technology and market share. I recently learned that for 25 to 30 percent of the components of Chinese-made batteries, the raw material is sourced from Africa. This presents a great opportunity for Chinese industries to open factories in Africa, where such components can be made locally, creating local employment and facilitating technology exchange," he said.It is now a crime for parents or guardians to not send a child to school in South Africa as the country takes a step to improve the education sector with new legislation.This comes after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the Basic Education Laws Amendment (BELA) bill into law on Friday. The new legislation criminalizes anyone who disrupts school activities with a maximum sentence of 12 months. In the past, community protests used to disrupt school activities. BELA law prohibits corporal punishment in schools including non-physical forms of punishment that undermine a child's dignity. After publicly signing the bill into law, Ramaphosa said the new legislation seeks to strengthen governance within South Africa's education sector."The Bill is part of the state's ongoing efforts to build an education system that is more effective and more equitable. The law that we are signing today further opens the doors of learning. It lays a firm foundation for learning from an early age. Grade R, the reception year before Grade 1, will now be compulsory. This will enhance our focus on early childhood development.  It will ensure young children are better prepared for formal schooling," said Ramaphosa. He explained that the government had made progress in making education accessible to many and the new law seeks to correct some of the challenges in the system. The BELA law gives schools an obligation to respect cultural and religious beliefs and gives learners the right to seek exemption in certain activities. The government is trying to ensure that education is inclusive, said Ramaphosa.He said, "The law requires schools to apply the same standards for the admission of learners. It seeks to ensure uniformity and fairness in educational standards across all schools. To improve safety in the learning environment, the legislation reinforces the ban on corporal punishment. It introduces stronger penalties for those who administer corporal punishment. The legislation introduces financial and public accountability frameworks for school governing bodies." This legislation gives the minister of basic education the right to regulate the registration and administration of home education. The department head is required to conduct site visits before registering home education. Under the new law, there must be independent assessments of home-schooled children's progress to ensure they receive a quality education.Mugwena Maluleke, general secretary of the South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) welcomed the new legislation as one of the initiatives to improve the education sector in the country.He said, "We believe this is the right step in the right direction to transform the education system. We have been fighting for a long time for Grade R to be critically formalized. We have been fighting for the democratization of education and this legislation gives dignity to the people," said Maluleke.He welcomed the abolishment of corporal punishment. The teachers made submissions during the public hearings on the bill and are aware of what BELA requires, said Maluleke. He explained that they will hold face-to-face or virtual workshops with teachers to raise awareness and familiarize themselves (teachers) with the new legislation.Mary Metcalfe, visiting adjunct professor at the University of the Witwatersrand said there is a need for additional infrastructure and teaching personnel required for Grade R. The national treasury has estimated the annual costs of Grade R teacher salaries to be about $944 million which is 5 percent of the annual allocation of the basic education, said Metcalf.  She said education is now compulsory from the years a child turns six years old.She said, "This will mean that South Africa will now have 10 years of compulsory education from Grade R to Grade 9. The concept of ‘compulsory education' is important here because, as a public good that is enforced, this not only has implications for parents – but also for the state because the has the obligation to ensure that all children can access public schooling in the official language of their choice where this is reasonably practical (as required by Section 29(2) of the Constitution."Metcalfe explained that the Constitution specifies that all educational alternatives must be considered including equity, practicability and the need to redress the results of past discriminatory laws and practices.Maluleke said the Department of Basic Education should hold some awareness campaigns to inform the parents or guardians about the new regulations.Kenyans were on Friday treated to traditional Chinese dances, music, drama, and poetry by students from the Confucius Institute at the University of Nairobi as they prepared for the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival, one of China's most important traditional holidays.During the event, which was held in partnership with the Africa Star Railway Operation Company, the operator of Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway, speakers said that there is growing awareness among Kenyans of Chinese festivals due to deeper commercial and cultural ties between the two countries.Nelson Asienwa, head of corporate and culture at the company, said that Kenyans and the Chinese have a lot in common and the Mid-Autumn Festival corresponds to thanksgiving by farmers during harvest. He added that it is through such cultural activities that Kenyans and the Chinese community can gain deeper understanding of each other.According to Wang Xinyu, a lecturer at the Confucius Institute, it is important to regularly hold cultural events as a way of promoting cultural exchanges between Kenya and China."We have these celebrations so that the students and other Kenyans can learn about the Chinese culture. This time, we have included more activities than before, which is in line with our core mandate here at the institution, which is cultural exchange", Wang said.Shantal Atieno, a student at Confucius Institute at the University of Nairobi, said participating in the festival was an eye-opening experience especially for her as she learned more about Chinese culture and language."By participating in Chinese cultural activities, we get deeper insights into their traditions and that makes it easier for us in our studies as we learn the Chinese language," Atieno said.The Mid-Autumn Festival, which takes place annually on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese lunar calendar, will be observed on Sept 17 this year.The 7th edition of the Kenya International Industrial Expo opened on Thursday in the capital Nairobi, bringing together 192 international exhibitors, of which 70 percent were from China, and with more than 2,100 merchants attending.Themed 'Investing in Tomorrow-Trading for Prosperity,' the three-day expo, focuses on driving growth in Kenya's manufacturing sector. It thus created an opportunity for local investors to partner with their peers from China to strengthen the economic ties between the two countries.In a speech read on his behalf at the Expo opening ceremony, Erick Rutto, the president of the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the Expo has continued to provide platforms and opportunities in technology transfer, boosting inter-trade and enhancing the opening of the gateway between Kenya and China."We are committed to enhancing our support, as we continue to take advantage of the expo for the chamber members to establish partnerships, joint ventures and exchange ideas on product development," he said.Rutto urged Chinese companies to invest in Kenya to take advantage of the country's strategic location as the gateway to the region to connect with the rest of Africa, riding on the African Continental Free Trade Area.He said Kenya has many investment opportunities including in agriculture, information and communication technology, building and construction as well as green energy.Rutto expressed need for Kenya to expand products currently exported into the Chinese market and also diversify product range through the promotion of other products where Kenya has a supply capability, to bridge its trade gap with China.Pius Rotich, the general manager of investment promotion and business development at the Kenya Investment Authority, said the organizers' motif is to make the expo a high-level cooperation platform between China and Kenya.This is in addition to making it a platform to encourage more Chinese to invest in the East African country through in-depth exchanges to develop Kenya's manufacturing sector.He said the investment authority established a one-stop center to ensure efficient and effective facilitation of the implementation of new investments.Rotich said many Chinese companies are willing to invest in Kenya targeting the entire continent's market, and assured them of the authority's support."It is easier now to set up and do business in Kenya than ever before. We have put structures in place to ensure continuous improvement based on the private sector feedback," he said.Ronald Meru, the chairman of economic diplomacy at Kenya's National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said collaborative efforts between China and Kenya over the years have resulted in significant achievements that benefits both countries across key sectors such as construction, manufacturing, energy and machinery.Rural revitalization and mutual learning are key to advancing African development, with both China and Africa standing to benefit from each other's experiences, a communication and development academic said.The 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which concluded last week, "set the grand plan" for China and Africa to work together, Zhao Yuezhi, humanities chair professor at Tsinghua University, told China Daily.The 10 partnership actions laid out in President Xi Jinping's keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the summit are "comprehensive, interconnected, and above all, concrete", Zhao said.They cover a wide range of Sino-African cooperation, including agricultural and livelihood development, which are "exactly the focal point" of the Harare Forum for Africa, held for the first time in July in Zimbabwe's capital, said Zhao, who serves as the forum's chair."I was overwhelmed by the success of the forum, which is the culmination of a long process," she said."It was a dream come true. Zimbabwe has been a country of my fascination since I was 15, when I heard over the national radio (in 1980) the independence of yet another African country."I believe that piece of news, in a way, forged my imagination about the Global South."'Mutual learning'She attributes the forum's success to being held "in the spirit of mutual learning of civilization" and cross-sectoral cooperation, with support from field study academics and agricultural experts.Tungamirai Eric Mupona, one of the Zimbabwean scholars who addressed the forum, shared his personal experience conducting field studies in Jinyun county, East China's Zhejiang province, and how he found it relevant to Zimbabwe's context. Mupona said he looks forward to sharing China's experience of rural development with his fellow countrymen, according to Zhao.Zhao also highlighted how Achieford Mhondera, a scholar at the University of Zimbabwe, learned the "Two Mountains Theory" in Jinyun and connected it to Zimbabwe's development plan. The theory was first put forward in 2005, calling lucid waters and lush mountains invaluable assets comparable to the gold and silver of legend.Mhondera wrote in a report on the reflections from the forum: "My presentation explores the feasibility of integrating ecological considerations into Zimbabwe's economic development strategies, drawing inspiration from China's 'Two Mountains Theory' and the broader ecological civilization discourse."The theory, "emphasizes the need to treat the 'mountains' of ecology and economy as interconnected rather than competing priorities", Mhondera wrote.Zhao, who is also the founder and executive director of the Heyang Institute for Rural Studies, established the institute 10 years ago to explore the future of rural communities, meaningful living and rural-based communication empowerment. Heyang, a village in Jinyun county that represents traditional Chinese agrarian civilization, serves as the institute's namesake."I decided to zoom in to my home county as a basis to tell the China story, especially … through the rural story, because traditional Chinese civilization is rural-based," Zhao said.The professor said she plans to organize more events to further foster mutual learning between China and Africa, such as inviting agricultural experts to offer expertise on how to store food in dry conditions, such as extracting starch from sweet potatoes, which particularly caters to the situation in Africa.Throughout her academic career, she has observed the underdevelopment of some African countries, which have been historically exploited by Western colonizers."I've always been concerned about uneven global order and the importance of Global South countries to rise up to build a more fair, just, and equal international order," Zhao said.Zhao emphasized that the concept of the Global South transcends geography, representing the common aspirations of people opposed to colonization and hegemony."In this context, China-Africa collaboration is going to be not only a pillar, but to serve as an exemplar for the rest of the Global South, or for the North-South collaboration," she said.The youths from BRICS countries are expected to intensify exchanges of best practices and critical skills to help contribute to the sustainable development of their countries, said a South African government official.Sindisiwe Chikunga, Minister of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities made the remarks in a recent interview with China Daily on the sidelines of the BRICS Summer School South Africa 2024, organized by the South African BRICS Youth Association, in Johannesburg."We encourage the youths to pay particular attention to skills, knowledge, and cultural exchanges among BRICS youths to deepen and future-proof this alliance. Urgent attention should be directed to joint skills development initiatives, with a specific focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics," said Chikunga.She explained that BRICS youths and those in the global south should work together in digital transformation. BRICS youth have to develop business and market intelligence capabilities to leverage the opportunities presented by the expanded membership of BRICS, said Chikunga. Since the BRICS summit last year in South Africa, more countries such as Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates have joined BRICS.Chikunga said: "I expect to see BRICS youths' plans to learn each other's languages as a fundamental tool for further integration and strengthening ties within BRICS. Understanding the history of BRICS civilization is crucial to preparing the youths to be responsible and effective handlers of power."Early this year 22 female engineering students in South Africa were sent to India to learn about solar panel manufacturing which the South African government said is one of the resolutions of the 2023 BRICS Women in Business meeting. One of those summit resolutions was for women to take the lead in addressing the energy crisis.Charli Zhang, a student at South Africa's University of Cape Town said the youths should inform the communities about the positive contribution from BRICS. She said many people do not know the positive contribution of BRICS in South Africa, particularly the New Development Bank.She said: "BRICS should focus on the youths and give them scholarships and help them improve their skills. The youths should meet to discuss energy, innovations and creativity to facilitate south-south cooperation."There should be more interactions at different levels like university and high school learners from the countries of the south to discuss issues facing their countries and find solutions.Candice Moodley, corporate services executive at the Energy and Water Sector Education Training Authority in South Africa, said this year they sent 54 students and six lecturers to China to get workplace experiential training in renewable energy and PV solar manufacturing. Moodley said when the students and lecturers return to South Africa after 12 months, they are expected to help the country address energy challenges.She said: "We have to leverage on the strengths of each BRICS partner and also assist our youths with skills development. The youths can influence the policy decisions with a youth perspective."The civil conflict in Sudan, which broke out in April last year, has left over 25 million people facing high levels of acute hunger, including 755,000 people who are considered to be in catastrophic conditions with a risk of famine in 14 areas hardest hit by the ongoing conflict.During a visit to Sudan's Red Sea State on Tuesday to launch the distribution of certified seeds targeting local farmers, Abdul Hakim Elwaer, the assistant director-general to the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization, voiced deep concern about the security situation in Sudan and its implications for vulnerable populations.Elwaer pointed out that since continued conflict negatively affected the food produced by local farmers last year, the current agriculture season is critical to increasing locally available food. This is to avoid a further food gap that could lead to catastrophe in the coming months. He further called upon all parties of the conflict to cease hostilities immediately to enable the farmers to access their lands across all states in Sudan and produce the much-needed food to avoid catastrophe.According to FAO's latest Famine Review Committee report published on August 1, the spread and escalation of fighting to Al Jazirah State, the breadbasket of the Sudan, poses a significant threat to national food production, given that the state accounts for about 50 percent of wheat and 10 percent of sorghum production in the country."The outlook for food production in 2024 is bleak. Access is a number one concern among all agencies on the ground. Security constraints and bureaucratic obstacles are limiting how many people are assisted," the report stated.The UN agency called for urgent action by the international community to help people in Sudan meet their immediate needs and adapt their livelihoods by building resilience in the face of conflicts, climate and economic shocks. With a current mobilization of $32 million to finance its $104 million Humanitarian Response Plan 2024 for Sudan, FAO called for assistance to fill the $72 million gap.RABAT -- At least 11 people have been killed and nine others went missing after torrential rains battered southern Morocco, the Interior Ministry said in a provisional report on Sunday.Seven of the fatalities were reported in the Tata province, while four others, including a foreign national, were found in the provinces of Errachidia and Tiznit, ministry spokesperson Rachid El Khalfi told reporters in Rabat. The spokesperson also noted that the missing individuals are from the provinces of Tata, Errachidia, and Taroudant.The heavy rainfall also caused significant material damage, including the collapse of 40 homes and damage to 93 road sections. Traffic has been restored on 53 of the affected sections. The rains also disrupted electricity, drinking water supply networks, and telephone networks.According to a press release from the Ministry of Equipment and Water, nearly 200 people and 96 earthmoving machines have been deployed to restore traffic in the affected regions.The Interior Ministry urged local residents and visitors to exercise extreme caution due to the unstable weather and to follow all guidelines issued by authorities, the spokesperson added.KHARTOUM -- More than 20 civilians were killed and over 100 others injured in an attack by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on Sinnar city in central Sudan on Sunday, according to local aid groups.The Sinnar Youth Gathering, a local voluntary group, reported that the RSF "indiscriminately" shelled the Sinaar market and the Al-Muwazafeen neighborhood.Meanwhile, the non-governmental Sudanese Doctors Network reported that 21 people were killed and more than 70 others injured due to artillery shelling by the RSF on Sinnar market, calling the attack a "massacre" against unarmed civilians.The RSF has not yet commented on the incident.Since June, the RSF has controlled large parts of Sinnar state, including the capital city of Singa, while the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) controls the eastern part of the state. The International Organization for Migration estimates that fighting in Sinnar has displaced more than 725,000 people.Since April 15, 2023, Sudan has been engulfed in a deadly conflict between the SAF and the RSF, resulting in at least 16,650 deaths. According to the latest UN data, approximately 10.7 million people are internally displaced in Sudan, with about 2.2 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries.ALGIERS - Preliminary results showed on Sunday that Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has been re-elected for a second term, the country's election authority said.Mohamed Charfi, head of the Independent Authority for Elections, said in a press briefing in the capital Algiers that Tebboune received 5,329,253 votes, or 94.65 percent of the total.His nearest competitor, Abdelaali Hassani Cherif, garnered 178,797 votes, or 3.17 percent, while Youcef Aouchiche secured 122,146 votes.According to regulations, the country's Constitutional Council will review any appeals from the candidates before finalizing the results.The election was held on Saturday, with more than 23 million citizens eligible to vote. Although Algerian presidential elections are traditionally held in December, Tebboune moved this year's election to an earlier date in March, citing "technical reasons".The 78-year incumbent president first took office in 2019 following a political crisis and the resignation of late President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.Tebboune's victory marks a continuation of his leadership. During his electoral campaign, he pledged to continue addressing Algeria's political and economic challenges.Kenya's Ministry of Health on Friday confirmed the country's fifth case of the mpox disease as the country provided updates on contact tracing, with 33 individuals currently under observation. Debra Barasa, Kenya's health cabinet secretary, said that so far, 124 samples have been tested for mpox, with 110 testing negative, nine still under analysis, and five confirmed positives.In addition, 687,233 travelers have been screened at 26 ports of entry across the country, as the ministry ramps up surveillance efforts to control the spread of the disease. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that the continent is witnessing an upward trend in mpox cases.While unveiling a joint continental response plan against mpox with the World Health Organization on Friday, Africa CDC said that the Democratic Republic of the Congo has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak, accounting for 90 percent of reported cases on the continent.Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, called for a unified approach to contain the outbreak while emphasizing the importance of coordination under the Africa CDC-WHO joint continental response plan."This is an important milestone for coordinated action between our agencies to support countries by strengthening expertise, mobilizing resources, and rapidly halting the spread of mpox," Moeti said. "By working together, we can achieve more, ensuring that communities and individuals are protected from this virus."On Friday, the Africa CDC and United Nations Children's Fund also announced the arrival of the first shipment of 99,100 doses of JYNNEOS mpox vaccine in the DRC with an additional 100,900 doses coming on Saturday.This shipment is expected to launch a critical vaccination campaign aimed at curbing the rising epidemic in the country, which has reported over 4,901 confirmed mpox cases, with more than 629 associated deaths since the start of 2024.The continental response, co-coordinated by Africa CDC and WHO, emphasizes a community-centered, multisectoral approach tailored to the unique epidemiology and risk profiles of each African member state. The plan bolsters surveillance, laboratory testing, community engagement, and ensures the availability of critical countermeasures, while building resilient and equitable health systems.As Kenya looks into industrialization to grow its economy, Chinese businesspeople, especially those manufacturing industrial machines in partnership with Kenyans, could help propel the country's manufacturing sector to new heights, industry players and government agencies have said.Under Kenya's Vision 2030, the manufacturing sector has been identified as the key driver for economic growth and development due to its potential to create jobs and wealth, as well as its potential to realize the Sustainable Development Goals.The sector players and government agencies termed the upcoming seventh edition of the Kenya International Industrial Expo, also known as the Kenya Investment and Trade Fair 2024, as a platform for the China-Kenya businesspeople to foster partnerships that will facilitate the country's manufacturing sector.Key platformGao Wei, managing director of Afripeak Expo Kenya, the expo organizer, said the event, to be held from Sept 12 to Sept 14, is a vital platform for connecting local businesses with international partners, facilitating knowledge exchange and promoting the adoption of cutting-edge technologies."As we look to the future, the expo will play a crucial role in supporting East Africa's journey toward becoming a leading industrial hub on the continent," he said.Gao said the expo, which brings together industry leaders, policymakers, entrepreneurs and innovators from around the world, is a testament to a shared commitment to driving the industrialization agenda forward."By bringing together stakeholders from diverse industries and regions, the expo facilitates the exchange of ideas, technologies and best practices essential for driving industrial growth," he added.Gao said 192 companies will be exhibiting their products, of which 70 percent will be Chinese companies, 15 percent local companies and the remaining from the neighboring countries.Cynthia Kamau, the national director and chamber person of the labor migration committee at the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the expo promises to be a milestone in Kenya's industrial and economic journey.She said the expo presents a unique opportunity for Kenyan businesses to find joint venture partners and expand their market reach."As we continue to strengthen our bilateral trade relations, this platform will play a critical role in fostering new partnerships that can drive innovation, enhance productivity, and create jobs in our local economy," Kamau said."We believe that the collaboration between Kenyan and international businesses will yield transformative results, not just for our industries but for our broader economic landscape."Thousands of children in eastern Sudan are at risk of cholera following a major outbreak that hit the country in August, caused by widespread flooding and contaminated water amid a decimated health system due to the ongoing conflict in the country.According to Save the Children, a London-based humanitarian organization working for children, nearly 2,900 cases of cholera and 112 deaths have been reported between July 22 and the beginning of September.The organization's teams are reporting a huge spike in cholera cases among children under five in El Damer in River Nile State and Gedarif in Gedarif State, accounting for nearly 15 percent of the confirmed cases and deaths across the country.The rapid cholera spread is attributed to inadequate sewage treatment, flooding, and unsafe drinking water; conditions worsened by relentless heavy rains that have battered much of the country for the past three months."Children in Sudan have gone from horror to horror. Even before the conflict erupted last year the country was home to one of the world's biggest humanitarian crises, with existing localized conflicts, natural disasters, disease outbreaks and economic degradation leaving 15.8 million people in need," Mohamed Abdiladif, interim country director for Save the Children in Sudan, said."That figure has now escalated to 25.6 million people, and diseases like cholera will only trigger a greater increase."Abdiladif said his organization is working on ensuring access to clean water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene promotion activities to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera in conflict-affected areas."However, we urgently need a huge injection of funds to deliver the treatment needed for cholera," he said.Heavy rains and flooding have so far displaced 4,300 people from displacement camps in North Darfur State, including the Zamzam camp, where famine was recently declared.The flooding has destroyed around 900 tents and washed away latrines within these camps, severely disrupting humanitarian aid efforts, the organization said.NAIROBI -- Kenyan President William Ruto on Friday ordered investigations into a school fire that killed 17 children and left 13 others with serious burn injuries in central Kenya.Ruto, who is attending the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summit in Beijing, said those responsible will be held to account for the fire that erupted at the Hillside Endarasha Academy in Nyeri on Thursday night."I instruct the relevant authorities to thoroughly investigate this horrific incident. Those responsible will be held to account," Ruto wrote in a post on social media after a phone call with the school's head.The president also directed government agencies to mobilize resources to support those affected."This is heartbreaking; it is devastating," said Ruto as he prayed for a speedy recovery for the survivors and pledged support to the affected families.The victims who died in the fire were aged between seven and 11, according to the police.National Police Service Spokesperson Resila Onyango said security experts were on the ground to establish the cause of the fire.The team will thoroughly examine the site, gather evidence, and interview witnesses to uncover the source of the fire and determine if any foul play was involved, Onyango said.Witnesses said 16 died on the spot while one succumbed while being taken to hospital after one of the dormitories housing the pupils was razed down on Thursday night.The school is one of those billed as the best in the region in academic performance. There are fears that the death toll may increase.Digital innovations and advancements in the fintech sector are playing a vital role in driving Africa's prosperity, particularly for small and medium enterprises, women, and youth entrepreneurs. Experts have said that Africa has one of the fastest-growing fintech sectors in the world, and its value is expected to reach $65 billion annually by the year 2030, making it a prime site for the digital revolution.They were speaking on Thursday at the 12th edition of the bi-annual Africa Fintech Summit 2024 taking place from September 4-6 in Kenya's capital Nairobi. Wamkele Mene, secretary-general of the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement, or AfCFTA, said the continent is banking on fintech as an avenue to increase the level of intra-African trade, which he said is estimated at 15 percent compared to 70 percent within the European Union and 60 percent in Asia.Through the development by fintech companies, Mene said that Africa's financial outlook is being transformed through inclusion by enabling previously unbanked businessmen to engage in seamless cross-border trade.In 2022, AfCFTA officially launched the Pan-African Payments and Settlement System to enable intra-African trade in local currency after a pilot phase in the West African Monetary Zone. According Mene, the system will enable Africa to reduce reliance on third currencies, and more importantly, it has the potential to significantly boost intra-Africa trade.During panel discussions held on the sidelines of the summit, speakers agreed that while AfCFTA's new payment system presents significant opportunities for transforming intra-African trade, realizing its full potential requires overcoming existing challenges through innovation, collaboration, and effective implementation of policies and infrastructure.Mary Queenie Adam, the CEO of Kenyan consultancy firm Trends Research, said that Africa is a hub for fintech innovation, with digital payments, mobile money, and data-driven solutions leading the charge."In Kenya, for instance, our fintech sector is expected to grow at an annual rate of 24 percent over the next five years, driven by high mobile penetration and a youthful, tech-savvy population. Data analytics is increasingly becoming a critical tool with mobile money, blockchain technology, cross-border money transfer and remittances becoming common practice among businesses in the region," Adam said.NYERI, Kenya - At least 17 pupils were killed and 13 others seriously injured after a fire broke out Thursday night at a school in central Kenya, local police confirmed Friday.National Police Service Spokesperson Resila Onyango said that 14 pupils were sent to the hospital with serious burns after their dormitores caught fire at Hillside Endarasha Primary Academy in Nyeri County. One died after being hospitalized."We are investigating the cause of the fire and taking necessary action," Onyango said via phone. "So far we have 17 pupils dead."Witnesses said that one of the dormitories housing the students was destroyed, sparking fears that the death toll from the horrific fire could rise.Rescue teams are on the scene working to manage the situation, said local police.JUBA - The ongoing flooding has affected more than 710,000 people across 30 of 78 counties in South Sudan and the Abyei Administrative Area, the UN relief agency said on Thursday.Floods caused by heavy rains that began in May have worsened an already critical humanitarian situation marked by severe food insecurity, economic decline, continued conflict, disease outbreaks and the repercussions of the Sudan conflict, said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)."Since May, floods have caused extensive damage to homes, crops and critical infrastructure, disrupting education and health services and increasing the risk of disease outbreaks," the agency said in its Flash Update released in Juba, the capital of South Sudan.On Aug 29, the UN agency projected that at the peak of the rainy season, between September and October, flooding could impact up to 3.3 million people nationwide, including communities still recovering from the devastating floods of 2019-2022, which displaced at least one million people annually.It said a high-level consultation held in Juba on Monday and Tuesday reviewed the 2024 flood preparedness and response plan.During the meeting attended by senior government officials and key humanitarian leaders, officials emphasized the need for a unified understanding of the crisis, clear priorities, and well-defined roles.The UN agency called for coordinated action to address the escalating disaster, noting that humanitarian partners are rapidly responding to the immediate needs of flood-affected populations with life-saving assistance.Urgent needs include food, shelter, non-food items, water, sanitation and hygiene materials, emergency health kits, and protection services, OCHA said.The country's Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation on Aug 20 issued an urgent appeal for communities in low-lying areas along the Nile to relocate, as water levels at the Mangala Telemetric Station in Juba County reached a five-year high of 14.85 meters.Editor's note: President Xi Jinping held bilateral meetings on Thursday with foreign leaders who are in Beijing to attend the ongoing 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.Botswana embraces strategic partnershipThe robust China-Africa cooperation not only benefits the Chinese and African peoples, but also drives international cooperation with Africa, creating favorable conditions for the continent's development and vitalization, President Xi Jinping said on Thursday.He made the remark when meeting with Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi in Beijing. The two leaders announced the establishment of a strategic partnership between China and Botswana.Xi said the 2024 FOCAC Summit has brought China and its African brothers together, aligning the development of China, Africa and the world more closely and unleashing the positive energy of the Global South to promote global peace, security, prosperity and progress.Noting that next year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, Xi called on both sides to work as partners who trust each other, develop together and foster strong people-to-people bonds.He underlined the need for the two countries to steadfastly support each other and enhance cooperation in sectors such as industry, agriculture, mining, clean energy, education and healthcare.Masisi lauded Xi's inspiring keynote speech delivered at the opening ceremony of the summit, in which Xi announced new initiatives to support the partnership between China and Africa to promote modernization, along with China's opening-up policies dedicated to the continent.Botswana fully supports these initiatives and policies with a strong belief that the vision outlined at the summit will come to fruition, he said.He expressed gratitude to China for its long-standing support for Botswana, and said his country is willing to take the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations as an opportunity to further advance bilateral relations.BERLIN - Germany's migration commissioner proposed deporting to Rwanda migrants who arrive illegally to the European Union through its borders with Belarus, as Berlin contemplates measures to restrict refugees arriving in the bloc.The proposal comes amid rising pressure on Germany's ruling coalition government to restrict irregular migration following a fatal stabbing linked to Islamic State at a city festival last month that fuelled far-right opposition and criticism of Berlin's migration policies.Joachim Stamp, Germany's Special Representative for Migration Agreements, said the EU could utilize existing asylum facilities in Rwanda, which were initially intended for Britain's 2022 plan to send unauthorized migrants to the East African nation. The British plan was scrapped by Keir Starmer's new government in July.Under Stamp's proposal, the asylum procedures in Rwanda would be conducted under the supervision of the United Nations."We currently have no third country that has come forward, with the exception of Rwanda," Stamp said in a podcast by Table Media published on Thursday.Stamp, a member of the junior coalition FDP party and whose position sits in Germany's Interior Ministry, said this model would specifically target refugees crossing the EU's eastern borders."My suggestion would be that we concentrate on this group. It's about 10,000 people a year," he said, dismissing broader proposals from the conservative opposition to apply such a model to all refugees.He said Rwanda has publicly expressed its willingness to continue implementing this model.In addition, Stamp suggested removing the so-called "connecting element" in the new Common European Asylum System (CEAS), which currently requires external asylum procedures to be conducted in countries where the asylum seeker has a social connection.The European Union agreed in December on new rules to handle irregular arrivals of asylum seekers and migrants, a deal hailed as a breakthrough after almost a decade of bitter feuds on the issue. It could take until the end of 2025 for the pact to take full effect.ReutersMachakos University's Franklin Mutisya and Humphrey Mwambaji are testimonies to the Luban Workshop's impact on Kenyan students and the industry.

As a result of that, China comes to Africa not with the view of a perpetrator of the previous status quo, but with the view of partnering with African countries," said Tshabalala. "If you look at the commitments made by the Chinese leadership, they clearly demonstrate a clear pledge and willingness to prosper Africa on a long-term basis."He said this at a media round table themed "Realizing the Economic Potential of China-Africa Cooperation". On Tuesday, or just before the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC)opened, Tshabalala and the majority of the bank's executive group all participated in the round table, sharing their ideas about China-Africa cooperation with domestic journalists."Besides carrying out business and doing things that make business sense, China has been more importantly also supporting the growth of African countries," Tshabalala said.Deputy CEO of the Standard Bank Group Kenny Fihla said that as a financial institution they eye the economic potential of both China and Africa and their cooperation. "We've seen a lot of investment as well as business activity by Chinese clients in Angola, in Zambia, in the TRC, in South Africa, in Mozambique, in Namibia, in Zimbabwe," he said, "it's a wide range of sectors, which is also helping to drive the industrialization and the economic development of the African continent."The head of the business and commercial bank of the Standard Bank Group, Andrew Robertson, also spoke highly of the forums on trade, saying they were willing to regularly participate in "important forums to help educate Chinese investors on opportunities for Africa-China economic trade".Robertson also said they have been trying to connect "both African businesses wanting to trade in China and Chinese businesses wanting to trade in Africa". "We do this through matchmaking events and trade expos such as Chine International Import Expo that we've attended for the last six years, China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo as well as the Canton Trade Fair we participated recently," he said, hoping that the CACF will bring more opportunities to both sides.Residents of Kipsebwa village in Nandi Hills, western Kenya, are smiling following the launch of a cutting-edge water treatment and supply facility in the village that provides clean water for domestic use.Launched by Kenyan President William Ruto in August, the $3 million water project, funded by African Development Bank and built by China Railway No 10 Engineering Group Ltd, entails the establishment of massive water tanks. It also involves the rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing water distribution system within the town, water kiosks and three ablution blocks, and development of a new water source on the nearby Mekong River.Speaking at the launch ceremony of the project in Kipsebwa, Ruto said the project is currently supplying 250,000 liters of water a day to 1,000 households, adding that the project will be expanded to benefit at least 10,000 households in three years.Ma Qiwen, project manager of China Railway No 10 Engineering Group Ltd, said the water project responds to China's Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to uplift Kenya's livelihood development."The goal is to ensure that the community and its environs have access to clean water for domestic usage, which will help prevent waterborne diseases."Ma said more new water treatment plants are being constructed in coastal parts of Kenya.Like many other areas in Kenya, there is a scarcity of clean water access due to the lack of water treatment facilities. For decades the locals in Nandi Hills have been forced to use contaminated water for domestic use, posing health risks.Janet Tarus, a mother of four in Kipsebwa, was unable to hide her joy at having access to clean water due to the facility.She said the facility is a dream come true for her and the family. Earlier, she had to travel 15 kilometers to fetch 20 liters of clean water for domestic usage, which was not enough for the family, while now she can get clean water easily within a few minutes away from her home, she said.Lawrence Bett, a village elder in Kipsebwa, said previously villages in the area faced challenges in addressing the clean water shortage."For decades our children suffered from cholera and bilharzia diseases as a result of drinking contaminated water from the local river but now we do not need to worry anymore because the Chinese have connected our houses with clean water," Lawrence said.He also pointed out that the schools in the area have also been connected to the county waterline, a move he termed as vital in creating ample time for learners to spend more time in class."Previously, the school-going children were not able to concentrate in class because once they got back home, they were tasked with fetching water from kilometers away, but now, with the majority of the homes connected to clean water, we are going to see a tremendous improvement in their performance," he said.The availability of the clean water project has also inspired some villagers to venture into agribusiness.Gladys Jerobon and other women in Kipsebwa village now plan to start a tree nursery project. This will help them to earn a decent living and also contribute to the welfare of their families.Due to her ownership of a dairy farm, Jepkosgei Tai used to pay $200 monthly to buy water from a nearby vendor, which she thought was very expensive.Now that her home is connected to the water supply line, her water bill has fallen by more than a half. "This water bill used to eat into my profits, but now that I am connected to the supply line, I can invest the extra cash into acquiring more animal feed."Muisha Mbikyo Bienvenue, a Congolese medical student at China Medical University, recently conducted a training session for members of the Liaoning medical team aiding Gambia — a country in West Africa."Many of the medical team members are my teachers. As I shared with them the expectations African patients have for their doctors, I could sense the deep, selfless care they hold for the people of Africa," Bienvenue said."They leave their families behind without hesitation, carrying the spirit of medical altruism and dedication to Africa. Their resilience and selflessness in serving abroad deeply move me," Bienvenue added.Bienvenue has participated in multiple training sessions for outbound medical teams, offering insights into African culture, climate, and healthcare systems. He also led the team in practicing everyday language skills and medical English terms to help them adapt to their new environment.China Medical University has sent seven medical teams to Gambia since 2017, totaling 14 members. The university has also spearheaded the establishment of a gynecological endoscopy center in Gambia as part of its bilateral hospital partnership. The university has continuously enhanced Gambia's gynecology and maternal healthcare capacity through talent development, joint research, technical exchanges and telemedicine.Xin Zhiyuan contributed to the story.Intensified cooperation between China and Africa has not only promoted economic and trade development, but also contributed to peace and security in Africa, experts said.Cavince Adhere, an international relations specialist from Kenya, said that China's foreign policy is about respect, equality and common development. He added that China has become a major country that is preoccupied with exporting peace and development to its international partners.As Africa's largest trading partner, China's partnership with the continent has been defined by extensive consultation and consensus building and responding to the needs and requests of African countries without imposing extraneous terms or conditions, Adhere said."China has not imposed their idea of governance on African countries," he said. "China is pushing for amity of civilizations, learning from each other and seeking points of convergence rather than superimposing its will on African countries."He lauded initiatives by China to promote peace, including the China-Africa Peace and Security Forum, which has become a focal point of security cooperation between the two sides.Besides offering to help train African militaries and security personnel, China actively contributes its troops to the United Nations' peacekeeping missions on the continent as part of the nation's peaceful development policy. Beijing has also been active in supporting counterpiracy operations on the continent while seeking common ground on ways to resolve global security challenges and upholding international justice."China's decision to appoint a peace envoy for the Horn of Africa in 2022 demonstrates Beijing's willingness to constructively engage in Africa's peace and security prospects," Adhere said. "It is emblematic of recent action steps taken by Beijing to support novel aspects of peace and security such as conflict mediation."He said China's peace initiative in Africa is unique because its approach elevates development as a guarantor of peace and security while also championing multilateralism. The continent is endowed with natural resources but has been held back by domestic and cross-border conflicts and other forms of security challenges such as terrorism.Adhere also noted that guided by its noninterference policy, China's leadership emphasizes that its role in boosting Africa's security is focused on limited, multilateral intervention and building the continent's capacity to pursue solutions to its unique problems.Noninterference policyWhile reiterating China's noninterference policy during a UN Security Council meeting in May, Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, stressed the importance of respecting the leadership of African nations and their knowledge of how to best address their continent's problems. He rejected interference in African internal affairs, including applying pressure and sanctions."Africa should be a big stage for international cooperation, not an arena for great power competition," Fu said. "The international community should focus on helping African states fully display their strengths, turning their human and resource endowment into real productivity."Africa has seen a steady rise in Chinese peacekeeping activities, including in West Africa, where China has steadily expanded the number and variety of personnel it contributes to UN peacekeeping missions. These include military observers in Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire; medics, engineers and police in Liberia; and armed infantry in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali.Despite China's efforts to help Africa attain security, some experts argue that challenges still exist, and more can be done to achieve peace on the continent.Mikewa Ogada, a security researcher in Kenya, said that China and Africa can make more efforts to give civil society stakeholders in regional peacekeeping efforts a louder voice at future conferences such as the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the China-Africa Peace and Security Forum.This will help highlight the realities of those most affected by conflict in the discussions and improve coordination among stakeholders, she said.otiato@chinadaily.com.cnDiarra Boubacar, a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) expert from Mali, has been working in China for nearly 40 years. Dubbed as the "African Bethune" by locals, he has provided medical care to many while volunteering in remote mountainous areas of Yunnan province. When asked about the title, he expressed humility, acknowledging that he feels honored but believes his contributions are modest compared to those of Norman Bethune. Boubacar also emphasized that health is crucial for prosperity and advocated for African countries to learn from China's successful poverty alleviation experiences.Kenya and other African countries are looking forward to intensifying their practical cooperation with China at the upcoming 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, Kenyan President William Ruto said.In a recent interview with China Daily in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, Ruto expressed optimism that deals will be signed during the summit in areas such as industrialization, renewable energy development, agricultural mechanization, talent building and climate action investments.The summit will be held from Wednesday to Friday in Beijing.Ruto said the combination of Africa's renewable energy resources and Chinese technology would bring benefits to both sides.According to the International Energy Agency, Africa is home to 60 percent of the best solar resources globally, though its installed capacity of solar photovoltaic power is just 1 percent.Ruto said Kenya is already discussing with China the building of additional infrastructure across the country.He said Kenya looks forward to expansion of the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway to become part of a rail link that eventually would connect the East African country with the Atlantic Ocean.Other African countries "are in agreement that this is a piece of infrastructure that we all want done, and collectively we have been engaging the Chinese government on the possibilities and the mechanisms for making sure that the SGR connects the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic", he said.Ruto said Kenya is positioning itself to fully benefit from the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation as well as the Belt and Road Initiative, adding that the success of intra-Africa trade will depend on the availability of transportation infrastructure, including roads and the extension of the standard gauge railway.Kenya is also positioning itself as a leader in matters such as climate action and renewable energy, and the country is looking at how it can tap into Chinese technology to unlock its renewable energy resources, Ruto said.Furthermore, Kenya is positioning itself as a regional and continental technology hub."With China being a leading technology destination, especially in matters of renewable energy, we will be positioning ourselves to see how we can tap into those opportunities that are presented by FOCAC and the BRI to unlock our own potential as a country and to tap into the potential that exists in our continent," he said.He also said Kenya is exploring the possibility of working with Chinese companies in areas like e-mobility, robotics, the internet of things and other new technologies.The nation is also eager to work with China on agricultural modernization, the Kenyan president said, noting that the country's intention is to ensure that agriculture not only provides food security for the population, but also taps into agricultural products to expand the nation's manufacturing capabilities.Regarding China's proposal to support Africa in talent development, he said Kenya is expanding its digital footprint across the country, through rolling out another 100,000 kilometers of fiber-optic cable.He said this move will unlock talent, especially among young people, and opportunities for digital jobs and digital commerce.Ruto said he foresees an expanded relationship between Kenya and China, new partnership opportunities, and further private sector investment opportunities in both countries."I see us exporting more of our avocados, tea and coffee to China ... and this is all in the context of the people-to-people relationship," he said.Meanwhile, as the People's Republic of China prepares to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its founding, Ruto commended the country for its achievements over the past decades.He said China has made tremendous strides in changing its fortunes and unprecedented growth in its economy and human development."We are all aware that China has moved many places ahead of other countries. They have managed to grow their economy, sometimes at double digits, and managed to pull 800 million people out of poverty, which is a very commendable feat," he said."Today, China is the second-largest economy in the world, and also makes a huge contribution to the budget on peacekeeping and the human capital for peacekeeping."Members of the Somali Parliament who recently visited North China's Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanxi province have expressed admiration for China's progress.They were particularly impressed by China's advancements in agriculture and technology, and are looking forward to the upcoming Forum on the 2024 Summit of China-Africa Cooperation scheduled for Sept 4-6.Jama Mohamed Askar, a member of the House of the People Iin Somali finance committee and the Somali-Chinese Parliamentary Friendship Group chairperson, stated, "We aim to emulate the valuable experiences we have gained from China."The delegation of three Somali Parliamentarians participated in the 2024 Interregional Seminar on the Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals for Parliaments of Developing Countries.During their visit to Tianjin on Tuesday, they visited the world's first zero-carbon terminal at Tianjin Port.The trip, which took place from Aug 19-28, was organized by the National People's Congress in China and the Inter-Parliamentary Union.The seminar, attended by 153 parliamentary leaders and legislators from 32 developing countries in Beijing, facilitated discussions and research excursions in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanxi province."We anticipate the participation of our senior leaders in the 2024 Summit of China-Africa Cooperation in early September, and we are confident that the event will enhance diplomatic and economic relations between China and Africa," remarked Askar.KHARTOUM - The death toll from heavy rains hitting so far 10 states in Sudan has reached 138, the country's Health Ministry said Tuesday."A total of 138 deaths have been recorded, while 31,666 families, comprising more than 129,650 people, were affected," the ministry's Autumn Emergency Room said in a statement, adding that 12,420 houses completely collapsed.Meanwhile, Sudan recorded 102 new cases and five new deaths of cholera in five states, bringing the number of total infections and deaths to 1,223 and 48, respectively, the statement said.Flooding is a recurring problem in Sudan, typically occurring between June and October. Recent severe rains have resulted in significant loss of life and damage to agricultural land.Since the war broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in mid-April 2023, epidemic diseases such as cholera, malaria, measles and dengue fever have spread, leaving hundreds dead.On Aug 17, Sudan's Health Minister Haitham Mohamed Ibrahim officially declared a cholera outbreak in the country.The deadly conflict between the SAF and the RSF has resulted in the loss of at least 16,650 lives. An estimated 10.7 million people are now internally displaced in Sudan, with approximately 2.2 million others seeking refuge in neighboring countries, according to most recent UN data.The green economy is a cornerstone of Africa's future development, and collaboration between China and Africa in this sector will play a crucial role in facilitating Africa's green transition, experts said."Energy shortages have long been a challenge for Africa, and the continent is among the most vulnerable to climate change globally. As a result, Africa places significant emphasis on the development of renewable energy," said Zhang Chunyu, an associate researcher at the Institute of West-Asian and African Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.According to the African Union's Agenda 2063, the share of renewable energy in total energy production across the continent is expected to surpass 50 percent by 2063.Zhang pointed out that Africa's green development is still in its early stages and lacks the necessary funding and technical support. "On the other hand, China is a global leader in renewable energy technology and application. Thus, China-Africa cooperation can provide crucial support for Africa's green development."These remarks were made at a symposium held on Tuesday in Beijing for the release of the "Annual Report on Development in Africa No 26 (2023-2024)", compiled by the Institute of West-Asian and African Studies and the China-Africa Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.The report emphasized that the collaboration between China and Africa in the green development sector is making steady progress, with several clean energy projects, such as the low-carbon demonstration zone in Seychelles, being implemented smoothly and receiving high praise from African partners.According to the report, China's exports of new energy vehicles, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products to Africa have seen rapid growth, increasing by 291 percent, 109 percent, and 57 percent year-on-year, respectively. Chinese companies have also scaled up photovoltaic and wind power investments and projects in countries such as Egypt, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia, the report said."China-Africa cooperation in the green energy sector has significantly helped address energy poverty in Africa. Our efforts have primarily focused on two areas: large-scale hydropower projects and photovoltaic projects. Looking ahead, I believe our most crucial contribution will come from advancements in Chinese new energy technologies, which can greatly improve the daily lives and productivity of African residents," Zhang said."Additionally, the transfer of green energy technology resulting from China-Africa cooperation will also provide significant support for the development of Africa's green economy."China's leading social media and online payment platform, WeChat Pay, is set to launch in Kenya, in a move that will free traders from the need to buy dollars to settle transactions directly with their Chinese counterparts.Pyxis, a financial technology company focusing on China-Africa cross-border payments, said it is finalizing a deal that would allow Kenyan traders to make transactions of up to $70,000 via WeChat Pay with their Chinese counterparts in a move that will be a major boost for traders importing goods from China.Speaking on the sidelines of the 2024 China-Africa Digital Financial Inclusion Summit last week, Pyxis' Chief Executive Officer, April Long, said that cross-border payment solutions would help individual traders pay for Chinese products since China remained the number one source of merchandise for African traders."Currently, to trade with China you need to go to a bank, convert your Kenya Shillings into dollars and send the dollars to the trader in China who has to go ask his bank to convert the dollars into Chinese Yuan," Long said.The cross-border payment solution presents a major boost for Kenyan traders, who will benefit from avoiding the often costly and slow process of traditional banking and money transfer systems. Long said that once launched, Pyxis' platform will facilitate person-to-person money transfers between Kenya and China without the need for dollars, with plans in the future to extend this capability to business transactions.Additionally, Kenya's leading mobile operator Safaricom has indicated that it is working to create a link with Alipay, another major online payment platform in China, through its mobile payment solution M-Pesa through a product that will be structured to allow for the transfer of funds from an M-Pesa customer in Kenya to a beneficiary in China. Sylvia Mulinge, Safaricom's chief customer officer said that the goal of this partnership is to develop a super app that offers customers financial services, shopping, merchant services, entertainment, and direct marketing.The introduction of the e-commerce payment solution is expected to boost the growing trade between China and Africa which reached $282 billion last year.Ji Min, director of the Counselor Office at the People's Bank of China, said that the Chinese Yuan could play a bigger role in trade and cooperation between African countries and China, with opportunities for currency swaps and cross-border settlements.Ji added that China is willing to export its financial inclusion model which saw the creation of fintech giants. He pointed out that Chinese authorities gave fintech companies the room to grow with a tolerant, open and supportive regulatory environment and this can also work for Africa."Africa could achieve similar success if countries accelerated digital financial inclusion through regulatory reforms that encouraged financing for small, medium and micro enterprises, as well as agribusiness," Jin said.African countries must urgently address transport and rail bottlenecks by adopting new technology and harmonizing legislation to propel trade and economic growth, South African officials and experts say, calling for further partnership with China.Barbara Creecy, South Africa's minister of transport, said African nations face challenges to improve their outdated railway systems to grow economy and increase competitiveness."These challenges are further complicated by the need for greater regional integration, interoperability and the harmonization of standards to ensure efficient and competitive rail services," Creecy said at the Southern African Railways Association's annual international conference in Johannesburg last week.Railways are crucial for transporting bulk goods such as minerals, agricultural products and energy resources, she said, so rail networks within the Southern African Development Community region are vital for boosting the competitiveness of SADC products and services in the global market."As we look to modernize and expand our rail networks, the need for investment in appropriate skills across logistics, engineering, infrastructure development and digitization cannot be overstated. Investing in these skills today will not only help us address the challenges we face, but will also enable us to take advantage of new opportunities for economic growth and development," she said.Crynos Mutendera, a senior research specialist of the Cross-Border Road Transport Agency in South Africa, told China Daily that Africa's colonial history has led to varying standards and plans for rail and road infrastructure, as different European powers implemented distinct systems during their colonial rule.China has taken part in building major infrastructure projects across Africa, and projects done by Chinese companies are completed in time, Mutendera said.Many Chinese companies offer a "one-stop shop" approach, managing all stages of a project, he said. China's involvement has prompted some former colonial powers to change their engagement strategies with Africa, he added.Self-introspection"The good thing about the Chinese factor is bringing to the fore everybody to do self-introspection and say, 'I think there is something I'm not doing right.' So for them to compete, they have to change the tune. The way the Chinese have come in has brought in constructive competition to help us even in public-private partnerships and coming up with innovative financing solutions."Leslie Mlungisi Mpofu, executive director of Trans Kalahari Corridor Secretariat, urged Africa to improve its rail and road infrastructure and payment methods at border posts to facilitate trade.The Trans Kalahari Corridor is an alternative trade route developed by South Africa, Botswana and Namibia. The secretariat has streamlined trade between these countries by harmonizing legislation on trade, health, customs, transport and enforcement.Mpofu said that in the past, trucks carrying goods could take 24 to 48 hours to clear borders. Simplifications have reduced this time to just 20 to 30 minutes by standardizing border transactions.Additionally, Mpofu urged African countries to work with China to develop innovative financial solutions to developing crucial infrastructure projects. "We know dynamics are not the same but China has come up with their strategy which seems to be working," he said.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.In 2019, Wynn Rajula received a scholarship from the Chinese government to pursue her Master's degree in business administration in China. Despite clearing her education and traveling back to Kenya in 2022, Rajula was so impressed by the education system in China that she decided to go back to pursue her Doctor of Philosophy degree.Rajula is among 19 Kenyan students who have received scholarships this year from the Chinese embassy in Kenya to pursue further studies in China. While addressing her fellow students at the embassy located in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Thursday during a farewell reception for the scholarship winners, Rajula said that Kenya and China have a lot in common and this makes it easy for Kenyan students to benefit from Chinese education.As someone who has been to China before, Rajula assured students who are going to China for the first time that Kenya and China have more similarities than differences. She pointed out that she decided to go back to China for further studies since China's education system is advanced, the community is open and welcoming and the system offers a good work-study balance and students get wholesome development."Beyond formal education, students should ensure that they learn the Chinese language and culture which has several positive attitudes like the culture of saving money. You also get the chance to develop other talents like sports and other extracurricular activities due to the excellent facilities offered," Rajula said.Zhang Zhizhong, minister counselor at the Chinese embassy in Kenya told the young learners that China is a big book to read and offers a rich 5,000-year long history of continuous civilization, an abundant cultural heritage and economic success. He asked them to observe and learn from China's past and present struggles and use the knowledge to improve their country back home."This connection between individuals and times does not go only one way. We hope that the scholarship awardees are not only witnesses and beneficiaries but will also be contributors and promoters for the progress of China-Kenya and China-Africa friendship," Zhang said.Beatrice Muganda, Kenya's principal secretary in the ministry of education pointed out that China has sponsored well over 2,000 students for further studies in recent years and this has played a great role in improving Kenya's human capital.Through the scholarship, she said that China has played an important part in fast-tracking support for local research, innovation and development while helping Kenya meet the rising need for higher education.Muganda added that the students who have been awarded scholarships to study at various education levels that include undergraduate, Masters and PhD levels will be lucky to pursue courses that are relevant to the rapidly changing world at some of the best institutions of higher learning globally.CAPE TOWN — The Chinese naval hospital ship Peace Ark, which is on the Mission Harmony-2024, arrived in South Africa on Thursday. The seven-day visit is the ship's first in South Africa.In addition to providing medical services, Peace Ark's medical expert teams will administer treatment in local hospitals and conduct academic exchanges on traditional Chinese medicine in the Confucius Institute for Chinese Medicine at the University of the Western Cape, according to China Military Online.Mission Harmony-2024, the 10th for Peace Ark since its commissioning in 2008, started on June 16 when the ship set sail from a military port in Zhoushan, East China's Zhejiang province.During the mission, the hospital ship provided medical treatment to nearly 1,200 people per day in the Seychelles and welcomed a baby born on the ship in Tanzania, said Zhang Xiaogang, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, at a media conference on July 25. The ship will visit 13 countries for the mission and provide medical services to the locals.There are over 100 personnel on board the maritime hospital, featuring 17 clinical departments and five auxiliary diagnostic departments.Peace Ark is the first domestically designed and constructed standard ocean-going hospital ship in China. It had visited 45 countries and regions in previous missions, providing medical services to over 290,000 people.XinhuaGABORONE, Botswana — A massive 2,492-carat diamond, the second largest in the world, has been discovered in Botswana, the Canadian mining company that found the stone announced on Thursday.The diamond was discovered in the Karowe diamond mine in northeastern Botswana using X-ray detection technology, Lucara Diamond said in a statement.Lucara did not provide an estimation of the value of the find. Financial Times reported that people close to Lucara estimated that the stone could be worth upward of $40 million.In terms of carats, the stone is second only to the 3,106-carat Cullinan diamond discovered in South Africa in 1905."We are ecstatic about the recovery of this extraordinary 2,492-carat diamond," William Lamb, president and CEO of Lucara, said.This find was "one of the largest rough diamonds ever unearthed" and detected using the company's Mega Diamond Recovery X-ray technology installed in 2017 to identify and preserve large, high-value diamonds, the statement said.Naseem Lahri, managing director of Lucara Botswana, presented the translucent stone, which is the size of a palm, to Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi at his office later on Thursday.Lucara said it pays a royalty of 10 percent of the gross sales value of diamonds produced from Karowe to the government, regardless of whether the diamond is sold rough or polished."With a diamond of this magnitude, I can see roads being built," said Masisi, as he posed for pictures with the huge stone.Tobias Kormind, managing director of Europe's largest online diamond jeweler 77 Diamonds, confirmed it was the largest rough diamond to be unearthed since the Cullinan diamond. Cullinan was cut into gems, some of which form part of the British Crown Jewels.Agencies Via Xinhua"The saying that China is coming to colonize Africa is absolutely not true," said Adetoro Banwo, deputy director of the Confucius Institute at the University of Lagos at the 6th Forum on China-Africa Media Cooperation & China-Africa Think Tank High-Level Dialogue on August 21. He also stated that these were the first common core values that built the relationship between China and Africa, such as trade, economic interest, diplomacy and trust.Wang Xiaojie contributed to this story. Luc Bendza, the first representative of the African Film Association (AFA) in China, was once a martial artist. In 1983, at the age of just 14, he came from Gabon to the Shaolin Temple in Henan to learn Chinese Kung Fu. He also previously served as a torchbearer for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and expressed that African people greatly admire Chinese athletes like Lin Dan, Guo Jingjing, and Ma Lin.He also noted that sports exchanges are conducive to fostering friendship between China and Africa.Luc Bendza, the first representative of the African Film Association (AFA) in China, emphasized the widespread popularity of Chinese TV shows in Africa. He noted that The Legend of Zhenhuan ranks as a top favorite for its resonance with similar ancient narratives in Africa.Bendza also calls for enhanced cooperation between China and Africa in the film industry, hoping that African productions will soon be appreciated by Chinese audiences.The surge in digital financial tools in Africa through mobile phone connectivity has broadened financial access but is hindered by lack of access to affordable clean energy, experts who had gathered in Kenya's capital Nairobi said on Wednesday, adding that China-Africa cooperation can help bridge the continent's access-to-energy gap.Speaking during the China-Africa Digital Financial Inclusion Summit 2024, Bei Duoguang, president of the Chinese Academy of Financial Inclusion at Renmin University of China, said the focus in Africa should be covering the last mile in energy connectivity in order to bring people in far-flung areas into the financial systems.Bei cited the example of Kenya's M-Pesa virtual banking system, which is supported by the Huawei Mobile Money Platform as an innovative way, through which Africa uses digital technology to handle financial services. However, people in areas with no electricity find it difficult to use such solutions because simple tasks like charging a phone are a challenge.According to the International Energy Agency, 600 million people in Africa lack power supply, Bei said. "However, Africa has a huge potential in renewable energy like solar, which can help connect farmers and businesses to reliable energy," he said.Reflecting on the upcoming Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, or FOCAC, summit to be held in Beijing next month, Christine Mwangi, regional coordinator for NGO World Wide Fund for Nature in Africa, said the pledge to increase trade between China and Africa can be met through agriculture.Challenge remainsMwangi commended the cooperation between Africa and China in areas such as value addition promotion and manufacturing. However, the need for clean and affordable energy to help farmers in processes such as value addition or sustainable manufacturing remains a challenge.She urged policymakers in Africa and China to establish funds through avenues like the FOCAC for providing energy access in agriculture and manufacturing since sustainable agriculture is the best way to conserve environment and ensure biodiversity.Ji Min, director of the Counselor Office at the People's Bank of China, said they are working toward green investments, especially in businesses involved in renewable energy like wind and solar energy for small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas.Ji lauded Egypt for using this path to successfully issue a three-year Sustainability Panda Bond worth $478.7 million last year. It is the first country in the Middle East and Africa to issue such bonds in the Chinese financial market, underscoring China and Egypt's commitment to driving sustainable development, Ji said.The daylong summit brought together more than 100 participants. They included professionals from the banking and financial sector, government officials as well as experts from development and trade institutions in China and Africa.After completing his university studies in 2017, Nyambo Obed, who is from Rwanda, benefited from Chinese farming technology.While unemployed, he took a training course on agriculture featuring Juncao technology, which was organized by the China-United Nations Peace and Development Trust Fund.In five years, Obed became a farmer employing dozens of people and producing a wide range of products, including food, animal feed and fertilizer."Juncao technology has not only changed my life, but has also made me a champion in my village, helping others out of poverty. Thanks to it, I am now able to support the livelihoods of dozens of families on my own," Obed told Fu Cong, China's permanent representative to the UN, when Fu visited his farm in Rwanda.Juncao technology is an agricultural invention using chopped grass as a substrate for growing edible and medicinal mushrooms. Invented in the 1980s by Lin Zhanxi from China's Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, the technology has benefited more than 100 countries, including Rwanda, according to Xinhua News Agency."Today, I can proudly say that my mushroom business has enabled me to create jobs for over 20 people in my community, helping them lift themselves out of poverty," he told The New Times, a Rwandan news agency.Two weeks ago, Fu traveled with senior UN Secretariat officials and Lin to visit farms using Juncao technology in Rwanda and Tanzania.The technology "symbolizes the successful practices explored by the Chinese people in the course of poverty reduction and eradication and epitomizes China's practical actions to support the realization of sustainable development in the Global South," Fu said at a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday.The farming technology has been promoted and adopted in 107 countries around the globe, bringing hope for tackling problems of poverty, food security and employment, Fu noted."China is ready to work with the international community to help more developing countries realize independent development," he added.Juncao technology is one of the priority projects carried out under the China-United Nations Peace and Development Trust Fund. Established in 2015, the fund has so far supported about 150 projects in the Global South.Fu called the fund an "important support for the UN in promoting the sustainable development agenda and maintaining international peace and security".Jainaba Sonko, a journalist from Gambian media, shared that Gambian audiences love watching Chinese Kung Fu films. She grew up watching the work of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. Jainaba mentioned that Chinese movies are very unique, and after watching them, Gambian children are eager to learn Chinese Kung Fu."China has helped Tanzania in constructing Tanzania-Zambia railway," said Mlay Doreen Estomih, Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation editor, at the 6th Forum on China-Africa Media Cooperation & China-Africa Think Tank High-Level Dialogue on August 21.

Kakuru Dassy, a Ugandan student at Xiangtan University in Hunan province, noted that the expressway has significantly transformed transportation in Uganda and boosted the country's economic growth.Working together to realize modernization and strengthening unity among members of the vast Global South should be prioritized amid the looming challenges worldwide, said senior officials and experts from China and Africa.They made the remarks on Wednesday at the 6th Forum on China-Africa Media Cooperation&China-Africa Think Tank High-Level Dialogue, a key Sino-African exchange event held in Beijing. It convened ahead of the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which is scheduled in Beijing from Sept 4 to 6.Addressing the opening ceremony of the event, Li Shulei, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, said that Chinese and African media organizations and think tanks are expected to tell great stories about China-Africa friendship and cooperation, and their shoulder-to-shoulder endeavors in the new era.Li called on media organizations and think tanks from both sides to "make their voices better heard through various means", such as joint interviews, information exchanges, audiovisual cooperation and think tank dialogues.They should "join hands to safeguard international justice and continuously bolster the representation and voice of the Global South", he said.In a written message sent to the event, Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union Commission, said that media organizations "play a role in bridging China and Africa to better understand each other's past and present", while think tanks "pool their experiences and offer advice on tackling behaviors that affect climate change, jeopardize global peace and security, and seriously undermine sustainable development".He said: "Let the world hear our call for hope, resilience and progress. Let us together shape a future where the media promotes solidarity and shared prosperity."Mahamat called for encouraging exchange programs and scholarship programs for media professionals, collaborative reporting, use of data journalism, establishment of media innovation labs, and emphasis on multilingual support and improved translation capacity.Gao Xiang, president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that both the Chinese path to modernization and the African path to modernization "are writing unprecedented chapters in history, and they are different from the West's modernization built on colonialism and looting"."China is willing to work with African countries to support each other, collaborate vigorously and join hands to promote the modernization process for the benefit of the people of China and Africa," Gao said.The spirit of self-reliance and shared cultural memories have been giving a constant boost to mutual respect and amity between China and African nations, according to African dignitaries who attended Wednesday's event.Noting that the Global South has a shared history, Thierry Lezin Moungalla, minister of communication and media of the Republic of Congo and a spokesman for the Congolese government, said that history should be "written by ourselves" through "our own languages, sensitivity and cultures".He added: "Because we have to live together in such a world and show solidarity, we have to build bridges instead of putting up barriers. New models of cooperation emerge from this."Laurence Ndong, minister of communication and media of Gabon and a spokeswoman for the Gabonese government, said that China is a country that is popular among all ordinary people in Gabon, and the screening of Chinese martial arts films had a great impact on the Central African country from the 1960s to the 1980s."For our generation, we all grew up under the influence of the movie Shaolin Temple. We were all saddened by the departure of Bruce Lee, a lasting part in our memory. And we are also very familiar with Jackie Chan," she said.This year marks the 50th anniversary of China-Gabon diplomatic relations.Noting that China is an experienced player at the forefront of the artificial intelligence sector, the minister said the two countries should work together in good faith to "prevent risks and seize the opportunities presented by AI", which Gabon needs very much right now.zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com.cnWensel Mavara, the chairperson of Namibia Daily News, stated that western media frequently spread fake news to tarnish China's reputation and further their own economic agendas, in response to a question from China Daily. He made the remarks at the 6th Forum on China-Africa Media Cooperation & China-Africa Think Tank High-Level Dialogue on Wednesday.Grégoire Ndjaka, CEO of the African Union of Broadcasting, asserts that China is an essential partner in African countries' modernization.Thierry Moungalla, minister of communication and media from the Republic of the Congo, who is also the country's government spokesperson, shouts "Long live China-Africa cooperation!" at the 6th Forum on China-Africa Media Cooperation & China-Africa Think Tank High-Level Dialogue, drawing enthusiastic applause.On Aug 21, Wensel Mavara, the Chairperson of the Board of Namibia Daily News, expressed his admiration for Chinese technology at the 6th Forum on China-Africa Media Cooperation & China-Africa Think Tank High-Level Dialogue. He noted that China is making significant progress in technology and that many Namibians are fond of using Huawei smartphones.The upcoming Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summit will offer hope to a world that is in turmoil and contribute to fostering peace and prosperity in the African continent, African politicians and experts said.They anticipate that through the FOCAC framework, China and Africa will persist in mutually supporting each other's efforts to enhance economic development, peace and security.Khamis Omar, Tanzania's ambassador to China, said that he has witnessed "very high enthusiasm" in both Africa and China during preparations for the 2024 FOCAC summit, which will be held in Beijing in early September."I have also witnessed an extremely high degree of cooperation and understanding," he said. "I have no doubt whatsoever that the summit will be a complete success and will live up to expectations."He said that China and Africa have fundamentally agreed on areas of cooperation that have shaped the previous FOCAC programs. Hence there should be continuity on what both sides have started and there may be some adjustments needed to accommodate the latest dynamics."The cooperation should broadly be anchored around our common quest for economic modernization and transformation, development, peace and security, and cultural exchange," he said.Both sides already have taken various initiatives that will need new impetus for implementation. The action plan drawn from the Beijing Summit will not deviate far from these areas, he added.Nasser Bouchiba, president of the Africa-China Cooperation Association for Development in Morocco, said the convening of FOCAC comes as the world faces increasing turbulence and challenges, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Israel-Palestine conflict, the food crisis in certain countries and climate change."FOCAC brings hope, with China offering projects that promote peace and development," he said.Over the past few years, Bouchiba has been collaborating with Chinese enterprises to export China's independently-developed new technologies to developing countries. For example, he has introduced China's seawater desalination technology to his home country of Morocco, where drinking water resources are extremely scarce."This technology, characterized by its short implementation cycle and high cost-effectiveness, meets the increasingly severe drinking water demands of Morocco's coastal cities," he said.Furthermore, he began an experimental desert farming project in 2020, bringing cutting-edge soil enhancement technologies from Northwest China to the southeast part of Morocco. The positive outcomes are making people in arid areas optimistic about sustainable agriculture, which could reduce poverty and promote food security and stability, he added."There is significant potential for cooperation between China and Africa in the fields of technology and sustainable development. Unlike Western countries, China is very willing to transfer technology and know-how to Africa, which will greatly contribute to the economic development of Africa and the improvement of people's livelihoods," he said.He hoped that the FOCAC would better serve as a platform to promote China-Africa cooperation, focusing on the interest of people and discussing development-oriented topics. Moreover, successful cooperation cases should also be promoted to other parts of Africa to help with their development, he added.Ehizuelen Michael Mitchell Omoruyi, executive director of the Center for Nigerian Studies at the Institute of African Studies in Zhejiang Normal University, said that China acknowledges the importance of global cooperation, and plays an important role in enhancing African security by partnering with African countries, which is reflected in bilateral and multilateral Africa-China relations. The FOCAC platform and action plans have concentrated exclusively on Chinese-African cooperation and engagement in peace and security."All of these not only help mitigate the challenges posed by insecurity on the continent, but are also a clear indication that China is willing to support African countries in maintaining regional security and combating terrorism, and maritime piracy," he said.He added that China has always been a willing and reliable partner in helping African countries address their pressing socioeconomic challenges. China's cooperation with Africa in tech innovations has made progress in recent years, with China proactively implementing tech innovation action plans under the Belt and Road Initiative and sharing sci-tech feats and experiences with numerous African nations.KINSHASA - The ongoing mpox outbreak has been declared a "continental emergency", according to Roger Kamba, health minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), speaking on Monday.Kamba reported that since the beginning of this year, the DRC has so far documented 16,700 confirmed or suspected cases of mpox, including more than 570 deaths, an increase from the 15,664 suspected cases and 548 deaths reported last week.In December 2022, the DRC declared a national outbreak of mpox, prompting the establishment of an incident management system since February 2023 based on the increasing number of reported cases.The disease, affecting 17 African countries and several others outside the continent, is notably impacting younger populations, particularly children under 15, said Kamba, describing this as a "novelty" in the context of the outbreak."But I remind you that the vaccine is only part of the response; the first line of defense is adherence to preventive measures," said the minister, specifying that the country would receive a batch of mpox vaccines next week.The health minister also noted that the government's interventions have helped prevent a larger-scale spread within the country.The World Health Organization (WHO) declared last Wednesday that mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, a public health emergency of international concern, raising alarms about its potential for increased global transmission, following an initial announcement on July 23, 2022.The WHO's declaration came after the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the ongoing mpox outbreak constitutes a public health emergency for the continent.According to the African Union's health agency, the number of new mpox cases reported in 2024 represents a 160 percent increase compared to the same period in 2023.According to the WHO, the current outbreak, spreading from the DRC, has been exacerbated by the emergence of a more lethal new variant of the virus, Clade 1b, which has a mortality rate estimated at 3.6 percent, significantly higher than previous strains.Kenya's Kenyatta University has introduced a four-year bachelor's degree in Chinese culture and language, becoming the latest institute of higher learning in the country to offer Chinese language as a major in the hope of fostering cultural integration.The major will be offered at the university's Confucius Institute, and more than 300 students are expected to enroll in the degree program this September, said Nyambura Salome, director of the Confucius Institute at Kenyatta University.The quest for Kenyans to learn Chinese culture and language is growing and that is why the university has launched a full four-year course that will cater to the needs of the students, she said.The university has recently received more than 1,000 books about Chinese language and culture from China's Shandong Normal University to help students better understand Chinese culture and language, she said.Salome also said Kenyatta University has partnerships with secondary schools and primary schools in Kenya."Some of the books will also go to these primary schools and secondary schools because we have children who are learning the Chinese language, and we also have teachers who are in those schools," she said. "Our goal is to help these children learn the Chinese language and culture at a younger age."The Chinese language is gaining popularity in Kenya in recent years, boosted by intensified exchanges and economic cooperation. In addition to major universities, such as the University of Nairobi, that have been offering Chinese as a degree program, more institutes and schools have included Chinese as an elective course.Recently, Kenya adopted Chinese as one of its foreign languages to be studied by students at the secondary school level in its new education curriculum.More teachersAs more university students study Chinese language during their bachelor's degree courses in Kenya, the shortage of competent Chinese teachers at secondary schools in the country will ease, Salome said.Caroline Njomo, a diploma student at the Confucius Institute at Kenyatta University, said she fell in love with Chinese culture and language."My love for foreign languages is what attracted me to explore Chinese languages and I found out it's a beautiful culture," she said. "I have a dream of working and living in China in the future."Njomo added that parents should let their children learn the Chinese language at an early age."It will be best if children from the age of 12 years can be allowed to study Chinese as a subject at a lower secondary level as this can direct them to a new career path in China," she said.Felicity Kendi, who is currently pursuing a certificate course in Chinese culture and language at the university, said she also intends to enroll in the new major this year."The world is a global village and we can no longer stick to one language and that's the reason I want to pursue a bachelor's in Chinese culture and language as one of my foreign languages," she said. "My goal is to learn at least 10 foreign languages and finally pursue a career in international relations and diplomacy."Waceke Wanjohi, acting vice-chancellor of Kenyatta University, said teachers sent from China are providing training in Chinese language and culture at the university, adding that more efforts can be made to intensify training of local students and teachers and increase exchange programs to improve their skills.Luo Duoduo, a lecturer at the Confucius Institute at Kenyatta University, said many Kenyans pursuing Chinese culture and language are eyeing careers at the global level."They believe that with a foreign language like Chinese, they stand a chance of getting employed by international organizations," Luo said.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.African diplomats to Kenya have expressed strong optimism for the upcoming Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summit, viewing it as an opportunity to further deepen ties and chart new paths of cooperation toward building a China-Africa community with a shared future.The diplomats, having toured key Belt and Road Initiative projects in Kenya, including the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway, lauded the initiative for transforming the continent's infrastructure network and consequently boosting economic growth.Anouar Ben Youssef, Tunisia's ambassador to Kenya, said the FOCAC summit, scheduled for Sept 4-6 in Beijing, will provide a chance to reaffirm China's engagement with Africa across various sectors beyond infrastructure."The summit will also be an opportunity to exchange new views and opportunities for a stronger cooperation between China and Africa," he said.Youssef emphasized China's readiness to support Africa and urged countries across the continent to align their needs with internal development plans.Many BRI projects in Kenya reflect China's interest and commitment to help African countries develop in strategic fields such as communications and transport, he said.Despite the West's unfounded accusations that China is burdening Africa with debt, the evidence of significant infrastructure development across the continent demonstrates China's role as a key partner.This is in addition to the interest shown by African countries in maintaining and furthering their relationship with China.Sanyu Manday, counselor at the Uganda High Commission in Kenya, said she expects African countries to propose development projects at the FOCAC summit and hopes China can help explore ways to assist in their implementation."For Uganda, we are looking at constructing a Standard Gauge Railway to connect with the Kenyan one to further ease transportation and improve trade," she said.Regional approachManday said she believes that African countries should seek financing and development for BRI projects as a region rather than individually.This approach, currently being considered by the East African Community, could secure better investment rates and improve economies of scale.Projects such as the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway could help in regional integration, improve transportation and foster collective growth among regional countries, she said.Manday also thanked China for its practical engagement with African countries through models such as public-private partnerships, as was the case with the Nairobi Expressway project.At a time when Africa is facing high debt challenges and the pressing need for infrastructure projects to boost socioeconomic development, Manday said the public-private partnership model is the way to go."We appreciate that Africa has a partner who understands us, can move with us and help us get out of our transportation constraints," she said.Engagement strategyDamptey Bediako Asare, Ghana's high commissioner to Kenya, said each African country should go to the FOCAC summit with an understanding of their development needs and a strategy on how they want to engage China.He said it should be clear to them whether they want to engage China as a continent or individually and whether the African Union should negotiate on behalf of the continent."To benefit fully from the BRI, African countries must prepare adequately, understand what they need, understand their development needs and be able to negotiate effectively," Asare said.Andrew Sesinyi, Botswana's high commissioner to Kenya, said not only is China a good friend of Africa, but the level of bilateral cooperation is also on the rise."The relationship between China and Africa is not a scenario of a relationship between the wolf and the lamb. It's a true cooperation based on equity and mutual benefits," he said.The BRI projects visited by diplomats in Kenya reflect Africa's efforts to attract true partners and investors, he said."It's a global village; nobody is going to make it on their own. Whether the developed world or the developing world, we need cooperation," Sesinyi said.Zhou Pingjian, Chinese ambassador to Kenya, said through the joint efforts by China and Africa, this year's FOCAC summit will be a great success."The summit will be an event to celebrate China-Africa friendship, explore cooperation and chart the course for the future under the theme of joining hands to advance modernization and build a high-level China-Africa community with a shared future," he said.Financial assistance from China has played a crucial role in infrastructure development in Africa since the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, or FOCAC, was established, paving the way for economic prosperity, observers said, adding that Sino-African cooperation will help address emerging challenges facing the continent such as climate change.Lucas Engel, a data analyst for the Global China Initiative at the Boston University Global Development Policy Center in the United States, said while the volume of lending from China to Africa has decreased in the last few years, it has overall added to the vast amount of cumulative Chinese financing for development projects in Africa over the years.Speaking at an online seminar ahead of the FOCAC summit scheduled in Beijing in September, Engel said that since the establishment of FOCAC, the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank have made great loan commitments to Africa, with the majority directed toward vital infrastructure projects in energy, transport, and information and communications technology sectors.He said over the years, areas such as infrastructure, agriculture, energy transition, trade and economic integration have become prominent areas of engagement. He also believes that the upcoming FOCAC meeting will further reveal the extent of shifts in China's contributions to Africa's development.Major platformFollowing the establishment of FOCAC, a major cooperation platform between China and Africa, in 2000, China's economic relations with the African continent have grown and developed significantly.Over the last two decades, China has become Africa's largest bilateral trading partner. Experts also said China has emerged as a main financial contributor to Africa, providing African countries with a new source of infrastructure, mining and energy financing.One of the key projects financed by China is the iconic Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway, which links the two biggest cities in Kenya. The railway is expected to boost the country's annual economic growth by at least 1.5 percent, according to Kenyan experts.Dianah Ngui Muchai, a research manager at Kenyan-based NGO African Economic Research Consortium, said China has become a significant partner for many African countries, with a focus on sectors such as infrastructure development, natural resources, and manufacturing, which contribute to the development of many African countries.Looking forward, Muchai said more bilateral cooperation is expected under FOCAC that caters to the pressing needs of African countries, such as renewable energy, as Africa seeks to meet its rising energy demands and move toward sustainable energy sources."Given Africa's current economic challenges and energy opportunities, the next phase of China-Africa economic relations should see China playing a bigger role in contributing to African countries' low-carbon development goals," she added.The upcoming 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation is expected to bear fruitful results to further deepen Sino-African relations, according to observers in Africa.Alan Khan, senior director of corporate affairs at Durban University of Technology in Durban, South Africa, said the summit, to be held from Sept 4 to 6 in Beijing, is expected to strengthen the strategic partnership between Africa and China.With the African Development Bank estimating that Africa's need for infrastructure funding is between $130 billion and $170 billion annually, Khan said the FOCAC summit will present an opportunity to address such a challenge."China is currently the biggest trading partner with the African continent, and therefore this partnership is highly important for all the involved parties, since these economies are interdependent," said Khan. "The summit presents an opportunity to deepen cooperation in areas such as education, infrastructure development, healthcare and technology. We anticipate concrete commitments and action plans that will drive sustainable development and mutual growth."As African countries intensify efforts to boost intra-Africa trade, quality infrastructure, such as roads and railways, is needed to support the free movement of goods and support trade on the continent, Khan said. Therefore, it is likely that the FOCAC summit will prioritize infrastructure development to enhance connectivity between African countries, as well as connectivity between China and Africa as a whole, he added."This connectivity is the engine that drives economic growth and feeds into" the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, which has drawn the participation of 44 sub-Saharan African countries, Khan said.The upcoming summit, similar to previous FOCAC meetings, is expected to discuss educational exchanges and research, which will help boost scholarships and collaborative research projects to stimulate innovation and skills development in Africa, he said.In addition, more cooperation is expected in areas that will boost the sustainable and long-term development of Africa, such as healthcare and green technologies, he said, adding that these priorities are essential for fostering long-term sustainable growth and improving the quality of life across the African continent."FOCAC has been highly beneficial in nurturing China-Africa relations," Khan said. "There have been significant investments in roads, railways and ports that have improved trade and mobility for many African nations. There have been joint efforts in combating diseases like Ebola and COVID-19, including improving healthcare infrastructure and capacities for some countries in Africa. In terms of people-to-people exchange, important exchange mechanisms and platforms have been established under FOCAC."One of the numerous projects supported by FOCAC in Africa is an institute at Durban University of Technology that supports technology, innovation and entrepreneurship, and promotes vocational training that aligns with local needs, he said.Khan said he also expects that more projects will be established across Africa that will improve inclusive development, benefiting all segments of society, and will align with environmental sustainability goals in order to mitigate climate change impacts on many African countries.Oliver Bulaya, a prominent advocate of smart agriculture in Zambia, said that under FOCAC, increased Chinese investment and development initiatives have had a significant impact on local communities in the nation over the past two decades.He said he hopes that future cooperation will focus more on addressing environmental and social challenges for local communities, so that FOCAC can contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive development path for Zambia.Meanwhile, speaking with representatives of the Chinese community in Kenya at a meeting on Aug 6, Musalia Mudavadi, Kenya's prime cabinet secretary, said the upcoming FOCAC summit will renew practical cooperation with China in a wide range of areas, such as trade and investment, green financing, affordable housing and people-to-people exchanges.Khan, from South Africa, said that Chinese engagement in Africa is different from that of the former colonial powers and some other major nations."Chinese engagement often focuses on mutual benefit and noninterference, prioritizing development and long-term investments," he said. "In contrast, Western partners sometimes emphasize governance reforms and conditional aid. China's approach has been appreciated for its focus on practical development outcomes and respecting domestic sovereignty."Ndumiso Mlilo is a freelance writer for China Daily.A Chinese institute is collaborating with a Kenyan publisher to translate a number of Kenyan literature works into Chinese language, a major boost to cultural exchanges and mutual understanding between the two countries.The Foreign Literature Research Center of Shanghai Normal University is seeking collaboration with the Kenya Literature Bureau, to translate famous Kenyan English literary works to give the Chinese community a deeper understanding of Kenya's rich cultural and literary heritage.The cooperation will also focus on translation of representative works on Kenyan English literature studies, translation of the latest research achievements in Chinese African literature studies, and mutual visits for literary and cultural exchanges and mutual learning.Both parties hope that through the collaboration, the Chinese literature will also be translated into English and Kiswahili in the near future so that Kenyans can learn more about the Chinese civilization.Kenneth Jumba, publishing manager at the Kenya Literature Bureau, expressed gratitude for the cooperation intentions, noting that it will expose Kenyan authors and culture to the Far East.He said by availing Kenyan literature to the Chinese market and vise versa, in addition to the teaching of the Chinese language and culture by the Confucius Institutes at the Kenyan universities and schools, will open the understanding between people from the two countries, consequently promoting trade cooperation."To Kenya Literature Bureau, this partnership will open a window for us to offer our books to the world market as well as promote cultural exchanges," Jumba said.Zhu Zhenwu, the director of Foreign Literature Research Center of Shanghai Normal University, said Kenya is recognized as a significant nation contributing to the body of literature in English.He said his institution has published 10-volume studies in African literature series, the first major national project on African literature "History of African English Literature" in China, funded by the National Publishing Fund.While the series focuses on literature in English, it also includes literature in French, Portuguese and Arabic.It divides African literature into four regions: Southern African literature, Western African literature, Central African literature, and Eastern and Northern African literature, which are divided into "classic" and "selected" sections.The two literary sections complement each other, trying to restore the original face of African literature, so as to facilitate readers and researchers in various countries to understand and study African literature more comprehensively.Basically, the study of African English literature examines the impact of colonization on the development of modern African nations.It engages in intellectual debates on the thematic and artistic portrayal, as well as the theoretical criticism of specific African literary works.It showcases the current state of theoretical involvement in Chinese research of African literature in English and offers a profound understanding of the collision and fusion between traditional African culture and Western culture."Chinese people know some African literature. We can't compare it with literature in the US and the UK. This is why I spend years working on it," he said.Zhu said the intention of his institution is to rewrite the history of the literature of the African continent to drive civilization between countries and people."The World literature is basically the literature written by Western scholars - the US, UK, Germany, France and Japan. Mostly, it does not include African literature. Africa has plenty of literature but most of the western scholars ignore it," he said, adding that they plan to write the history of the literature of each of the African countries.As a close friend and admirer of the Chinese path to development, I often reflect on its remarkable success. I once met Zeyede Tesfaye, a person who had the opportunity to study in China on a scholarship, and I was eager to hear about his experiences. His stories were captivating and enlightening. In today's world, while many look to the East or West for inspiration, I find myself drawn to the Eastern approach to development.The remarkable journey of Zeyede, from a scholarship recipient in China to a key employee in a Chinese company in Ethiopia, serves as a powerful testament to the positive impact of Chinese companies on Ethiopian development. His story is one of transformation, inspiration, and valuable insights that can guide Ethiopia on its path to progress.Zeyede first encountered Chinese culture a decade ago when he received a Chinese government scholarship to study at Nankai University in Tianjin. Over the course of five years, he immersed himself in the Chinese way of life, gaining a deep understanding of the language, culture, cuisine, and social norms. This profound cultural immersion equipped Zeyede with unique insights that proved invaluable when he returned to Ethiopia and began working with the China First Highway Engineering Company CFHEC.In his role at CFHEC, initially focused on language translation and human resources administration, observing and participating in the Chinese work culture firsthand. He noted that one of the most striking aspects of working with Chinese companies is their punctuality and dedication to project completion. This commitment to timeliness, coupled with a culture of hard work and advanced technological applications in the workplace, left a lasting impression on him.Zeyede's experiences highlight several key elements of Chinese work culture that could serve as valuable lessons for Ethiopia: Chinese companies are renowned for their efficiency in managing and completing projects on time. This stems from meticulous planning and a strong sense of responsibility toward deadlines. Ethiopians can benefit from adopting a similar approach to project management, ensuring that timelines are adhered to and projects are delivered efficiently.The dedication to hard work is a hallmark of Chinese culture. Zeyede emphasizes that the relentless work ethic of the Chinese, even in the face of challenges, is something Ethiopians can emulate. The focus on hard work can drive significant progress and development.The use of technology in the workplace is another area where Chinese companies excel. By integrating advanced technological solutions, they enhance productivity and efficiency. Ethiopian companies can learn from this approach and invest in technology to streamline their operations and improve outcomes.Chinese companies have been instrumental in creating jobs in Ethiopia, providing sustainable income for many families. This not only boosts the economy but also aids in skill development. Zeyede himself has benefited from permanent employment, enabling him to support his family sustainably. He underscores that China's rapid development over the past 50 years is a testament to what can be achieved with determination and strategic planning. Unlike Western nations that have had centuries to build their economies, China's success story is relatively recent and full of valuable lessons:The path to success is rarely smooth. China's development journey has been marked by numerous challenges, yet their persistence has paid off. Ethiopians can draw inspiration from this and remain steadfast in the face of obstacles, understanding that progress requires resilience.Zeyede addresses a common misconception about Chinese products. While some may complain about the quality, it's essential to recognize that China has the capability to produce world-class products for those willing to invest. For others, they offer accessible and affordable alternatives, ensuring products are available for a wide range of consumers.Chinese government's generosity in providing scholarships to young, energetic individuals such as Zeyede demonstrates their commitment to fostering global talent. This is a valuable lesson for Ethiopia, highlighting the importance of investing in education and training for the younger generation to drive future development. His experience with Chinese companies underscores the potential benefits of adopting certain aspects of the Chinese working culture in Ethiopia. Hard work, effective time management, and resource utilization are key takeaways that can help build a robust work culture in Ethiopia.Moreover, fostering strong bilateral relations and learning from China's development model can accelerate Ethiopia's growth. As Ethiopia continues its development journey, incorporating these lessons can ensure that the path to success is not only achievable but also sustainable.Zeyede's journey from a scholarship recipient in China to a key employee in a Chinese company in Ethiopia highlights the profound impact of cross-cultural exchanges and the valuable lessons that can be learned. By embracing the principles of hard work, technological integration, and efficient project management, Ethiopia can look forward to a promising future of development and prosperity.KHARTOUM -- The death toll from the heavy rains, which have hit many Sudanese states, has climbed to 53, Sudan's Health Ministry said on Saturday."A total of 208 injuries have been recorded, including 53 deaths, while 9,777 families were affected," the ministry's Autumn Emergency Room said in a statement.Nine states were affected, while more than 2,000 houses completely collapsed, and over 4,000 houses partially collapsed, it said.The room added that 25 new cases of acute watery diarrhea were recorded on Friday, bringing the total cases to 192 in three states, including Kassala, Khartoum, and Gezira.Flooding, a yearly occurrence in Sudan, typically happens between June and October. Over the past three years, heavy rains have claimed hundreds of lives and destroyed vast swathes of agricultural land.ADDIS ABABA - Ethiopia has vaccinated over 10 million people as part of a national campaign to contain the spread of an ongoing cholera outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.In a statement issued Wednesday, the WHO said that two years after the cholera outbreak began in August 2022, the East African country has continued to battle the disease, with a recent increase in the number of cases.A national oral cholera vaccination campaign, launched recently to protect at-risk populations covering 89 districts across eight regions in Ethiopia, has achieved 98.4 percent coverage, vaccinating over 10.19 million people, it said.As part of the anti-cholera efforts, multi-sectoral stakeholders have also implemented response measures to contain transmission, including house-to-house disinfection, water testing and treatment, and latrine construction.The WHO stressed that the lack of funding is severely impeding the coordinated anti-cholera response efforts led by the Ethiopian Public Health Institute.It called for "extensive investments" in safe water supply and sanitation systems to effectively combat the outbreak.According to the WHO, Ethiopia has reported 143 cholera-related deaths so far this year, with 19,271 cholera cases reported from Jan 1 to June 30.UN agencies and humanitarian partners have been calling for durable solutions to address the root causes of recurrent cholera outbreaks, which include poor-quality drinking water and open defecation. In most cases, faecal contamination of drinking water is the main source of cholera, with most cholera patients using unsafe drinking water.Cholera, an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by consuming contaminated food or water, results in acute watery diarrhoea and severe dehydration. The disease can be fatal within hours if untreated.TUNIS -- Tunisian President Kais Saied Wednesday appointed Social Affairs Minister Kamel Maddouri as the new Prime Minister, replacing Ahmed Hachani, according to the president's office.The Tunisian presidency did not provide further details on this decision. It came two months before the presidential elections scheduled for Oct. 6, when Saied will seek a second five-year presidential term.Maddouri was born in 1974. He was appointed social affairs minister on May 25, 2024, as part of a partial government reshuffle. Before that, he was the chairman of the National Health Insurance Fund.Ahmed Hachani was appointed prime minister in August last year.China and Kenya have committed to strengthening bilateral cooperation ahead of this year's Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, or FOCAC, summit to be held in Beijing next month.Speaking at a meeting with representatives from the Chinese business community on Tuesday, Musalia Mudavadi, Kenya's prime cabinet secretary, said Kenya is ready to be the pilot country in Africa to implement the joint vision of building a closer community with a shared future.Mudavadi, who is also the cabinet secretary for foreign and diaspora affairs, said the strategic partnership between Kenya and China underlines the strength of diplomatic relations between the two sides over the past six decades."We achieved an important milestone in 2017 when China elevated bilateral relations with Kenya to a comprehensive strategic partnership that manifested our mutual trust, respect and benefit for the people of Kenya and China," he said.Mudavadi assured the Chinese business community of the government's support in scaling up their investments in priority sectors of the economy, anchored on the government's Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda.He said Kenya has high expectations for the upcoming FOCAC summit, noting that the East African country has greatly benefited from the forum, specifically on infrastructure development."We are particularly optimistic that the forum will speak about the current global challenges and their impact on Africa and China," he said.Stability and clarityMudavadi said Kenya finds stability and clarity in the manner and scope of cooperation within the FOCAC framework with clear roles and obligations to each side.He said he hopes that the FOCAC summit will discuss practical cooperation between China and Africa on trade and investment, affordable financing for sustainable development, and reform of the international financial architecture.This is in addition to Africa's industrialization within the context of the fourth industrial development decade for Africa, green financing, peace and security as well as people-to-people exchanges.Zhou Pingjian, Chinese ambassador to Kenya, said China-Kenya comprehensive strategic cooperation has maintained good development momentum and entered into a new stage of jointly building an even closer China-Kenya community with a shared future in the new era.He said the Chinese community in Kenya has played a critical role in growing bilateral relations between the two countries.Zhou said the meeting between Mudavadi and the Chinese business community speaks volumes about Kenya's firm commitment to stronger international partnership in pursuit of its Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda and national development."The embassy will continue to exert its utmost efforts to consolidate and further the long-standing friendly ties between our countries and enhance friendship between our people," he said.Gao Wei, chairman of the Kenya Overseas Chinese Association, said the Chinese business community is witnessing Kenya's development, contributing to its growth and benefiting from its development.He said Kenya boasts a favorable natural environment, political stability and a rapidly developing economy."Infrastructure projects have significantly improved over the past decade, enhancing the convenience of life and increasing the country's attractiveness to international visitors," Gao said.He said the number of Chinese nationals visiting Kenya, including tourists and entrepreneurs, has surged post-pandemic, noting that about 50,000 Chinese nationals are currently working in various sectors in the East African country.Wang Shangxue, director of the Confucius Institute at the University of Nairobi, said Kenya's Ministry of Education and its Chinese counterpart may sign an agreement during the FOCAC on joint Chinese language education in Kenya."This will support the training of local Chinese teachers, standard accreditation, pilot the introduction of Chinese language in Kenya's basic education, Chinese language curriculum and textbook development," she said.As Laurence Niyonagira stretches her hand to greet Aloys Mutiribambe with a smile on her face, just before they sit next to each other for a meeting to share their past experiences, one would think they are either relatives or long-term friends.However, 30 years ago, it was unimaginable that the two would ever see each other face-to-face, let alone shake hands. Niyonagira is a survivor of the 1994 Rwanda genocide against the Tutsi minorities, while Mutiribambe is a perpetrator of the genocide that saw almost 1 million people lose their lives within 100 days.Indeed, Niyonagira traumatically watched as Mutiribambe brutally attacked and killed her family members. Nevertheless, today they are not only neighbors and friends but Niyonagira's daughter is married to Mutiribambe's son.Niyonagira and Mutiribambe are neighbors in Mayange Reconciliation Village, about 40 kilometers south of the capital Kigali. Mayange is one of the eight villages that host genocide survivors, former perpetrators and their respective families who chose to go beyond forgiveness and embrace reconciliation.The villages were established in 2004 by the government in partnership with the Prison Fellowship Rwanda, a nongovernmental organization aimed at facilitating victims and perpetrators of genocide to genuinely embrace forgiveness and reconciliation. They currently consist of more than 800 houses accommodating more than 4,900 people.The realization of genuine forgiveness and reconciliation is aimed at ensuring that the residual feelings of anger and vengeance will not fester, or be passed on to the next generation only to erupt into another intergeneration cycle of violence.Community members are also equipped with skills like welding, sewing, tailoring, handicrafts, carpentry and masonry among others to improve their well-being and foster trust, safety, conviviality and hope.As Rwandans mark the 30th anniversary of the massacre this year, the traces of unimaginable sufferings caused by the genocide are hard to find in a country now characterized by peace and security.Today, reconciled and revived from the ravage caused by the genocide, Rwanda, a hilly and landlocked country with a population of less than 14 million in Central Africa, has been rated by international institutions such as the World Bank as one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa. It also ranks among the safest countries in the world, according to Numbeo, a leading data and research platform.Fredrick Kazigwemo, one of the community leaders in Mayange village, which hosts 54 households with about 380 people, said the reconciliation has been a long journey, initially characterized by fear and misunderstanding between the survivors and perpetrators but today, a lot has been achieved, and the community members live in peace and harmony.He said the farming cooperatives, established in 2005 as social saving groups, have played a critical role in the forgiveness and reconciliation journey.Mutiribambe said he regrets the genocidal crimes that he committed but expresses gratitude that the survivors have forgiven him.Colonialists blamedMutiribambe, 72, blames the colonialists — Germany and later Belgium — for the genocide and for bringing differences among the Tutsi, Hutu and Twa tribes despite the fact that the entire country has had a common ethnic language — Kinyarwanda.The identification was based on physical appearance — the Hutu were presumed to be dark-skinned and short, while the Tutsi were light-skinned and tall.The colonialists, said Mutiribambe, radicalized the Hutu extremists for long, to hate the Tutsi.In 1990, Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front invaded Rwanda from Uganda, leading to a violence outbreak. An agreement was signed in 1993 in Tanzania calling for the creation of a broad-based transition government that would include the Rwandan Patriotic Front.The Hutu extremists opposed the plan. The then president of Rwanda Juvenal Habyarimana fueled an anti-Tutsi campaign through the media."The government instructed Hutu extremists to kill any Tutsi they came across to ensure they will never ascend to power and that's why we were killing an entire family. We were also told to burn their houses and take their possessions," Mutiribambe said.When a plane carrying Habyarimana and the then Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira was shot down over Kigali on April 6, 1994, it ignited weeks of intense and systematic massacres.The genocide officially ended in mid-July 1994, when the Rwandan Patriotic Front took military control of the entire country.Criminals were tried by Gacaca, a participatory justice system that was established to address the enormous backlog of cases. The system was allowed to promote forgiveness and reconciliation.Mutiribambe, who was imprisoned for eight years, said they were given an opportunity to confess to the survivors of the genocide, the crimes they committed against their families and ask for forgiveness, after which they were released and sent back to their communities.While the release from prison came with joy, Mutiribambe dreaded how he would face the survivors but eventually, they reconciled and built trust."I would advise countries to learn from the Rwanda genocide to never radicalize young people to hate each other based on tribal lines."Niyonagira said she has genuinely forgiven Mutiribambe and all those who killed her relatives but said it wasn't an easy journey.The 51-year-old mother of 10 and a grandmother of five, said the genocide left so many scars both on her heart and her body.Niyonagira is grateful she was able to overcome her grief through several sessions of counseling and that she can sleep comfortably without any medication.James Higiro, a village leader, said Rwandans owe the success of the reconciliation to the government which thought of establishing such villages."We believe that if it wasn't for the role of the government to promote forgiveness and reconciliation as well as bridging the Hutu and Tutsi divisions, the revenge was inevitable because people were angry, sad and traumatized," he said.The government of Rwanda also established the Ministry of National Unity and Civic Engagement, mandated to preserve historical memory, reinforce national unity, and promote citizenship education and culture. The country has guarded its political stability since the 1994 genocide.Jean Chrysostome Ngabitsinze, Rwanda's minister of trade and industry, said it was hard to attract direct investment after the genocide, but with the political will and the leadership vision, the country has managed to recover."People now believe in Rwanda and many are investing in the country," he said.NIAMEY -- Niger will break off diplomatic ties with Ukraine "with immediate effect," Amadou Abdramane, spokesman for the Niger military government, announced on national television on Tuesday.He said in a statement that the move was taken because of Kyiv's "support for terrorist organizations," and called the UN Security Council to make a ruling on Ukraine's "aggression."The statement said that "considering the seriousness of the situation, and the recognized and assumed involvement of Ukraine in the aggression of Mali," the Nigerien government, in solidarity with the Malian government and people, decided to break off "with immediate effect" diplomatic relations with Ukraine, and the referral to the UN Security Council with a view to ruling on the Ukrainian "aggression" and its sponsors.On Sunday, Mali's transitional government said it would sever diplomatic relations with Ukraine "with immediate effect," citing Ukraine's acknowledged involvement in an act of aggression against Mali.The decision was taken in response to "subversive remarks" made by Andriy Yusov, spokesperson for the Ukrainian military intelligence, who recently admitted Ukraine's involvement in an attack by "armed terrorist groups" that resulted in the deaths of Malian defense and security forces personnel in Tinzaoutene, according to Abdoulaye Maiga, the Malian government's spokesperson.On July 30, the Malian Armed Forces reported having suffered "significant human losses" during intense fighting on July 26 against a "coalition of terrorist forces" in the northeastern part of the country.Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger announced the creation of the Confederation of the Alliance of Sahel States during the institution's first summit in early July.MOGADISHU, Somalia — At least 37 civilians were killed and 212 injured in an explosion at a popular beach restaurant in the Somali capital Mogadishu late on Friday, the health minister said, an attack the government blamed on militant Islamist group al-Shabaab.Ali Haji told a news conference that 11 of those injured in the attack were in a critical condition.It was the deadliest attack in the Horn of Africa country since twin car bombs detonated near a busy market intersection in October 2022, killing at least 100 people and wounding 300 others, Reuters reported.In addition to the civilians killed at the beach restaurant, police spokesperson Abdifatah Aden said one soldier was killed during the assault.One of the attackers blew himself up, while three others were killed by security forces. One attacker was captured alive, Aden said.There was no immediate claim of responsibility by the al-Shabaab, which has admitted similar attacks in the past, including the 2022 car bomb attack.Hassan Farah, a survivor, described the shock as the explosion shattered a peaceful evening."I was in the restaurant sipping coffee and having a good chat with friends when I saw a big man running, in a second there was something like lightning and a huge blast," he told Reuters. "We were covered with smoke. Inside and outside the restaurant many people were lying on the floor while others were bleeding and crying."Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre met with security agencies after the attack and drew up plans to strengthen the city's security, the president's office said in a post on X."The government is determined to eliminate the terrorists. The terrorists want to terrify the civilians. Let the civilians report the terrorists hiding among them," the post said.Agencies via XinhuaKIGALI, Rwanda — At an exhibition stand during an agriculture show in Rwanda's capital Kigali, Emmanuel Ahimana said it is an exciting time to be involved with China's Juncao cultivation technology.His company, which operates in Kigali's Gasabo district, uses the Chinese-invented Juncao technology to grow mushrooms with low-cost materials such as Juncao powder, cotton husks and lime powder.After learning the technology, Ahimana established a mushroom cultivation workshop in 2016, employing dozens of people. The workshop produces up to 10,000 mushroom tubes monthly. His goal is to expand the business with modern machines and open several shop outlets around Kigali to sell mushrooms.Juncao is a hybrid grass and an important multifunctional agricultural resource developed and used for mushroom farming in China. The innovation invented by Lin Zhanxi from China's Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University in the 1980s has benefited more than 100 countries, including Rwanda.Ahimana is one of more than 4,000 Rwandan farmers making use of Juncao technology, employing more than 30,000 people in the agricultural value chain, according to the Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Development Board.Leonidas Mushimiyimana, another Rwandan farmer, said the Juncao technology has made a big influence on his community.He started mushroom production after receiving training from Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University and capacity-building workshops from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.This came at a time when a solution was needed to address local challenges such as poverty, child malnutrition and youth unemployment.Mushimiyimana said he used the income from his Juncao mushroom production to build a school, which has improved education and economic opportunities in his community.Since 2006, experts from Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University have been working with the Rwandan government on Juncao technology, teaching and promoting Juncao and other agricultural technologies in the country.To date, more than 50 training courses on Juncao mushroom cultivation technology have been organized, benefiting more than 35,000 local mushroom farmers, official data showed.By supporting mushroom cultivation, the innovation has promoted food security and the transition to a green economy through environmentally friendly technology and more sustainable agriculture, said Egide Karuranga, an economist in Rwanda.Juncao has played an important role in building resilience to climate change, Karuranga said, adding it has also helped combat land degradation by producing fodder for livestock and minimizing soil erosion."Juncao technology has been a success, which demonstrates the need to invest in science and technology," Karuranga said, highlighting the technology's transformative power in changing the lives of various communities.XINHUAAt Tudor Creek in Kenya's coastal city of Mombasa, local community members have committed to restoring mangroves, an eye-opener initiative that is creating lucrative income ideas."In addition to generating income to sustain the program, our dream is to see each member get monthly income, enough to meet their basic needs in the near future. We have several projects in the pipeline toward that end," said Mbaarak Abdalla, founder and program director of Brain Youth Group.Since 2012, he said, the group has planted 3.8 million mangroves with a survival rate of 87-95 percent. They plan to increase this number to 8 million by 2030.The group has also planted 270 beehives in the forest to combat logging. Per hive, they harvest 10-15 kilograms of honey every three months. Each kilogram earns them $6-8. They also have two fishponds along the creek, so they harvest twice a year.A portion of the income from honey and fish sales goes to the savings account for conservation efforts while the remaining amount is shared equally among the members."We are currently looking for funds to buy two deep sea fishing vessels and build a hostel near the creek, with 100 guest accommodation rooms," Abdalla said adding that upon securing the fishing vessels, they will start exporting fish to the Middle East.To further diversify income generation activities, the group has also bought 8 hectares of land to venture into poultry farming. They plan to keep 25,000 chickens."Money was not the reason why I joined the group. I fell in love with conservation and I'm enjoying," said Bahati Karisa, a member who joined the group in 2017.She has since learned a lot, including identifying different species of mangrove and their adaptations.Mustafa Shabani, who joined the group in 2019, was motivated on conservation by the destructions caused by the 1997-1998 El Nino-induced rains to the local community. Though he was a young boy then, the impact still lingers in his mind.Thanks to the mangrove restoration, the 35-year-old father of two said the area looks beautiful, the air is fresh and the numbers of fish and crabs have increased significantly.Mangroves provide ideal breeding grounds for fish, crabs, shrimp and other shellfish. Decomposed mangrove leaves also provide a food source for marine life. Mangroves also act as a critical buffer against storm surges by slowing water flow.Mangrove forests in Kenya cover about 61,271 hectares, representing approximately 3 percent of the natural forest cover or less than 1 percent of the national land area, according to the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, a state corporation.However, the ecosystem faces serious threats associated with deforestation and degradation.For effective management of mangroves in Kenya, the country prepared the National Mangrove Ecosystem Management Plan running from 2017 to 2027.The plan focuses on forest conservation and utilization, fisheries development and management, community, tourism development, research and education, as well as human resources and operations.Troops from the People's Liberation Army participating in the "Peace Unity-2024" joint exercise in Tanzania have begun to carry out training to acclimatize themselves to the local environment, according to the PLA.Infantrymen from the Chinese military started checking and surveying their drill zones at the Tanzania People's Defence Forces' Comprehensive Training Center in Mapinga of Bagamoyo District on Saturday.They also conducted tactical training at the center over the past two days, using armed fighting vehicles and self-propelled assault guns transported from China, according to the PLA Central Theater Command.The command said in a news release on Sunday that starting Monday, infantry troops from China and Tanzania are scheduled to perform joint command and tactical training.The militaries of China, Tanzania and Mozambique will hold "Peace Unity-2024" joint exercise from late-July to mid-August, according to China's Ministry of National Defense.With a focus on joint counter-terrorism operations, the trilateral exercise will be carried out both on land and at sea, aiming to enhance the participating troops' capabilities in joint counter-terrorism maneuvers, and deepen military mutual trust and practical cooperation. It will be conducive for the three countries to jointly safeguard regional peace and stability, Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for the ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday.The Chinese forces in the Peace Unity-2024 consist of two groups: ground units sent by the PLA Central Theater Command and a naval flotilla sent by the PLA Southern Theater Command.The ground units come from the 82nd Group Army, an information and communication regiment and a military hospital, including assault, reconnaissance, intelligence, special operations, information support and logistics elements.They were carried to the African nation by China's Y-20 strategic transport planes and two Chinese Type 071 amphibious transport docks over the past 10 days.The last batch of ground units arrived in the Julius Nyerere Airport in Dar es Salaam on Saturday and soon moved to the Comprehensive Training Center in Mapinga.Meanwhile, the Chinese naval flotilla, composed of two Type 071 amphibious transport docks and a Type 052D guided-missile destroyer, arrived in Tanzania on Wednesday.Together with naval units from Tanzania and Mozambique, Chinese sailors will take part in exercises including joint defense of port, counter-terrorism tactics, boarding and seizure operations, anti-piracy and joint maritime patrol tasks, according to the PLA Southern Theater Command.As China rolled out a series of new measures to further deepen reform and advance Chinese modernization, political party leaders and officials from African countries said they are confident the country will fulfill its set goals and bring benefits not only to itself, but also to the rest of the world.They made the remarks on Wednesday after being briefed about the third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee in Changsha, capital of Hunan province."Many foreign friends asked us to provide information on the session at the earliest time possible so that they will know more about the major measures that China will take for Chinese modernization," said Lu Kang, vice-minister of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee.Noting that it was the first such briefing for foreign guests shortly after the session concluded last week and adopted a landmark resolution covering more than 300 reform measures in various fields and aspects, Lu said it shows the great attention that China pays to sharing experiences of governance with African countries.Obert Mpofu, secretary-general of the ruling ZANU PF party of Zimbabwe, said he is paying attention to almost every aspect of the resolution because "they taught us about how China's reforms are conducted".Mpofu said he has witnessed, through visits to different cities over the past three days, how China has achieved rapid development by taking reform measures and policies, especially under strong leadership."Once the resolution is adopted, it will serve as the road map for implementing reform decisions. So, we are really learning a lot from China," he said.Marvin Fanny, vice-president of United Seychelles, said he was happy to know that some of the reform measures as outlined in the resolution are about the environment and ecosystem.Blue economyAs Seychelles has embarked on a strategy for sustainable development called "Blue Economy", Fanny said that "China can also get involved with us to help us in achieving this endeavor and to pioneer the blue economy".The young leader also said China's commitment to promoting unilateral opening-up to the world's least-developed countries will certainly benefit African countries through cooperation with China in terms of infrastructure, industrial capacity, training and education, among others.Khalid Boudali, presiding officer of the African Union Economic Social and Cultural Council, said that China has been committed to opening up."As we land here in China, we have seen that the Chinese cities are very well developed," he said.He believes that the goals set in the resolution will surely be accomplished. "I think this is not a challenge for China because Chinese people have the will, the leadership and the political stability and also the good governance (for realizing them)," Boudali added.Maged Refaat Aboulmagd, an ambassador member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, said he was quite astonished when he read about the resolution during his flight to China."When China talks about the intention (to make reforms), it gets really serious into the fields of high-tech technology and high-quality innovation," he said, noting that the main purpose of the reforms is about creating better lives and meeting aspirations of the people."I think most of the world will be watching really how China is trying to reinvent itself and to reinvent how it is perceived in the world …because determined people make change," he said.African countries have resolved to strengthen their collaboration in the implementation of the African integration agenda, underscoring the role of member states in the allocation of adequate financial resources to ensure effective implementation of continental integration.Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union Commission, said African countries can maximize the potential of integration avenues, like the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, by making it an engine of growth and diversification of the economies to increase trade within the continent.Mahamat highlighted the need for member countries to present a united front in upcoming engagements with international partners. He also emphasized the importance of speaking with one voice at major global forums, including the G20, where the African Union now holds membership. He made the remarks on Sunday while speaking during the AU's sixth midyear coordination meeting in Ghana's capital Accra.Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo said the urgency to consolidate the fragmented financial instruments to accelerate Africa's development agenda must be met if Africa is to achieve full integration."By consolidating our development funding instruments, we can create a more cohesive and effective financial framework that ensures resources are allocated where they are most needed. This consolidation will not only streamline our efforts, but will also improve our capacity to mobilize domestic and external resources efficiently," Akufo-Addo said.Facilitating tradeMohamed Ould Cheikh Ghazouani, Mauritania's president and current chair of the AU, said cooperation and integration would strengthen strategic planning and operationalization of critical continental infrastructure, such as regional power pools, digital and transport infrastructure. He urged member states to redouble efforts in trade facilitation through the simplification, standardization and harmonization of related procedures and information flows to boost intra-African trade.Kidi Mwaga, a Kenyan law and governance expert, said Africa has no choice but to fast-track its integration process by overcoming political and historical hurdles that have stood in the way of its unification. In his view, opening up intra-Africa trade is the first critical step toward economic integration in Africa."Currently, when, for instance, Kenya wants to trade with Uganda, they first have to transact through the US in terms of buying dollars. We therefore must create a payment system that ensures that trade within Africa must first remain in Africa. In so doing, we will be able to alleviate poverty and suffering and give people a fair shot at upward social mobility," Mwaga said.Despite the challenges facing Africa, Mwaga believes that the elusive idea of African integration is the silver bullet for Africans to find their way out of poverty, insecurity and violence as well as the way out of manipulation of Africa by the West. ADDIS ABABA -- The death toll from Monday's landslide in southern Ethiopia has risen to 229, the local government said on Tuesday.The deadly landslide occurred on Monday morning at around 10:00 am local time (0700 GMT) in southern Ethiopia's Geze Gofa district.The deaths include 148 males and 81 females, according to a statement issued by the Gofa Zone Government Communication Affairs Department.As part of rescue efforts, the Ethiopian Red Cross Association and professionals from neighboring regions and zones are currently at the site, helping the victims.The deadly landslide occurred as Ethiopia is in the midst of a rainy season, which started in July and is expected to last until mid-September. Seasonal rains occasionally cause deadly landslides in some parts of the East African country. NAIROBI -- Kenyan authorities on Tuesday heightened security in and around the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in the capital of Nairobi, the country's main airport, ahead of anti-government protests.Young Kenyan protesters, or Gen-Z, have threatened to disrupt airport operations to protest President William Ruto's decision to rehire six former Cabinet secretaries more than a week after their dismissal.The Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) and Kenya Airways (KQ) have advised passengers to arrive at the airport early due to heightened security checks and traffic disruptions on roads leading to the main airport.In separate statements issued Monday evening, the KAA told passengers to expect longer security protocols, while KQ, the national carrier, advised travelers to arrive four hours before the departure time."Due to heightened security checks and protocols at the JKIA, passengers are advised to arrive at the airport early to avoid any potential delays in catching their flights. Kindly contact your respective airline for the latest flight information," the KAA said.Kenya Airways advised its customers traveling through the JKIA that traffic disruptions were anticipated on major roads leading to the airport Tuesday."Due to anticipated traffic disruptions on major roads leading to the JKIA on Tuesday, customers are advised to arrive at the airport at least four hours before their scheduled flight departure time," the national carrier said in a statement."Customers are also encouraged to plan extra time to avoid potential delays en route to the airport," it said, insisting that the safety and well-being of its crew and customers is their number one priority.The airline said traveling customers can physically check in at the airport as early as four hours before flight departure, and they can also check online through its website or on their mobile devices via the KQ Mobile app from 30 hours to 90 minutes before flight departure.Kenya Airways said it was doing everything possible to ensure its flights depart and arrive on schedule but advised customers to expect some delays in their departure and arrival times.The advisories came ahead of Tuesday's planned anti-government demonstrations in the capital, in which young protesters have vowed to march to the heavily fortified facility.Besides Kenya Airways, the JKIA, the busiest airport in East Africa, also serves other major airlines including Rwanda Air, Emirates, British Airways, Ethiopian Airports and Turkish Airways.The police have, however, warned protesters to keep off the JKIA and other protected areas.Acting Police Inspector General Douglas Kanja said protesters must take note of the legal boundaries that govern access to protected areas."We urge all individuals participating in demonstrations to respect these legal provisions and refrain from attempting to enter or interfere with protected areas. The National Police Service is resolute in its commitment to uphold and enforce these laws," Kanja said in a statement.Kanja said the Protected Areas Act (Cap 204) of the Laws of Kenya prevents the entry of unauthorized persons into areas declared to be protected areas. He added that the Kenya Civil Aviation Act stipulates that anyone who trespasses on any land forming part of a government aerodrome or an aerodrome commits an offense punishable by law.The president was forced to dissolve his Cabinet on July 11 after young protesters staged anti-government demonstrations across the country in June against a wide range of unpopular tax increases contained in the Finance Bill 2024 that has since been withdrawn.The Finance Bill 2024, which sparked youth protests that led to its withdrawal from the National Assembly by Ruto, was seeking to raise an additional 346.7 billion Kenyan shillings (about 2.7 billion U.S. dollars) through new taxes.The protesters had expressed outrage over provisions of the bill that would raise taxes on goods and services that many people depend on, such as bread, and mobile money transfers, to meet the government's revenue targets.The Gen-Z protesters had also been demanding accountability from the government, saying there is a lot of opulence and wastage in government spending.ADDIS ABABA - The death toll from a landslide in southern Ethiopia has risen to 146, local government officials said on Tuesday.The deadly landslide occurred on Monday morning at around 10:00 am local time (0700 GMT) in southern Ethiopia's Geze Gofa district. KIGALI -- Rwanda's incumbent President Paul Kagame of the ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) won the presidential election held on July 15 with 99.18 percent of the vote, according to the final results released Monday by the National Electoral Commission (NEC).His challengers, Frank Habineza of the opposition Democratic Green Party of Rwanda, and Philippe Mpayimana, an independent candidate, garnered 0.50 percent and 0.32 percent, respectively, of the vote.The RPF and its coalition also won 37 seats of the parliament's 53 seats representing political parties and independent candidates, the results showed.The opposition Liberal Party led by Donatille Mukabalisa, the outgoing Speaker of Parliament and the Social Democratic Party led by former Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta got five seats each.Other parties, including the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda, the Ideal Democratic Party and the PS Imberakuri that fielded parliamentary candidates, got two seats each, according to the final results.About 9 million voters took part in the elections on July 15.A total of 589 candidates contested for the 80 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the bicameral national legislature of Rwanda.Besides representatives from political parties, other lawmakers come from special groups (youth, women, and people with disabilities)."We would like to thank all Rwandans for their active role in organizing and participating in the elections both in the country and abroad," the NEC extends its gratitude to all involved."In particular we would wish to express our appreciation to the political parties and independent candidates for their exemplary conduct throughout the election period," the NEC said in a statement.At the cocktail reception to thank key contributors to the successful RPF presidential campaign on Sunday night in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, Kagame said: "For our friends, we are very good friends, you should rely on us. We won't disappoint our friends. For our adversaries, for those who don't wish us well, we will always extend a hand of cooperation. We will always show them that we can work together...""When we start with our strengths and work together with our friends and partners, we achieve a lot. In our culture as the RPF, we do not become complacent. We work very well with those who are willing," he said.Kagame, 66, assumed power in 2000. He is credited with spearheading the country's liberation war of the then Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA), an army wing of RPF which ended the 1994 100-day genocide against the Tutsi, an ethnic group of the African Great Lakes region, fostering unity and peace restoration in the country. About 1 million people were killed in the genocide.Kagame won the 2017 election for a third term with more than 98 percent of the vote.African smallholder farmers are central in the transitioning to nature-positive, sustainable, and climate-resilient food production systems across the continent. Smallholder farmers, who produce more than 70 percent of staple food, should be involved in formulating policies to facilitate a transition to agricultural practices that conserve habitats while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Delegates gathered for the Africa Protein Summit held on Thursday in Kenya's capital Nairobi said that that Africa's pursuit of a food-secure, green, and resilient future hinges on the adoption of ecologically sound farming practices at the smallholder level. The delegates, who included senior policymakers, representatives of civil society, academia, and industry, renewed the call for a smallholder-led overhaul of food systems to tackle Africa's hunger crisis.Philip Kilonzo, head of policy, advocacy and communications at Nairobi-based Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, said the continent is poised for a transition to a future free from hunger and malnutrition and resilient to climate emergencies, through the scaling up of smallholder farmers' innovations.Million Belay, the general coordinator of the civil organization Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Uganda, pointed out that smallholder farmers and livestock keepers are fundamental in swiftly adopting culturally and environmentally friendly food production systems.Referring to them as custodians of a vast wealth of genetic diversity, Belay said that African smallholder farmers and herders are in a prime position to promote the cultivation of traditional foods that are nutritious and resistant to pests, diseases, and climatic stresses. He urged governments and donors to support these farmers in implementing agroecological practices that ensure food security, habitat regeneration, and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases.Tennyson Williams, regional director for Africa at the global lobby group World Animal Protection, said there is a need to empower smallholder farmers through capacity building, sustained funding, and awareness creation to facilitate food systems transformation, achieve climate resilience, and improve rural livelihoods.Partnerships between government, private sector and non-governmental organization as well as enhancing coordination mechanisms, allocating adequate resources and improving data collection systems could help address road accidents in Africa.This, in addition to prioritizing the safety of vulnerable road users and enhancing legislative frameworks, could help the continent realize the United Nations goal of halving road traffic deaths by 2030.Patrick Kinyanjui, the Africa coordinator at Global Alliance of NGOs for Road Safety, said through advocacy and pointing the government to the right direction, NGOs could help improve road safety situation in Africa."The NGOs are in contact with the communities, they know what is happening at the community level so they are able to feed the government on the actual challenges and problems that communities are facing and are able to inform policy decisions at the highest level," he said.Kinyanjui gave the remarks on Tuesday during the launch of the WHO Status report on road safety 2023 for the African region.The report found that the African region holds the highest fatality rate, of 19.4 per 100,000 population compared with a global rate of 15 per 100,000.Additionally, Africa recorded a 17 percent increase in road-related fatalities, between 2010 and 2021.Despite hosting only 15 percent of the world's population, and 3 percent of its vehicles, the continent accounts for nearly one-fifth of all road deaths globally.The report attributed the increased road traffic death rates to multiple factors, including inadequate road safety laws and standards.No African country currently has laws that meet the best practice standards for the five key road safety behavioral risk factors of speeding, drink driving, non-use of motorcycle helmets, seatbelts and child restraints.According to the report, males aged 15-64 years are the main victims of road traffic crashes. Vulnerable road users such as motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians are worst affected, with road-related deaths of motorcyclists doubling in the past 10 years.Kinyanjui said the report findings will help in monitoring the progress on what governments are doing as well as measure progress to know when to fast-track some of the interventions being implemented.In a speech read on his behalf, Harry Kimtai, the principal secretary of State Department for Medical Services at the Kenya's Ministry of Health, said road safety is a public health concern, noting that collective responsibility is crucial in addressing the burden."With strong and sustainable multi-sectoral engagement the target of halving the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accident can be advanced," he said."It's up to us to translate the findings into effective laws, regulations, policies and actions and most importantly implement them effectively."Kimtai said lack of harmonized data from the health sector and police, underreporting and the poor quality data are some of the reasons that have led to the adoption of ineffective options on road safety.He said road accidents are ranked the ninth cause of death in Kenya with the annual healthcare cost attributable to the road traffic injuries estimated at $361 million.Joyce Nato, professional officer at the WHO Kenya country office, said the UN agency is supporting governments to harmonize data from the police and ministry of health, noting that availability of accurate data could help improve policy and implementation.Abdourahmane Diallo, the WHO representative to Kenya, called on countries across Africa to develop the right policies or update the existing ones."We know the solutions that work so we need to look into them and see how we can adopt them into our countries, implement and enforce. Many countries have the relevant policies and laws but they are not being implemented," he said.Kinyanjui attributed failure to implement the policies in many countries to lack of implemental budget allocation to road safety which is usually listed as the last priorities of the governments.Following its expansion at the beginning of this year, BRICS is increasing its appeal to developing nations, which analysts said reflects the common desire of the Global South to build a more just and equitable world order against Western dominance.Last month, Zimbabwe announced its interest in joining the BRICS grouping for an opportunity to access new markets and investment opportunities as well as grow its economy.Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri, the country's defense minister, made the announcement at the "World Majority for a Multipolar World "international inter-party forum with BRICS and partner countries held in Russia.She said Zimbabwe has a strong conviction in BRICS' potential to counterbalance the dominance of Western powers, by challenging their unilateral decision-making and promoting a more balanced global landscape, as quoted by Zimbabwe's The Herald newspaper.Cavince Adhere, a Kenyan expert on international relations, said BRICS formation provides Zimbabwe with a family that respects its own unique internal conditions but at the same time allows it to play on the global stage.In addition, by joining BRICS, Zimbabwe will be provided with alternative markets for its natural resources, as the country is unable to do business with Western countries due to sanctions, he said."Zimbabwe has to seek new territories and friendly countries to work with and I think BRICS provides that framework for the country to engage," he said.Just like Zimbabwe, some other developing countries have expressed interest in joining BRICS recently. In January, the grouping welcomed five more countries, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Iran and Ethiopia, expanding to a 10-member organization.Paul Frimpong, founder and executive director of the Africa-China Centre for Policy and Advisory, said more than 40 countries have expressed interest in joining BRICS, indicating the attractiveness of the bloc."BRICS attracts a diverse group of potential members because of its primary-driven shared desire to create a more equitable global landscape that many countries believe is currently biased against them," he said.Frimpong said the BRICS countries' push to represent a collective voice for the Global South in international forums like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, is one of the reasons countries are interested in joining the bloc.He said BRICS offers a chance for member countries to have a greater influence on global issues and policies as well as push back on the West's economic dominance.The grouping's emphasis on a multipolar world, an international system that better advances emerging market country and developing country interests appeals to nations desiring a more balanced global order, he said.This is in addition to establishing alternative financial institutions like the New Development Bank to provide financial support to member countries, offering an alternative to the IMF and the World Bank, which are traditionally dominated by Western nations.These initiatives reflect an effort by BRICS members to reduce their vulnerability to Western economic policies, and create a multipolar world reflecting the interests of emerging economies, he said."Additionally, shared development challenges and goals among BRICS members offer a platform for collaboration on issues like poverty and sustainable growth, presenting significant trade, investment, and economic development opportunities for prospective members."Significant shiftFrimpong said BRICS expansion represents a significant shift toward a more inclusive and balanced global governance structure, with the inclusivity promoting multilateralism, encouraging cooperation and dialogue among a diverse set of nations.Economically, the expansion stimulates growth and stability through enhanced trade and investment among member states, which collectively possess substantial economic potential.He said BRICS initiatives in energy, trade networks, and infrastructure projects can significantly boost economic development and connectivity, contributing to global prosperity and sustainable development.By addressing critical global issues such as climate change through a multilateral approach, BRICS can foster a more equitable and sustainable world, he said."By providing a platform for the Global South to voice its concerns and priorities, BRICS contributes to the creation of a new world order that is more reflective of the diverse economic and political realities of the modern world," Frimpong said."This shift toward a more balanced and inclusive global governance system has the potential to address long-standing inequalities and promote a more just and equitable international order."Melha Rout Biel, executive director at the Institute for Strategic and Policy Studies, based in South Sudan, said BRICS expansion means a lot to the international system."The fact that many developing countries are joining in a big number is sending a signal that something might have been wrong with the current world system and that different ways of doing things must be found," he said.edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn Rwandans across the country and the diaspora turned up on Monday to cast their votes in a presidential election that is expected to extend Paul Kagame's 24-year governance.Kagame, 67, is facing two contenders in the presidential race — Frank Habineza, 47, chairman of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda, and Philippe Mpayimana, 54, independent candidate and a journalist by profession.Many Rwandans said they would vote for Kagame, calling him a transformative leader who has steered Rwanda's economy to growth after the 1994 genocide that left the country in ruins. Rwanda is currently one of the fastest-growing countries in Africa.According to the World Bank, Rwanda's economy is projected to grow by an average of 7.2 percent in 2024-26.Kagame has been enjoying wide support since he took power in 2000.He won nearly 99 percent of the votes in the previous election in 2017.Ismael Buchanan, dean of the College of Business and Economics at the University of Rwanda, expressed confidence that Kagame will be reelected.He said Kagame's popularity among the Rwandans is largely due to the fact that he is seen by many as a hero who united Rwandans following the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi and is a champion worldwide on matters such as gender equality.Buchanan said Kagame's expected reelection is a signal of further stability not only in Rwanda, but also for neighboring countries."Kagame campaigned on a promise to sustain inclusive development, security and change people's livelihoods for the better without leaving anyone behind," he said.Buchanan also said Kagame has a track record of transforming the country into a regional financial hub.Additionally, Rwanda has been recognized as one of the cleanest countries not only in Africa, but also globally with a stable economy."The Rwandans want to continue enjoying security, political stability, unity and economic development, which are the core issues concerning Rwandans," Buchanan said.He said Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front party enjoys the support of major opposition groups that formed a coalition to support his candidacy, hence an assurance that he will be reelected.The United States and several Western countries have accused Rwanda of human rights abuses.However, Buchanan disputed the claims saying that those who are accusing Kagame should present concrete and tangible facts, adding that the accusers' motives may undermine what Rwandans have achieved through spreading disinformation.Parliamentarians of the African Union are actively promoting the ratification of a protocol on the free movement of people across the continent, aiming to spur tourism and trade.Margaret Jepkoech Kamar, a Kenyan senator and member of the Pan-African Parliament committee on trade, customs and immigration, said the parliament will promote trust among African countries."We are involved in capacity building for Pan-African Parliament members and African countries' members of parliament to build trust, because free movement of people will create more jobs. If Africa can be open, more companies will invest and create more jobs," Kamar told China Daily in Johannesburg, South Africa.About 250 MPs across the continent gathered in Johannesburg for a meeting that concluded on July 5 at the Pan-African Parliament to discuss African issues.Kamar outlined efforts to collaborate with NGOs and engage civil societies across Africa via the AU's Economic, Social and Cultural Council to persuade countries to ratify the protocol."It is important for the people to know that we need to be integrated to prosper and share the skills. We want to remove that suspicion that free movement means taking away jobs. There is no data to back up that fear," she said.The Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community Relating to Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment was adopted during the 30th Ordinary Session of African Heads of State in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in January 2019. Its aim is to facilitate travel for African citizens holding valid identity documents.Once operational, the protocol will allow citizens from African countries to visit any other African country for up to 90 days. It also mandates African nations to develop and implement programs that promote student exchange and research collaboration.Currently, only four African countries — Mali, Niger, Rwanda, and Sao Tome and Principe — have signed the protocol. To fully enact it, a total of 15 countries must ratify the protocol.Bashiru Silikie, an MP in Sierra Leone, said some countries have an "independent mentality" that prevents them from ratifying the free movement of people protocol. Some believe that by ratifying the treaty they will allow illegal immigrants into their countries, which is not true, Silikie said.Boosting businesses"We are advocating, appealing and encouraging African countries to ratify the free movement of people so that we can have people moving freely from one country to the other doing business with no hindrance," he said."We encourage countries to sign and domesticate the protocol so that we can be one Africa. We want seamless travel and borderless Africa to boost trade and tourism."McHenry Venaani, an MP in Namibia and deputy chairperson of the Pan-African Parliament committee on trade, customs and immigration, said many African countries do trade with China and European countries and get more visitors from there than from Africa.Allowing citizens to move freely in the continent can spur trade within African countries, Venaani said. The free movement of people in Africa should be urgently implemented since African countries share their cultural and historical bond, he said.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.NIAMEY -- A number of prisoners on Thursday escaped from a prison holding militants in west Niger's Tillabery region, according to the Ministry of the Interior.The ministry did not specify in its statement how many prisoners managed to escape or how they escaped from the Koutoukale prison, which is located some 50 km northwest of the Nigerien capital Niamey and considered the safest in the country.The prison detains many members of the Nigerian group Boko Haram and Sahelian militant groups.Local authorities imposed an overnight curfew in the urban commune of Tillabery, located in the same region as the prison, but did not provide further details. NAIROBI -- Kenyan President William Ruto on Thursday dismissed all cabinet secretaries except the deputy president and prime cabinet secretary who is also the cabinet secretary for foreign and diaspora affairs.Spurred by intensified economic and cultural exchanges, as well as communication between China and Zambia, more institutes in the Southern African country are offering Chinese courses to meet the increasing demand for the language.In Livingstone, a tourism city famous for Victoria Falls, Livingstone Institute of Business and Engineering Studies, or LIBES, is spearheading an initiative to teach Mandarin to professionals in Zambia.Ignatius Lubinda, the principal of LIBES, has outlined the strategic vision behind this educational shift, emphasizing its importance for communication and economic enhancement."We are integrating Mandarin into our curriculum just as we teach communication skills in English," Lubinda said."Our goal is to improve the way our learners communicate with Chinese counterparts," he said, adding that the initiative aims to enhance communication and foster better business and diplomatic relationships.Lubinda said a major reason for the institute to promote Chinese learning is to meet the increasing demand for Chinese speakers from the hospitality industry as the city receives a lot of tourists from China every year."We are training tour guides, receptionists, waitresses and other professionals who interact with tourists," Lubinda said.By equipping these workers with Mandarin skills, LIBES aims to enhance the visitor experience for Chinese tourists, a growing demographic in Zambia's tourism sector."We are planning to target the possibility of having an executive class in the evening so that the working class can join," Lubinda said, adding that the move is aimed at ensuring professionals who have regular daytime jobs can still benefit from Mandarin education."A number of students have been trained and are now applying their skills in various sectors," Lubinda said, adding that breaking language barriers can benefit Zambia in tourism, investment and business opportunities.Key institutionsIn addition to LIBES, the Confucius Institute at the University of Zambia is also spearheading the initiative to teach Mandarin across the country, offering Chinese language programs at 19 teaching centers. Other key institutions that plan to offer Chinese language courses include Mulungushi University and Copperbelt University.By incorporating Mandarin into the curriculum, Zambia is fostering better international relationships and positioning itself strategically in a world where the centers of power are shifting.Malizgani Nyirongo, a distinguished language expert and historian in Zambia, emphasizes the benefits of this move."The Chinese have been living in Zambia and southern Africa for a long time, as evidenced by archaeological finds," said Nyirongo.This deep-rooted historical presence forms a foundation for the robust relationship between Zambia and China today."Learning the Chinese language is significant because of the impact it has on trade and commerce," he said. "China is a global player. You have to deal with China in trade, commerce, education, medicine and technology."By understanding Mandarin, Zambians can navigate Chinese manuals, tap into advanced technologies and appreciate Chinese innovations in science and medicine, he said.Beyond economic benefits, learning Mandarin fosters deeper cultural understanding and promotes people-to-people exchanges."Learning the Chinese language will bring us closer to China," Nyirongo emphasized, adding that direct engagement counters often skewed narratives presented by Western media.Nyirongo envisions a future where Mandarin is examinable in more Zambian schools, preparing students for studies in China.This early preparation aligns with Zambia's broader educational goals, ensuring its youth are globally competitive and culturally adept, he said.Emmanuel Mulenga, a resident in Lusaka, who learned Chinese in China, said mastering Chinese is challenging but rewarding."Learning Chinese has significantly helped me, especially in business contexts. Knowing Chinese gives you an upper hand in negotiations and opens up new opportunities," Mulenga, a translator for a Chinese company in Lusaka, said.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.In efforts to improve cassava production in Kenya as well as promote an alternative food crop in the face of the declining maize production, the country's staple food, scientists at the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization have developed high-yielding, drought and disease-resistant cassava varieties.The varieties were developed using Semi-Autotrophic Hydroponics technology, which involves the use of modified soil that holds plant roots in planting pots with little water.The soil transports the moisture to the plant roots, with the top of the soil remaining relatively dry. This allows the production of cassava seeds that are pests and disease-resistant.Godwin Macharia, a scientist in charge of food crops and research at the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization, said the new cassava variety dubbed Variety KME-08-02, or locally as Tajirika, can double farmers' yields by halving the maturity period from 24 months to a year."One of the most devastating diseases facing cassava farmers in Kenya is the cassava brown streak disease. We consider it one of Kenya's most dangerous plant diseases due to its significant impact on food and economic security," Macharia said."The cassava variety that we have developed is resistant to the disease and could considerably improve the crop's ability to feed Africa while generating income for smallholder farmers."He said the variety has the potential to yield up to 50 metric tons per hectare compared to 11 metric tons per hectare when using the local cassava varieties.Macharia pointed out that since the research began in 2020, the first batch of 2,000 farmers from the coastal region received the improved seeds in 2022 as part of the trials.This saw Kenya's cassava production grow by more than 150,000 metric tons in 2023 compared to the previous year.Macharia said the production is set to improve further in the coming years once farmers in Western Kenya start receiving the improved seeds.They also plan to introduce the crop to areas that traditionally do not grow cassava to improve production."Once the majority of farmers adopt the improved cassava seeds in the country, we believe Kenya's production will triple due to increased yields per hectare coupled with the fact that the improved cassava matures in half the time it takes for the traditional varieties to mature," he said.Macharia termed multiplying and disseminating new cassava varieties to farmers as the key challenge to breeders and scientists. This is because cassava is a clonal crop whose multiplication is done using stems and this process can take several years to reach most farmers.However, the Semi-Autotrophic Hydroponics technology currently being used makes it easier and faster to propagate new seeds, hence easily accessible to farmers.Patience Khasoa, a Kenyan environmental consultant said cassava production can promote food security among rural populations in Kenya.As a cassava advocate, she works with local farmers by providing specialized expertise and advisory services related to cassava cultivation, processing, and value chain development."When it comes to cultivation, Kenyan cassava farmers need to identify and promote high-yielding and disease-resistant cassava varieties suitable for Kenyan agroecological zones. This should introduce improved varieties that have desirable traits such as disease and drought tolerance and early maturity," Khasoa said."The Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service must also establish and strengthen community-based seed systems to ensure farmers have access to high-quality planting material. We need to promote the use of certified planting material to reduce the spread of diseases."otiato@chinadaily.com.cnRegional leaders and stakeholders are pushing for amendment of the treaty of the East African Community (EAC) to adopt Kiswahili as an official language of the bloc.The leaders urged the EAC council of ministers to speed up the process, noting that the use of Kiswahili will enable people across the region to clearly understand the proceedings of the EAC, which are currently delivered in English.During the celebration of the third EAC World Kiswahili Day in Kenya's coastal city of Mombasa on Sunday, the leaders called on partner states to pass laws and policies that will promote the use of the language.Aisha Jumwa, Kenya's cabinet secretary for gender, culture, the arts and heritage, said with 200 million people speaking Kiswahili it will be a unifying language for the region."I urge all EAC partner states to push for laws and policies to be written and published in Kiswahili," she said.Nestor Kayobera, the judge president of the East African Court of Justice, said the treaty establishing the EAC recognizes the English language as the official language and Kiswahili as a lingua franca."Those who find themselves in courts, most of them use Kiswahili, but judgments are delivered in English because the law that guides the judiciary was enacted in English," he said.Kayobera said delivering rulings in Kiswahili means people are unable to follow proceedings and understand judgments in their own language.James Ikuya, Uganda's minister of state for EAC affairs, reaffirmed Uganda's commitment to adoption of Kiswahili as an official language, adding that Kiswahili was now a compulsory subject in the country's schools."With our language, we can set our own agenda. Kiswahili is our own language. These celebrations reiterate the region's goodwill in promoting the growth and development of the language," he said.The Sunday celebrations followed a two-day international conference organized by the East African Kiswahili Commission, revolving around the theme "Kiswahili, Multilingual Education, and the Enhancement of Peace."The conference explored the vital role of language and education in promoting regional peace.Caroline Asiimwe, the executive secretary of the East African Kiswahili Commission singled out the UN's recent recognition of Kiswahili and reaffirmed the Commission's dedication to promoting the language across East Africa.She said during the two days, stakeholders from all EAC partner states, discussed the status of Kiswahili usage in their countries, the need for Kiswahili language policy and its use in the education systems."As a commission responsible for sharing the efforts of the development and use of Kiswahili in the EAC, I reiterate our commitment to working with all regional stakeholders to ensure we realize our goal," Asiimwe said.edithmutethya@chinbadaily.com.cnABUJA -- At least two people were killed and 18 others were rescued after a wooden boat capsized in Nigeria's northern state of Jigawa late Sunday, police said on Monday.The boat, carrying a group of some 20 local traders, was en route to the Hadin village in the Auyo local government area when it capsized in the Kwalgai River, Lawan Shiisu, spokesman for the police in Jigawa, told reporters Monday.At least two people were killed and 18 others were rescued, said Shiisu.Citing a preliminary investigation, Shiisu said the incident was caused by "powerful waves and overloading to the extent where the driver was unable to steer the canoe."Kenya's President William Ruto made history as the first head of state in the country to come face to face with his citizens on social media, fielding unfiltered questions about his government's inadequacies and ills, following weeks of nationwide protests sparked by a controversial financial bill.At a meeting hosted on social media X attended by more than 1 million Kenyans on Friday, Ruto took the opportunity to field tough questions from furious anti-tax protesters, and apologized for police brutality witnessed during recent protests and the alleged abductions of organizers.Ruto was forced to withdraw the controversial finance bill late last month because of the demonstrations that rocked Kenya. Last week, he also announced a budget cut to seal the budget hole left after the withdrawal of the finance bill.The protests were organized online through social media platforms such as the X Spaces, a feature that allows users to host live audio conversations. The protesters called for rejection of the bill that would impose additional taxes on a wide range of commodities, and denounced corrupt officials.Pledging to do moreIn Ruto's X Spaces session he pledged to sack all officials implicated in corruption, saying: "I agree some of our officials display obnoxious opulence, and I have called them personally and advised them how to conduct themselves. I will do more."Ruto defended many of his government's policies, saying a lot of them had been misunderstood and had been intended to boost Kenyan businesses.He said he had learned much during the online engagement and hoped to have more such interactions. In particular, he said it had taught him that he needed to show more empathy for the plight of his fellow citizens.Some X users voiced their opinions and asked questions, which he promptly answered."My administration has always believed in listening and engaging, and that is why I go around the country to engage people," Ruto said. "I rarely sit in the office. I go to different places to engage with Kenyans."WASHINGTON - The US military is set to complete the withdrawal on Sunday of its personnel from Niger's Air Base 101 in the nation's capital and then shift its focus to exiting a major drone base in the coming weeks, a US general said on Friday.Niger's military rulers have given the US until Sept 15 to remove its troops.Air Force Major General Kenneth Ekman, who is on the ground in Niger to coordinate the departure, said the US exit from Air Base 101 will be finalized with a ceremony. The base is located next to Diori Hamani International Airport in the capital Niamey."We will do a joint ceremony on that occasion that marks the departure of the last US C-17 (aircraft). The government of Niger will assume control of former US areas and facilities," Ekman said, speaking by video conference.Agencies Conflict, inflation, severe weather and poor access to nutritious diets and safe water continue to severely affect the state of food security and nutrition in East Africa, leaving some 66.7 million people in the Greater Horn of Africa region facing severe food insecurity as of June, a report has found.The figure was an 11 percent decrease compared with the 74.9 million in May, said the report published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and East Africa's Intergovernmental Authority on Development on Wednesday.The report further revealed that severe floods have heightened the levels of food insecurity in countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan, which were already recovering from the lingering effects of previous droughts.In Kenya, the Kenya Red Cross estimates that floods in April destroyed approximately 16,000 hectares of cropland, intensifying concerns over agricultural output.Furthermore, extensive waterlogging severely disrupted crop production. The damage caused by the floods is expected to disrupt the transportation network and agricultural production, consequently affecting the prices of goods and services.In Tanzania, floods claimed lives and decimated thousands of farmlands, with the Department of Disaster Management in the Prime Minister's Office estimating a 30 percent drop in food production.With the majority of the Tanzanian population dependent on agriculture and livestock, the relentless floods have exacerbated food insecurity in the country.In its Food and Security Update published on April 25, the World Bank said domestic food price inflation remains high in low-and middle-income countries including those in East Africa. The situation was predicted to get worse following natural disasters such as the floods experienced in the region.The update also indicated that domestic food price inflation, measured as year-on-year change in the food component of a country's consumer price index, will remain high."In East and Southern Africa, food insecurity, including famine, continues to rise because of ongoing conflicts and extreme weather events. An estimated 75 million people will be food insecure by October 2024," the update said.The World Bank is worried that floods could significantly reduce the ability to increase maize production in a region that is already facing a shortage.Refugee crisisThe Food and Agriculture Organization said the East and Central Africa region also hosts a substantial number of refugees and internally displaced persons, especially in countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, where people grapple with food insecurity because of restricted access to essential resources and limited livelihood opportunities.To help relieve the food insecurity in the region, East Africa's Intergovernmental Authority on Development said it is providing technical support to countries in the subregion in identifying food safety gaps at policy, strategy, legal, institutional and technical levels to better inform subsequent interventions and investments in such areas.Xinhua contributed to this story.The Kenyan government is determined to end violence and looting stemming from anti-government protests, said Kenya's interior cabinet secretary, adding that anarchy, violence and plunder must stop.Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki said in a statement following violent demonstrations on Tuesday that the protests have been hijacked by criminal gangs who continue to disrupt public order, commit arson and terrorize the public. The protests began last month in response to a controversial finance bill that aims to increase taxes to pay Kenya's external debt."The reign of terror against the people of Kenya and the impunity of dangerous criminal gangs must end at whatever cost. The government is determined to stop criminals aiming to terrorize the public and harm Kenya," Kindiki said.He also said more protests are being planned on Thursday and Sunday and promised illegal activities such as looting will be firmly dealt with.Though Kenya's President William Ruto had already declined to sign into law the controversial tax bill, thousands of young people still poured onto the streets across the country on Tuesday calling for Ruto and his government to resign.Tuesday's protests resulted in widespread destruction of property and lootings. In the capital Nairobi, some businesses were attacked and looted, according to local media reports. Anti-riot police were forced to fire tear gas at protesters in Nairobi and other cities across the country.According to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, a total of 39 people have been killed and more than 360 injured in the anti-government demonstrations since late June.Nanjira Nyabola, a Kenyan social media user on X, said that despite the finance bill being the immediate trigger for the protests, the backdrop is a collapsing currency and rising inflation.On June 26, Ruto bowed to pressure and declined to sign the finance bill into law, saying he would listen to the views of Kenyans. He called for multi-sectoral, multistakeholder engagement to be held with a view of charting the way forward on matters relating to the contents of the finance bill. Speaking at a media roundtable in Nairobi on Sunday, Ruto said he was willing to meet with protesters, especially the youth, on any platform they are comfortable with and listen to them.Kenyan lawyer Miguna Miguna said that despite the government discarding the controversial finance bill, Kenyans want to see more through the sacking of corrupt government officials and the introduction of austerity measures.CAIRO -- Egypt's new cabinet has been sworn in before Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi at the Al-Ittihadiya Palace in the Egyptian capital Cairo on Wednesday, the state-run Nile TV reported.Before the swearing-in ceremony, Sisi promoted Abdel-Maguid Sakr to the rank of lieutenant general and appointed him as the minister of defense and military production, succeeding Mohamed Zaki.The new cabinet is headed by Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, who has been in the post since 2018.Comprising 30 ministers, the new government saw the merging of some ministries and the introduction of new ones, especially the economic portfolios.On Sunday, the Egyptian president said the new government's top priority is to mitigate the impact of rising prices and create more job opportunities.Chinese film and TV productions are not only captivating Kenyan audiences with their diverse content and high production quality, but are also making strides in promoting cultural exchange and mutual understanding between the two peoples.With the signing of new agreements on licensing and co-production between China's National Radio and Television Administration and Kenya Film Commission on Monday, more jointly produced TV programs are expected to be broadcast in the two countries.Under the new partnership, Citizen TV in Kenya will air 39 episodes of the second season of the Chinese drama series Like a Flowing River and 35 episodes of the Chinese drama series Welcome to Milele Village. Kenya's Bliss TV, on the other hand, will add the Chinese drama series A Very Close Relation to the many Chinese TV series, documentaries and entertainment programs they offer.Speaking at the signing ceremony of the agreements, Dong Xin, vice-minister of China's National Radio and Television Administration, said that Kenya and China plan to expand their collaboration in television and film to include co-broadcasting, co-production and adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence.The move was welcomed by Judith Munyinyi, secretary of information in Kenya's Ministry of ICT, who said the collaboration would highly impact Kenya's media industry, especially due to technology transfer.Grace Njenga, CEO of Bliss TV in Kenya, said that by showing aspects of traditional Chinese culture, modern lifestyles, social development and change, many Chinese productions being aired in Kenya have not only helped to spread and share Chinese culture around Kenya and Africa, but it has also deepened international understanding of China.A significant development in the agreement with Bliss TV is the introduction of dubbing where local artists will be voicing the Chinese programs which will be aired in the local Swahili language. Previously, viewers depended on subtitles for translation, she said."In addition to creating jobs for the voice artists, the translation of the films into Swahili through dubbing will expand the audience for Chinese films to include the illiterate who cannot read the subtitles," Njenga said.Timothy Owase, the chief executive officer of the Kenya Film Commission, said Kenya-China media cooperation in areas of training, co-production and technology adoption will spur the growth of the creative economy and unlock jobs for the local youth.Mwachari Butiko, a voice artist or dubber, from Sonatic Media, a Nairobi-based company, said Kenyans have been watching shows from China since the 1990s, but in recent years there have been more Chinese TV programs broadcast in Kenya, especially TV series, dramas and documentaries. Over the past year alone, Butiko said he has dubbed two Chinese TV series with Sonatic Media so they can be broadcast in Swahili language.Through the TV programs, Kenyans can have a better knowledge of China and the Chinese people and an understanding of the profound Chinese culture, he said."The TV shows give us an insight into the life in China. They bring us closer to Chinese culture," he said.One of the two TV series he dubbed last year has around 50 episodes and tells about the court life in ancient China, he said, adding that it impressed him a lot."From the TV series, I can see a very rich Chinese culture," he said.Munyinyi, secretary of information in Kenya's Ministry of ICT, pointed out that cooperation with China in the fields of media and performing arts is key to breaking cultural barriers and nourishing friendship.Wang Xiaodong in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed to this story.JOHANNESBURG -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the lineup of his new national executive cabinet Sunday, comprising ministers from various political parties that form the Government of National Unity (GNU).Ramaphosa finally made the long-awaited announcement after protracted negotiations that nearly collapsed when the main opposition party within the GNU demanded additional ministerial positions.The announcement came more than a week after Ramaphosa's inauguration on June 19 for his second presidential term. His re-election came with a reduced majority, forcing his party, the African National Congress, to share power for the first time in three decades.This led to the formation of the GNU with 10 opposition parties such as the Democratic Alliance (DA), Inkatha Freedom Party, Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, among others.In his late-night televised national address, Ramaphosa declared that the economy and the stability of the government would be of top concern to the new cabinet."The incoming government will prioritize rapid, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and the creation of a more just society by tackling poverty and inequality," said the president.The DA, which garnered over 21 percent in the recent elections, was allocated six cabinet posts. The party's leader John Steenhuisen, 48, was appointed minister of agriculture.Some minor parties also saw their leaders receive cabinet posts.Garry Conille, Haiti's prime minister, has announced a robust strategy to liberate his country from gang control while vowing to reclaim the country "house by house, neighborhood by neighborhood, city by city".Conille was speaking on Wednesday after visiting the base of the United Nations-backed Multinational Security Support mission led by police officers from Kenya. During the visit to the base located near Port-au-Prince International Airport, Conille, who was accompanied by Kenyan and Haitian officials, reaffirmed his government's commitment to closely work with both the Haitian National Police and the newly arrived Kenyan forces.He also underscored the importance of strategizing and planning operations aimed at restoring peace and order, emphasizing the critical role of public cooperation. On Tuesday, the first contingent of 400 Kenyan police officers arrived in the Haitian capital to launch a long-awaited peacekeeping mission in the Caribbean country that has been ravaged by gang violence.In a message shared with Haitian journalists after the arrival of the Kenyan police contingent, Jimmy Cherizie, one of the main gang leaders in the country called for community dialogue to help end violence in the Caribbean nation.However, Conille insisted that dialogue could only take place if the gang leaders stopped engaging in illegal activities. He further clarified that dialogue was not possible over what he claimed to be the gangs looting and killing citizens."Lay down your arms, recognize the authority of the State before any other arrangement," Conille told the gang leaders.According to the UNHCR, the gang wars in Haiti have now displaced over half a million people and nearly five million are facing severe food insecurity. Armed groups, which now control most of the capital, have formed a broad alliance while carrying out widespread killings and ransom kidnappings.NAIROBI -- Kenyan President William Ruto on Wednesday announced that his government has withdrawn new tax proposals, which had sparked nationwide protests since June 18 when a financial bill was made public for the first time.At a news conference in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, Ruto said that the government will implement immediate austerity measures to reduce expenditure, including cuts to the presidency's travel budgets and vehicle purchases. These measures will also apply to counties and ministries.The announcement came after violent protests in Nairobi Tuesday resulted in six deaths and more than 150 injuries. Protesters, chanting anti-government slogans, breached the heavily guarded parliament compound, causing property damage and setting fire to part of the building.In a televised address Tuesday night, Ruto labeled the protests "treasonous" and promised a swift government response, directing security forces to use all necessary means to prevent future threats to national security.The protests were triggered by tax hikes in the Financial Bill 2024, which aimed to raise an additional 346.7 billion shillings ($2.67 billion) to fund the government's 31 billion dollar budget for the 2024/2025 financial year. Following the bill's passage in parliament Tuesday, Ruto decided not to sign it, given the public outcry against it.Ruto, who campaigned on a platform of helping the poor, has faced pressure to increase revenue amid rising government debt repayments.He said Wednesday that the austerity measures will be applied across all branches of government, including the Executive Office of the President, parliament, and the judiciary. Without the new taxes, some development programs amounting to 1.58 billion dollars could be delayed, postponed or canceled.Additionally, Ruto vowed to tackle corruption to end wastage, a significant issue highlighted by protesters. To foster unity and address concerns, he announced plans for a meeting with various stakeholders, including the youth, to discuss the country's debt and budget deficits and listen to their views."There is a need as a nation to pick up from here and forge ahead together into the future. After getting rid of the Finance Bill, we will have a conversation as a country, how we manage the mounting debt and budget deficits, and we will engage young people and listen to their views," he said.Kenya's parliament on Tuesday approved a finance bill and will send it to President William Ruto for assent, as thousands of people marched through the streets of major towns and cities across the country calling for its rejection.Tension is building across Kenya as young people protest against proposed tax hikes in the bill that seeks to raise an additional $2.7 billion to reduce budget deficit.On Tuesday, people took to the streets in different cities across the country as the demonstrations entered the second week, calling on the legislators to reject the Finance Bill 2024, which they say will raise the cost of living despite many people already struggling to put food on the table.Several injuries and deaths were reported during the protests with police allegedly using live bullets to contain the protesters.The protests were triggered by proposed new taxes on bread, sugar, financial services, vegetable oils and a 2.5 percent motor vehicle tax. This is in addition to an "eco levy" on sanitary towels, diapers, phones, computers, tires and motorcycles.On June 18, the finance committee announced amendments to the bill to scrap some of the proposed taxes in response to the views of the people and stakeholders during public participation sessions.However, protesters declined the amendments calling for total rejection of the bill. They could also not bow to the call by Ruto on Sunday that the government would engage them on the way forward.Ready for a conversationRuto had said that he was ready for "a conversation" with thousands of young protesters."I want to tell them we are going to engage them," Ruto said in his first public comments on the protests on Sunday."We are going to have a conversation so that together we can build a greater nation," Ruto said during a church service in the Rift Valley town of Nyahururu.Eric Kimori, the director of Griot Consulting Kenya, a consultancy company that offers services in environment and climate change, called on President Ruto to avoid signing the bill into law "for the sake of the country's stability".Christianus Otieno, one of the protesters in Nairobi, said the current demonstrations stood out because digital activism drove nationwide physical protests."Young people have moved off their screens and onto the streets, forcing leaders to listen and even make amendments to the finance bill before it was passed," he said.Otiato Opali in Nairobi, Kenya, and agencies contributed to this story.edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn NAIROBI -- At least five protesters were shot dead and more than 150 others injured in Kenya on Tuesday as protests erupted countrywide for the second week in a row against new taxation measures proposed by President William Ruto's administration.The protesters, in their hundreds, gathered in various towns across the country, including the capital Nairobi.In Nairobi, at least four protesters were killed as they stormed parliament buildings, a few hours after the lawmakers passed a contentious law that seeks to raise taxes, while the first person was shot on the streets in the capital.The protesters breached the heavily guarded premises at about 3.00 pm local time to enter both the National Assembly and the Senate. A section of the building was set ablaze by the angry protesters, many of whom were chanting anti-government slogans."They said we would not get into parliament but here we are. The people have power," shouted a protester inside the National Assembly.The lawmakers on Tuesday morning passed the finance bill 2024 seeking to raise an additional 346.7 billion shillings ($2.67 billion), by such measures as increasing the railway development levy from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent, and the import declaration fee from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent.Legislators also imposed an eco-levy on imported items like smartphones and electronics, noting they end up as electronic waste damaging the environment.Ruto, who won the elections in August 2022 on a platform of helping the poor, has been under pressure to raise additional revenues amid rising government debt repayments.The finance bill was thus amended to remove the proposed 16 percent VAT on bread, transportation of sugar, financial services, and foreign exchange transactions, as well as the 2.5 percent motor vehicle tax.There will be no increase in mobile money transfer fees, and excise duty on vegetable oil has been removed. And levies on the housing fund and the proposed one on social health insurance will not attract income tax.Besides the parliament, protesters in Nairobi also raided the City County Government, vandalising property and setting ablaze some offices.The protests in the capital brought business to a standstill, with all the shops in the central business district remaining shut.Public transport was disrupted across Nairobi, with many operators of commuter buses grounding their vehicles."We have cancelled all our trips today for fear of our own safety. We have grounded all our vehicles," Joy Alecky, a manager with Super Metro Sacco, told commuters.The grounding of vehicles left hundreds of office workers stranded, with many of them opting to walk for kilometers away from the central business district to try and get vehicles home."I walked from Kenyatta National Hospital to Nyayo Stadium at about 3.00 pm, some 7 km away to get a vehicle to Kitengela. We have paid 1.5 dollars, double the normal fare," Evan Mukane told Xinhua.In Nyeri, besides marching on the streets of the town chanting anti-tax slogans, protesters stormed a retail outlet looting goods.A similar incident was reported in Eldoret, the president's political bedrock, where hundreds of protesters turned up on the streets asking the government to withdraw the new taxation measures. Similar scenes were witnessed in several other towns.On Monday, the government permitted the protests to go on, but warned that it would not hesitate to take action in case they become violent."The government undertakes that it respects, upholds, promotes and fulfils the inalienable constitutional right of every person to peacefully assemble, picket and present petitions to authorities," Interior and National Administration Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki said.Kindiki asked protesters to respect non-protesters and those who hold contrary views and end the demonstrations by 6.30 pm, adding that the government would not entertain lawlessness.In bid to dissuade public anger, Ruto announced last week that his government had dropped some tax proposals after listening to citizens' views.Ruto argued that the tough decisions he has so far adopted have yielded fruits, citing the drop in inflation from 9 percent in 2022 to 5.1 percent in May and the strengthening of the shilling against the dollar.The government is working on achieving a balanced budget in the next three years, he stressed, adding that this will reduce borrowing and ensure that the country lives within its means. NAIROBI -- Protesters in Kenya on Tuesday broke through security at the parliament building in Nairobi, capital of Kenya, and stormed the institution just hours after lawmakers passed a contentious tax hike bill.Hundreds of anti-tax hike demonstrators overpowered security guards and entered both the National Assembly and the Senate, where they vandalized the premises.Part of the parliament building was set on fire by angry protesters, many of whom were chanting anti-government slogans.Earlier this day, protesters took to the streets to oppose the finance bill that aims to raise taxes on a wide range of items, which they argue will exacerbate the economic hardships faced by citizens.At least four protesters were shot dead and several others sustained serious bullet wounds during the violent chaos, said Nairobi County Police Commander Adamson Bungei."I saw four bodies lying in a pool of blood outside parliament. Things are really sad," a witness told Xinhua outside the parliament building.Some protesters had brought down a gate near the Senate and burnt down a police lorry that was outside the parliament.Members of parliament were evacuated as the group of protesters confronted police.The finance bill seeks to raise an additional 346.7 billion shillings (about 2.67 billion U.S. dollars) in taxes, including the railway development levy from 1.5 to 2.5 percent and the import declaration fee from 2.5 to 3.5 percent.KHARTOUM - The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Monday said Sudan continues to spiral into chaos, with the humanitarian crisis worsening."The lives of 800,000 people -- of women, children, men, the elderly and people with disabilities -- are hanging in the balance as bombing and shelling continue in densely populated areas, causing widespread and long-term harm to civilians and severely disrupting the essential services they very much depend on," the OCHA said in its latest update on Monday.Over the past three months, it noted, up to 143,000 people may have been displaced from Al Fasher, the capital city of Sudan's North Darfur State due to clashes between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).The intensifying fighting in and around Al Fasher has claimed over 300 lives, according to Ibrahim Abdullah Khatir, director-general of North Darfur State's Health Ministry.Sudan has been witnessing deadly clashes between the SAF and the RSF since April 15, 2023. The conflicts have so far claimed more than 15,550 lives and displaced over 8.8 million people nationwide, according to recent estimates by the OCHA.Thousands of people marched on the streets in major cities in Kenya on Thursday to protest against what they termed as punitive taxes introduced by the government in a recent national budget proposal.The tax hikes are the latest effort by President William Ruto's administration to boost revenue and reduce borrowing, but they have triggered widespread opposition.Led largely by young Kenyans, the demonstrations began in the capital Nairobi on Tuesday before spreading nationwide on Thursday.Police hurled tear gas canisters at hundreds of demonstrators on Tuesday, forcing businesses to temporarily close because of fears over looting. At least 335 people have been arrested, according to a consortium of lobby groups, Agence France-Presse reported.Hours after Tuesday's demonstrations, the cash-strapped government agreed to make concessions, rolling back several of the tax hikes.But the government still intends to go ahead with some tax increases and has defended the proposed levies as necessary for filling its coffers and cutting reliance on external borrowing.On Thursday, protests were held across Kenya, with thousands assembling in Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and Nanyuki.Ruto defended the proposed taxes last month, saying the country must be financially self-sustaining.Robinson Makau, an Uber taxi driver and one of the protesters, said the Kenyan government proposed a 2.5 percent annual levy on the value of motor vehicles in the 2024-25 financial budget."This means that if my car is valued at $15,500, the government would take $390 annually ... That is not fair considering I had to pay taxes to import my car in addition to the fuel levies I pay every time I visit the fueling station," Makau said.Dennis Kabaara, a planning expert and founder of financial management company Fintellect in Kenya, said the government is able to raise revenues by taxing citizens, but the process should not be seen as punitive.However, Dennis Itumbi, a political strategy consultant to Kenya's ruling party, noted the country's huge debt obligation, saying that to meet its commitments, citizens have to tighten their belts."If we have to develop our country, Kenyans must roll up their sleeves. Our country is not going to be developed by others, by aid or by debt. It is going to be developed by us," Itumbi said. "Other countries are built by their people using their own taxes. Kenya will be built by Kenyans using our own revenue and taxes."A parliament source told AFP a vote on the proposals was expected on June 27, three days before the deadline for passing the bill.Agencies contributed to this story. LILONGWE -- Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appointed Michael Usi as the country's vice-president, replacing Saulos Chilima who died in a plane crash on June 10.The president made the announcement on Thursday through Secretary to the President and Cabinet Colleen Zamba, adding that the new vice president will be sworn in on Friday.Usi was the minister of natural resources and climate change until his appointment as vice president. He is also the vice president of the United Transformation Movement, a political party that Chilima founded and led as president.Born in 1968, Usi is known for his significant contributions to the entertainment industry as an actor, playwright, and filmmaker. He is also known for his development work in Malawi.In addition to his entertainment career, Usi has extensive experience with non-governmental organizations, focusing on community projects in health, education, and economic development.Throughout his career, Usi has been an advocate for social justice, education, and community empowerment, earning him widespread respect and popularity among Malawians.His appointment is reportedly seen as a strategic move to harness his charisma and experience to address the nation's challenges and promote development initiatives.Sustained financial assistance from China has significantly improved connectivity in Zambia, producing major projects that have formed the backbone of the country's infrastructure, said experts."China has contributed more to Zambia's infrastructure than any other country," said Francis Mwape Ndilila, founding partner at Ndilila Associates Architects, a major architectural designer based in the African country's capital Lusaka."If you remove the infrastructure built by the Chinese, there wouldn't be much left," he said, highlighting the profound dependency on these projects for the country's infrastructure backbone, including the Mukuku Bridge, the country's longest bridge and the 500-kilometer road linking Kasanka National Park with Luapula.The roads, bridges and other projects, many of which were built with loans from China, have opened up new areas, driving long-term economic growth and development, and provided many employment opportunities for locals, he said.Laveni Apuleni, a business consultant based in Livingstone, said loans from China have played a crucial role in the country's development.According to Apuleni, Zambia's journey into large-scale loans began around 2011, during the presidency of Michael Sata, who was determined to improve connectivity in the country."The debt incurred was aimed at building infrastructure that would unify Zambia, making it easier for people and goods to move across the nation," he said.The ambitious infrastructure projects spearheaded by the then government included extensive road networks and the creation of new districts.Regional integrationThese developments were seen as essential for boosting economic activities and integrating remote areas into the national economy. Without such investments, many regions in Zambia such as Mwandi and Luano would have remained isolated and underdeveloped, Apuleni said."The Chinese debt is one of the best debts because there is no one who can say they have not seen where the money was used," Apuleni said.He added that new roads, hospitals, schools and other infrastructure developments, many of which were built with Chinese assistance, are projects that have positively impacted the lives of many Zambians, and have laid the groundwork for economic growth and development.Ndilila also believes that the debt incurred for infrastructure development is justified."The debt was not for consumption but for infrastructure development. Infrastructure is going to be forever," he said, adding they have opened up areas, driving long-term economic growth and development.Apuleni said while loans have produced a positive impact on the country, it is clear that Zambia faces a delicate balancing act.He said the government must navigate the challenges of debt repayment while ensuring that the benefits of infrastructure investments are maximized.Apuleni said this includes addressing any inefficiencies and ensuring that future projects are undertaken with greater financial prudence.In a significant step toward restructuring debts in Zambia, China has taken a proactive role by co-chairing the Official Creditor Committee, or OCC.China's role in the OCC underscores its significant contribution to Zambia's infrastructure and is now playing a pivotal role in steering the debt restructuring process toward a favorable outcome.China was the first official international creditor to relieve Zambia's debt, as well as making efforts that will lead to significant progress in restructuring its debts, according to China's Foreign Ministry.As the complex debt restructuring in Zambia continues, Apuleni said there are tangible benefits that cannot be overlooked, adding that the key lies in leveraging these benefits to create a sustainable and prosperous future for all Zambians.Chali Mulenga is a freelance journalist for China Daily. YAOUNDE -- At least nine people have been killed and 46 others injured following an explosion at an ammunition warehouse in Chad's capital, N'Djamena, the country's Minister of Public Health, Abdelmadjid Abderrahim said on Wednesday.The cause of the fire and explosions, which occurred late Tuesday, is not yet known, Abderrahim told a press conference.Local media reported that civilians, including children, were among the victims.Early Wednesday, Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno visited those injured and the disaster site, located at the city's Goudji neighborhood."The situation is under control. The state will take care of those that were injured," Deby told reporters after the visit."This serves as a lesson to us concerning the construction of weapons warehouses in cities. We need to abide by international norms," he said, adding that a commission has been created to investigate the tragedy. JOHANNESBURG -- Cyril Ramaphosa, leader of South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC), took oath as the nation's president for the next five years on Wednesday at a ceremony in Pretoria, the administrative capital.Ramaphosa, 71, was re-elected as South African president by the National Assembly on June 14 with 283 votes against the other nominee, Julius Malema from the Economic Freedom Fighters, who received 44 votes.Under the South African Constitution, once elected as president by the National Assembly, the president-elect must assume office within five days.In the general elections on May 29, the ANC secured 159 out of the 400 seats in the National Assembly, for the first time falling below the 50 percent needed to maintain its 30-year-old outright majority in the lower house of parliament.A Chinese company operating in Africa has brought the spirit of China's hugely popular Village Super League to the continent by building a community soccer pitch and organizing a grassroots competition.Staff members at a Chinese-assisted cotton technology project in the city of Parakou, Benin, struck upon the idea of building the grounds and organizing the competition after noticing local children playing soccer despite having little equipment or even a suitable field to play on.Shou Xiaoyong, leader of the technical team of the project and an organizer of the contest, said the league aims to further promote friendship and understanding between China and Africa through a shared love for soccer.Twelve teams competed in the contest from March to late May, with 11 of the teams coming from nearby villages and one team from the University of Parakou.Players included cotton farmers, tractor drivers, carpenters and college students.The teams ran out onto a soccer field built using agricultural machinery and recycled material and shot at goals welded together by Chinese workers and local villagers.At halftime, performances of Chinese martial arts, African drums and dance entertained the assembled crowd of 1,000 supporters.On the sidelines, vendors sold steamed cassava, fried fruit and juice.The top three teams received medals and trophies, and each was awarded a sheep.Chinese experts have been in the city of Parakou for the past 10 years promoting cotton planting techniques and teaching locals about agricultural machinery technology."Local children in Benin often play soccer barefoot on the muddy ground. They don't have proper shoes, let alone jerseys and shorts, but they don't mind," Shou said, adding that villagers didn't even have a complete soccer field, and casually built a goal using branches and sticks.The situation is similar to that in Rongjiang — the rural county in China's Guizhou province where the phenomenon of the Village Super League first took off.Better facilitiesA couple of decades back, young villagers in Rongjiang played soccer on a sandy wasteland. Around 2001, they transformed the wasteland into a soccer field with gates made of fir trees and lines drawn with lime. This marked the beginning of soccer matches being played by village teams in a league format, which was the precursor to the Village Super League in Guizhou.In Parakou in March last year, Shou decided to build a standard soccer field on unused land named Friendship Soccer Field. The idea quickly gained strong support from the local villagers.Degnimon Fulbert, a soccer player in the league, told China Youth Daily that for people in big cities such games are very common, but for people in small villages, it's rare to participate in such gatherings. "It's turning my 'soccer dream' into reality," he said.Another player Karim Souleman, a telephone maintenance worker, told the paper that the league had helped improve his soccer skills.Shou said villagers from more villages want to join, and they plan to increase the size of the league to 20 teams.To further encourage soccer enthusiasts in Benin, a company in Rongjiang donated 200 jerseys valued at 20,000 yuan ($2,757) to them. The Guizhou Village Super League's logo, bullhead, is printed on the jersey to promote the spirit of striving and encourage them to play soccer well, according to Chang Longping from Guizhou Yueqian Chuanqi Clothing, the donor."Sports knows no boundaries, and the spirit of sports is always worthy of praise and admiration. We want them to feel our passion and friendship," said Chang.Xinhua contributed to this story.The new coalition government in South Africa will not result in a big policy shift in the domestic field or relations with China, and South Africa-China collaboration and exchanges are likely to intensify, experts say.South Africa announced the formation of a coalition government on Friday, South Africa's first in 30 years, which came two weeks after elections that resulted in no outright winning party.The African National Congress, which had the highest number of votes, formed a government with the Democratic Alliance, the Inkatha Freedom Party, the National Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance.Cyril Ramaphosa was chosen as the country's president on Friday. Congratulatory messages continued to pour in for the leader.Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane, a member of the ANC, was elected chairwoman of the National Council of Provinces, the upper house of parliament, on Saturday.The ANC said it was "ready to set aside our political differences, find innovative ways to work together in the interest of our nation".On Friday, Chief Justice Raymond Zondo opened the parliament's first sitting, swearing in MPs and presiding over the election of the speaker, who is from the ANC, and a deputy speaker, a member of the Democratic Alliance.Mikatekiso Kubayi, a researcher with the think tank Institute for Global Dialogue, associated with the University of South Africa, said he expects the ANC to retain the Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation for continuity and policy consistency."I am optimistic about what this coalition government will deliver. I don't see the foreign policy changing at all. I see a zero policy shift toward China. I don't see any parties interfering with China-South African relations (that benefit) both countries."The governing parties have committed to improving governance, delivering services, tackling challenges the country faces and helping the economy grow.Kubayi said both the Democratic Alliance and the ANC, the two major parties in the government, agree that they have to get the economy to grow, create jobs and promote infrastructure.China-South Africa cooperation should continue and broaden in areas such as green hydrogen and infrastructural development, he said.In the domestic field, there will be no policy changes, and it is expected that the government will perform better because both parties have something to prove to the people of South Africa, Kubayi said."The foreign policy won't change, but South Africa will consolidate its membership of the multilateral forums. They are not going to compromise anything but have continuity and consistency. They will maintain South Africa-China relations."There would be disagreements on a few policy issues, he said, but little contestation, and there would be no shift in the country's BRICS membership.Rule of lawJohn Steenhuisen, leader of the Democratic Alliance, in a previous speech, had told party supporters that it will co-govern in a spirit of unity and collaboration, adhering to the constitution and the rule of law.Alan Mukoki, chief executive of the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said it expects the government to give priority to meritocracy in allocating cabinet posts.There is an expectation that the governing parties will work together to create an environment for economic growth and create jobs, Mukoki said. Among many challenges facing the new government are a sluggish economy and high unemployment.Ramaphosa will be sworn in on Wednesday, and is expected to announce the composition of the Cabinet. The spirit of the new government has already been seen in the national assembly and many provincial legislatures.In 1994 the first independent president, Nelson Mandela, appointed one of his deputies from the National Party and the home affairs minister from the opposition.Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.South Africa's health department on Wednesday announced plans to procure vaccines against the Mpox, virus formerly known as monkeypox after the country recorded its first confirmed death from the disease this week.While addressing a media briefing, Joe Phaahla, South Africa's minister of health, said that five cases have been confirmed since May involving men aged between 30 and 39. However, none of the individuals were reported as having traveled abroad, suggesting the disease was being transmitted locally. He added that all five cases recorded in the country this year were classed as severe and required hospitalization."At the current moment, there is no registered treatment for Mpox in South Africa. However, the World Health Organization, or WHO, recommends the use of the Tecovirimat vaccine for the treatment of severe cases. We are trying to source vaccines from WHO member countries who have stockpiles that exceed their needs as well as from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization," Phaahla said.Close physical contactMpox is a viral infection which is transmitted through close physical contact. Its initial symptoms include headaches, fever, back pain, aching muscles and swellings which can develop into a rash. In 2022, WHO declared a public health emergency over an outbreak of Mpox. Despite lifting the public emergency last year, low levels of cases are still being reported in some countries."Although the World Health Organization has not recommended any travel restrictions, it is important for travelers to and from endemic countries to alert health officials on the situation to enable them to provide guidance for case detection and management," Phaahla said adding that one death is too many, especially from a preventable and manageable disease like Mpox.Of the remaining four cases in South Africa, the health minister said that one patient has been discharged, one discharged for home isolation and two remain in hospital. He urged South Africans to help the government in curbing further spread of the infectious disease by having those with suspected symptoms, or who were in contact with known patients, present themselves at healthcare facilities for early diagnosis and effective treatment.According to data published by WHO on June 5, the last severe cases of the disease in Africa were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in April after the country recorded 19 cases of the virus. WHO said that as part of its coordination of potential Mpox vaccine donors, it was working with other WHO member states who are interested in donating vaccines to the country.otiato@chinadaily.com.cn CAPE TOWN -- The South African parliament on Thursday announced that the inauguration of the country's president-elect will be held in Pretoria Wednesday next week.According to a statement issued by the parliament, the newly elected National Assembly, the lower house of the legislature, will hold its first sitting Friday at the Cape Town International Convention Center to elect the South African president for the next five years. This follows the country's 2024 general elections on May 29 where members of the National Assembly and provincial legislatures were elected."The first sitting of the National Assembly will commence with the swearing-in of all designated members in attendance by the chief justice. Following the swearing-in ceremony, the chief justice will also preside over the election of the speaker of the National Assembly," said Xolile George, secretary to the Parliament, in the statement.Once elected, the newly appointed speaker will take over the proceedings and preside over the election of the deputy speaker, according to him."With the speaker and deputy Speaker elected, the National Assembly will then be constitutionally competent to proceed with its first major task -- the election of the man or woman from amongst the members of the Assembly, to be inaugurated as the President of the Republic," said George. "This is a crucial process, as it sets the stage for the formation of the new administration that will govern the country. Once elected, the person ceases to be a member of parliament."The constitution stipulates that once elected as president by the National Assembly, the president-elect must assume office within five days by taking an oath or affirming their faithfulness to the republic and their obedience to the constitution, according to the parliament's secretary."After the conclusion of the first sittings, members will proceed to attend the inauguration of the president-elect, which is scheduled for June 19, 2024 in Pretoria," he added.The East African Community member states should consider the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative projects collectively instead of individually for better results in its regional integration efforts.That is the view of Ismael Buchanan, dean of the College of Business and Economics, Huye Campus of the University of Rwanda, who said BRI offers the region, which consists of eight countries including Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania, an opportunity to construct infrastructure projects that would connect the entire region, consequently increasing trade."The EAC member states could for instance consider construction of a railway line running from Kenya's port city of Mombasa to Rwanda's capital Kigali, Burundi to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This would be beneficial politically and economically, enhancing people-to-people interaction and country-to-country connectivity," he said.Buchanan said such a project would reduce the cost of transportation, reduce border conflicts and enhance regional integration. It would also reduce taxes, make it easy to use a common currency and reduce poverty because job opportunities would be created during construction.He said in addition to infrastructure development, BRI also focuses on agricultural modernization, an advantage that the EAC member states can utilize to improve food security.Cooperation in agriculture and food security is one of the priorities that feature prominently in the EAC integration process.The agricultural sector accounts for 25-40 percent of the gross domestic product of the EAC partner states and employs more than 80 percent of the population in the region.Agro-based regionAdditionally, more than 70 percent of the industries in the region are agro-based and depend on agriculture as the main source of raw materials. Agricultural commodities also constitute about 65 percent of the volume of intraregional trade in the EAC.China has said to support Africa to modernize its agricultural sector, as well as help the continent to expand grain plantations. This is in addition to encouraging Chinese companies to increase agricultural investment in Africa.The plan is aimed at helping Africa to achieve food self-sufficiency and independent sustainable development, promote food production, effectively boost the continent's ability to safeguard its food security, and help the continent reach related goals in agricultural modernization.Buchanan said African countries should also take advantage of the BRI to increase their exports to the Asian powerhouse.He also urged African countries to implement trade policies that will promote foreign investments especially in manufacturing, noting that many Chinese enterprises are willing to set up factories in Africa as long as the investment environment is conducive.At the national level, he said countries should strengthen their institutions, establish the rule of law to deal with injustice and corruption, and allow free trade so that Chinese investors will be motivated to invest and also recommend investment opportunities to other enterprises back at home.BLANTYRE, Malawi — Malawi's vice-president and nine others were killed in a plane crash, the country's president said on Tuesday.The wreckage of the military plane carrying Vice-President Saulos Chilima was located in a mountainous area in the north of the country after a search that lasted more than a day. There were no survivors, Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera said in a live address on state television.Hundreds of soldiers, police officers and forest rangers had been searching for the plane that also carried a former first lady after it went missing on Monday morning while making the 45-minute flight from the southern African nation's capital Lilongwe to the city of Mzuzu, around 370 kilometers to the north.Air traffic controllers told the pilot not to attempt a landing at Mzuzu's airport because of bad weather and poor visibility and asked it to turn back to Lilongwe, Chakwera said. Air traffic control then lost contact with the aircraft and it disappeared from the radar, he said.Seven passengers and three military crew members were on board. The president described the aircraft as a small, propeller-driven plane operated by the Malawian armed forces. The tail number he provided shows it is a Dornier 228-type twin-propeller plane that was delivered to the Malawian army in 1988, according to the ch-aviation website that tracks aircraft information.About 600 personnel were involved in the search in a vast forest plantation in the Viphya Mountains near Mzuzu, authorities said.Chilima was serving his second term as vice-president. He was also in the role from 2014 to 2019 under former president Peter Mutharika.Agencies via Xinhua LILONGWE, Malawi -- The wreckage of a plane that was carrying Malawian Vice President Saulos Chilima has been found, reports citing a military source said on Tuesday.LILONGWE - Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed to the international community for help in the search and rescue efforts after the plane with Vice President Saulos Chilima on board went missing Monday morning.In a televised address to the nation late Monday evening, Chakwera said that he has sought assistance from neighboring countries and other countries including the United States, Britain, Norway and Israel. The international community has committed to supporting the country's security agencies with high-tech search and rescue technology until the plane is found, he said.Meanwhile, Chakwera said he has ordered continued search and rescue operations as the country awaits international support.The Malawi Defense Force plane failed to land at its intended destination at Mzuzu Airport in northern Malawi due to adverse weather conditions, and the pilot was advised to return to Kamuzu International Airport in Lilongwe before the aircraft went off the radar around 10 am local time (0800 GMT) Monday, according to Chakwera.The president appealed to all Malawians to pray for the lives of those on board and their families, saying that he is "holding on to every fiber of hope that there could be survivors".The search and rescue operation is concentrated in the country's man-made forest, Chikangawa, on the outskirts of Mzuzu City. According to the president, this is where the plane's tracking has indicated its location.Meanwhile, Chakwera has directed the Malawi Defense Force to keep the public informed of the ongoing developments as the operation continues.The vice president was traveling to a funeral of the country's former Attorney General and Minister of Justice Ralph Kasambara, who was found dead in a room at a lodge in Lilongwe on Friday.A new report on African elephants has revealed the wild animals, just like humans, use "names" to address each other, findings that will help in conservation efforts of the endangered animal.The study published on Monday by Save the Elephants, a conservation group based in Nairobi, Kenya, Colorado State University and conservation organization Elephant Voices, provides unprecedented insights into animal cognition and the evolution of language.Researchers collected audio recordings of wild female-calf groups in Kenya's Amboseli National Park in 1986 to 1990 and 1997 to 2006 and Samburu and Buffalo Springs National Reserves in November 2019 to March 2020 and June 2021 to April 2022.The recorded vocalizations from the elephants indicated that they address each other with individually specific calls dubbed "vocal labels". The calls were uncovered using a machine-learning algorithm known as Random Forest.The ultimate dataset comprised 469 distinct calls, of which 101 unique callers and 117 unique receivers were identified.When these calls were played back, the elephants responded energetically to those addressed to them, approaching the source and vocalizing in response — further supporting the existence of "vocal labels".Joyce Poole, scientific director of Elephant Voices, said over the years she often observed a particular elephant's contact call answered excitedly by one family member, yet a second contact call was answered by a different elephant.Mickey Pardo, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Biology at Colorado State University, said the study not only shows that elephants use specific vocalizations for each individual, but that they recognize and react to a call addressed to them while ignoring those addressed to others."This indicates that elephants can determine whether a call was intended for them just by hearing the call, even when out of its original context," he said.Deeper understandingThe study findings will help in a deeper understanding of elephant cognition, offering invaluable insights for their conservation, according to the experts.George Wittemyer, senior author of the study, said it promotes fascination and interest in elephants, which hopefully translates to empathy for the species and support for conservation efforts."The hope is that if we can decipher how they communicate, we may be able to communicate more effectively and directly with them," he said in an email to China Daily.He told China Daily the study findings are only applicable to African elephants but not in other regions like Asia, because elephants in those regions are different species.Following population declines over several decades due to poaching for ivory and loss of habitat, the African forest elephant is now listed as critically endangered. The number of African elephants in the wild is about 400,000, while an estimated 60,000 elephants live in Asia, according to Wittemyer.Frank Pope, the chief executive of Save the Elephants, said despite the fact that elephants are separated from humans by a hundred million years of evolution, they have converged on many aspects of their lives."We live for similar periods, in extended family units with rich social lives, underpinned by highly developed brains. AI is helping to open up a new frontier in our understanding of the natural world; that elephants use names for one another is likely only the start of the revelations to come," he said.MZUZU, Malawi -- A search is underway in Malawi for the missing plane that carried the country's Vice-President Saulos Chilima and nine others.The plane belonging to the Malawi Defense Force went off the radar Monday morning and did not land at Mzuzu Airport in the northern region where the vice-president was supposed to connect by land to a funeral of the country's former Attorney General and Justice Minister Ralph Kasambara.The Malawi Defence Force and the Malawi Police Service, together with other security agencies, are on the ground in Chikangawa Forest in the outskirts of Mzuzu City where the plane is suspected to have gone missing.KINSHASA -- Recent deadly attacks attributed to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels have resulted in the deaths of at least 50 civilians in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), local media reported on Saturday, citing local officials.According to local sources, the ADF carried out two overnight assaults in the Beni region of North Kivu province, killing at least 50 civilians on Tuesday and Friday. Several civilians were reportedly abducted by the rebels.The ADF, an affiliate of the Islamic State in Central Africa, has been notorious for its violent activities in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which have been under a state of siege since May 2021, with military and police authorities replacing the civilian administration.Through its propaganda channels, the Islamic State Central Africa Province claimed responsibility for the deaths of over 60 "Christians."Since November 2021, Ugandan troops, alongside their DRC counterparts, have been engaged in joint operations to combat the rebel group in eastern DRC.KHARTOUM -- More than 100 civilians were killed in an attack by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on a village in central Sudan, a resistance committee announced on Thursday.One afternoon late last year, Paul Busienei, a principal at Tenges Boys High School in Kenya's Baringo County, watched news via a local television about a Chinese wonder grass touted as the solution to the animal fodder shortage in the country and the answer to improved milk production for dairy farmers.Despite the fact that Busienei is also a dairy farmer and clearly understood the fodder shortage facing farmers like him, he didn't pay much attention to the news, treating like another interesting story. He brushed it off.It was not until March, when a conversation with his friend revived the news, where he became convinced about the high nutritional value of the wonder grass. This saw him make a 119 kilometer-journey from Nandi to Crevation International Limited, a Nakuru based Chinese company that is growing the Juncao grass in a 20-hectare land."When I visited my friend's farm, he told me unlike the ordinary Napier grass, Juncao doesn't need additional nutrients. He told me his milk production had increased from 25 liters for high yielders to 40 liters and from 15 liters to 25 liters for low yielders per day," Busienei said.After visiting Juncao farm, he bought 500 stem pieces to plant for propagation. His plan is to have 1.6 hectares of his land under the grass in the near future."From what I saw in my friend's farm, this grass is a game changer. I thank the Chinese for the technology that is set to address both fodder shortage and milk production among dairy farmers in Kenya," he said.Africa's vast potential for renewable energy, combined with China's technological expertise and investment capacity, presents a unique opportunity for mutual economic growth, experts say.This collaboration can drive sustainable development, alleviate energy poverty and stimulate economic activities across the African continent, they said.Speaking during the African Development Bank Group's annual meeting in Kenya's capital Nairobi, which concluded on Friday, Kevin Kariuki, the bank's vice-president for power, energy, climate and green growth, said the continent needs to tap into renewable energy for industrial growth."I believe that by investing in Africa's renewable energy infrastructure, China can help build large-scale solar farms, wind farms and hydroelectric plants. These investments can provide reliable and affordable energy, which is crucial for economic growth."The continent has not fully tapped into its renewable energy sector, according to the State of Africa's Infrastructure Report 2024 published last month by the Africa Finance Corporation.This has continued to affect its economic growth rate, especially in the manufacturing sector, the report said."Our inability to tap into the renewable energy sector continues to slow down our growth rate," African Development Bank Group President Akinwumi Adesina said."Today our continent harnesses only a fraction of its renewable energy resources, with 1 percent of its solar potential, 5 percent of gas-to-power, 6 percent of geothermal, 7 percent of wind and 11 percent of hydropower. Hence, we cannot compete with other regions."Africa should forge renewable collaboration with China to unlock its energy potential, Adesina said.Expanded investmentIn recent years, China has expanded investment in renewable energy in Africa. In Garissa County, Kenya, a Chinese-built solar power plant has contributed to Kenya's energy grid, supporting local industries and communities, while helping reduce more than 43,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, Kenya's Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation said."One of the ways is to share expertise and provide training," Adesina said. "China can help build local capacities to manage and sustain renewable energy projects. This can be done through joint ventures, scholarships for African students in Chinese universities and the establishment of research and development centers in Africa."In addition to benefiting from Chinese technology, delegates at the meeting also called on African countries to develop renewable energy regulatory frameworks that foster investments and partnerships."China can assist by sharing its experiences in creating effective renewable energy policies and regulatory frameworks," Kariuki said. "Collaborative efforts can also focus on developing regional energy markets and grid interconnections, enabling countries to share renewable energy resources more efficiently."Paul Muthaura, CEO of the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative, identified financing as a major obstacle hindering renewable energy projects in Africa, highlighting China's potential to offer low-interest loans, thus bolstering support for such initiatives across the continent.Although African countries in general lag behind in renewable energy development, countries such as Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are implementing ambitious renewable energy development policies."It's no doubt that renewable energy has the potential to provide electricity to the 600 million Africans currently deprived of it, create jobs and stimulate industrial revolution in the continent," Muthaura said.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.CAIRO -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi instructed Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly to form a new government after the latter submitted his cabinet's resignation on Monday, the Egyptian presidency announced in a statement.Madbouly has been assigned the task of forming a new government with highly qualified, competent, and experienced individuals, to work toward achieving a multitude of goals, the statement said.Sisi ordered that the new government should prioritize maintaining Egypt's national security in light of regional and international challenges, developing health and education sectors, continuing efforts toward strengthening political engagement, and building on previous achievements in security, stability, and counter-terrorism efforts.He also instructed the new cabinet to persist in economic reform, with a focus on attracting and increasing investments, encouraging the growth of the private sector, and curbing the rise in prices and inflation.The statement noted that the current government will still perform duties until a new one is formed.According to state-run news website Ahram Online, this is the fourth cabinet reshuffle led by Madbouly, who has been serving as the prime minister since 2018. The last ministerial reshuffle was in August 2022.Sisi began a third consecutive presidential term in April, serving until 2030.Aid worth 370 million Kenyan shillings ($2.8 million) from China is due to arrive in Kenya to assist in restoration from the recent floods that affected the East African country.On Friday, Minister Counselor at the Chinese embassy in Kenya Zhang Zhizhong said two ships carrying 2,040 metric tons of aid are currently en route to Kenya's port city of Mombasa and will dock in the early weeks of June.Zhang was speaking at an event where the Chinese embassy handed over more than $38,000 to MCEDO Beijing School, in Mathare slums in Nairobi, to aid reconstruction following the devastating floods. The school was flooded when the nearby Mathare River broke its banks in April."This gesture symbolizes the deep friendship between China and Kenya and reflects the compassion of the Chinese people for their Kenyan counterparts. We hope that the students here will excel in their studies and grow to become pillars of strength for their families and their country," Zhang said.The donations will go toward the renovation of the school and the provision of desks, chairs, and books. In addition, every student will be given a new backpack to restart their studies.The latest data released by the United Nations indicate that an estimated 291 people have been killed while more than 280,000 people in Kenya have been displaced since the onset of heavy rains in March which continued into May.In Nairobi, about 3,000 people have been sheltered in temporary evacuation centers while a majority of the 65,493 affected people had been integrated with the community as of mid-May.Elijah Mungai, director of projects at Kenya's Ministry of Education, thanked China for the timely response to the humanitarian crisis."The floods caught us at a time when we were just about to open schools. Therefore, there was a need to give hope and when you join us in giving hope to those who were affected, we feel like you are meeting us at the place of need," Mungai said.In addition to supporting the rebuilding of MCEDO Beijing School, Mungai lauded the Chinese embassy in Kenya for continually offering scholarships to children from informal settlements."We want to appreciate that you chose Mathare, a slum area that requires to be empowered. When you empower them, you empower a very vulnerable part of our society. We will forever remember the People's Republic of China for the opportunities you have given to these children," Mungai said.Zhang said 39 students from the MCEDO Beijing School are set to benefit from scholarships from the embassy this year.The school has been supported by the Chinese embassy since 2007, helping thousands of students. It currently has an enrollment of more than 500 students.South Africa's governing party African National Congress has for the first time in 30 years lost its political dominance in the country's elections.South Africa conducted the national and provincial elections on Wednesday. With more than 99 percent of the votes counted as of Sunday morning, the ANC was said to have won 40.2 percent of the vote. The Democratic Alliance was said to have 21.78 percent, followed by the uMkhonto weSizwe party with 14.59 percent and Economic Freedom Fighters with 9.51 percent.The final result is expected to be announced on Sunday evening by South Africa's Electoral Commission at an event to be attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa.The country is required by law to form a government 14 days after elections. It is expected that the parties will start negotiating after the final results have been released.It marks the first time the ruling party fell below the 50 percent needed to maintain its 30-year-old unchallenged majority in the National Assembly.The ANC, which came to power in 1994 following the end of the apartheid, had secured majority votes in all the previous elections. It got 62 percent in 1994 and more than 57 percent in 2019.The ANC remains respected for its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies which are said to have helped millions of black families out of poverty, Agence France-Presse reported.Gideon Chitanga, a researcher with the University of Johannesburg's Centre for Africa-China Studies, said the ANC will have to negotiate with other parties and form a coalition government."It is a wake-up call for the ANC and we do not know what will happen in the next five years," said Chitanga."The ANC is committed to the formation of a government that reflects the will of the people, that is stable and that is able to govern effectively," Fikile Mbalula, secretary-general of the ANC, said at a news briefing on Sunday.The voters of South Africa have shown they expect the leaders of this country to work together in the interests of all, said Mbalula. "We wish to assure the people of South Africa that we have heard them. We have heard their concerns, their frustrations and their dissatisfaction."The ANC has many options for coalition partners among other parties, including one with DA, The Associated Press reported.Open to engagement"We'll talk to everybody," Mbalula said. "We are engaged and we are open to engagement. We need stability in this country."Nearly 28 million South Africans were registered to vote, and turnout was expected to be around 60 percent, according to the electoral commission.The ANC's national executive committee met on Friday to discuss their performance in the elections and the results of the meeting have not been communicated to the public.Mbalula said the ANC's leadership would meet on Tuesday for discussions on the way forward.UMkhonto weSizwe, led by former president Jacob Zuma, has slammed the door on the ANC by saying they won't go into coalition with them.DA chairwoman Helen Zille said all options were on the table, including allowing the ANC to rule alone as a minority government.Chitanga said the ANC has to "go to the drawing board", analyze where it went wrong and correct its mistakes. It remains to be seen how the ANC will respond if they will reshuffle the leadership or not, said Chitanga.The African Union Election Observation Mission to South Africa's 2024 elections has disclosed that the elections were conducted in a peaceful manner despite a tense political environment.Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story.The author is a freelance writer for China Daily. JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) has secured 159 out of 400 seats in the National Assembly in the country's 2024 general elections, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officially announced on Sunday evening.The main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), came second with 87 seats in the National Assembly, followed by the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) Party with 58 seats and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 39 seats, according to the official election results released by the IEC at the Results Operation Center (ROC) in Midrand, Johannesburg.More than 27 million South Africans took part in the 2024 national and provincial elections on May 29 to elect a new National Assembly and provincial legislatures.In the end, no party won an outright majority in the National Assembly. The ANC got less than 200 seats it needed to maintain its 30-year-old unchallenged dominance in the lower house of parliament.While announcing the final results, IEC Chairperson Mosotho Moepya declared the 2024 general elections as "free and fair."Calling them "the most difficult and highly contested elections" since the end of apartheid in 1994, Moepya said this year's elections were not without their challenges, as attempts to undermine the credibility of the IEC had been made.In his speech after the announcement of election results, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said it "represents a victory for our democracy, for our constitutional order and for all the people of South Africa.""We have held another successful election that has been free, fair and peaceful," said Ramaphosa. "Our people have spoken. As the leaders of political parties, as all those who occupy positions of responsibility in society, we have heard the voices of our people and we must respect their wishes.""And now, we are all called upon to recognize that the results of the election reflect the will of the people," he added.Following Sunday's official announcement of the election results, the newly elected National Assembly will have 14 days to hold its first sitting, where members will elect the president of South Africa for the next five years by a simple majority.The South African elections were held in a peaceful environment, said African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) head Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday.Kenyatta, who is a former president of Kenya, addressed the media about the preliminary report of the South African elections. South Africa held the national and provincial elections on May 29 and counting is still in progress. The AUEOM had 65 observers from 26 African countries. Kenyatta pointed out that the pre-election period showed high tensions and concerns over the potential misuse of social media for spreading fake news, disinformation and misinformation, which could incite violence."Despite the challenges and tensions, the 2024 elections were conducted peacefully, demonstrating the resilience of South Africa's democratic processes. South Africans freely exercised their constitutional right to vote and voted peacefully," said Kenyatta.The AUEOM also commended the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) for its online registration which encouraged youths to register to vote, allowing citizens living abroad to vote and visiting those who are physically challenged to give them a chance to take part in the elections. Over 76,000 registered to vote at 111 foreign missions abroad.The AU mission will release the final report with comprehensive findings and recommendations two months after the elections.Goodluck Jonathan, head of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) International Election Observer Mission (IEOM) said the elections were peaceful. The mission comprised 34 observers from 17 African countries. The public broadcaster provided "equitable coverage for political parties" and candidates specifically during rallies and launching of manifestos, said Jonathan. who is the former president of Nigeria. He commended the IEC for using the Universal Ballot Template that enables voters with visual impairments to vote independently and in secret.Jonathan said, "The electoral environment was generally peaceful.... The EISA IEOM observed that the final days of the campaigns were conducted in a context that was largely free of fear and intimidation. Voting and counting took place in an open and transparent atmosphere in the presence of observers, party agents and the media. Citizen observers made up 80 percent of observers encountered on election day."Friendly relations and cooperation between China and Africa will not be encroached upon even as the United States has tried in recent years to counter China's influence on the continent, experts have said.Kenyan President William Ruto last week visited the White House, the first state visit by an African president since 2008, reflecting the importance of a continent that is home to 1 billion people and nurtures close trade ties with China, but ranks behind on Washington's agenda, Reuters commented.US President Joe Biden pledged to designate Kenya as the first sub-Saharan African country to be a major non-NATO ally. The two countries also agreed on other cooperations, including supporting Kenya's semiconductor industry.The state visit came barely two years after the US-Africa Leaders Summit held in December 2022, when Washington pledged to invest $55 billion in Africa by 2025.As the continent has suffered from neglect in the past, African scholars are skeptical, and wonder whether the US can fulfill its pledge.Aly Khan Satchu, a Kenya-based analyst, said the US feels it has lagged behind China in terms of engagement with Africa, and is trying to catch up, as China has been Africa's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years, and one of the biggest investors in the continent.Despite the deals signed during Ruto's visit, Kenyans can only wait and see the results, said Macharia Munene, a professor of history and international relations at the United States International University in Nairobi, noting the US is "good at making promises but never delivering".During Ruto's visit, the US agreed to start building in 2026 the 440-kilometer Nairobi-Mombasa Expressway, a badly needed road linking the two largest Kenyan cities.But Cavince Adhere, a Kenyan scholar of international relations, said the expressway was promised by the US to former two Kenyan presidents, and that it may not be implemented even during the current Ruto administration."The expressway came up when the US learned that China and Kenya were planning to build the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway. This year, the SGR is celebrating seven years of operation. For the US, it is promise after promise," he said.Construction of the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR, a major infrastructure project in Kenya under the Belt and Road Initiative, was completed in 2017, just two and a half years after the construction started.Adhere said the US may not compete with China on major infrastructure projects, because traditionally it has never been interested in improving the economic capabilities of African countries through infrastructure construction.The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, launched in June 2022 by the US-led G7, to compete with the BRI, is yet to deliver a single project, said Adhere, noting the BRI has transformed Africa's infrastructure landscape.What's more, China has become the most preferred destination for young Africans seeking higher education abroad, he said.Rice varieties introduced from China have significantly enhanced production in Burundi, a Burundi agricultural expert said on Wednesday.Enhanced collaboration with China has facilitated our country in achieving greater success across various fields of production, especially in grain cultivation and livestock farming, said Alfred Niyokwishimira, director general of Burundi Institute of Agricultural Science and a 2020 alumnus of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.Specifically, the introduction of the eight hybrid rice varieties from China has elevated the rice yield from 3 to 4 tons per hectare to 9 to 10 tons per hectare, mitigating the hunger and malnutrition challenges in Burundi, Niyokwishimira added.He made the remarks at the inaugural joint agricultural research and development symposium organized by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation from Wednesday to Thursday.Situated in East-Central Africa, Burundi, despite being a typical agricultural country obtaining abundant sunlight, warmth and land resources, faces serious food security crises due to factors such as weak infrastructure, outdated agricultural techniques, agricultural machinery shortage, and plant diseases and pest infestations.To fulfill the commitments made at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, China has dispatched around 50 agricultural experts to Burundi since 2009 to enhance collaboration in practical agricultural technology and the training of agricultural professionals. These experts specialize in various fields such as rice cultivation, agricultural product processing, aquaculture, fruit tree cultivation, livestock and poultry management, and soil fertilization.The introduced hybrid rice varieties were meticulously selected by Chinese and Burundian agricultural experts after conducting on-site assessments of local conditions and are now being promoted across Burundi, Niyokwishimira said.We highly appreciate the quality of the seeds exported from China to Burundi, and they have made a significant contribution to increasing production yields, Niyokwishimira said.He also expressed optimism that the high-yield hybrid rice varieties in Burundi can be effectively expanded to West African nations.Niyokwishimira pointed out that although notable progress has been made through bilateral cooperation aimed at improving people's well-being and fostering sustainable agricultural development, Burundi continues to encounter numerous challenges. New cooperation projects between China and Burundi are under way in areas of agricultural machinery, livestock vaccine promotion, horticulture, and bean and fruit cultivation, he added.In African nations, including Burundi, all harvesting activities are conducted manually, resulting in approximately 40 percent of harvested crops being wasted and complicating quality control processes, he said, emphasizing that agricultural machinery can enhance production efficiency while ensuring quality.In face with changing climate conditions, he also highlighted the urgency of presenting a solution in the agricultural sector, noting that shifting rainfall patterns and rising temperatures have created new requirements for irrigation, farming schedules and harvest management.Tens of millions of South Africans voted on Wednesday in an election that could reshape the future of the nation.This will be the most contested election for South Africa in the past 30 years, with the ruling African National Congress, or ANC, facing serious challenges from other parties amid a sluggish national economy and high unemployment.A total of 27.8 million people registered to vote in the national and provincial elections, the highest since the end of apartheid in 1994. A total of 23,292 polling stations were established across the country.The elections, which coincide with South Africa's celebration of 30 years of freedom and democracy, are the seventh general elections held since the end of apartheid."South Africa's general election is a watershed moment in the political history of the country," Aleix Montana, an analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft, told Agence France-Presse.The Electoral Commission of South Africa, or IEC, said many South Africans turned up to vote on Wednesday.IEC's deputy chief electoral officer Masego Sheburi said voting began smoothly but there were some delays in the beginning at some polling stations.The voter turnout is expected to be more than 66 percent, the figure recorded in the previous election in 2019, said Sheburi.The Department of Home Affairs said their offices would remain open from 7 am to 9 pm on Wednesday to enable those who have lost their identity documents to apply for temporary ones and be able to cast their votes.Nomonde Mnukwa, acting government spokesperson, said: "There is a conspicuous and palpable sense of jubilation at voting stations across the country as citizens exercise their constitutional right in this seminal seventh national election."A total of 2,828 members of the South African National Defense Force have been deployed to work with the police during the elections.Drones deployedTebello Mosikili, deputy national commissioner of police, said they have deployed "10 multidisciplinary airborne surveillance helicopters and drones" for monitoring the elections.Nokuthula Ngcobo, a 36-year-old resident of Johannesburg, said she was excited to vote for her uMkhonto weSizwe party, which she thinks is capable of transforming the country for the better.UMkhonto weSizwe party was formed in 2023 and is led by former president Jacob Zuma.Ngcobo had lost her identity document on Tuesday. However, she managed to get a temporary identity card and cast her vote.She said: "I want the incoming government to create job opportunities. There are some graduates who are not employed. I want those above 65 years of age who are members of parliament to give youths a chance."The unemployment rate stands at 32.9 percent currently.Relebogile Mashaba, 45, said she voted for the ANC to give the party another chance to complete the development projects they started. She said the ANC has improved the lives of the people through infrastructure projects and allowing free education for the poor.Meanwhile, support for the ANC hovers at around 42 percent, an opinion poll showed, Reuters reported. A result of below 50 percent would mean the ANC would have to make a deal with one or more smaller parties for the first time since it came to power 30 years ago.Among the opposition parties vying for power is the Democratic Alliance, which won the second-largest vote share in 2019. It has formed an alliance with several smaller parties.President Cyril Ramaphosa, 71, sat alongside other voters in Soweto, where he was born. Ramaphosa said he was certain South Africans would give the ANC "a firm majority".The electoral commission said the election results will be announced on Sunday.Agencies contributed to this story.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.JOHANNESBURG - South Africans began to cast their ballots on Wednesday morning in the country's 2024 general elections.More than 27 million voters are expected to vote at over 23,000 voting stations across the country to elect a new National Assembly and provincial legislatures, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) of South Africa, the country's electoral body.The 2024 national and provincial elections, which coincide with South Africa's celebration of 30 years of freedom and democracy, are the seventh general elections held in the country since apartheid ended in 1994.The IEC said the election results will be announced on Sunday. The new National Assembly will then choose the president of South Africa for the next five years.For Zhao Tian'an, giving those in need a helping hand is not just a matter of international concern, but also a family affair as well.Zhao, his older brother and late father have been involved in China-aided construction projects in 10 African countries."At times, when things were tough and I wanted to go home, I found a lot of emotional support by reading my father's diaries," said Zhao, 60, who spent more than two years building the Maseru District Hospital and Eye Clinic in Lesotho in southern Africa.In the 1960s, his father was part of the first group of construction experts that China dispatched to Africa."When I was 2, my father went to Guinea and was in charge of designing the People's Palace, the national parliament," Zhao, who is from Hunan province, said. "From his diaries, I learned of the tough conditions he and his colleagues faced and how they overcame their difficulties."The most impressive thing was how — when faced with undersea silt that posed a great threat to safety — they managed to solve the problem of the foundation's uneven settlement. They had no examples to follow, but yet they eventually worked out a way based on thorough investigation and a lot of experimentation."Zhao's father also had a role in building the National Theatre in Mogadishu, Somalia. He returned to Africa from 1973 to 1976, doing quality control checks on projects in five countries in which China had a hand.Zhao said it was his father, who died in 2002, that inspired him and his older brother to embark on their African odyssey.In 2010, Zhao's brother, as a member of a Chinese experts team, went to Ghana for the preliminary design of a hospital. Three years later, he went to Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia to design primary schools in impoverished areas.As for Zhao, his engagement with Africa began in Libya, where he took part in a residential project in 2008. Building the hospital in Maseru was his second time visiting the continent, when he was appointed deputy head of the construction project in 2021."Unlike our father, we two have mainly worked on low-cost projects that deliver fairly quick benefits to locals," Zhao said."For example, many of the locals in Maseru suffer from eye diseases because of exposure to strong ultraviolet rays at a high altitude. So, when the hospital was designed, we concentrated a lot on the eye clinic."When it opens, locals will no longer need to travel to South Africa for treatment."The 200-bed hospital was built with a 400-million-yuan ($55 million) donation from the Chinese government as a Belt and Road Initiative project to improve the lives of locals, and will begin operations next month.At its peak, the project created more than 300 jobs for locals."I got to know the job from a friend who speaks Chinese and had worked on the project," Retselisitsoe Letsasa, the project's human resources manager, said."At first, it was a challenge for me because I don't speak Chinese. But the Chinese are very easy to work with and always eager to help. I have been mainly in charge of recruiting locals. It's interesting and enjoyable to work as a bridge between local workers and the Chinese staff."Letsasa expressed her gratitude to Zhao and his company, PowerChina Zhongnan Engineering Corporation, for giving her a chance to visit China last year, which she said inspired her to pursue a master's degree in the country."I visited several energy companies where I learned how they managed to make sure that everything was sustainable. China is much more advanced than us in using clean energy such as hydropower and wind power," she said. "I studied environmental management in my undergraduate years, so I want to do a master's degree in China to study environmental and sustainable development."Letsasa is not the only one who has benefited from such visits. With Zhao's help, two groups of African officials, technical experts and company representatives took part in training programs in China last year, organized by PowerChina Zhongnan and sponsored by China's Ministry of Commerce.'Amazing' tripTsotang Amin Mphethe, chairman of the Local Government Service Commission in Lesotho, said his trip to China in July was amazing."I witnessed China with my own eyes. I found it to be a very big country with kind and loving people. I got the chance to visit a few Chinese factories in manufacturing and electric power, and I see growing prospects for cooperation between the two countries," he said.China has helped Lesotho and other African countries in many ways, Mphethe said, adding that he cherishes the China-Africa friendship."China has offered us humanitarian assistance in a good spirit, wanting to see us grow and to be independent," he said.China's aid to Africa began in 1956. Their friendship continues to grow and blossom, with the two sides helping each other in many ways over the years. Through various mechanisms including the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the relationship between the two has entered a new era of building an even closer China-Africa community with a shared future.Zhao said his family has experienced firsthand the enduring China-Africa friendship, and he wants to do more to promote mutual communication and collaboration."Actually, I am much busier after I came back. I'm working with universities and companies in Lesotho and neighboring countries, including South Africa, hoping to build connections between them and those in China to provide more opportunities for people-to-people exchanges and business cooperation."wangxiangyan@chinadaily.com.cnDHAKA, Bangladesh/VALLEY VIEW, Texas — A cyclone flooded coastal villages, blew away thatched roofs and left hundreds of thousands of people without power on Monday in southern Bangladesh and eastern India, while powerful storms killed at least 18 people and left a wide trail of destruction across the US Southern Plains and Ozarks.Dozens of Bangladeshi villages were flooded after flood embankments were either washed away or damaged by the storm surge, TV stations reported. Nearly 800,000 people had been evacuated from vulnerable areas in Bangladesh on Sunday.The death toll from the cyclone has risen to at least 10 people, with more than 30,000 homes destroyed and tens of thousands more damaged, local officials said on Monday.In India's West Bengal state, roofs on thatched houses were blown away while electric poles and trees were uprooted in some coastal districts. Four people died from electrocution, authorities said, taking the death toll in the state to six. Heavy downpours also inundated streets and homes in low-lying areas of Kolkata city.Cyclone Remal weakened considerably after making landfall in Bangladesh's Patuakhali district early on Monday morning with sustained winds of 111 kilometers per hour.Affecting airportsIndia's Kolkata airport reopened after being shut on Sunday, and Bangladesh shut down the airport in the southeastern city of Chattogram and canceled all domestic flights to and from Cox's Bazar. Loading and unloading in the Chittagong seaport was halted and more than a dozen ships moved from jetties to the deep sea as a precaution.Volunteers helped Bangladesh's hundreds of thousands of evacuees move to up to 9,000 cyclone shelters. All schools in the region were closed until further notice.Remal was the first cyclone in the Bay of Bengal ahead of this year's monsoon season, which runs from June to September.Over the weekend, at least 18 people were killed across central United States as tornadoes and other extreme storms hit several states including Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma.Rescue efforts were continuing and hundreds of thousands of people were without power after the storms struck the Southern Plains region beginning late on Saturday.The storms threatened to bring more violent weather to other parts of the Midwest. By Monday, the greatest risk was forecast to shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York.The latest bout of extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through a rural Iowa town, killing four people.Meanwhile, the US was preparing for what government forecasters have called a potentially "extraordinary" 2024 Atlantic hurricane season beginning on June 1.Agencies via XinhuaSouth Africa's long-ruling African National Congress party is expected to face serious challenges in the upcoming elections, the most fiercely contested poll in 30 years, with the public calling for massive reforms to address a range of problems plaguing the country, including a sluggish economy, high unemployment rate and corruption.Wednesday's national and provincial elections "would be the most highly contested elections since 1994. This is the first time that more than two former senior leaders of the African National Congress are challenging the ANC", said Sethulego Matebesi, an associate professor and head of the department of sociology at the University of the Free State, in Bloemfontein, South Africa.The ANC won a majority in all previous elections in South Africa since it came into power in 1994 after the end of apartheid. In the 2019 election, the party got 57.5 percent of the votes. The main opposition parties include the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters party.Matebesi said that people will expect whoever wins to prioritize provision of clean water and electricity, combating crime and corruption and creation of jobs. The current unemployment rate in South Africa is around 33 percent, one of the highest in the world.Gideon Chitanga, a researcher from the University of Johannesburg's Centre for Africa-China Studies, said the 2024 elections could see the ANC's dominance being put to test for the first time. He said the elections will see a major challenge to the 30-year ANC rule. While South Africa has made huge progress in democratic consolidation, economic growth has been less than robust because of local and international factors, he added.He said the paradox of South Africa is that while progress has been made in democratic consolidation, political freedom and building institutions of democracy, there are few economic opportunities. South Africa has been recording an average of less than 1 percent per annum economic growth, while the country's economic blueprint, the National Development Plan, targets an annual economic growth rate of 5 percent to match the growing population."The opinion polls suggest that there will be some coalition governments ... I think the ANC will win with a slight majority," he said. "The country should work with its international partners like China and the United States to attract more capital to address unemployment, inequality and poverty. More needs to be done to address the challenges of weak economic growth, crime, corruption and governance."Nombuso Khumalo, a 40-year-old resident of Johannesburg, said she is ready to vote for the party of her choice. The party that will win must create job opportunities, ensure there is water and electricity and show commitment in fighting social ills like drug abuse, said Khumalo. She said she registered to vote and promised to wake up early on voting day.The past weekend saw most of the political parties canvassing for votes across the country. ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed supporters in Johannesburg where he promised to rule with integrity when his party is elected to power. He promised economic growth and an end to unemployment. Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen addressed party supporters in Western Cape where he promised to "save South Africa". He promised to tackle corruption, grow the economy and create jobs.Enock Kavindele, head of Southern African Development Community Electoral Observation, said the organization will observe the campaigns and actual voting process including the counting to ensure that these elections are conducted in a peaceful, free, fair, transparent and credible manner.Busisiwe Mavuso, CEO of Business Leadership South Africa, an association of South Africa's major corporations, told China Daily that elections raise the risk premium of the country, which is expected to dissipate after the elections. Some investors usually have a "wait and see" attitude till the election results are announced. Mavuso pointed out that it is important for South Africa to make the environment conducive for investment with steps such as friendly immigration policies, tackling crime and removing red tape.The author is a freelancer journalist for China Daily.As African countries strive to industrialize through stepping up their industrial policies and accelerating the roll-out of industrial parks and special economic zones, experts and leaders are of the view that a lot still need to be done to boost the manufacturing sector.Henok Shawl, the Africa managing director of the Boeing Company, said it's not an easy task to get manufacturing right, the reason Africa is struggling in many ways to get it right."You need a lot of pieces of the puzzle to come together; there is integration of the countries, technologies, incentives, industrial parks, special economic zone, infrastructure and logistics," he said during the Africa CEO Forum held in Rwanda's capital Kigali last week.Shawl said investors will not come and invest in Africa's manufacturing sector, unless policies are in place and are implemented, adding that Africa will not develop unless it industrializes first."We need to make sure that we build as many factories as we can and satisfy our consumption needs and the export market," he said.Shawl added that for Africa to be able to mitigate the effects of climate change and for its population to be able to live through it, the continent will have to industrialize first.He urged African countries to invest in green manufacturing, develop green energies with the support of the international partners and ensure that the energy is availed to the private sector at an affordable cost.Similar sentiments were shared by Mary Porter Peschka, the East Africa regional director of the International Finance Corporation, who said that her company is prioritizing green investments and those that support women in its credit financing.She said while Africa has achieved a lot, there is need for improvement on creating an enabling environment for the growth of the manufacturing sector. This is in addition to ensuring the right environment for availability of capital locally.Jean-Chrysostome Ngabitsinze, the Rwanda minister of trade and industry, said the agricultural sector could spur manufacturing in Africa.He said Africa has huge tracks of idle land that has the potential to produce enough food for the continent and for agro-business.Ngabitsinze said technology and innovations can unlock the potential of the agricultural sector in Africa as well as help address the post-harvest losses, which has been a key challenge across the continent.He added that putting the pieces together to have one unity in terms of development is the greatest challenge for Africa.Ngabitsinze cited the African Continental Free Trade Area, which despite being a good idea with great potential, it is yet to be implemented due to logistic issues.He termed lack of sustainable political governance, as another key hindrance to development and investment in the continent.Ngabitsinze said a country may have a project that it wants to be financed for the next 50 years, for instance, but due to instability, financial partners may refuse to finance it, because it's a big risk."Development is connected to governance, if there is good governance investors will come in," he said.Satbir Hanspaul, the chief executive of the Hanspaul Group, said many local companies are struggling to access financing due to lack of supportive policies, hence they can't realize their investment potentials.He said there is need for policies to ensure that the raw materials mined in Africa are not exported outside the continent but fully processed within the continent.edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cnAfrica is hopeful that the upcoming 77th session of the World Health Assembly or WHA scheduled for May 27-June 1 in Geneva will prioritize the health challenges that are plaguing the continent.Speaking at a pre-WHA press briefing webinar on Thursday, Dr Ngashi Ngongo, chief of the staff and head of executive office of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, he expects Africa's health priorities to take center stage at the assembly to realize the vision of a safer, healthier and prosperous Africa."We want to see the discussions also focus on Africa's critical public health priorities linked to universal health coverage and also health security including recurrent vaccine preventable disease outbreaks such as cholera, measles, polio, yellow fever and diphtheria," he said.Ngongo also expects discussions on the emerging and re-emerging diseases like Mpox, the burden of pandemic diseases such as malaria, HIV and Tuberculosis which continues to pose significant challenges on the continent.This is in addition to antimicrobial resistant, communicable diseases and the current high maternal and child mortality in the continent.He said the disease burdens are exacerbated by the continent's weak health systems, conflicts, climate change and other social detriments such as poverty and food insecurity."Last year we registered 166 public health events and outbreaks, an average of three events every week. That's a huge challenge considering the context of Africa in terms of the systems, financing and the overall capacity to respond," he said.Dr Githinji Gitahi, the group chief executive of the Amref Health Africa, said it's important for Africa to have a clear picture of what it's going to do at the assembly.He said 54 percent of people in Africa have no access to universal health coverage, adding that household gross domestic product per capita expenditure on health is highest in the low-income countries."The vulnerable are the ones that are carrying the health systems in their countries which multiplies the vulnerability," he said.On the upcoming assembly, Gitahi expects discussions on harnessing country learning and leadership in terms of localization as well as accelerating reduction of maternal and neonatal diseases and antimicrobial resistance.This is in addition to the future of global health initiative – the Lusaka agenda which is about working with global health initiatives to localize their strategies so that they are country-led, community-centered, and people-centered.Gitahi also expects discussions on social participation of universal health coverage. "The power rests with people, we don't empower people, we harness their power – how to get people demand faster achievement for universal health coverage," he said.Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the regional director of the World Health Organization regional office for Africa, called on African leaders to continue prioritizing health and government projects, noting that despite the fact that the world is emerging from the COVID-19, African countries are experiencing additional health challenges.She called for a fair system of access to financing for development including for health. "I urge international communities to ensure that African countries can borrow affordably," Moeti said.edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cnChinese enterprises are attracting college talent from Kenya and other African countries in technology and other career paths, as hundreds of college students flocked to a career fair that kicked off on Wednesday in Kenya's capital Nairobi.The job fair, which lasts until Friday, held at the University of Nairobi, attracted 54 recruiters from Kenya and various other countries, and international organizations based in Kenya. About half of the employers are Chinese companies, according to the Confucius Institute at the university.Wang Shangxue, director of the institute, said the recruitment exercise not only enables Chinese companies to select the best Kenyan students, but also guides the students in selecting the best path to their desired careers.Samuel Amukowa, a high school student at Reverend Muhoro Secondary School for the Deaf, was hoping to pursue a career as a sign language interpreter. However, after visiting the Huawei Kenya stand at the career fair, he was able to explore different avenues to reach his aspirations."I have always wanted to work in a field where I can help people with a disability. As I pursued my studies, I always thought that the only way to work in the field involving the deaf was through sign language interpretation," Amukowa said, adding that he was attracted to the Huawei stand because of the advanced technology that the company excels in.High-tech areas"However, the officials at the Huawei stand have shown me different areas in information technology where I can apply my skills, like developing artificial intelligence tools to help with interpretation."Though Amukowa is just a high school student, he said he has decided to work toward a career in technology when he gets to college with the information he received at the fair. He was among the many students who were attracted to the booths of Chinese companies during the opening ceremony of the fair on Wednesday, most of whom said it has given them an opportunity to broaden their knowledge of their prospective careers and make connections to possible employers.Harriet Wanjiku, a recruiter from Kevla Motorcycle and Spare Parts Company, a Chinese enterprise in Kenya, said it is important to open channels of communication for students with regard to career guidance, mentorship and talent identification."I attended the career fair and talked to the recruiter at this company's stand. He advised me to get some training in marketing, though I had studied for a bachelor's degree in education. I left them my contact details and when they were recruiting this year, I was among their first picks," Wanjiku said.The annual fair, which is hosted by the Confucius Institute at the University of Nairobi with the support of Chinese enterprises in Kenya, offers hundreds of job opportunities for Kenyan students who are able to connect and exchange contacts with possible employers.Naomi Nyaboga, section head in the office of career services at the University of Nairobi, said Chinese enterprises have been instrumental in offering students an opportunity to explore new-age careers.DAR ES SALAAM -- Three foreigners, from Brazil, Kenya and India, and eight Tanzanian technicians were killed early Thursday, and two others seriously injured, following an explosion at a sugar factory in Morogoro region in eastern Tanzania, a local official said.Shaban Marujugo, Morogoro region commander for the Tanzania Fire and Rescue Force, told Xinhua over the phone that the blast occurred at 1:00 a.m. local time (2300 GMT Wednesday) at the Mtibwa sugar factory in Kilombero district.The blast hit the control room, where technicians were testing one of the newly fixed heating systems for sugar production, Juma Ramadhan Palamba, an electrician at the plant, told Xinhua, also via phone.The explosion occurred after a pipe that releases steam into a boiler busted, Palamba said.The newly fixed system was scheduled to start operations on Friday, he said, noting that he escaped unhurt because he went out of the control room to answer a phone call at the time of the explosion.KINSHASA - Vital Kamerhe, deputy prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), was on Wednesday elected president of the National Assembly, the country's lower house of parliament.Kamerhe, who leads the Union for the Congolese Nation, won 371 of the 407 votes cast. Jean-Claude Tshilumbayi, from the ruling party Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), was elected first vice-president, while Christophe Mboso, the outgoing speaker, was elected second vice-president.According to the Congolese army, Kamerhe was one of the targets of a failed coup attempt in the Central African country on Sunday.His residence was raided by a group of armed men early Sunday in the coup attempt, which was "nipped in the bud" by defense forces, announced DRC military spokesperson Sylvain Ekenge.Four attackers were killed, and about 40 others involved in the attack, including several Americans, were arrested, according to the DRC military. The failed coup attempt has been condemned by multiple leaders of African countries and organizations.Kamerhe, 65, was appointed as deputy prime minister and minister of national economy last year.Voting for the speaker of the lower house was originally scheduled for May 18 but was postponed last Friday.In the general elections held in December 2023, President Felix Tshisekedi was re-elected for a second term, as the Sacred Union, a parliamentary coalition composed of Tshisekedi's Union of Democracy and Social Progress party and its allied parties, won the majority of at least 90 percent of seats at the 500-member National Assembly.However, the lower house had remained paralyzed due to the absence of a leadership bureau, which includes posts such as president, first vice-president and second vice-president.In the voting on Wednesday, Kamerhe was the sole candidate for president of the National Assembly.In early April, Tshisekedi named Judith Tuluka Suminwa as the new prime minister. Tuluka was also a target of the failed coup attempt, but the putschists failed to "identify" her residence.Kenya has reiterated that, just like the rest of Africa, the country recognizes Taiwan as an inalienable part of China.In a symposium hosted on Monday in Nairobi and attended by officials, members of parliament and scholars from different backgrounds, speakers condemned any attempts to derail China's complete reunification.Former cabinet secretary for foreign affairs Raphael Tuju said that the Taiwan authorities' pro-independence remarks are nothing but ridiculous and fraudulent.Tuju noted that African countries overwhelmingly supported United Nations Resolution 2758, which undertook to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China. He said this was because China had stood with Africa in its independence and post-independence struggles."There is a potential disruption of world stability. China is a gentle giant that has advanced its development agenda under the banner of peace and should not be provoked to war," he said, adding that ideological differences and business rivalry were among the main factors fueling the foreign forces which agitate for Taiwan's secession.Tuju also stated that the joint communique between China and Kenya, which he oversaw in 2006 as the foreign cabinet secretary that reiterated Kenya's support for the one-China principle, still stands and the Kenyan government maintains there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.Jane Makori, deputy director of Asia and Pacific affairs in Kenya's Foreign Ministry, said the country's position is that Taiwan remains a province of the People's Republic of China. She made a reference to the recent joint statement by both Kenyan and Chinese foreign ministries in January as a demonstration that Kenya recognizes one China.In the statement, Kenya's Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi said that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and the one-China principle is a universally recognized basic norm.Strategic ambiguityPeter Kagwanja, director at the Africa Policy Institute, based in Nairobi, said that the United States' stand in encouraging the so-called Taiwan independence is strategic ambiguity since it recognizes one China following UN Resolution 2758. He added that the National Security Strategy document adopted in October 2022 clearly stated that China must be outcompeted and contained and advocating for Taiwan's independence is part of this strategy.Zhou Pingjian, Chinese ambassador to Kenya, said China appreciates Kenya's principled stance on the one-China principle, which compellingly demonstrates that both nations address each other's major concerns and core interests."Peaceful reunification of China is of benefit not only to the Chinese nation but to all peoples and the international community as a whole. The reunification of China will not harm the legitimate interests of any other country, including any economic interest they have in Taiwan," Zhou said.China-Kenya cooperation has yielded fruitful results over the past decades and Kenya is looking to carry forward bilateral relations as well as supporting the one-China principle for mutual benefit, said a senior Kenyan official.In an interview on Monday in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, Moses Wetang'ula, speaker of the National Assembly of Kenya, said bilateral relations have grown phenomenally since the start of the century, which has boosted growth in Kenya and brought benefits to the people."When you look today, China is a signature to almost every major infrastructure project in Kenya, and the people of Kenya appreciate this," he said. "The relationship between Kenya and China is excellent."Look at the Nairobi-Thika Superhighway, the best highway we have in the country. Look at roads, even in the most unexpected rural areas that are being constructed by Chinese companies, water, dams, last mile connectivity and electricity, construction of institutions and universities," Wetang'ula said."We have a lot going on between Kenya and China. And I would encourage it to continue because it is changing the lives of our people," he said.China and Kenya just celebrated the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations last year. China is Kenya's biggest trade partner while Kenya is China's biggest trade partner in East Africa, where a number of signature infrastructure projects have been completed in recent years with the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.In addition to Kenya, China's "positive footprints", as Wetang'ula said, can be seen everywhere, including Africa, Asia and South America."There's a beacon everywhere that Chinese development can be visible, such as roads, bridges, and so on," he said.Wetang'ula, who was also a former foreign minister of Kenya, said the country firmly supports the one-China principle, and recognizes Taiwan as an inalienable part of China."Taiwan remains an integral part of China, and China is recognized as the only representative of the people of China. Regardless of what those who support Taiwan say, Kenya followed the resolution of the UN with which we voted," he said during the interview on Monday.In October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 2758, which restored all rights to the People's Republic of China, recognizing it as the sole legal representative of China at the UN. The resolution has since been followed by the vast majority of the international community.Recognizing the one-China principle is "an inevitable development that no country will stand in the way," Wetang'ula said, adding that in Africa, developing relations with China has proved to be in the interests of the continent and individual countries as well.Wetang'ula's comment coincided with Lai Ching-te assuming his role as the Taiwan region's new leader. China's State Council Taiwan Affairs Office on Monday said Lai has sent "a dangerous signal" of seeking "Taiwan independence" in a speech upon assuming the role on Monday.Based on the one-China principle, Kenya is looking forward to intensified bilateral cooperation in many areas through various platforms such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, said Wetang'ula.Kenya embraces the Belt and Road Initiative and has been engaging the initiative of its own development plans, so the initiative can best align Kenya's economic development, he said.One major plan for the government of Kenya is to put more focus on the development of its mineral resources, which Wetang'ula said he hoped more Chinese companies could participate in."China will be a critical partner in doing so because we know that when we deal with your country, the red tape and roadblocks to making decisions are far less than some of our partners who put a lot of caveats on many things," he said.Anticipating the new meeting of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation to be held in Beijing in the fall of this year, Wetang'ula said he wishes it would put more focus on boosting international trade for Africa to create more wealth for the continent.wangxiaodong@chinadaily.com.cn  KINSHASA -- An "attempted coup" in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), was suppressed on Sunday by defense and security forces, said Sylvain Ekenge, spokesperson for the Congolese army. "The army reassures that the situation is under control and asks Kinshasa residents to freely go about their business," the spokesperson said in a brief message broadcast on public television, specifying that several perpetrators of the act were arrested.At least three deaths were reported in incursions early Sunday by a group of attackers in neighborhoods where politicians and diplomatic missions reside in Kinshasa, according to local media.According to witnesses, "violent gunshots" were heard around 4:30 am (0330 GMT) on Sunday near the residence of Vital Kamerhe, a federal legislator and a candidate for speaker of the National Assembly, the lower house of the country's bicameral parliament.Three people, including two police officers, were killed in the clashes, local media reported, citing security sources.The attackers also entered the Palais de la Nation, the symbolic headquarters of the DRC presidency in Kinshasa, and said via a livestream on Facebook that they were "fighting for the country."DRC President Felix Tshisekedi works primarily at the Cite de l'Union Africaine (City of the African Union), a government complex in the Ngaliema commune of Kinshasa. The army spokesperson did not provide details on the situation of the president or Kamerhe.Michel Moto Muhima, Kamerhe's spokesperson, said on the social media platform X that Kamerhe and his family were "safe and sound" and that "their security has been reinforced."The attackers, dressed in military uniform and displaying the Zaire flag, claimed in videos circulating on social media that they wanted to "change things in the management of the republic." Zaire, officially the Republic of Zaire, was the name of the DRC from 1971 to 1997 under the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko.In the circulating videos, a man presenting himself as the leader called himself Christian Malanga. He is a former DRC politician who formed the United Congolese Party (UCP) in 2010 and has been pleading for the return of Zaire. In 2017, Malanga created a government in exile in Brussels, Belgium, giving birth to the so-called "New Zaire.""The Congolese and foreigners involved have been put out of action, including their leader. The security forces have the situation under control," said Ekenge without giving further details.Hillary Makokha from Moi University, in Kenya, had never had a chance to practice his public speaking skills until he enrolled in Chinese classes at the university two years ago. The second-year student in information science said he only enrolled for classes at the Confucius Institute out of curiosity but admits he is glad he has acquired extra skills.Makokha was part of 20 final contestants from six colleges in Kenya that participated in the 23rd Chinese Bridge-Chinese Proficiency Competition for College Students, held at the University of Nairobi on Tuesday. Like other contestants, Makokha showed his mastery of Chinese by making a three-minute speech in the language and completing a China national knowledge test. The participants also showcased their talents and understanding of Chinese culture in areas such as folk songs and dances, operas and martial arts.Makokha who received an award for his performance at the competition, said learning Chinese has not only given him a foreign language skill, but also has given him the opportunity to appreciate the rich Chinese culture, as well as satisfying his curiosity for a mysterious yet rapidly developing country.According to Stephen Kiama, the vice-chancellor at the University of Nairobi, this year's competition has grown to include 200 students who participated at the college level before the 20 finalists were selected. He added that the number of colleges taking part in the competition has increased after it opened up to non-Confucius institutes last year.Wang Shangxue, director of the Confucius Institute, University of Nairobi, said the inclusion of non-Confucius institutes in the competition was necessitated by the improvement of Chinese language skills among Kenyan students in recent years and that is why, since last year, the contest has been opened to all colleges, which offer Chinese language courses in Kenya."This shows intensifying Chinese language education in Kenya, and the number of college students studying Chinese has been increasing with an increasing number of schools in Kenya opening Chinese language courses," Wang said."The contest has been an incentive for overseas students to study Chinese, and has played an important role in promoting Chinese language learning in Kenya," she said.Zhang Zhizhong, minister counselor at the Chinese embassy in Kenya, speaking at the opening ceremony of the contests, encouraged the students to take advantage of opportunities presented by learning the Chinese language.Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital in Sudan's city of El Fasher has been forced to close its doors after an airstrike damaged the roof of its intensive care unit, putting the lives of thousands of people who live in and around the city at stake.The pediatric hospital, which is supported by Doctors Without Borders, has been the only working hospital in North Darfur state following the closure of many others in the region due to the escalating violence.Martin Griffiths, the United Nations emergency relief chief, warned that Sudan is at a tipping point, noting that El Fasher is home to about 800,000 people."Countless lives are at stake," he wrote on his X account. "We have told all the parties how they should protect civilians from this carnage. We can now expect them to do what the world and international humanitarian law expect."The airstrike, carried out by the Sudanese Armed Forces on Saturday, landed 50 meters from the hospital and the destruction of the ICU roof claimed lives of a caregiver and two children who were receiving treatment.Some 115 children who had been admitted to the hospital were evacuated to a small health clinic that was revamped and expanded in May and June last year.The hospital called on all warring parties to protect civilians and ensure the protection of health structures, as per international humanitarian law.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, called the airstrike in the vicinity of the pediatric hospital as horrifying."We again urge all parties to protect civilians, health workers and health facilities. We urge immediate, safe and sustained access to humanitarian aid. It's high time for peace," he wrote in his X account.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said humanitarian access into El Fasher has been severely constrained following the disruption of the Kosti supply route since mid-December 2023.Increased costsThe Europe External Programme with Africa, a Belgium-based Centre of Expertise, said damage and looting of pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies have disrupted traditional medicine distribution channels in Sudan, leading to the proliferation of counterfeit and expired medicines, as well as increased costs.According to the UN, at least 27 civilians were killed and about 130 injured following the renewal of conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces in El Fasher.The International Organization for Migration data indicated that about 570,000 people have been displaced in North Darfur state since mid-April 2023 and 6.7 million have been internally displaced, while 1.8 million have fled across the country's border.The hunger levels in the country are alarming, with almost 25 million people across Sudan in need of food aid, while 17.7 million are facing acute food insecurity, figures from the UN indicate.edithmutethya@chinadaily.con.cnA recovery process to restore internet to parts of East Africa following outages caused by a submarine cable cut have commenced. However, the Communication Authority of Kenya said on Monday that the unresolved internet disruptions will persist in the coming days.According to David Mugonyi, the director at the Communication Authority of Kenya, service providers in the country have been directed to take proactive steps to secure alternative routes for their traffic. Internet service providers servicing the East African region say they are working to minimize interruption as they await the full restoration of the cables.Safaricom, a leading internet service provider in East Africa, acknowledged experiencing an outage due to damage to one of the undersea cables that manage internet traffic. In response to this disruption, Safaricom activated various redundancy measures aimed at minimizing service interruptions.In addition, the company informed their customers that while they work towards fully restoring the damaged cable, there may still be periods of reduced internet speeds."We have experienced an outage on one of the undersea cables that deliver internet traffic in and out of the country. We have since activated redundancy measures to minimize service interruption and keep you connected as we await the full restoration of the cable. You may, however, experience reduced internet speeds. We thank you for your patience and understanding," the company said in a statement Released on Monday.Ben Roberts, chief technology innovation officer at Liquid Intelligent Technologies Kenya said that faults have been reported in the Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System and the Seacom cables. He added that three crucial submarine cables in the Red Sea have also suffered cuts and remain unrepaired, leading to the widespread outage."Internet to East Africa is severely impaired. All sub-sea capacities between East Africa and South Africa are down. 3 cable cuts in Red Sea that is Seacom, EIG and AAE1 remain unrepaired" Ben said in a post on social media platform X.According to the latest reports, the cable problems have had a severe impact on internet users in Kenya and Tanzania with social media posts suggesting a near total internet blackout in some areas. Rwanda, Uganda and Madagascar also appear to be affected.This is the second time Africa has experienced a major fibre cut this year. In March, a suspected underwater rock slid off the coast of Cote d'Ivoire resulting in several submarine cables being offline. The cables included Africa Coast to Europe, Submarine Atlantic 3 and the West Africa Submarine Cable. The outage impacted 13 African countries located on the West African seaboard, causing either degraded services or near-total internet outages. NAIROBI -- The death toll from devastating floods and landslides in Kenya, triggered by heavy rains, has risen to 277, according to a government announcement.The update came as schools across the nation cautiously resumed classes for the second term, following a two-week delay due to the adverse weather conditions."Some of the schools that have been adversely affected by the heavy rains and flooding will have their opening delayed as the national and county multi-agency teams ensure that repairs are done to create a safe environment for students to resume learning," said the Ministry of Interior and National Administration in a statement issued in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.Sunny intervals are forecast for most regions of the country over the coming week, interspersed with occasional rainfall and thunderstorms across 37 counties.Flooding is expected in low-lying areas, riparian areas and urban areas while landslides and mudslides may occur in areas with steep slopes, escarpments and ravines, the ministry said.Health concerns are escalating amid the crisis, with 53 cholera cases reported so far.The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the Kenya Red Cross, is trying to control cholera and other waterborne diseases in Tana River and Marsabit Counties.On May 10, the World Health Organization warned of a possible surge in food-borne diseases in Kenya due to the ongoing flood crisis.The WHO advised those affected by floods to ensure food safety through thorough cooking, proper storage and enhanced personal hygiene practices.Riding on the deepening relationship between the two countries, Kenya is calling on Chinese investors to take advantage of the opportunities in its manufacturing sector to contribute to the country's industrialization.Juma Mukhwana, the principal secretary for the State Department of Industry, assured investors of a huge market once they set up factories in Kenya, saying the government has signed several agreements aimed at opening up the market for locally made goods.Mukhwana, who spoke at a China-Kenya economic, trade and investment collaboration roundtable in Nairobi on Friday, said the country had just concluded the Kenya-European Union Economic Partnership Agreement under which Kenyan goods gain duty-free and quota-free access to Europe.Kenya is also working with other major economies such as the United States and with other African countries to facilitate exports to these countries, which will provide opportunities to investors in Kenyan manufacturing, he said.Kenya aims to raise the contribution of manufacturing to GDP from 7.5 percent to 15 percent by 2027 and to 20 percent by 2030, calling for more international investment in manufacturing in Kenya.Kenya also plans to establish industrial parks in all its 47 counties, Mukhwana said. Eighteen industrial parks have been built in 18 counties and another 18 will be built next financial year, with plans to cover all 47 counties within the next three years, he said.There are huge investment opportunities in textiles, leather, avocado, coffee, macadamia nuts, tea, pharmaceuticals and automotive sectors, he said.The government is now looking at increasing cotton production to ensure adequate supply for the textile industry.Mukhwana said the country is also looking for investors who want to invest in large-scale agricultural production, noting that Kenya has huge tracts of fertile land sitting idle."This is the appropriate time to invest in Kenya. As a government, we are ready to hold your hands wherever you want to invest and help you set up a factory to achieve your dreams."China has been the biggest trading partner, and the biggest source of imports and foreign direct investment for Kenya. Bilateral trade was worth $8.5 billion in 2022, 23 percent more than in the previous year, according to official figures.Yuan Lin, of the Department of West Asian and African Affairs in China's Ministry of Commerce, said China has invested in e-commerce, transportation and logistics, green environmental protection and other emerging industries, playing an effective role in fostering the development of related industries in Kenya and other African countries.By the end of last year China's average annual investment flow in Africa was about $3 billion, with more than 3,500 Chinese companies engaging in various types of business activities across the continent, he said.CAPE TOWN -- The death toll in the building collapse in South Africa has risen to 16, with 36 construction workers still trapped under the rubble, authorities said on Sunday.The multi-story building under construction collapsed Monday afternoon in the coastal city of George, located about 400 kilometers east of Cape Town in the Western Cape province. The reasons for the collapse are still under investigation.As rescue and recovery efforts continued into the sixth day at the site, 45 of the 81 individuals present during the incident have been retrieved, said the municipal government of George in its latest update on Sunday morning.According to the update, 16 of the 45 recovered workers have been declared deceased, while 36 are still unaccounted for.This followed the miraculous rescue of Gabriel Guambe, a survivor who was trapped under the rubble for nearly five days, said the George municipality in a statement issued on Saturday evening.The 32-year-old is "recovering well in the hospital, having remarkably sustained only minor injuries," according to the statement."He is doing extremely well, especially considering he went 118 hours without food or water," it said. "He recently had his first meal in the hospital and is in good spirits."In a video shared with the statement by the municipality, Guambe expressed his gratitude to all the rescue personnel for their relentless efforts.Rescue teams onsite were encouraged to continue their dedication and hard work during the challenging task of searching for those still unaccounted for, the George municipality added in the statement.NAIROBI -- The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday warned of a possible surge in food-borne diseases in Kenya due to the ongoing floods crisis."There is a likelihood for increased illnesses associated with contaminated food diseases," WHO-Kenya said in an alert issued in Nairobi, Kenya's capital.More than 260 people have been killed and over 378,000 others displaced by floods in Kenya as heavy rains of 200 mm a day pound different parts of the country, according to Kenyan authorities. The crisis has affected 41 out of the 47 counties, with most of those displaced living in congested camps in schools and churches.WHO issued the alert due to the congestion in camps and the damage the floods have caused to sanitation infrastructure, including in Nairobi.Kenya has already reported a cholera outbreak, with 44 cases recorded in Tana River County in the coastal part of the country, one of the worst affected areas by floods.To avoid contaminated food diseases, WHO-Kenya advised those affected by floods to ensure food safety through thorough cooking, proper storage and enhanced personal hygiene practices.The WHO said it will continue to support the health emergency response and remain vigilant for disease outbreaks that can easily spread if not quickly contained."We must be agile and ready to respond, led by the government and along with the partners, to bring relief to hundreds and thousands of affected people," Abdourahmane Diallo, WHO representative in Kenya, said on Tuesday.At least 14 health facilities have been closed in different parts of Kenya and a major water treatment plant contaminated due to flooding, according to Kenya's Ministry of Health.About a million people have been displaced by floods in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Ethiopia and Tanzania, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said, adding the numbers are on the rise as rains intensify.Kenya's avocado sector is seeking improved cooperation with China in food safety to expand exports to the lucrative market.Kenya is one of the leading avocado producers in Africa, and China is a huge market for Kenyan avocado farmers and exporters.But many have failed to meet the strict food safety standards set by Chinese importers, and this has been a major hurdle for expanding Kenyan avocado exports to China, Muthomi Ernest, CEO of the Avocado Society of Kenya, said at the 4th International Africa Avocado Congress in Kenya's capital Nairobi.The society is seeking partnerships with stakeholders in China to set up better fumigation and cooling centers in Kenya to boost exports, Ernest said.Such cooperation can help Kenya's avocados become more competitive in the Chinese market, he said."I believe we can work together with them in ensuring that our avocado fruits meet their food safety standards and also help in reducing the cost of export to China," he said.The four-day event, which runs through Friday, has attracted more than 100 exhibitors, avocado growers, exporters and stakeholders from Africa, Europe and the Middle East.Erick Nyansimora, commercial and supply chain manager of Keitt Exporters, believes the new plans will be a key remedy in boosting avocado trade between the two countries."As avocado exporters to the Chinese market, we must adhere to Chinese food fumigation processes, which is essential for us. We are more eager to work with China to enhance the quality of food products we export. Hence, this will help open up the markets to our farmers," Nyansimora said.With China's expanding middle class and increasing consumer demand for healthy and exotic foods, the world's second-largest economy offers immense opportunities for Kenyan exporters.Kenya's agricultural state agencies should work with their Chinese counterparts to ensure that the avocados exported to China meet the safety standards, Nyansimora said. And by doing so, Kenyan avocado farmers will make more profits.Jonathon Kipruto, assistant general manager of agricultural company Kakuzi, said despite the European Union being the biggest market for Kenya's avocado exports, China is a huge untapped market.Last year, Kakuzi exported one container of avocados to China. This year, the company is eyeing export of 20 containers, Kipruto said. "We are working with all government agencies to expand our market in China."The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.It was around 11 pm when Josephine Atieno was woken up by screams from neighbors, and she found floodwaters had entered her house, almost submerging it. She was so frightened that she got up quickly, holding her three children, and rushed out of the room to higher ground."The village was full of screams such as 'flood is coming, get up quickly', and 'we are going to die'," she said. She kept running in the dark and when she arrived at a public hall of a nearby primary school — about half a kilometer from her home, which is located on the bank of a river — she found the hall had already been packed with hundreds of people."I felt so scared and cold, I could not sleep at all that night," she said. "I just lay on the ground with wet clothes and spent the night cold and hungry."Almost two weeks have passed since her house was swept away, and like many other people who survived the flooding at the Mathare slum in Kenya's capital Nairobi, Atieno did not know how long she would have to stay in the hall, which had been turned into a temporary shelter."Our houses were swept away by the flood," she said. "We have lost everything."Although the local government provided some help, she said it was not enough. The displaced people have been provided with one free meal comprising rice and beans at noon every day. Besides the lack of food and clean water, she said they are also in dire need of toilet paper, soap, diapers for children and mosquito nets.Mathare slum, where some half a million people live, is one of the worst-affected areas in the recent flooding. More than 235,000 people in Kenya have been displaced and living in various temporary shelters, according to the Kenyan government.The government has declared Friday as a public holiday in honor of the flood victims. Almost 260 people have died, while 75 are still missing.Working togetherKenyan President William Ruto on Wednesday said Friday will mark the start of a major tree-planting program to reduce the impact of climate change, which is believed to have contributed to the floods. He urged Kenyans to work together to plant at least 200 million trees on Friday.Ruto also announced the reopening of all schools in the country on Monday after the meteorological department predicted rains would subside in the coming days.Schools were scheduled to reopen on April 29, but it was postponed by the Ministry of Education due to flooding across the country.The Kenyan government is in cooperation with the World Health Organization and the Kenya Red Cross Society to accommodate flood victims by setting up camps across the nation.Joe Mbalu, deputy secretary-general of Kenya Red Cross Society, said the society has set up some camps in Nairobi, which can be used as shelters for the displaced people. People will be provided with sleeping mats, blankets and other essential items at these camps.Boniface Matindi, head teacher of Mathare North Primary School in the Mathare slum, said the entire school was submerged in late April, damaging most of its 25 classrooms. While the floodwaters have receded, the classrooms are full of broken chairs and desks."Most of the classrooms are not safe and need reconstruction," he said. The toilets are blocked and the thick mud carried by floodwaters needs to be cleared before the school can be reopened, he said.Otiato Opali in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed to this story.wangxiaodong@chinadaily.com.cnDAKAR -- Eleven people were injured, four seriously, after a Boeing 737 passenger plane skidded off the runway during takeoff Thursday morning, Senegal's Blaise Diagne International Airport said in a statement.Air Senegal flight HC301, heading for Bamako, Mali, "went off the runway during its takeoff phase" at around 1:00 am local time, the statement said.It said that among the 78 passengers on board, 11 people were injured, four seriously.An investigation is underway to establish the causes of the accident, the statement said.The airport has since been closed.UNITED NATIONS - While wide-spread flooding challenges East Africa, UN humanitarians have launched an appeal for landlocked Zambia suffering from drought, a UN spokesman said on Wednesday.Stephane Dujarric, chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the appeal of $228 million would assist 4.6 million people between now and December."Zambia is experiencing its driest agricultural season in more than 40 years, resulting in crop losses, increased livestock deaths and worsening poverty," Dujarric said."Nearly half of the 2 million hectares of maize planted in the country have been destroyed by the drought and, according to authorities, cereal production is forecasted to decline by nearly 50 percent this year," he said.The spokesman said the government reported that more than 9 million people -- nearly half the population -- are food insecure and need humanitarian assistance.The spokesman said Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths released $13.5 million from the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) last month to shore up support to address the El Nino-induced drought in southern Africa. Zambia received $5.5 million of the CERF allocation in April and an earlier $2.5 million allocation.He said the government declared a national drought disaster back in February.As for the East Africa drought victims, Dujarric said the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is working with the governments and UN humanitarian partners in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia.The spokesman said that in Burundi, IOM provides emergency shelter, blankets, dignity kits and other items to more than 5,000 people and supports relocating those affected to safer and less flood-prone areas.He said that in Kenya, IOM and partners reported delivering shelter and essential household items to support 39,000 people in the country's most severely flood-impacted parts.He said that IOM targets approximately 240,000 people in neighboring Somalia with shelter materials and other essential items and services.The spokesman said that in Ethiopia, IOM has supported over 70,000 people impacted by floods across the Somali and Oromia regions."The agency says that at this critical moment, the call remains urgent for sustainable efforts to address human mobility spurred by a changing climate," Dujarric said.Torrential rains and flash floods continued to wreak havoc across Kenya, destroying properties, claiming lives and displacing thousands, as the country remained on high alert for Cyclone Hidaya, which was predicted to hit the Kenyan coast.On Saturday evening, the Kenya Meteorological Department said the cyclone had weakened after landfall on Mafia Island in Tanzania but warned other depressions were developing and it's closely monitoring them. "Heavy rainfall offshore along the Kenyan coast is likely from Sunday, propagating inland on Monday to Tuesday," the meteorological department said."Effects offshore include strong winds exceeding 40 knots and waves surpassing 2 meters. Residents, especially in coastal areas and those in marine activities, are advised to take precautions."Authorities said on Sunday that the death toll from weeks of devastating rains and floods had risen to 228 and warned there was no sign of a letup in the crisis.Nearly 205,000 people have been affected across the country and 72 people were reportedly missing as of Friday.Data from the Kenya Red Cross Society indicated more than 8,000 livestock have been lost due to heavy rains and floods, over 14,000 hectares of croplands and 46 roads damaged, more than 600 small businesses, 39 schools and 13 health facilities affected by Wednesday.Philes Matha, a resident of Kithimani village in Kitui County, said though the locality has not been affected by floods, whenever the people see heavy clouds, worry overshadows them as they fear their houses could crumble."My brother-in-law's house fell on Thursday night due to heavy rains and strong winds. Luckily, he was not hurt," she said."We experienced the El Nino phenomenon in 1997 and 1998 but the intensity and destruction was less than the current one."In a village in Machakos County, Daniel Nduti said he woke up to find that his pit latrine had collapsed due to heavy rains.Rescue operationsSearch and rescue operations were continuing in Nakuru, Nairobi, Kirinyaga, Homa Bay, Machakos and Tana River, which are among the worst-affected areas.Across the border, the Tanzania Meteorological Authority declared that Cyclone Hidaya had "completely lost its strength" after making landfall on Saturday.The country's tourism sector has been affected. Several tourists had to be evacuated from Maasai Mara National Reserve after hotels and lodges were flooded.The Kenya National Highways Authority had to block some of the main roads after they were destroyed by floods, hindering transportation and affecting food supply.President William Ruto on Friday directed the Ministry of Education to postpone indefinitely the reopening of schools for the second term because of flooding. Schools were scheduled to reopen on April 29 but this has been delayed until Monday.To fight climate change, Ruto called on Kenyans to intensify their response to an ecosystem restoration plan, which aims to grow 15 billion trees nationwide in the next 10 years.The United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned that continued flooding and water stagnation may trigger waterborne and livestock diseases.Already, 34 cholera cases have been reported in Garsen Sub-County in Tana River County by Thursday, according to the health authorities.Agencies and Xinhua contributed to this story.edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn NAIROBI -- About two million people in Kenya are in need of food assistance, a situation exacerbated by the ongoing heavy rains that have led to the displacement of thousands of people, the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) said on Tuesday.According to the NDMA's March update, the affected individuals are spread across 23 arid and semi-arid counties in the country. "Acute malnutrition has also been noted across the counties with 847,932 children aged six to 59 months and 124,359 pregnant and breastfeeding mothers malnourished acutely and in need of treatment," the NDMA said.The heavy rains in April have further worsened the situation, causing displacement and destruction of roads in arid counties. Kenyan authorities have reported that at least 169 people have died due to flooding, with about 200,000 individuals displaced across the nation.The NDMA has called for the provision of regular food assistance and unconditional cash transfers, particularly targeting vulnerable groups in flood-prone areas.According to the United Nations World Food Program, an estimated 54 million people across Eastern Africa were food-insecure in March, with hotspot countries including Sudan (17.7 million), Ethiopia (15.8 million), and South Sudan (5.7 million).NAKURU, Kenya -- At least 40 people have been confirmed dead, with several others still missing, after a dam burst in a town north of the Kenyan capital Nairobi, following heavy rains across the country, local police said Monday.Naivasha Police Commander Stephen Kirui said that the police recovered 40 bodies from the debris on Monday, with a major search and rescue operation ongoing in the Mai Mahiu area, about 60 kilometers north of Nairobi, after a nearby river overflowed due to flash floods."We have 40 bodies collected so far, and many more are covered by the mud. Many cars are also submerged," Kirui said from the site.The Kenya Red Cross Society, a charity organization, said that the floodwaters originated from a nearby river that burst its banks on Sunday night. "Several people have been taken to a health facility in Mai Mahiu due to flash floods affecting Kamuchiri Village," it added.Local officials said casualties could rise as the search and rescue operation continues, noting that many people remain missing.Kirui said that more than 100 people were rushed to the hospital following the tragedy. Rescue missions were hampered by the challenging terrain where the water raged through.The Kenya National Highways Authority reported that the incident had cut off the major road from Nairobi to Mai Mahiu after heaps of rocks, mud and logs were deposited there.Kenyan authorities issued a warning on Sunday about more deaths and property damage following heavy rains and devastating floods across the nation. According to the police, more than 90 people have lost their lives since March, with concerns that the actual number could be higher as many bodies remain missing.Government Spokesperson Isaac Mwaura said that the heavy downpour has affected all 47 counties, and the floods have displaced 24,196 households, comprising 131,450 people.The meteorological department has forecasted continued rainfall across several parts of the country, with over 40 counties expected to receive heavy rainfall in the coming days.Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua announced that the government has allocated four billion shillings (about $30 million) for an immediate response to the rain's impact.The devastating floods are exacerbating the country's humanitarian crisis, following the El Nino floods in late 2023, which killed at least 178 people, injured 242 and displaced thousands.ABUJA -- At least 19 children have been killed so far by a suspected measles outbreak in Nigeria's northeastern state of Adamawa, local authorities said Saturday.More than 200 children were suspected to have been affected by the measles outbreak in Mubi North local government area, Felix Tangwami, the commissioner for health in Adamawa, told reporters Saturday.Official reports indicated that the 19 fatalities were caused by complications from the measles outbreak, Tangwami said, noting the development led to a quick mobilization of medics and drugs to the affected communities.Children with severe infections would be referred to specialist hospitals, he said, while blaming parents for refusing to immunize their children.Measles is a viral infection common among children under five but easily preventable through vaccines. It spreads through the air by respiratory droplets produced from coughing or sneezing.During the observation of World Malaria Day on Thursday, African health officials hailed the progress made so far in fighting the disease. In a statement released to mark the day, Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa said that the continent has reduced the malaria mortality rate by half in the past two decades.Moeti said that two malaria vaccines approved by WHO last year will be rolled out in 19 countries in the African region this year providing new hope for hundreds of thousands of children at risk of dying from the tropical disease.The latest World Malaria Report by the United Nations released in January indicates that major inroads have been made against the disease in Africa as a result of stepped-up funding and programming. The annual report indicated that between 2000 and 2019, malaria mortality rates among all ages in Africa halved from 28 to 14 per 100,000 population at risk."In 2020, the mortality rate increased to 15 per 100, 000 population at risk partly due to the disruptions in access to malaria prevention and case management caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and then decreased slightly to 14 by 2022. During the period 2000 to 2022, the percentage of total malaria deaths among children under 5 declined from 87 percent in 2000 to 76 percent in 2022," the UN report stated.Despite the achievements made, Moeti said that Africa has reached a crossroads in controlling the disease since 20 of the most affected countries that contribute more than 85 percent of global cases and deaths are in the region. She attributed this to challenges such as extreme weather events, conflict and humanitarian crises, resource constraints, biological threats, and inequities."Infants and young children represent about 80 percent of the mortality, while studies show that children under the age of five from the poorest households in sub-Saharan Africa are five times more likely to be infected with malaria than those from the wealthiest households," Moeti said.She added that the last World Malaria Report demonstrates how malaria disproportionately affects vulnerable populations such as young children, pregnant women, rural communities, and displaced populations.In his message to the global community while marking this year's World Malaria Day, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization called for increased implementation of new and existing interventions to save lives, including WHO's pilot vaccine program in Africa."Everyone has the right to quality, timely, and affordable services to prevent, detect and treat malaria, yet this is not a reality for all. We have the tools to drive down malaria, a package of interventions that includes vector control, preventive medicines, testing, and treatment," Ghebreyesus said.According to WHO, nearly 1.5 million children at high risk of illness and death from malaria in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, have now received their first dose of the first-ever malaria vaccine as part of an ongoing WHO-coordinated pilot program.As part of the countries participating in WHO's pilot of the world's first malaria vaccine, the Kenyan government called on Kenyans to sleep under mosquito nets and advocated for behavior change as a way of safeguarding the gains made in the fight against malaria.While marking World Malaria Day, Mary Muthoni, the principal secretary in the public health ministry said that malaria prevalence in the country decreased from about 11 percent in 2010 to 6 percent in 2020. Kenya had an estimated 5 million malaria cases and more than 12,000 deaths reported in 2022, according to the World Health Organization.The Electoral Commission of South Africa has partnered with social technology giants, including TikTok, Google and Meta, to tackle misinformation and disinformation as the country prepares for next month's general election.Fortune Mgwili-Sibanda, director of public policy and government relations at TikTok Africa, said the move aims to provide facts to South Africans for them to make an informed choice during elections. TikTok is also working with other organizations such as South African Human Rights Commission to tackle fake news.TikTok is disseminating information related to the elections in five local languages, such as the voting date and requirements for eligibility, he said. It is also running education sessions for voters provided by the Electoral Commission.In the latest community guidelines report in December, TikTok said it had removed more than 721,000 videos from South Africa, some containing hate speech and others of criminal nature, he said.Sy Mamabolo, chief electoral officer of the Electoral Commission of South Africa, said they welcome the support offered by technology companies.He emphasized the important role of collaboration in minimizing misinformation and disinformation, ultimately safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process."Our expectations are that in these instances, disinformation and misinformation will be removed or at least members of the public be warned that there is a problem with a particular video," he said.On the consequences of politicians spreading misinformation, he highlighted the potential for disqualification through the Electoral Court. Such actions could lead to fines of about $10,500 or even deregistration.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.ABUJA -- At least 119 inmates escaped Wednesday night from a custodial center damaged by heavy rains in central Nigeria, an official said Thursday.Ten of the escaped inmates from the Suleja Custodial Center, in the north-central state of Niger, were recaptured and taken back into custody, Samson Duza, a Nigerian Correctional Service spokesman in the central region, said in a statement.Nigeria has witnessed a series of jailbreaks in recent years, prompting the government to launch an audit of prison facilities in the country to fix their vulnerabilities.DODOMA -- Flash floods caused by ongoing torrential rains have left 155 dead and 236 others injured in Tanzania, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa told parliament on Thursday.Flash floods have been reported in 14 out of the 26 regions in mainland Tanzania, affecting 200,000 people and damaging 10,000 houses, Majaliwa told the House in the capital, Dodoma.School infrastructure, farm crops, roads, bridges, health facilities, and livestock were impacted by the floods, he said.The government has taken steps aimed at preventing further catastrophic situations, like ordering the closure of schools in areas severely affected by the floods, Majaliwa said.The Tanzania National Roads Agency, the Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency, and the Tanzania Railways Corporation have been ordered to undertake an urgent assessment of damaged roads and railways for immediate renovation, he said.The heavy rains, influenced by El-Nino conditions, are expected to last through May, according to the Tanzania Meteorological Authority.The Food and Agriculture Organization has warned that Southern African countries will experience maize shortages due to the recent El Nino-linked drought that has decimated harvest prospects.The predicted production shortfall is expected to intensify households' food insecurity, increase domestic prices and spur a surge in import needs across the sub-region, as the new assessment from FAO's Global Information and Early Warning System indicated.Acute food insecurity in southern Africa, estimated at 16 million people in the first three months of 2024, could deteriorate in late 2024, the UN agency warned.Additionally, food prices, which are already increasing at an annual rate of more than 10 percent, could rise further.According to the current projections, South Africa and Zambia which are typically maize exporters, will not be able to cover the supply shortfall. Over the years, white maize supplies from the two countries have been more than sufficient to meet the import demand of the neighboring countries.Unfortunately, due to the current situation, Zambia has already started importing maize to meet the shortfall. The governments of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe, on the other hand have, declared drought emergencies.White maize accounts for almost 20 percent of calories consumed in Southern Africa.Zimbabwe is expected to experience a significant increase in maize imports because it's likely to have a precipitous drop in production. Imports are also forecast to rise markedly in Malawi and Mozambique.Jonathan Pound, an economist at FAO's Global Information and Early Warning System, said the combination of reduced harvests and rising food prices is particularly harmful to agricultural households and the restoration of production. This is because farm incomes are set to be squeezed while more resources will be needed to purchase food.FAO warned that low cereal outturns in South Africa and Zambia could also affect the sub-regional availability of maize seeds for the subsequent agricultural cropping season, starting in September.The last time a cereal shortage was experienced in the region was in 2016/2017, following the El Niño-affected harvest. During that period, nearly 650,000 metric tons of white maize were sourced from Mexico and the United States.When Ngaruiya Njonge wanted to start learning kung fu 10 years ago, he had no one to teach him and nowhere to go and learn the art since his hometown of Kiambu in central Kenya had no such facility. Determined to learn the skill, he turned to video streaming service YouTube for lessons and since then, he has never looked back.Born in the remote village of Kangoya in Kenya's Kiambu County, Njonge's interest in kung fu was roused after a teacher in a nearby primary school, who was trained in China, introduced martial arts to the villagers. However, once the teacher left the village, Njonge had nowhere to turn to and this is where YouTube tutorials came in handy."I used to work as a truck driver with a transport company but after training for five years, I quit the job and decided to fully concentrate on kung fu. In those days, I was aspiring to be a trainer but I could not get students so my two daughters who were 6 and 4 years old at the time became my first students," Njonge said.In order to advance his dream of becoming a coach, he approached his local county government with a proposal to start training local youths. Njonge was concerned that his county was known for heavy drinking among the youth and sought to work with the county government by using kung fu to curb the vice.As luck would have it, the county government allocated him the local community hall for training, thus marking the beginning of his journey as a career coach. He started by training children and jobless youths at the community hall on Saturdays and Sundays. From having fewer than 10 trainees at the time he started, Njonge has seen the sport grow and he now trains at least 60 children and dozens of youths for free during the weekends."I started with a handful of students but over the years, the numbers have grown. Once I became a registered coach, the Ministry of Education wrote me a letter which I could use to approach schools and request to train their students in kung fu," said Njonge, who is now the president of Kenya's Kung Fu Wushu Federation.So far, he has established kung fu clubs in 24 public primary schools in Kiambu County, where he trains about 4,000 pupils for free. Despite the lack of monetary support from the government, he said that he also trains students in private schools where he makes part of his earnings. As president of the Kenya Kung Fu Wushu Federation, Njonge has so far established eight branches across the country.In 2019, he walked to the Chinese embassy in Nairobi and introduced himself as a registered kung fu coach. Having reviewed plans by the federation to expand the sport in Kenya, the embassy agreed to become a partner in setting up a tournament for junior championships and the federation held the third edition of the tournament on Sunday.This year, the competition had 70 participants from different schools across the country. The best 10 performers were awarded medals and certificates and will represent Kenya in an international tournament to be held in Rwanda in June.Sheila Wanjiku, a judge at the tournament said that she is not only impressed by the growing numbers of kung fu performers but also the improving quality of the practice.ADDIS ABABA -- At least 16 Ethiopian migrants, including children and women, drowned and 28 others were missing after a boat capsized off the coast of Djibouti, the Ethiopian Embassy in Djibouti said Tuesday.In a press statement, the embassy said that the Ethiopian migrants lost their lives on Monday night when a boat carrying 77 of them capsized off the coast of Djibouti. The incident occurred while the migrants were being transported by human smugglers from war-torn Yemen to Djibouti.The embassy said that the 16 Ethiopian migrants who died in the incident include children and women. It also noted that 33 migrants who were aboard the capsized boat have been rescued, but 28 migrants remain missing. The rescue efforts are underway.Expressing its condolences for the victims, the embassy also warned of the serious risks associated with illegal migration across the Red Sea.The International Organization for Migration has frequently expressed concern about the dire conditions faced by migrants stranded in war-torn Yemen, leaving them with no choice but to rely on smugglers to return home. It has called on all governments and concerned actors along the route to join hands and support its efforts to allow migrants to return home safely.The latest boat accident is one of many similar deadly calamities that have occurred in Djibouti's Red Sea coast area. Earlier this month, the Ethiopian embassy said that at least 38 Ethiopian migrants had died off the coast of Djibouti.Data from the embassy show that more than 200,000 Ethiopian migrants make risky land and sea journeys from the coast of Djibouti and the Gulf of Aden each year to reach destinations in the Middle East. It said that at least 189 Ethiopian nationals had died off the coast of Djibouti in the past five years.In most of these incidents, desperate East African migrants attempted to cross the dangerous route, hoping to reach the Middle East via war-torn Yemen, with the main destination being Yemen's northern neighbor, Saudi Arabia.ADDIS ABABA -- At least 16 migrants have died and 28 others are missing after a boat capsized off the coast of Djibouti, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said Tuesday."Tragedy as boat capsizes off Djibouti coast with 77 migrants on board including children. At least 28 missing, 16 dead," the IOM said on X, formerly Twitter.

Government and humanitarian partners have started providing food and health services, which remain inadequate due to limited resources.On April 13 and 14, armed clashes occurred in Alamata town in northern Ethiopia. An undetermined number of casualties were reported, while many civilians reportedly fled towards neighboring Kobo and Sekota, said UNOCHA in a previous report.Ongoing heavy rains and flooding have caused havoc across Kenya, Tanzania and Somalia, claiming lives and displacing thousands of people.According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, at least 32 people have died in Kenya due to the floods, 15 people injured and two missing as of April 18.The UN agency said more than 100,000 people have been affected, including over 40,000 people displaced in 21 out of 47 counties in the country.Additionally, over 960 livestock have been killed and more than 9,600 hectares of croplands destroyed by floods and heavy rainfall.On Sunday, residents of Syokimau in Machakos County had to stay indoors as their residences were flooded due to the ongoing heavy rains.Last week, Kithure Kindiki, the cabinet secretary for internal security and national administration said the flood may cause over spilling of dams, and warned that further heavy rains could cause Tana River to burst its banks downstream leading to significant flooding in Garisa, the Tana Delta and Lamu counties.He also warned of likely flooding in western Kenya, especially communities along lakes and rivers. This is in addition to low-lying areas in Narok, Kajiado and Mombasa as well as hilly areas traditionally prone to mudslides.Kindiki said the government has taken proactive measures to ensure public security and safety and is prepared to mitigate any adverse effects of flooding in the country.In Tanzania, floods have claimed more than 50 lives, displacing almost 2,000 people and affecting more than 100,000 people, according to the European Commission's Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations. The most affected areas are the Coast and Morogoro regions.In a press conference on Saturday, Mobhare Matinyi, the government's spokesperson said around 40,000 hectares of land under crops in Morogoro district have been affected by the heavy rains and flooding.He noted that the situation has improved following reduced rains.In Somalia, April to June rains have started but no significant flash or riverine flooding have been reported, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. However, heavy rains have been reported in Hirshabelle State, South West State and in Banadir regions.Moderate to heavy rains are also projected to continue over several areas in Hirshabelle and South West states, with chances of very heavy rains over some areas in Bay, Sool and Sanaag regions.The UN agency warned that up to 770,000 people could be affected by the heavy rains in 22 hotspot districts across the country, including in 15 cholera hotspot districts.On Sunday, the IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre warned that extremely heavy rainfall, reaching top 1 percent on record are expected over isolated areas in central parts of Ethiopia and central to northern Kenya.Additionally, very heavy rainfall, reaching the top 5 percent on record, is expected in most parts of southern and eastern Ethiopia into north-eastern Somalia, northern and western Kenya, and cross border regions of Rwanda-Burundi-Tanzania.Heavy rainfall, reaching the top 10 percent on record, is also expected over northern and western Uganda, central to southern Somalia and eastern Tanzania, the centre said.South Africa will soon start implementing lie detector tests in addition to other technologies to tackle poaching, said an official from one of the largest game reserves in Africa.A lie detector, or polygraph, is a junk science device or procedure that measures and records several physiological indicators such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration and skin conductivity while a person answers a series of questions."Polygraph will be used in the next few weeks, everything is in place. Initially there was resistance to it, but it has been explained and everybody has accepted it. This is our latest move to fight poaching by ensuring that we have honest and professional rangers," said Don English, a regional ranger at Kruger National Park.Despite adopting a number of measures, such as installing cameras, radar systems and using detecting dogs fitted with global positioning system devices, to prevent poaching in national parks in South Africa in recent years, poaching of wild animals is still not effectively checked in the country.Last year a total of 499 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa, an increase of 51 compared with the previous year.In addition to poachers, some national park rangers are also suspected of being involved in poaching. In a recent case at a section of Kruger National Park, 16 out of the 18 rangers were arrested for working with poachers including a section ranger. The rangers supplied tactical information to the poachers and were arrested after money was deposited in the accounts of various relatives.Kruger National Park stretches between Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces and is near the borders of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, covering almost 20,000 square kilometers.To prevent poaching, South Africa has been using various means including the use of cameras to record the number plates of cars entering and leaving the park.Main targetsRecently the South African National Parks installed cameras in areas with high concentrations of rhinos which are the main targets of poaching.English said: "We have developed radar systems that can pick up anything. It can differentiate humans and different species of animals and these (radars) are strategically placed. We have a magnetic cable system which picks up any movement or objects. We have high-tech camera systems."The South African National Parks also use ballistic tests when they find poachers in possession of rifles. This helps them to link the poachers with animals which could have been killed in the park. English pointed out that some poachers were arrested in possession of rhino horns and rifles and DNA tests linked them to the crime where the rhino had been killed.The South African National Parks also use dogs which track poachers with global positioning systems strapped on their necks and helicopters that can operate at night.Rhinos are the most targeted animals because their horns are sold at higher prices in various parts of the world including Southeast Asia where they are used for jewelry and as an aphrodisiac. South Africa is home to the world's largest number of rhinos. In addition, some other wildlife such as impalas, kudus and birds like vultures have been killed for meat or medical purposes.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.NAIROBI -- Kenyan President William Ruto confirmed that military chief Francis Ogolla was among 10 senior commanders killed in a helicopter crash in the northwestern part of the country on Thursday.Ruto said Ogolla, chief of the Kenya Defense Forces (KDF), was aboard the KDF Huey helicopter with 11 other military personnel. The helicopter took off from a local primary school in Elgeyo Marakwet County when it went down and burst into flames at about 2:20 p.m. local time (1120 GMT).Ruto, speaking at a televised news conference in the national capital of Nairobi, said that 10 military officers, including Ogolla, died in the crash, while two others survived and are now hospitalized. "This is a moment of great sadness," he added.The president said that Ogolla left Nairobi in the morning to visit troops deployed in the troubled region to fight bandits and inspect ongoing school renovation work.The Kenya Air Force has formed and dispatched an aviation investigation team to determine the cause of the crash, Ruto said.He also announced that the nation will observe a three-day period of mourning beginning Friday to honor the life and distinguished military career of the fallen general, who lost his life not only while in office but also while on active military duty.Witnesses said that the KDF helicopter crashed two kilometers away and burst into flames moments after taking off from an area along the troubled Elgeyo Marakwet-West Pokot border. "We saw the chopper come down, and when we rushed to the scene, we found the chopper in flames," said Evans Kipkosgei, a resident, adding that the site was immediately cordoned off by KDF officers stationed in the Kerio Valley.Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan sent a condolence message to Ruto following Ogolla's death. "I am sending my condolences to the Kenyan commander-in-chief of the armed forces, President William Ruto, all Kenyans, and the families, relatives, and friends of all who have lost their lives in the accident," she said on her X platform, formerly Twitter.A China-Kenya joint agricultural lab in Kenya has bred more than two dozens of superior crop varieties over the past five years, effectively improving food security for farmers across the country.Established in 2019, the Kenya-China Joint Laboratory for Crop Molecular Biology at Egerton University in Nakuru County has developed 25 crop varieties through molecular breeding, of which 18 have been commercialized. The crops are suitable in different ecological conditions, disease resistant and high yielding compared with traditional ones.Once the seeds are developed, they are taken to the Agro-Science Park at the university, where seed bulking and commercialization take place.Among the improved seeds are five bean varieties, three of which have been released in the market and have attracted much attention from farmers because of their advantages.The most popular one is the Chelalang beans that were released in the market in 2016. In the Kalenjin community, the name loosely translates to mean a warm, beautiful girl who can fetch the highest bride price.Paul Kimurto, director of Agro-Science Park, said Chelalang can yield up to 25 bags, or 2,250 kilograms, per hectare."It's a very adaptive variety. If you grow when there is enough rain, it prolongs the growth and puts in more yield. When the rainfall is short, it quickly accelerates, so it has early maturity characteristic. Hence, farmers don't lose yields," he said.Anna Wanjiku, a farmer from Matangi Tisa village in Nakuru, was amazed by a bean variety last year. As the August rains arrived, she sowed Chelalang and Tatton beans, another variety under the bulking process and nearing commercialization.The rain vanished for a month after the crops germinated, then returned. While Wanjiku's other beans succumbed to the drought, the Chelalang and Tatton beans persevered.Wanjiku reaped a remarkable harvest. From 20 kg of Tatton beans, she collected a bountiful 120 kg. Her investment in 5 kg of Chelalang beans yielded 40 kg."In the upcoming rainy season, I will plant each of the variety in a 0.8-hectare land. I'm looking forward to a bumper harvest and consequently, increased income," she said.Hillary Chelal, a research assistant at Egerton University, highlighted the characteristics of Tatton beans, including their superior yield, prolific pods, self-stripping leaves for effortless harvest, adaptability to diverse altitudes and preference by canneries.In partnership with agricultural development nonprofit Kilimo Trust, Chelal said they are also promoting water-efficient upland rice and five such varieties have been tested.Kenya imports about 80 percent of rice, but Chelal said the country has the potential to produce enough rice for its population.Rising productionJoseph Orende, program assistant officer at Kilimo Trust, said that through partnering with Egerton University and training farmers on sustainable rice production techniques, they have increased production from 2 metric tons to 3.5 tons per hectare within two years.With proper management, the rice varieties have the potential to produce 7 to 11 tons per hectare, he said."Looking at what we have been able to achieve in the two years, if it is sustained, this collaboration can be able to achieve food security initiative in Africa if replicated to many areas and several food chains," he said.Liu Gaoqiong, a horticulture professor at Egerton University, said the collaboration between China and Kenya through the lab aims to improve food security in Africa, with its rapidly expanding population and unpredictable weather patterns."We are trying to develop different varieties with good yields, good quality and climate-smart. We also plan to bring more agricultural equipment from China to Kenya," he said.Kimurto said the laboratory is mitigating climate change through the development of resistant crop varieties that are able to grow in areas with low rainfall."We have developed four varieties of finger millet that are early maturing (and) resistant to low soil fertility and diseases. We have also developed sorghum varieties that are good for breweries," he said.Plans are underway to establish the Egerton Agro-Industrial Park with the help of the Nakuru government to accelerate commercialization of improved crop varieties, he said.China and Egypt are now at the peak of their bilateral relationship after a golden decade of leapfrogging development, and more progress is expected to be made as they continue to deepen cooperation, China's Ambassador to Egypt Liao Liqiang says.The two countries have consolidated their political mutual trust, achieved fruitful results in practical cooperation and jointly safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries over the past 10 years, Liao said in an interview with China Daily."The development of bilateral relations has entered the fast lane and is now at its best," he said, highlighting the fruitful Belt and Road cooperation between the two countries.Egypt was among the first countries to respond to the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China in 2013. In 2016, a memorandum of understanding was signed to boost bilateral cooperation under the initiative.The two countries have joined hands in building Egypt's first electrified light rail transit system, establishing Africa's largest vaccine storage center in the country and constructing a huge cement plant that boasts six production lines, among others.In addition, the China-Egypt TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone, a demonstration project set up in 2008 that aligns the BRI with the development of the Suez Canal Corridor Project, has attracted 145 companies with an investment of more than $2 billion."China and Egypt, both of which are representatives of major developing countries and emerging economies, have provided strategic stability to a changing and turbulent world through their cooperation," Liao said.Egypt was the first African country and the first Arab state that established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.Development vision"For China and African countries, walking side by side on their respective paths toward modernization will create a favorable environment for realizing our development visions," he said.He said he believes a new chapter for a China-Africa community with a shared future will be created this fall during the meeting of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in China.Liao, who is also China's representative to the League of Arab States, said more than 200 large-scale projects have been carried out by China and Arab countries under the framework of Belt and Road cooperation, with the results benefiting nearly 2 billion people on both sides.The Arab League was the first regional organization to sign a cooperation agreement with China on BRI, and China has signed bilateral cooperation documents on the initiative with all 22 Arab countries."China and Arab countries enjoy broad prospects in terms of pushing forward all-around cooperation and working together to realize their respective national rejuvenation," Liao said.On Jan 1, five countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates, joined BRICS, marking a historic expansion of the bloc's membership."In a broader sense, BRICS expansion reflects the collective rise of the Global South and a world evolving faster toward multipolarity," Liao said."At a time when the world pattern is undergoing profound changes and human society is facing multiple challenges, it is of great significance for China and Arab countries to strengthen cooperation," he said.Organizations from across the globe have called for urgent actions to address the ongoing war in Sudan that has created the world's worst displacement crisis and a looming famine over the past year.The Food and Agriculture Organization or FAO, said food production in the country has been severely affected by the conflict, pushing millions of people into hunger.The UN agency called for urgent and at-scale agricultural support ahead of the planting season which starts in June.FAO said the 2023 production of sorghum, millet and wheat which was harvested last month was approximately 4.1 million tonnes, a 46 percent decrease from the output obtained in the previous year and about 40 percent below the average of the previous five years."This is a very practical manifestation of the impact of clashes, conflict and violence on food production. We clearly have a context that requires urgent and appropriate support," Rein Paulsen, director of the FAO Office of Emergencies and Resilience said.In 2023, most inputs, including fertilizers and herbicides, and agricultural machinery were scarce and extremely expensive. In addition, they were often not available promptly, thus delaying planting and other agricultural operations, FAO said.The war that broke out on April 15, 2023, between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces in the capital Khartoum, has killed more than 15,000, displaced eight million people and left five million on the brink of famine, according to the USAID, a Washington headquartered international development agency.The agency said 25 million people – more than half the population – are in need of humanitarian assistance.The United Nations Children's Fund said hunger is reaching catastrophic levels in Sudan, with 17.7 million people - approximately over a third of the population – being acutely food insecure, including about 4.9 million who are experiencing emergency levels of food insecurity.The UN agency warned that nearly four million children are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition this year, including 730,000 who are expected to suffer from severe wasting – the deadliest form.Almost half of the children suffering from severe acute malnutrition are in areas that are hard to access due to the ongoing fighting, UNICEF said.Despite the alarming risk of further violations and abuses against civilians amid a still worsening humanitarian crisis across the country, humanitarian organizations are concerned over the underfunding of the 2024 humanitarian appeal.On Monday, France, Germany and the European Union organized an international humanitarian conference for Sudan and neighboring countries in Paris, where countries pledged a total of $2 billion. The conference brought together ministers and representatives of 58 states.In reaction to the conference, Fati N'Zi Hassane, the Africa director of Oxfam, a British-founded confederation of 21 independent non-governmental organizations focusing on the alleviation of global poverty, said the conference largely failed to meet the enormous needs.She said the pledged amount was less than half of the $4.1 billion needed to urgently help over 14.7 million people in Sudan and millions more suffering in Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopia, and South Sudan."It is not too late to act. Donors and the international community must show clear, swift, coordinated action to save lives now. Warring parties must also ensure an immediate cessation of hostilities," Hassane said.Hassane said the 2024 Sudan humanitarian need and response plan requires $2.7 billion, but so far, the appeal is 3.1 percent funded.One year of conflict in Sudan is taking a devastating human toll, said international humanitarian organizations, as they call for stepped-up efforts to help the country.The number of Sudanese forced to flee has now surpassed 8.5 million, with 1.8 million of them having crossed borders, according to data released by the United Nations Refugee Agency, or UNHCR, on Tuesday.The agency said the country and its neighbors are experiencing one of the largest and most challenging humanitarian and displacement crises in the world.Acute shortages of essential resources such as food, water and fuel, along with a seriously degraded healthcare system, are just some of the terrible consequences of the conflict, the International Committee of the Red Cross said."We have mobilized 4,000 volunteers from across the country to provide first aid and help evacuate the wounded. Our staff and volunteers distribute food and essential items, provide psychological support, and search for the missing," Aida Al-Sayed Abdullah, secretary-general of the Sudanese Red Crescent Society, said."We urge the international community to increase their support to help us meet the urgent needs of the communities trapped in the conflict. We cannot let Sudan become another forgotten crisis."Despite the magnitude of the crisis, funding remains critically low, the UNHCR said. Only 7 percent of the requirements outlined in the 2024 Regional Refugee Response Plan for Sudan led by UNHCR have been fulfilled.On April 15, 2023, conflict erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces in the capital Khartoum, which subsequently spread to other regions.BEIJING - At the invitation of Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Central African Republic Sylvie Baipo-Temon will pay an official visit to China from April 14 to 16, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning announced on Friday.TRIPOLI  -- Clashes broke out on Thursday between rival armed groups in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, as witnesses reported heavy gunfire in different parts of the city and military mobilization on the streets.Heavy gunfire has caused panic among the people, witnesses said.The Emergency Department under the Ministry of Health has advised residents to stay away from the conflict areas and remain at home for their safety.Rwanda's President Paul Kagame has said he is concerned over the failure of the United States to characterize his country's 1994 massacre as a genocide against the country's minority Tutsi people.While speaking during a televised news conference in the capital Kigali on Monday, Kagame said the issue was part of the discussions during his talks with former US president Bill Clinton, who led a delegation to a ceremony on Sunday to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the genocide."Rwandans will never understand why any country would remain intentionally vague about who was targeted in the genocide. I do not understand that. Such ambiguity is, in fact, a form of denial, which is a crime in and of itself, and Rwanda will always challenge it," Kagame said.Kagame's comments came after Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, released a statement on Sunday commemorating the massacre but failed to specify that the genocide targeted the Tutsis."We mourn the many thousands of Tutsis, Hutus, Twas and others whose lives were lost during 100 days of unspeakable violence," Blinken said in his message posted on social media platform X.Kagame asserted that the US, together with any other government, had the right to blame Rwanda on any other day but not the commemoration day.Kagame said he believed he had reached an understanding with US authorities around 2014 for them to avoid any criticism on the genocide anniversary."There are 365 days in a year. Give us that day, April 7, and then you can have the rest 364 days to blame us every day for everything you do not like about us," Kagame said.Rwanda began observing a week of national mourning and commemoration on Sunday to mark the 30th anniversary of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi, during which more than 1 million people were killed, according to the Rwandan government.This year's commemoration will run under the theme Remember-Unite-Renew and also focuses on Rwanda's transformational journey over the past 30 years.The genocide was ignited when a plane carrying then-president Juvenal Habyarimana of the Hutu ethnicity, was shot down over Kigali in April 1994. The Tutsi people were blamed for downing the plane and killing the president, and became targets in massacres led by Hutu extremists.Xinhua contributed to this story. JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma won his appeal at the country's Electoral Court Tuesday, meaning that he will be allowed to contest the upcoming elections as a candidate of the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) Party."The application for leave to appeal is granted. The appeal succeeds," the Electoral Court's ruling said.Zuma's appeal at the court came as the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), the country's election management body, decided in late March to uphold an objection against his candidacy in the elections.The IEC's objection is hereby dismissed, according to the court's ruling.Zuma, who was sentenced to 15 months in prison for contempt of court in 2021, was nominated as a candidate for the elections by the newly-formed MK Party.South Africa will hold the national and local government elections on May 29.HARARE -- Zimbabwe's gold-backed currency started trading on Monday following the announcement of the new currency by the central bank last Friday.The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) announced that effective from April 8, the trading currency is the Zimbabwe Gold, or ZiG."All share prices will now be denominated in ZiG, therefore the opening prices for the trading session effective April 8 will reflect the ZiG currency," said ZSE CEO Justin Bgoni in a statement.Zimswitch, a national payment platform, also announced on Monday that ZiG had gone live.The introduction of the new currency by the central bank comes in response to the rapid depreciation of the old Zimbabwe dollar.According to Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor John Mushayavanhu, the new structured currency will be backed by a basket of foreign exchange reserves and precious metals, mainly gold, being held by the central bank.Mushayavanhu said the central bank was starting with total reserves of 285 million US dollars to back up the new currency.Zimbabwe adopted a multi-currency regime in 2009 to stabilize the economy following years of hyperinflation. The government in 2019 outlawed the multiple currency regime and re-introduced the Zimbabwe dollar as the sole legal tender.In 2020, the government reintroduced the multi-currency regime. Since then, the use of the US dollar has grown in the economy, with the national statistics agency ZIMSTATS saying that over 85 percent of international transactions are in the US dollar.BUGESERA/KIGALI, Rwanda — Anastasie Nyirabashyitsi and Jeanette Mukabyagaju think of each other as dear friends.The women's friendship was cemented one day in 2007 when Mukabyagaju left her child in Nyirabashyitsi's care.This expression of trust stunned Nyirabashyitsi because Mukabyagaju, a Tutsi survivor who lost most of her family in the Rwandan genocide in 1994, was leaving a child in the hands of a Hutu woman for the first time since they had known each other."If she can ask me to keep her child, it's because she trusts me," Nyirabashyitsi said, describing her feelings at the time. "A woman, when it comes to her children, when someone trusts you with (her) children, it's because she really does."They were both witnesses to terrible crimes 30 years ago. The killing rampage, which lasted 100 days before the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebel militia took the capital Kigali in July 1994, claimed the lives of about 800,000 people, largely Tutsis but also moderate Hutus.In keeping with tradition, April 7, the day Hutu militias unleashed the carnage in 1994, began with President Paul Kagame placing wreathes on mass graves and lighting a remembrance flame at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, where more than 250,000 victims are believed to be buried.At a solemn ceremony, Kagame addressed an audience that included several African leaders and former United States president Bill Clinton, who had called the genocide the biggest failure of his administration.The United Nations and the African Union also held remembrance ceremonies. The AU said this year signifies "a significant moment to honor the deceased, stand in solidarity with survivors and join together to prevent such atrocities from occurring ever again".Sunday's events also marked the start of a week of national mourning.In the government-approved reconciliation village where Nyirabashyitsi and Mukabyagaju have lived for 19 years, they have reached peaceful coexistence from opposite experiences.As for Mukabyagaju, she was a 16-year-old temporarily staying in the southern province of Muhanga while her parents lived in Kigali. When she could not shelter at the nearest parish she hid in a latrine for two months, without anything to eat and drinking from trenches until she was rescued."I hated Hutu so much to the point that I could not agree to meet them," she said, adding that it took a long time "to be able to even think that I can interact with a Hutu".The women are neighbors in a community of genocide perpetrators and survivors 40 kilometers outside Kigali. At least 382 people live in Mbyo Reconciliation Village, which some Rwandans cite as an example of how people can peacefully coexist 30 years after the genocide.More than half the residents of this reconciliation village are women, and their projects, including a basket-weaving cooperative and a money saving program, have united so many of them that it can seem offensive to ask who is Hutu and who is Tutsi.An official with Prison Fellowship Rwanda, a civic group in Kigali that is in charge of the village, said the women foster a climate of tolerance because of the hands-on activities in which they engage regularly."There's a model ... which we call practical reconciliation," said Christian Bizimana, a program coordinator with Prison Fellowship Rwanda. "Whenever they are weaving baskets they can engage more, talk more, go into the details. We believe that by doing that... forgiveness is deepened, unity is deepened."In Rwanda, with a population of 14 million, women leaders have long been seen as a pillar of reconciliation, and Rwandans can now "see the benefits" of empowering women to fight the ideology behind genocide, said Yolande Mukagasana, a prominent writer and genocide survivor.Rwandan authorities have heavily promoted national unity among the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi and Twa, with a government ministry dedicated to reconciliation efforts.Rwandan ID cards no longer identify a person by ethnicity.

She allegedly solicited an amount of approximately 4.5 million rand (about $240,000), of which 2.1 million rand was received in cash."According to the statement, the court granted her 50,000 rand bail, and her bail conditions are that she should surrender her passport to the investigating officer and she should have no direct or indirect contact with the state witnesses.In court, Presiding Magistrate Anna Oosthuizen said she was satisfied that Mapisa-Mqakula is not a flight risk and will co-operate with the police.The NPA statement added that the case against the former speaker is postponed to June 4 for the arrest of the second suspect accused in the matter.Mapisa-Nqakula, a 67-year-old veteran of the governing African National Congress, was South Africa's defense minister from 2012 to 2021.In her resignation statement on Wednesday, Mapisa-Nqakula said that her decision to resign was "in no way an indication or admission of guilt regarding the allegations" being leveled against her."I maintain my innocence and I am determined to restore my good reputation," she added.CAPE TOWN -- South African National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula resigned Wednesday amid investigations into corruption allegations against her."Today, the 3rd of April, I have submitted to the Acting Speaker of the National Assembly, Hon. Lechesa Tsenoli, my letter of resignation as both the Speaker of National Assembly and a Member of Parliament of the Republic of South Africa," Mapisa-Nqakula said in a statement. "The resignation is effective immediately.""I have made this conscious decision in order to dedicate my time and focus to deal with the recently announced investigation against me by our country's law enforcement agencies," she said.Mapisa-Nqakula, a 67-year-old veteran of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, has been facing corruption allegations that she solicited a cash bribe of about 2.3 million rands (about 120,000 U.S. dollars) from a former military contractor while she was defense minister between 2016 and 2019.The speaker took "special leave" from her parliamentary position on March 21 after an early morning raid by a special investigations unit on her Johannesburg home.Last week, she launched an urgent court bid to block her possible arrest, but a judge at the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria dismissed her application Tuesday.Citing court papers, local media reported Tuesday that Mapisa-Nqakula may face 12 corruption charges for allegedly soliciting bribes amounting to a total of 4.5 million rands during her tenure as the defense minister.In her late Wednesday statement, Mapisa-Nqakula stressed that her resignation was "in no way an indication or admission of guilt regarding the allegations" being leveled against her."I believe that, at the right time, I will have the opportunity to thoroughly address these allegations as and when they have been formally brought against me in the appropriate forums, at which time I will clear my good name," she said. "I maintain my innocence and am determined to restore my good reputation.""Given the public trust entrusted in me as the Speaker of our National Assembly and the need for me to protect the image of our organization, the African National Congress, I have an obligation ... to step down from my office," she added.Mapisa-Nqakula also noted that she had informed the ANC leadership of her decision and she remains a "dedicated member" of the party.In a statement issued later Wednesday, the ANC confirmed that it had officially received Mapisa-Nqakula's resignation letter."In her resignation, Comrade Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula highlighted her intention to protect the reputation of our organization, the African National Congress, after dedicating more than 30 years of service," said the statement. "We value her commitment to maintaining the image of our organization, as it reflects our principles of organizational renewal that promote proactive responsibility-taking among members, rather than waiting for instructions to step aside."The rapid development in artificial intelligence, or AI, has had the effect of disrupting and transforming socioeconomic activities across industries ranging from health, trade, education and even the mitigation of climate change.However, as industries and governments across the globe are positioning themselves to tap into and exploit these possibilities, experts argue that African countries need to tackle governance issues and lack of institutional and infrastructural capacity to establish the building blocks that will allow them to benefit from artificial intelligence.They added that Africa needs supportive policies and robust infrastructure to tap the limitless opportunities of artificial intelligence to quicken its development. Though it is important to regulate the use of AI in Africa to avert its risks, the experts said that the continent should not wait to have the regulations in place in order to embrace the technology.Fayaz King, an expert in digital public infrastructure from Zimbabwe, said AI has the potential to contribute up to $1.2 trillion to the African economy by 2030, representing a 5.6 percent increase in the continent's GDP by 2030. That is why it is important for African governments to incentivize stakeholders across AI value chains with a focus on small-medium scale enterprises to foster innovation and equitable access to AI technologies.Intensifying effortsAlfred Ongere, an information technology expert and the founder of Artificial Intelligence Kenya, a nongovernmental organization, said the urgency to regulate AI in African countries is expected to intensify because it can potentially be used in disseminating misinformation, fake news, and disinformation. However, policymakers should prioritize improving the state of the AI ecosystem."In Kenya, the government proposed a bill last year seeking to create a professional body to oversee the activities of AI practitioners and impose license fees for those working in the sector," Ongere said."However, this bill could hold back a nascent sector by reducing the flow of private investment, and locking young people out of opportunities," he said.Despite arguing against tempered regulation by African governments, Ongere said that it is still crucial to protect consumers from the risks posed by the unfettered application of AI on the continent. He urged African governments to develop an AI road map or policy paper that factors in the views of all stakeholders as a first step rather than imposing regulations that could potentially damage a promising sector."AI-focused solutions should address real-world challenges such as rural development, low literacy levels, and financial inclusion, among others. More importantly, efforts should be directed toward ensuring the commercial viability of these solutions," Ongere said.King said that regulating AI in Africa should address ethical considerations such as data privacy, bias and transparency. As the use of AI continues to expand, it is likely that more countries will follow in introducing such regulations.According to him, regulating AI in Africa could be seen from three perspectives. First from the point of a law enacted by a parliament, second in the form of strategies toward the adoption of AI, and finally on policies."The question of regulation, especially in the African context is that Africa is not mature to have full-blown regulation on AI because Africa lacks the level of technology advancement that exists in developed nations," King said.otiato@chinadaily.com.cnKINSHASA -- Judith Tuluka Suminwa has been appointed as the new prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the country's presidential office said late Monday."Because I have walked your path, because I have endured your hardships, I share your joys, I pursue your dreams..."

"We don't know what more is still coming."The Independent Electoral Commission of South Africa, the country's election management body, said Thursday that it has upheld an objection against Zuma's candidacy in the upcoming elections.Zuma, who was sentenced to 15 months in prison for contempt of court in 2021, was nominated as a candidate for the elections by the MK Party.JOHANNESBURG -- A total of 45 people were killed in a bus crash that occurred Thursday in South Africa's northeastern province of Limpopo, the country's Department of Transport said.The crash, which involved a passenger bus allegedly transporting people from Botswana to Moria, a town in Limpopo, killed at least 45 people and seriously injured one, the department said in a statement late Thursday."I am sending my heartfelt condolences to the families affected by the tragic bus crash near Mamatlakala. We continue to urge responsible driving at all times with heightened alertness as more people are on our roads this Easter weekend," Minister of Transport Sindisiwe Chikunga said.The police will continue to provide updates as the rescue and recovery efforts unfold, and the precise cause of the crash is under investigation, according to the statement.The 45 dead were worshippers, and they were killed after their bus went out of control, fell over a bridge, and caught fire on the mountain pass between Mokopane and Marken in Limpopo, the South African Broadcasting Corporation said in an earlier report Thursday. JOHANNESBURG -- The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) of South Africa, the country's election management body, said Thursday that it has upheld an objection against former President Jacob Zuma's candidacy in the upcoming elections.IEC Chairperson Mosotho Moepya said at a media briefing that they have received 82 objections about candidates nominated by 21 political parties for the 2024 national and provincial elections."In the case of former President Zuma, yes, we did receive an objection, which has been upheld," said Moepya. "We were unanimous. These are not matters we deal with that are personal. It is a provision of the law against which we must measure an objection and it's straightforward. It is whether the person qualifies or does not qualify."Zuma, who was sentenced to 15 months in prison for contempt of court in 2021, was nominated as a candidate for the elections by the newly-formed MK Party.South Africa will hold the national and local government elections on May 29. DAKAR -- Bassirou Diomaye Faye, the candidate of the opposition coalition "Diomaye President," has won Senegal's presidential election, according to results released Wednesday by the country's National Vote Counting Commission.Faye secured a total of 2,434,751 votes, constituting 54.28 percent of the total votes cast, said Amady Diouf, the commission's president, during a press conference held in Dakar, the country's capital. The voter turnout rate was 61.30 percent.His closest rival, Amadou Ba, representing the ruling coalition, trailed behind with 35.79 percent of the votes.Aged 44, Faye was born in Ndiaganiao, located 115 km east of Dakar. He holds a master's degree in law from Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar. In 2004, he passed the entrance exam to the National School of Administration and became a tax inspector after graduation.He served as the secretary general of the African Patriots of Senegal for Work, Ethics and Fraternity (PASTEF) party, which was dissolved by presidential decree in July 2023.Faye was imprisoned in April 2023 and was released on March 14 following the enactment of an amnesty law by outgoing President Macky Sall. DAKAR -- Senegal's ruling coalition candidate Amadou Ba congratulates his rival Bassirou Diomaye Faye on winning the presidential election in the first round, the ruling coalition said in a statement on Monday.Clashes between two communities in eastern Chad have killed at least 42 people, the public security ministry said on Thursday, in a desert region of the vast Sahel country often hit by land disputes.The ministry did not say exactly who was involved in the fighting or how long it went on, but the area regularly sees clashes between sedentary farmers and nomadic breeders, or other groups, over land.The fighting led to the arrest of 175 people at the scene, where "a large part" of the village of Tileguey in Ouaddai Province was "set on fire by armed men", it said.The private sector, government and international organizations have reiterated that Africa needs to attract more private sector finance in order to bridge its climate finance gap.They made the remarks during a two-day meeting in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi that concluded on Wednesday to discuss ways to increase climate finance in Africa.During the Climate Change Global Business Summit, speakers called on multilateral development finance institutions to strengthen their role in de-risking green projects. This will make it more attractive for domestic and international private sector players to enter Africa's green space.While addressing the media at the event, Adele Fusi, think tank European House-Ambrosetti's chief of climate change affairs, said that the African continent faces a funding shortfall to address climate change despite being the least carbon emitter globally. She urged increased financing for the Global South while calling for the private sector to play a more significant role.Significant role"In the past five years the total amount of money that the main multilateral development banks have been allocating to the African region is about $25 billion. This is way below the required funds because the continent faces a significant funding gap, with current climate finance flows to Africa covering only 11 percent of what is needed annually to implement climate action plans," Fusi said.However, she noted that unstable governments are some of the critical aspects that need to be addressed within the continent, as private investors find it hard to roll out funding in environments with weak governance structures.African markets are perceived by international private sector investors as risky, leading to increased capital costs. Such perception results in African countries receiving unfavorable and predominantly subjective credit ratings on the global stage, Fusi said.Khadija AI-Makhzoumi, Somalia's minister of environment and climate change, said Africa is experiencing the most severe economic impacts of climate change in comparison to other regions. This is despite being the lowest emitter of pollutants in the world. She urged African nations to tackle challenges like high interest rates for green projects such as geothermal, solar and wind energy projects in order to attract private sector financing.In his presentation at the summit, Hennie Heymans, the chief executive officer at logistics company DHL in South Africa, pointed out that the implementation of Africa's nationally determined contributions in mitigating climate change from 2020 to 2030 is estimated to require about $2.8 trillion.The summit comes after the African Union and the government of Kenya co-hosted the inaugural Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi in September, culminating in the Nairobi Declaration that calls for a significant overhaul of the global financial system to facilitate climate action financing.otiato@chinadaily.com.cnAs Africa strives to industrialize, the ability to bring prosperity, create jobs and improve incomes for all will be greatly helped by Chinese investments in the continent, as well as helping deepen the relationship between the two partners, experts say.According to McKinsey & Company, a US multinational strategy and management consulting firm, Africa only represents 2 percent of total manufacturing output globally and only 0.6 percent of imports of manufactured goods globally come from the continent.Experts believe that through cooperation platforms like the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the Belt and Road Initiative, Africa's industrialization dream could become a reality.According to Humphrey Moshi, director at the Center of China Studies in Tanzania, through the BRI, the level of industrialization in Africa has increased in terms of its contribution to the gross domestic product."In Tanzania, for example, 60 percent of Chinese investments are in manufacturing," he said.Ezechiel Nibigira, former Burundi minister of foreign affairs, said Africa has manpower that is young and not expensive, terming it a good opportunity for Chinese enterprises to establish industries in the continent.Maged Aboulmagd, former deputy assistant minister in Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said for the China-Africa partnership to move wider and upward, the parties might have to consider adding industrialization to their priorities.Creating valueHe specifically suggested transforming Africa's agriculture through agro-industry, noting that it would link two sectors together, create value and jobs, get Africa in the global supply chain and boost food security, consequently reducing poverty and creating growth."The recent establishment of industrial parks in Tanzania and in Egypt and elsewhere are excellent starting points in this direction," Aboulmagd said.He said Africa's manufacturing sector has not only been minimal in its contribution to the continent's GDP and employment but it's also concentrated in only 10 countries that dominate almost 80 percent of Africa's manufacturing activity."This sector needs a healthy dose of investments not only in the food sector but also in products like beef and fish processing, leather and cocoa to mention a few," he said."Manufacturing needs to take hold in African economies, and there's no better partner to co-invest in our drive for industrialization than China."Sheriff Ghali Ibrahim, director of the Center for Contemporary China Studies at the University of Abuja in Nigeria, said he hopes China can help Africa increase manufacturing capacity to develop an export-led economy.Noting that the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a trade agreement between the US and the sub-Saharan African countries, expires next year, Sheriff suggested the establishment of a similar pact between China and Africa.With the African population projected to hit 2.5 billion by 2050, Sheriff said China could help Africa to increase food production through agricultural mechanization to feed the expected high population.According to the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, because of new technologies and approaches such as biotechnology, digitalization, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology, there are more options available to make agriculture more productive and water and land use more efficient, improve diet structure, and reduce waste and greenhouse gas emissions.edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cnThe 13th meeting of the China-Africa Think Tanks Forum was recently held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and over 300 Chinese and African scholars jointly issued the Consensus Among African and Chinese Think Tanks on Deepening Global Development Cooperation.The consensus, also known as the Africa-China Dar es Salaam Consensus, urges the international community to deepen development cooperation based on the principles of mutual respect, solidarity, win-win cooperation, openness and common prosperity. Its aim is to foster knowledge sharing, intellectual exchange and cultural prosperity."If you are not at the table in the international system, you're going to be on the menu," United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken remarked during a public forum at the Munich Security Conference in February. The analogy reflected the weak-and-strong mentality that is prevalent in the world order."Independence, mutual respect and mutual learning, people-oriented development philosophy, and sharing of development dividends" are key words and phrases in the eight major initiatives of the Africa-China Dar es Salaam Consensus. They represent the voices of unity, independence and innovation from the Global South countries as articulated by think tank scholars from China and Africa.China-Africa cooperation and development have always been driven by a shared commitment and mutual understanding. Common development, shared interests, joint promotion of industries, collaborative ecological initiatives, mutual well-being, cultural co-prosperity, joint protection of security, and open, win-win cooperation, as called for in the consensus, not only vividly depict the current state of China-Africa cooperation, but also represent a promising prospect for China-Africa cooperation in the future.We are not "food" on the dining table, but food producers for the entire world. China-Africa collaboration should be a broader "dining table". It is high time to put an end to the "table and menu "approach that seeks to divide and pick sides.Regardless of how turbulent the world is, genuine and friendly relations between China and Africa will remain deeply rooted. China-Africa cooperation, characterized by mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, will persist in uniting people to navigate challenges and successes together.The core proposition of the China-Africa Dar es Salaam Consensus is to encourage all countries to pursue a development path characterized by independence, mutual respect, mutual learning, and people-centered development. It aims to promote the establishment of an equal, orderly, multipolar world, foster an inclusive global economy, and enhance social productivity by activating the market through the synergy of efficient markets and effective governments.Against the backdrop of a sluggish global economy and the turbulent geopolitical landscape, as well as rampant unilateralism, protectionism and hegemonism, the emergence of this consensus is timely. It fully reflects the expectations of Chinese and African think tank scholars for future development and the strengthening of the China-Africa Cooperation Vision 2035, bringing greater certainty and stability to a world of turmoil and chaos.The China-Africa Dar es Salaam Consensus does not promote a singular model, but instead emphasizes subjectivity and autonomy, advocating that countries independently choose their development paths based on their own civilization and development needs. In this sense, the consensus stands as the most resounding declaration of shared prosperity, shared global responsibilities, fair market competition, and the establishment of a standardized financial order. It embodies the essence of the common wisdom of the people of China and Africa.The unveiling of the consensus reflects the broadest consensus on global development among Chinese and African think tank scholars, demonstrating the unity of moral principles and rationality, as well as the alignment of interests and righteousness between the Chinese and African peoples.Both sides firmly support the exploration of a development model suitable for their respective national circumstances, a pursuit that is poised to propel and guide the modernization process in the Global South. Furthermore, it will advance the implementation of the Initiative on Supporting Africa's Industrialization, the Plan for China Supporting Africa's Agricultural Modernization, and the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development.Together, by aligning our words with consistent actions, we will build a high-level China-Africa community with a shared future, and a community with a shared future for mankind that will unite the world.Liu Hongwu is a Changjiang Scholar appointed by the Ministry of Education and director of the Institute of African Studies at Zhejiang Normal University.

However, the union's secretary-general Davji Atellah said the strike was necessary because no consensus has been reached on issues affecting healthcare workers across the country.At the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital in Nairobi, services proceeded normally despite fears that the strike might interrupt services in the coming days.Solution urgedAn ear, nose and throat specialist, who preferred to remain anonymous, said doctors are obligated to save lives, but they cannot do that in poor conditions.He said he is on duty in accordance to the labor court ruling, but will await the direction of their union leaders pertaining to the strike."We have patients in the intensive care unit, in the sick newborn and pediatric medical unit, women with premature labor or high-risk pregnancies and many of other high-risk patients who cannot survive the withdrawal of services. That is why we prefer that the government offers a solution," the doctor said.Sakina Akoko, an expectant mother, said she was relieved to be told that services were still available at Mama Lucy despite the earlier announcement of the doctors' strike."I had come to Mama Lucy when I was experiencing some pain. The doctor attended to me and recommended that I be admitted for observation," Akoko said. "Imagine if I were to go into labor or had some complications and there was no one to attend to me because of the strike, where would I go as I cannot afford to pay for private hospitals."Kenya's Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha pleaded with doctors to be patient as the Ministry of Health finds a lasting solution to their grievances. She also noted that strikes will not solve the medical interns' problem or other pertinent issues that have persisted for years.otiato@chinadaily.com.cnChina remains Africa's valued partner not only for its contribution to transforming the continent through infrastructure development but also as a role model for the continent to take a leaf from, African think tanks have reiterated.Experts from the think tanks, who gathered for a forum in Tanzania's Dar es Salaam city last week, urged African governments and policymakers to learn from China about their development agenda as well as take advantage of the opportunities provided by the Asian powerhouse.David Norris, advisory panel member of the Africa-China Centre for Policy and Advisory and the vice-chancellor of the University of Botswana, called on African governments and policymakers to draw inspiration from China's philosophy of development, which is people-centered.Norris said African governments should put people first in every policy consideration."We should learn how China developed from a very poor country to being an economic powerhouse. If we don't set certain things right in Africa, our partnership with China could be a lopsided affair," he said.He said if African countries fail to take care of people's desires and aspirations, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals will become empty talk.Norris challenged Africa to stop copying economic models and develop its own by taking a leaf from China, which he said has a homegrown economic model — a socialist market economy.Charles Onunaiju, director of Centre for China Studies in Nigeria, said for China and Africa to remain stable in a turbulent world, Africa should meet China halfway, bring something to the table and drive cooperation on a win-win principle. This, he said, can be achieved by engaging in local capacity building."We need to take several initiatives, including rural revitalization, which is the strength of Africa. If we don't revitalize our rural communities, if we don't connect our rural communities with trends of Africa renaissance, it will be empty talk," he said.Through rural revitalization, China has been able to promote a more balanced economic and social development as well as alleviate poverty and protect the environment.Humphrey Moshi, director at the Center of Chinese Studies in Tanzania, expressed the need for Africa's proactiveness in seizing the opportunities offered by China's cooperation platforms, especially the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the Belt and Road Initiative.He said the platforms are non-bureaucratic, hence consultative, through the holding of scheduled summits and ministerial conferences whose decisions are dutifully implemented.Spillover effectMoshi said the BRI has a positive spillover effect on other sectors of a country's economy and views the development process in its totality.It is also inclusive as it ensures the cooperation parties meet frequently at scheduled Belt and Road forums to review progress, discuss the challenges confronted and chart out the way forward, thus promoting the spirit of ownership and partnership.He said the BRI has incorporated a new agenda on its menu with a view to addressing challenges and tapping opportunities.The post-COVID-19 pandemic ushered in the Health Silk Road, Green Silk Road, Digital Silk Road and Clean Silk Road, Moshi said.He said the BRI is well aligned with individual African countries' development, visions and plans, coupled with those of regional groupings such as the East African Community, the Southern African Development Community, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, and the Economic Community of West African States."In that regard, African countries have been quite proactive in embracing the initiative. This is evident among others, through the mushrooming of BRI-led projects in Africa, ranging from infrastructure, manufacturing, agriculture, education, public health, energy, vocational training and culture," he added.edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cnArtificial intelligence can be a promising area for China-Africa cooperation to help African countries tap their potential for economic development, industry insiders said.Paradigm Initiative, a Pan-African nonprofit organization that promotes digital inclusion, terms AI as the magic bullet that will help the continent add value to its vast mineral resources for economic growth.Sani Suleiman Sani, programs officer at Paradigm Initiative, said China has been a key strategic partner for most African states in areas such as trade, science, technology and infrastructural development, and AI can also be an area where China can provide support."We need to unlock AI potential which requires strategic partnerships and careful consideration of ethical concerns. China can support this journey through collaborative research, capacity building, and infrastructure development."Sani added that African states seeking fruitful AI partnerships with China should focus on strategic dimensions such as digital infrastructure projects, new-generation mobile communication networks and meaningful connectivity technologies, digital education, and digital governance capacity, as well as the development of AI tailored for local African problems.Data from PwC Research reveals that by 2030, AI industry globally will be worth nearly $16 trillion.Chris Otundo, CEO of Brighter-Monday Kenya, a recruitment firm with a presence in the African continent, said that Africa needs to be strategic to reap dividends from the sector."Our governments should strengthen partnerships with global players, including China and other AI-developed nations, to foster knowledge exchange and technology transfer. We can work with China in establishing innovation hubs and incubators that support AI-driven innovation and development," Otundo said.He said African states need to allocate more funding toward the growth of the AI industry. "We must be able to allocate a reasonable percentage from our budget in a bid to grow the AI industry in the African continent and there is no other way out of this because either we get it right or forget about it."Ehud Gachugu, project director of Ajira Digital and Youth Employment under the Kenya Private Sector Alliance, said AI collaboration between Africa and China can help the continent solve many of the challenges it faces in the traditional sectors.Vibrant ecosystem"China's AI industry is characterized by robust research and development, massive investments, and a vibrant ecosystem of startups and tech giants, which present a wealth of opportunities for African nations to leapfrog traditional barriers and accelerate their development agenda," said Gachugu.He pointed out that by fostering collaboration between Chinese AI firms, African startups, and academic institutions, synergistic ecosystems can emerge, fostering knowledge exchange, skills development, and technology transfer."Through incubators, accelerators, and joint research initiatives, African innovators can leverage Chinese expertise to develop AI-driven solutions tailored to local challenges."However, the lack of a better regulatory framework is a major bottleneck for the growth of the AI industry in the African continent, according to experts."Most African countries … rely on data protection laws and other 'soft laws' to regulate AI. These laws often predate significant AI advancements and may not adequately address the unique risks and opportunities presented by the technology," said Sani.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.The 18th China-US defense policy coordination talks held.Finding the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other is what both nations and the international community need the most, a top Chinese envoy said on Thursday.Chinese Ambassador to the US Xie Feng, speaking at the Vision China event at the Asia Society in New York, said that for the past 50 years, the reopening and development of China-US relations was the most important event in international relations and the biggest contributor to global peace and prosperity."History provides us inspirations to look ahead to the future," Xie said in a keynote speech.He said that in the next 50 years, charting that proper course will be critical to international relations.Jointly hosted by China Daily and Bank of China, the event brought together more than 200 people to discuss "inspiration from the past" and "vision for the future".Also speaking at the event, Qu Yingpu, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily, said the country's only national English-language newspaper has chronicled the development of Sino-US relations and "faithfully recorded the bonds forged between the two peoples"."China-US relations are the most important bilateral relations in the world, and they must be managed well, despite the risks and challenges," Qu said.Qu said the newspaper "has never been absent" when important moments unfolded in and between the two countries."Just as President Xi Jinping pointed out 'the hope of the China-US relationship lies in the people, its foundation is in grassroots connections, its future depends on the youth, and its vitality comes from subnational exchanges' — those are the key aspects we should constantly work to strengthen," Qu said.The veteran journalist said he is a firm believer that "mutual understanding is the foundation of friendly cooperation" and that "a modernized China represents an opportunity, rather than a challenge, to the US".Given that China and the US have accumulated remarkable "cognitive deficits" amid profound changes taking place in the world, it is crucial that the two peoples reacquaint themselves with a real, multidimensional and comprehensive view of each other's country, he said.In his keynote speech, Xie, the ambassador, said: "The history of the China-US relationship in the past 45 years, especially the ups and downs in recent years, tells us that pressure, sanctions, isolation, containment and blockade don't serve the purpose. Rather, they bring self-inflicted trouble and require extra work to offset the unwanted results."The idea of 'decoupling' is illusive. Viewing each other as new Cold War adversaries will prove to be the biggest strategic misjudgment in the 21st century," he said.The envoy underscored that among the four red lines that China has drawn — Taiwan, democracy and human rights, path and system, and development rights — the Taiwan question is paramount in China-US relations and is a red line that must not be crossed."For China-US relations to have a 'stable floor', it is critical to avoid touching these 'high-voltage wires'," Xie said.The Vision China morning session featured presentations from six Americans. They came to tell stories of friendship with China in a time wrought with uncertainty. They are people who have remained steadfast in their support of China while trade and political tensions persist, particularly in a US presidential election year.US' wrong assumptionsUS policy on China has veered off course because the assumptions have changed, in many ways radically, David Firestein, CEO and president of the George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, said during his speech at the event."They have changed in a way that they have become less accurate than they were before," he said.He outlined six wrong assumptions: China is no longer a partner but an enemy; building a constructive relationship with China does not serve the long-term interests of the US; China no longer accepts the existing world order and seeks to reshape it; China is trying to replace the US as the sole superpower; excessive engagement with China harms the US and makes it vulnerable; China-US relations are a "zero-sum game"."They're all wrong, every one of them," Firestein said of the assumptions.In 1979, teenagers Kelly Van Dries and her elder sister Kitty were working at a rodeo in Simonton, Texas, which was owned by their parents.

"We will build more bridges of dialogue and communication between our peoples to sustain the tradition of friendship."Also speaking at the forum, Qu Yingpu, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily, said the country's only English-language newspaper has chronicled the development of Sino-US relations and "faithfully recorded the bonds forged between the two peoples"."China-US relations are the most important bilateral relations in the world, and they must be managed well, despite the risks and challenges," Qu said.Qu said the newspaper "has never been absent" when important moments unfolded in and between the two countries.Most recently, it covered stories including American families who once lived in the Fujian resort of Kuliang, US youth visiting China, the 80th anniversary commemoration of the "Flying Tigers", and the August debut of the giant pandas "Yun Chuan" and "Xin Bao" at San Diego Zoo."Just as President Xi Jinping pointed out 'the hope of the China-US relationship lies in the people, its foundation is in grassroots connections, its future depends on the youth, and its vitality comes from subnational exchanges' — those are the key aspects we should constantly work to strengthen," Qu said.The veteran journalist said he is a firm believer that "mutual understanding is the foundation of friendly cooperation" and that "a modernized China represents an opportunity, rather than a challenge, to the United States".Given that China and the US have accumulated remarkable "cognitive deficits" amid profound changes taking place in the world, it is crucial that the two peoples reacquaint themselves with a real, multidimensional and comprehensive view of each other's country, he said.For five years in a row, the newspaper has worked with the Chinese embassy in the US to stage an annual story-sharing event titled "My China Album", presenting photo albums that show a unique pathway to understanding, while acting as a lens through which one can appreciate the richness of another culture, Qu said.The Vision China morning session featured presentations from six Americans.

In an attempt to salvage the agreement, the two countries extended it twice, for six months each time, to negotiate renewal terms. Those efforts proved unsuccessful, and the most recent six-month extension expired last month.Many disappointedThe demise of the STA has sparked concern and disappointment among experts in the field.Richard Dasher, director of the US-Asia Technology Management Center at Stanford University, supports maintaining international cooperation."I think we should stay internationally focused. And I think that cooperation is good whenever we can do it. So, in principle, I would be in favor of continuing the US-China Science and Technology Agreement," Dasher told China Daily.The frustration surrounding the obstacles to renewing the STA is palpable within the scientific community.Denis Simon, a former professor at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, and Marcus Stanley, director of studies at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, voiced their exasperation by asking, "Why can't we just let American and Chinese scientists get along?"In an article published in the Quincy Institute's online magazine Responsible Statecraft the day after the agreement expired, the authors emphasized the critical role of the STA in fostering scientific collaboration."The STA provided an overarching framework for facilitating scientific exchanges, joint research projects, and the sharing of knowledge and technical expertise," they wrote.Simon and Stanley warned of the potential consequences of allowing the STA to lapse."It would be a mistake for agreements to facilitate basic scientific research cooperation such as the STA to become irretrievably damaged by the increase in US-China tensions. The decision on whether to extend, amend, or terminate the STA has profound implications for the global scientific community," they cautioned.The authors also highlighted the broader context of growing distrust between the two countries, which has contributed to the current impasse. Besides Congress, the US government has increasingly scrutinized Chinese scientists and researchers over "national security" concerns, which has hampered academic exchanges."This climate of growing distrust not only has made renewal of the STA more contentious, but it has also made the rekindling of overall science and technology cooperation more difficult," they said.Roger Pielke Jr, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank, expressed his support for continuing the STA "in the most robust form that can be negotiated between the two nations".He argued that the very existence of such an agreement is more important than its specific details, adding he viewed "decoupling" to be "a bad idea and it is also a bad idea in science and technology".Crucial supportFor decades, the STA has been instrumental in fostering scientific collaboration in areas of basic science such as agriculture, clean energy, public health and the environment. It has provided US and Chinese researchers with crucial financial, legal and political support, enabling them to work together on groundbreaking research and innovations.Dasher emphasized the interconnected nature of the global scientific community and the importance of collaboration."There's a continuum between basic research and actual commercialization, and certainly in the basic research area, there's always cooperation potential, just about everywhere," he said. "And you're seeing a lot of papers written jointly between people in China and in the United States."The agreement has contributed to a rapid increase in both the number and quality of joint papers by Chinese and US researchers. However, in recent years, research collaboration has declined, attributed to rising tensions and anti-China sentiment.A study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in June showed that scientific cooperation between the US and China had drastically decreased since 2016 when the former US president, Donald Trump, took office.The study analyzed data in three key areas: STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) trainee mobility, use of scientific works between scientists in each country, and scientist productivity in each country as measured by the production of peer-reviewed papers.Between 2016 and 2019, ethnically Chinese graduate students were 16 percent less likely to attend a US-based PhD program. Moreover, those who did attend such programs were 4 percent less likely to stay in the US after graduation, the study found.Output dropsThe researchers also documented a sharp decline in Chinese use of US science as measured by citations, although they found no such decline in the propensity of US scientists to cite Chinese research.The trends are corroborated by the State of the Science address delivered by US National Academy of Sciences President Marcia McNutt in June.McNutt presented data showing that the US is dropping in research output as measured by articles published, while China is experiencing a triple-digit percentage increase. In terms of research quality, measured by the percentage of articles in the top 1 percent cited, the US is losing ground while China has moved ahead of the European Union.The shifting landscape of scientific productivity is also reflected in the pharmaceutical industry. China's share of drugs in phase one to three trials has risen dramatically from about 3 percent in 2013 to 28 percent in 2021, while the US share is in decline, according to McNutt.China's number of patents per year surpassed the US around 2015 and is now leading by a ratio of 2 to 1 as of 2021.In the corporate world, China has emerged as a dominant force, leading the Global Fortune 500 list with 142 out of 500 companies in 2023, a stark contrast to its nonplayer status in 2000.Those statistics underscore McNutt's conclusion that advancing the frontiers of basic research now requires international partnerships to benefit all researchers.Saving livesThe importance of such partnerships is illustrated by an example provided by Dasher, involving a medical technology company. He described a collaboration between a senior electrical engineer in Silicon Valley — with innovative ideas for medical image analysis — and a professor in China."China has eight times as many medical images as the United States does. So, he cooperated with a professor in China, and the two of them have created a company about medical image analysis to detect cancer," Dasher said."That's a very good use, where China has data that is useful for everyone, and we have a technology idea. I think that kind of thing will continue."The benefits of international cooperation extend to the overall strength of the US technology sector. Dasher said one of the key strengths of Silicon Valley has been its diversity, with 13 percent of the technical workforce born in China."We've benefited from foreign people who come to the United States as students and continue to work here. I think that it's also the case where some Americans may want to go to China and work in China. So we need to maintain a very good, safe environment for people to cooperate," he emphasized.With dwindling government investment, the US industry began taking the lead around 1981 and now dominates US research investment with a 75 percent share, compared with the federal government's 20 percent.The strengths of the private sector in advancing scientific and technological development, however, have been challenged by the US government's "national security" measures aimed at containing China's development in science and technology.The biotech industry provides a stark example of the potential consequences of decoupling. Many achievements under the STA, such as US-China collaborations on gene editing research that have created disease-resistant crops and improved yields, are at risk of being reduced to historical footnotes.Patrick Beyrer, a researcher at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, said a potential US-China biotech decoupling is being expedited while everyday Americans aren't adequately prepared for the consequences.He cited the example of WuXi AppTec as a "research superstore" for its US partners, and WuXi Biologics, the second-largest biologic outsourcer in the world.Recent policy recommendations from the US House of Representatives' select committee on China have described US dependence on Chinese pharmaceutical supply chains as a "distinct national security risk", with some lawmakers proposing to block Chinese companies, such as BGI Group and WuXi AppTec, from future US federal contracting and government technology procurement.Impact on treatmentBeyrer warned that the elimination of those companies from US supply chains would have an impact on developing treatments for critical medical conditions, including hearing loss, cystic fibrosis and leukemia."In addition to China representing the largest and most cost-effective exporter of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the US market, jointly developed drugs, agricultural technologies, and other biotech-enabled solutions have improved countless American lives," he wrote in an article."The collapse of US-China biotech partnerships would spell the end of such jointly developed innovations that harbor the potential to deliver sorely needed global public goods, including saving American lives suffering from diseases such as cancer," Beyrer cautioned.Talent crunchThe challenges faced by the biotech industry are symptomatic of a broader issue affecting US-China relations in science and technology. Export controls and other measures to restrict technology transfer have moved to the heart of the relationship, increasing tensions between the two countries and posing significant challenges for US tech companies.Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, criticized the US export controls for causing an "intensely difficult problem" for US tech companies, particularly those that are in Silicon Valley."There's a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety. And I think that's true across the board in tech," Allen observed during an event at Stanford while visiting his organization's members in Silicon Valley.The semiconductor industry, in particular, has been hit hard by these restrictions. Allen said that several US chip companies have recently been banned from selling to an "ill-defined" range of Chinese customers."It's becoming more and more difficult to avoid that conflict of law, and thereby the consequences would be terminating or severely restricting what had been a very profitable enterprise for decades," he said.He emphasized the importance of China for many technology companies, both as a market and as a source of talent."China's extremely important for the tech companies; many of them have a large percentage share of their total sales in China, and many of them draw on that enormous Chinese talent pool in China, and that is not something that they can easily walk away from," he said.An April report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated that in a small subset of tech companies studied, $130 billion of market capital was lost due to export controls. When new export controls were announced, employment in affected companies declined by 7 percent."It is especially detrimental for American companies when export controls are unilateral, enforced by the American government only on American companies in such cases, and there are many unilateral export controls (that) asymmetrically hurt American firms and long-term American competitiveness," said Allen.These restrictions are disrupting long-established partnerships and hindering access to crucial talent. Allen cited the case of a US multinational company whose lead scientist in China was denied a visa to visit his own laboratories in the US."American companies need to access Chinese talent if they are to remain globally competitive. If American companies are barred from hiring Chinese talent, then other companies will be given a long-term structural advantage that probably over a very short period of time will impact American competitiveness," he argued.This talent crunch is exacerbated by the US' dependence on international students to meet its STEM workforce requirements, as noted by McNutt in her June address. The narrowing channel for data flows between R&D teams in China and the US is making this challenge more acute every day.Looking ahead, Allen acknowledged the complex political landscape that companies must navigate."We live in a political world; companies have to recognize that a potential future conflict between the United States and China would make it impossible for most international trade and investment to continue," he said."While conflict is certainly not inevitable, tensions need to be managed carefully, as we try to nudge our way to a more sustainable rules-based multipolar order."Beijing condemned on Tuesday the so-called Biosecure Act passed by the United States House of Representatives, urging Washington to stop unwarranted oppression against Chinese enterprises.The bill, passed by 306 to 81 votes on Monday, would prohibit the US government from contracting with, or providing grants to, companies that do business with a "biotechnology company of concern".It names five Chinese companies — BGI, MGI and its subsidiary Complete Genomics, WuXi AppTec, and WuXi Biologics.China firmly opposes such discriminatory measures against its companies, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a daily news conference.Mao urged the US to abandon ideological bias, earnestly respect market principles and trade rules, stop pushing forward the legislation and provide a fair, just and nondiscriminatory business environment for companies from all countries.China will continue to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of its companies, she said, adding that the country also supports its companies in safeguarding their rights and interests in accordance with the law.The legislation needs to pass the US Senate before it can be sent to US President Joe Biden to be signed into law.The targeted companies have all said the measure is based on false and misleading allegations and would limit competition. They denied posing any threat to US national security and stressed that they do not have access to the personal data of US citizens in their operations.The act is the latest move by US lawmakers who have already succeeded this year in requiring Chinese-based parent company ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a US ban.The Biosecure Act is part of a string of China-related bills that the US lawmakers are pushing ahead this week.In what has been dubbed "China Week", the US House of Representatives is aiming to introduce dozens of bills touching on trade, technology, farm ownership and electric vehicles, in moves to counter China's political, economic and technological influence.The China Institute honored three people for promoting mutual understanding between China and the United States during the annual Blue Cloud Gala on Thursday in New York.The awards were presented to Ronald Diamond, vice-chairman of Conair LLC and chief executive of Cuisinart Outdoor; Henry Fernandez, chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley Capital International; and Sheldon Pang, vice-chairman of Freepoint Commodities and chairman of Freepoint Solar, at The Plaza Hotel."We are thrilled to have the opportunity to salute these three honorees for their outstanding leadership and contribution to our society as well as in the social exchange between the American and Chinese people," said George S. Geh, CEO of the China Institute in America. "This is aligned with our mission to promote bridge-building and cultural understanding between the US and China."Chinese Consul General in New York Huang Ping attended the gala and expressed his appreciation for the China Institute and the awardees' efforts in "making a positive impact on China-US cultural exchanges"."I have been inspired by the vision and commitment of the people and organizations that believe China and the US ... should work together," Huang said. He expressed appreciation for the China Institute's commitment to introducing China to US friends, including its history, culture, values and lifestyle."I know we were different, we are different, and we are going to be different. But we share a lot of things in common. The only problem is we just don't know each other as we need to know, so that sometimes causes problems," he said."But if we would enhance people-to-people communication, if we could have more contacts, more people flow across the Pacific, having more face-to-face chatting, we will get to know each other better."The three-time Chinese diplomat to the US hosted and took part in more than 400 events each year during his six-year term and received a special award from the China Institute."The road for China and the US is always bumpy," Huang said. "We started reengagement 50 years ago; we had our relationship mobilized 45 years ago. We believe in the power of the youth, strength, the power of unity and solidarity. We can always find a way to get along."The China Institute is a nonprofit founded in New York in 1926 by US educators John Dewey and Paul Monroe, along with Chinese scholars Hu Shi and Kuo Ping-wen."Our mission is to deepen the world's understanding of China's 5,000-year history and its rich and diverse culture," Geh said.mingmeili@chinadailyusa.com China and the United States will make joint efforts to ensure a successful United Nations climate change conference in November, a key task of which will be to set a new financial target for supporting developing countries in their climate actions.The announcement came after a three-day meeting of the China-US Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which was hosted by China in Beijing from Wednesday to Friday. The meeting was co-chaired by Liu Zhenmin, China's special envoy for climate change, and John Podesta, senior adviser to the US president for international climate policy.The two sides continued their discussions on tackling the climate crisis, including the implementation of the 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions and preparation of their 2035 NDCs, according to a media release on Sunday from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.Nationally determined contributions are part of a climate action plan under the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change to cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate impacts. Each party to the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep the global temperature increase this century to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels, and limiting it to 1.5 C, is required to establish an NDC and update it every five years.The ministry's release said the two sides welcomed the technical and policy exchanges that have been conducted under the working group, including discussions on energy transition, methane, circular economy and resource efficiency, as well as low-carbon and sustainable provinces, states and cities.While reaffirming their intention to jointly host a summit on methane and other non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases at the UN COP29 climate change conference, the two sides also discussed encouraging participation from other parties, according to the release.COP29, formally known as the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is scheduled to be held from Nov 11 to 22 in Baku, Azerbaijan.Recalling their commitments to advancing efforts to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030, China and the US expressed their intention to continue discussion and cooperation in this regard, the ministry release said. Furthermore, the two countries will continue to enforce laws on banning illegal imports and promote global forest conservation and sustainable management.The two countries also are committed to further strengthening dialogue and collaborative efforts, together with other parties, to support Azerbaijan for successful outcomes at COP29, including reaching the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance and making progress on setting rules for Article 6 of the accord, which allows countries to cooperate with each other to achieve emission reduction targets.The New Collective Quantified Goal, a key element of the Paris treaty, is designed to set a new financial target to support developing countries in their post-2025 climate actions. Regarding Article 6, parties to the treaty have so far failed to agree on detailed rules after years of negotiation.China and the US reached a consensus to establish the working group during COP26, in Glasgow, United Kingdom, in 2021, vowing to meet regularly to address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process.The two sides held the first meeting of the working group in Washington on May 8 and 9.LOS ANGELES - A group of representatives of US travel agents, organized by Air China and China National Tourist Office (CNTO), departed from Los Angeles Sunday on a FAM (short for "familiarization") trip for China."It will be good to experience it ourselves, so that we can tell our clients that China would be safe to go," Joey Sy, a personal travel manager from Los Angeles-based Hyssop Travel, told Xinhua at Los Angeles International Airport.Since China introduced a series of measures in 2023 to facilitate inbound tourism, including simplifying visa processes, expanding the list of visa-free countries, and expanding international flights, the country's inbound tourism market has seen continuous growth, Wu Dawei, CNTO Los Angeles director said.Wu added that this group is aimed at further increasing the travel from the United States to China and solidifying the outcomes of the 14th China-US Tourism Leadership Summit held in Xi'an in May.The group will explore classic itinerary including Beijing, Xi'an, the Yangtze River cruises and Shanghai on this FAM trip that encompasses site inspections of accommodations, dining and tourist attractions.China and the United States will co-host a summit focusing on non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases at this year's United Nations climate change conference, with the shared goal of ensuring the success of the UN gathering involving nearly 200 countries.The announcement came following a three-day meeting of the China-US Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which was hosted by China in Beijing and co-chaired by Liu Zhenmin, China's special envoy for climate change, and John Podesta, US senior advisor to the president for international climate policy.The two sides continued their discussions over tackling the climate crisis, including the implementation of 2030 nationally determined contributions and preparation for their 2035 NDCs, according to a media release from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment late on Sunday.NDC is a climate action plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate impacts. Each party to the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement is required to establish an NDC and update it every five years.The release said the two sides welcomed the technical and policy exchanges that have been conducted under the working group, including discussions under the themes of energy transition, methane, circular economy and resource efficiency, as well as low-carbon and sustainable provinces, states and cities.Liu and Podesta also participated in the China-US Circular Economy Cooperation Forum and China-US Sub-national Climate Action Roundtable on Friday, it said.While reaffirming their intention to jointly host a summit on methane and other non-CO2 greenhouse gases summit at COP29, it said, the two sides also discussed encouraging participation of other parties in the summit.Recalling their commitment to advance efforts to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030, they expressed their intention to continue discussion and cooperation in this regard, it said. They will continue to enforce laws banning illegal imports and promote global forest conservation and sustainable management.Both sides are committed to further strengthening dialogue and collaborative efforts, together with other parties, to support Azerbaijan for successful outcomes at the COP29 United Nations climate conference, including reaching the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance and making breakthroughs in texts for Article 6 under the Paris Agreement.Formerly known as the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP29 is scheduled to last from November 11 to 22 in Baku, Azerbaijan.The New Collective Quantified Goal, a key element of the Paris treaty, is designed to set a new financial target to support developing countries in their post-2025 climate actions.Article 6 of the Paris climate accord allows countries to voluntarily cooperate with each other to achieve emission reduction targets set out in their NDCs. But parties have so far failed to agree upon all detailed rules for the article after years of negotiation.China and the US reached a consensus to establish the working group during the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, aka COP26, in Glasgow, United Kingdom, in 2021, vowing to meet regularly to address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process.The relationship between Silicon Valley and Shenzhen, often dubbed "China's Silicon Valley", exemplifies the mutual benefits of cooperation between US and Chinese technology companies.Rather than viewing China's technological advancements as a "threat", prominent US-China business relations experts said such innovations should be welcomed and embraced.Ker Gibbs, an executive in residence with the China Business Studies Initiative at the University of San Francisco, said Chinese companies have become increasingly competitive and innovative. He advocates a reciprocal approach, suggesting that the United States and China should learn from each other."China's digital businesses and services are phenomenal. Even though reading Chinese menus is, of course, slower for me than English, I can easily navigate Chinese apps and use them to do everything from ordering food to paying for parking," Gibbs said. He was most recently the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.Gibbs found these apps "powerful" and "easy to use", attributing their rapid development to intense competition and the ability to conduct quick, low-cost experiments in the Chinese market."We're also seeing digital innovation cross over into traditional businesses. Chinese-made cars, for example, have integrated digital interface designs very effectively. Foreign company CEOs often report that their local competitors adopt digital technologies faster, which means they are watching and learning from Chinese competitors," he said.He also emphasized Chinese companies' strength in creating innovative business models. He cited WeChat as an example, explaining how it combined existing technologies such as cellphones, messaging and mobile payments into a unique and powerful business model that "has yet to be replicated in quite the same way elsewhere"."You see this kind of thing everywhere in China, where an entrepreneur has found a gap and filled it. China's entrepreneurs are unstoppable. As long as they are allowed to continue to prosper, China's future is bright," he said.Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, echoed these sentiments, cautioning against underestimating the "Shenzhen model".'Strong and ambitious'While he believes the Silicon Valley model will ultimately prevail because of its "enthusiastic embrace of diversity and inherently global nature", Allen urged giving the Shenzhen model "the respect that it deserves" during a recent discussion organized by Stanford University on the relationship between Silicon Valley and Shenzhen.He described Shenzhen as a "strong and ambitious" competitor, capable of mobilizing vast resources, leveraging the vast market scale and utilizing "superb" engineering talent."They are fast, and they are agile. They have strong government support and their ecosystem and infrastructure are second to none," he said, adding that the two regions have had a complementary relationship.Silicon Valley has benefited significantly from cooperation with their Chinese counterparts, particularly in outsourcing labor-intensive operations to China and benefiting from Chinese excellence in manufacturing.This complementary relationship extends to research and development, with many US companies conducting R&D in China. Initially focused on localizing international products, these US corporate R&D efforts in China are increasingly contributing to the global operations of US companies, a trend Allen expects to continue."I think that Chinese entrepreneurial drive and creativity is something to be celebrated and welcomed," he said. However, he acknowledged that rising national security concerns in the US have affected private companies, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty.Addressing the issue of US export controls and other measures aimed at containing China's technological development, Gibbs said the concept of "containing China" has been "misconstrued and destructive".From a business perspective, he explained, the notion of "containment" does not apply. "All businesses do better when the economy is strong and consumers have more buying power. Why would anyone want to contain that? America's businesses want China's economy to be strong and the people prosperous," he said.Regarding the current strained relations between the US and China, Gibbs said assigning blame serves no purpose. "The restrictions on both sides mean consumers lose out and innovation suffers. The goal should be to fix the relationship so that these kinds of restrictions will not be necessary." Beijing called on Washington to maintain consistency with policies and make concerted efforts with China to cope with global challenges, as Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with United States Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy John Podesta in Beijing on Friday.Recognizing that addressing climate change is crucial for the future of humanity and the fate of the planet, Wang emphasized China's commitment to pursuing a path of green, low-carbon, and sustainable development. He also stressed China's active engagement in international cooperation on climate change issues.Dialogue and cooperation on climate change are not only integral to China-US relations but also crucial measures for implementing the consensus reached between the two heads of state at a summit in San Francisco, Wang said.Teams on climate change on both sides have been in close communication since the beginning of this year, yielding a series of practical results, he said.Wang expressed hope that the US will keep its policy stable, genuinely respect China's legitimate concerns and avoid protectionism and pan-securitization to work together with China to jointly tackle global challenges.Podesta said the US is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China, and engage in constructive cooperation on the climate issues.He said cooperation on climate change is a key component of US-China relations, concerning global multilateral cooperation.He expressed the belief that collaborative efforts between the US and China will not only benefit the two peoples but also bring more benefit to the world.China's ambassador to the United States said that the spirit of the Flying Tigers "has been, and will continue to be, a common treasure of China and the United States".Ambassador Xie Feng also said that he hopes "more Flying Tigers members of the new generation "will "write new stories of friendship and cooperation".The Flying Tigers, established in 1941 by US General Claire Lee Chennault, were officially known as the American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force. They traveled to China to assist in the defense against the invading Japanese forces from 1941 to 1945.Xie delivered his remarks via video link at the Remember the Heroes — Historical Photo Tour of the Flying Tigers (Nanjing) opening ceremony held in Nanjing Anti-Japanese Aviation Martyrs Memorial Hall, in East China's Jiangsu province. The exhibition showcases approximately 180 photographs and more than 100 cultural relics, including General Chennault's medals.Xie said the spirit of the Flying Tigers is about upholding justice and defending peace, helping each other and uniting as one, as well as valuing and renewing the two nations' friendship.He said that President Xi Jinping spoke highly of the historical contributions of the Flying Tigers in assisting China in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45) and the profound friendship forged between the two peoples.Xie said that China is still helping to search for the remains of US service members who assisted China. "To date, nearly 500 Flying Tigers veterans and hundreds of their family members have visited China nearly 80 years after the end of World War II."We welcome the Flying Tigers veterans to come back to China often, and jointly support the Flying Tigers Friendship School and Youth Leaders Program and President Xi's initiative of inviting 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years," Xie said."We expect more similar events to be held in the United States as well, to tell the story of the Flying Tigers to the public and continue enhancing exchanges between our two peoples and deepening our time-honored friendship."China also released for the first time a list of 2,590 anti-Japanese aviation martyrs from the US, most of whom were from the Flying Tigers, according to the Nanjing memorial hall.Xie mentioned "a special ceremony" for the addition of the name of Lieutenant Jack Hammel, a Flying Tigers pilot "who gave his life in China".According to the Xinhua News Agency, Hammel, a pilot from Michigan, died at the age of 23 on July 25, 1945, in China's Jiangxi province, after his fighter plane was hit by Japanese ground fire.In 2017, Hammel's family and friends visited the memorial hall but couldn't find his name. Hammel's identity was confirmed with assistance from the Chinese embassy in the United States, the Sino-American Aviation Heritage Foundation and other institutions and his name was added to the monument.John Podesta, senior advisor to the United States president for international climate policy, will visit China from Wednesday to Friday, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced on Tuesday.During the visit, Podesta and Liu Zhenmin, China's special envoy for climate change, will co-chair the second meeting of the two countries' working group on enhancing climate action in the 2020s, as agreed by the two countries, the ministry said in a media release.It was highlighted that the two sides will engage in thorough discussions regarding practical cooperation within the Sino-US working group, domestic climate policy initiatives in each country, and the multilateral climate change process.China and US reached a consensus to establish the working group during the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, aka COP26, in Glasgow, United Kingdom, in 2021.According to a joint declaration of the two countries released during the conference, the two sides will meet regularly to address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade.BEIJING -- China and the United States will hold the second meeting of the Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, according to China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment on Tuesday.US Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy John Podesta will visit China from Sept 4 to 6 and co-chair the meeting with China's special envoy for climate change Liu Zhenmin.The two sides are expected to hold in-depth discussions on practical cooperation within the framework of the working group, domestic climate policy actions by both countries, and multilateral efforts to address climate change.China and the United States launched their Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s in January 2024. The working group was initiated to implement the consensus reached between the two heads of state at their San Francisco meeting and strengthen cooperation between China and the United States in response to climate change.US manufacturers, businesses and retailers are stockpiling some imported products and parts, especially those from China, because of uncertainty over tariffs heading into the US presidential election in November.Between June and July, the peak season for retailers to build inventory for the holiday season, the volume of ocean shipments to the United States from China increased by more than 4 percent over last year, according to a report by Project44, a company that provides a digital supply chain platform for businesses.The analysis suggests retailers are somewhat nervous over the tariff policy.US President Joe Biden announced in May an increase in tariffs on more than $18 billion worth of goods from China. The duties were scheduled to start on Aug 1 but have been delayed until this month.Manufacturers have asked for the higher tariffs to be reduced, delayed or abandoned, Reuters reported.Biden raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100 percent, and on semiconductors and solar cells to 50 percent. A 25 percent tariff was put on lithium-ion batteries and cranes, while steel, aluminum and solar cells imports will also cost more.Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has not said if she will keep the existing tariffs in place if she wins in November.Charles Lutvak, a spokesperson for the Harris-Tim Walz campaign, told The New York Times that she will "employ targeted and strategic tariffs to support American workers, strengthen our economy and hold our adversaries accountable".Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has floated the idea of tariffs of 60 percent or higher on imports from China. In 2018, the Trump administration enacted tariffs between 10 percent and 50 percent on $283 billion of goods from China.China responded with tariffs of its own. A trade agreement was reached in 2019, but Biden has kept the tariffs in place and also extended them.Trump said tariffs will bring back US jobs. "We are going to have 10 to 20 percent tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years," he said in a speech in North Carolina on Aug 14.Mary Lovely, a professor emeritus of economics at Syracuse University, told China Daily, "Tariffs may create jobs in directly protected sectors, but they cause job loss in sectors that use imported intermediate and capital goods."Businesses are also aware of potential strikes at East Coast and Gulf Coast ports this fall that could affect imported goods before November, the National Retail Federation found.Most recent imports into the US arrived at ports on the West Coast rather than the East Coast as the contract between the International Longshoremen's Association and the US Maritime Alliance covering East Coast and Gulf Coast ports is due to expire on Sept 30. A breakdown in negotiations could cause strikes, the NRF said.The Port of Long Beach in California has seen a 5 percent year-on-year increase in imports and has handled 22 percent of the peak season volume so far this year, Project44 found.The California ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Oakland and Seattle-Tacoma in Washington state received more than 44 percent of all imports in June and July. The ports of New York, Baltimore and Savannah, Georgia, saw a drop.Ben Hackett, founder of Hackett Associates, a consultancy for the maritime industry, said in a statement, "Importers are continuing to grow their inventories and are shifting cargo to the West Coast as a precaution against potential labor disruptions."Freight rates are rising, too.The ports of New York and New Jersey have ordered eight cranes from China's ZPMC, costing $18 million each. A 25 percent tariff — as proposed by Biden — could push up the price by $4.5 million.Production shiftBoth the Biden administration and former Trump administration have said tariffs create more production jobs in the US and lessen the country's reliance on Chinese imports. However, some production has shifted to Mexico, Vietnam and India.Lovely, who is also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, added, "In some sectors, tariffs create no new jobs in the US, as trade is diverted to third countries rather than inducing new domestic production."Other challenges include tensions in the Red Sea region, which have caused delays and rerouting from the important global shipping route.And a drought in Central America made water levels fall in the Panama Canal, affecting shipments on that route.Jonathan Gold, vice-president for supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, told China Daily, "Retailers are consistently working to mitigate any risk to the supply chain to ensure cargo arrives in a timely manner."Monthly inbound cargo volume at major US container ports last month was expected to see a record surge, according to the NRF's port tracker. Most of the goods will likely come from China.Agencies contributed to this story.belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.comThe 22nd Washington Chinese Culture Festival began on Saturday, fostering new opportunities for diverse cultures to connect and learn from each other.The crowd often erupted in cheers during the lion dance performances, particularly when Anaje Kilpatrick, an African American, performed. Many attendees were surprised to see a non-Chinese person participating in the traditional dance.Kilpatrick has been practicing Chinese kung fu for six years. "I started with tai chi. Then I joined Wong People at the Chinese Cultural Center in Chinatown, where I began learning kung fu. Since lion dance incorporates many kung fu stances, that's how I got into it, and I love it," Kilpatrick told China Daily.Meanwhile, as China seeks to boost foreign tourism, the southwestern province of Guizhou is taking it one step further by participating in Saturday's event to promote its tourismAt the festival, Nafisa Rustan, a volunteer at Guizhou's ethnic groups workshop, told China Daily: "We are showing the different minorities of Guizhou. There's Miao (people), and there's Dong (people).And there's all the drawings and the figurines, and they all represent one of the 17 minorities in Guizhou."Rustan, who is also from an ethnic group, expressed her enthusiasm: "I just like learning about other minorities ... And I think it's also really awesome sharing the culture of the Chinese."Five workshops at the event showcased Guizhou's rich cultural heritage, including traditional batik, ethnic clothing and a photo exhibition of its scenic beauty."The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive," volunteer Zou Ying told China Daily. "Everyone is saying that if they visit China, they must go to Guizhou."Attendee Nicole He shared her surprise at seeing Guizhou's traditional batik art in person."I had seen a documentary about Guizhou's batik on TV, but I never expected to encounter it here. The colors in batik aren't always easy to get right on the first try. You need to understand the process and work on it for a long time. These materials are rare, so I was amazed to see them here in DC," she told China Daily.The most common feedback from visitors about the Guizhou workshops was that they were "very unique", volunteer Maggie Wu told China Daily. The opportunity to witness authentic culture brought to Washington had many foreign guests excited, Wu said.It was a great platform for showcasing Chinese culture, she said.As China expands its visa policies to attract foreign visitors and foster people-to-people exchanges, a Chinese culture festival kicked off in Washington on Saturday, providing an opportunity to learn more about Chinese culture and connect with the local community."The Chinese culture is deep in the heart of every Chinese, and we are glad to see it attracting more and more American friends with its inspiration and charm," Xie Feng, China's ambassador to the United States, said at the opening ceremony of the event."What belongs to a nation also belongs to the world. Culture is a bond of heart and emotion, transcending time and space. It connects China with the rest of the world."The 22nd Washington Chinese Culture Festival is now an annual event, a "friendship rendezvous" between the Chinese and US people, Xie said. Without the need to travel afar, US friends can have a taste of Chinese culture and its cuisine, he said."For kids, a must do is, of course, taking a picture with the giant panda mascot. On my way here, I met several American friends who traveled from various states for this festival. I could see their curiosity about Chinese culture, its history and profoundness."Regarding Chinese pop culture, Xie highlighted a Chinese AAA game that has gained widespread popularity, Black Myth: Wukong, based on the classic novel Journey to the West.The game's success is attributed to three key elements: the appealing character of Wukong, the timeless charm of Chinese culture and the "universal human desire for communication, cooperation and mutual learning", he said.Xie said he noticed that many players are drawn to the Chinese version for its "authentic voice acting", and some are even inspired to explore the original novel or visit locations featured in the game."After a journey to the West in the video game, why not take a journey to the East through travel in China? With open arms, China welcomes friends from across the world," he said, emphasizing a new rule that allows travelers from 54 countries, including the US, to have a 72-hour or 144-hour visa-free transit.US President Joe Biden sent a letter to the event and said "events like these represent America at its best"."By encouraging us to reflect on the ways our country's character has been shaped by the Chinese American community, you remind us of the importance of honoring and celebrating our roots no matter where they are," Biden said in his letter.The festival came on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US. Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, said that since the establishment of ties, "we have experienced peace and prosperity throughout all of Asia"."Perhaps most importantly, effective ties and constant diplomacy have led to an unprecedented half-century of peace in the Asia-Pacific region, and this is not something we should take for granted," he said.Positive dialogue and interaction are necessary between the United States and China on finance, trade and economics, instead of resorting to tariffs, an observer has said."Such dialogue leads to positive trade interactions," said Anthony Moretti, department head and an associate professor of the Communication and Organizational Leadership Department at Robert Morris University in Pennsylvania."It increases the potential for foreign-owned businesses in both nations. It carries with it the potential for good jobs for thousands of people."Moretti referred to the fifth China-US Financial Working Group Meeting held in Shanghai on Aug 15-16."There exist two parallel tracks when you think of the US and China," he said."The political track is filled with all kinds of negativity from the US. Whether it be tariffs, other forms of sanctions, dubious legislative items or the daily negative rhetoric, not much in the way of positive news comes out of that."But the business community understands how essential it is for the US and China to find ways to keep as many doors open as possible and to ensure that optimistic dialogue exists."Describing the conversation, William Pesek, a columnist focusing on global economics, politics and financial markets, called the "US-China financial stress hotline a well-timed connection" in an Asia Times article."The US and China's agreement to name point people to handle future 'financial stress events' in the world's two biggest economies and beyond could hardly be better timed," he said."This dialogue framework is the most notable deliverable from last week's meeting of the Financial Working Group created last year following US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's 2023 China visit."Nicholas Tabor, deputy assistant secretary for international financial markets at the US Treasury Department, said in a speech in June that China and the US account for some 40 percent of global banking assets, and "are the home authority to 12 of the world's 30 global systemically important banks"."The domestic financial stability of the US and China has significant implications for global financial stability, and our policies have an outsized effect on how financial risks evolve globally," Tabor said."Working directly with our Chinese counterparts can help advance many of Treasury's priorities, including our financial stability objective, our climate goals and the effectiveness of our global efforts to combat money laundering and illicit finance."The process of establishing channels of communication has progressed, but "much remains to be done", he said.Moretti said green technology is good for China, the US and the world, so it is meaningful to make efforts to "assist companies ...that create products that are cost-effective and good for the environment"." (The politicians) know that cooperation in areas such as pandemic research, overcoming food insecurity, and creating good-for-the-climate products brings positive results when China and the US are working together," he said.US President Joe Biden has touted green initiatives but also announced new tariffs on Chinese imports, including electric vehicles, amid US officials' accusations about Chinese manufacturing "overcapacity" and their concerns about "national security".'Make no sense'"If you say you believe in something, then demonstrate a real commitment to it," Moretti said, adding that the tariffs imposed by the Biden administration on Chinese EVs "make no sense"."Washington wants a healthier climate, and yet it is deliberately blocking cars that are affordable, of good quality and good for the globe from US consumers. It defies common sense to preach a message of being climate-friendly and then slam the door on one such opportunity," he said."If the US showed a commitment to long-term strategic thinking, as China has when it comes to the most modern technologies, then it would enjoy strong market share for such products."They did not. So the criticism of China for doing so is weak."Moretti said more governors and mayors are leading business delegations to China."Those local and state leaders understand that American jobs created by Chinese-based companies are as good as those from US-based companies. That is another example of win-win cooperation. We need to see more of that."For Harmon Barlow, executive director of the Kentucky Dairy Development Council, his participation in the Fourth Annual US-China Agriculture Roundtable in multiple cities in China in June "was nothing like what I was kind of expecting"."I had a lot of preconceived ideas about what to expect," he told the audience on Thursday at an online event to share his experiences. "There were times I was a little bit even apprehensive about making the trip. But it turned out to be a great experience."According to Min Fan, executive director of the US Heartland China Association (USHCA), which organized the roundtable with several Chinese agencies, the delegation visited universities, farms and agricultural-experiment stations in China. They enjoyed talking with their counterparts and also sightseeing."We had a wonderful, enlightened trip," Fan said.Barlow has been to Europe, South America and Africa and knows well the international dairy markets, including China's. The trip, his first to China, opened his eyes to other facets of the country."And China, it's amazing how they have developed their own industry in the dairy world and are using much less exports than they ever have before," Barlow said.He was amazed to see the work ethic in China."Everybody is working, everybody has something to do," he said. "There's no waste."One thing he noticed is how land is used in China. "When we were on those bullet trains, and you looked across, you saw every inch of available land was in food production. I thought that was fascinating."Barlow was also struck by other aspects of China. "I found it was obviously the cleanest and probably safest place I've ever been," he said.He said it was "fascinating" to see "practically zero obesity" in China, and "the citizens were very healthy and weren't facing a lot of the issues that is really epidemic in our country today with obesity and things like that".The trip led Barlow to realize that it is important to keep the dialogue going: "It's better to talk than to yell at each other and go through what the TVs say."For Olga Bolden-Tiller, dean of agriculture at Tuskegee University, it was also her first time in China."I think what was most enlightening for me was the conversation around how the US can partner with China to really address global food security and do so from an educational standpoint," she said."I like the model that China has with a few other organizations where they are partnering with developing countries to do work on the ground in China to really uplift a lot of their producers and some of the agricultural practices," Bolden-Tiller said.Lou Swanson, professor emeritus from Colorado State University, said he enjoyed the aspect of global citizenship from the trip. "At Colorado State University, we really think that people-to-people, student-to-student, faculty-to-faculty relationships are the core for having any kind of global citizenship," said Swanson."What this trip did — and I've taken many delegations of students and faculty to China over the years — is the people-to-people dimension."Swanson said that trade and cultural exchanges are important to avoid misunderstandings that can lead to conflict. Trips like this help people "to understand the importance, but also the precariousness, of not attending to this global citizenship", he said.China has made major technological advancements in the energy storage and electric vehicle sectors, and US companies could be at a disadvantage if US policies preclude them from cooperating strategically with Chinese companies, an expert said.In an online discussion about cooperation between the United States and China on climate change, Joanna Lewis, director of the Science, Technology and International Affairs Program at Georgetown University, said the two countries need to expand cooperation.The event on Tuesday was presented by the Center for American Progress.Lewis said political and economic tensions between the US and China are high, and that "is exactly when engagement on climate change is of the utmost importance" to avoid "derailing all the progress that we've made in our engagement with China" over the last 30-plus years.She said US engagement with China on climate change and clean energy has helped to build up China's own capacity to track and reduce its emissions, as well as its ability to promote "a low-carbon energy transition"."And today, we see that China has leapfrogged many other countries in these areas, and our bilateral exchanges have become much more of a two-way street," Lewis said. "I also see that engagement has led to increased ambition, transparency and trust between our two countries."She said US President Joe Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, which she said moved the US in the right direction of making clean energy industries more competitive globally, "may have gone too far in terms of completely excluding Chinese entities from participating in the US clean energy sector"."I think there has to be a conversation about our respective roles in global clean energy supply chains without just letting it devolve into a global trade war that will slow the low-carbon transition globally," she said.Lewis visited China this summer for the first time since the pandemic, meeting with Chinese officials and touring China's new clean energy manufacturing facilities. She said she witnessed how China is leading the world in some aspects of green technologies.She said there are ways that are smart and protect national security, but also allow "us to leapfrog and take advantage of a lot of the real impressive innovation that we're seeing coming out of China", Lewis said.She said the US should also have conversations with China on tough issues such as trade and research or it could risk derailing cooperation on climate change."We need to hit that head-on. I think it's silly to make engagement on basic science a political issue," Lewis said.President Xi Jinping has urged Washington to "view China and its development in a positive and rational light" and "work with China to find a right way for two major countries to get along".He made the comments when he met with visiting United States National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Thursday afternoon.Xi pointed out that in this changing and turbulent world, countries need solidarity and coordination, not division or confrontation, and people want openness and progress, not exclusion or regress.As two major countries, China and the US should be responsible for history, for the people and for the world, and should be a source of stability for global peace and a propeller for common development, he said.While great changes have taken place in the two countries and in China-US relations, China's commitment to the goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged, and the principle of handling the relationship based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation remains unchanged, he said.What also remains unchanged are China's position of firmly safeguarding the country's sovereignty, security and development interests and its efforts to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people, Xi added.Xi expressed the hope that the US side will work in the same direction with China, view China and its development in a positive and rational light, see each other's development as an opportunity rather than a challenge, and work with China to find a right way for two major countries to get along.Zhang Youxia, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, met with the United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in Beijing on Thursday during the US official's three-day visit to China.Zhang, China's top uniformed military official, noted that the successful San Francisco meeting between the presidents of the two countries last November and their phone call in April this year have charted a course for the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations, according to a news release from the Ministry of National Defense.He said that both sides should implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state and work towards turning the San Francisco Vision into reality.Zhang said that maintaining stability in the military security field serves the common interests of both China and the US and is a shared expectation of the international community.He expressed hope that the US would work with China in the direction of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.The senior official also urged the US to correct its strategic perception of China, return to a rational and pragmatic China policy, genuinely respect China's core interests, work with China to promote military communication and exchanges, and jointly shoulder the responsibilities of major powers.Zhang reiterated China's position on the Taiwan question.He said that the Taiwan question is the core of China's core interests, the foundation of the political basis of China-US relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US ties.China remains committed to maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, but "Taiwan independence" and the peace and stability in the Strait are mutually exclusive, Zhang stressed.It is the mission and duty of the People's Liberation Army to firmly oppose "Taiwan independence" and promote reunification, he said, underscoring that any reckless provocations by "Taiwan independence" forces will be definitely countered.The Chinese side demands that the US side cease military collusion with Taiwan, stop arming Taiwan and halt the dissemination of false narratives concerning Taiwan, according to the news release.The two sides also exchanged views on other issues, it said.Aug 22 marked the 120th anniversary of the birth of Deng Xiaoping, the late Chinese leader widely regarded as a pioneer of China's economic reforms. But his legacy extends far beyond China's borders.Deng's historic visit to the United States in 1979 stands out as a pivotal moment that reshaped China-US relations and set the stage for decades of collaboration between the two countries.In January 1979, just weeks after China and the US formally established diplomatic relations, Deng embarked on a groundbreaking visit. At that time, Deng was the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the US since 1949, so the trip carried enormous symbolic and practical significance."Deng's 1979 trip was extremely successful as he charismatically wooed Congress, the media and the American people," said the US Department of State's Office of the Historian, which has included Deng's visit in the "Milestones in the History of US Foreign Relations".Deng, then vice-premier of China and a pragmatic reformer, arrived in the US with clear objectives."Deng fully understood the importance of a conducive international environment for China's modernization, and the United States held the key for regional and global stability," said Zhu Zhiqun, a professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania."The purpose of the visit was to present to the United States a new and reforming China in the post-Mao era and to seek US support for China's modernization," he told China Daily.While high-level meetings were a key part of the agenda, the Chinese leader visited Atlanta, Houston and Seattle. In Atlanta, Deng toured the headquarters of Coca-Cola, signaling China's openness to US business. His visit to Boeing in Seattle underscored an interest in aviation technology.Perhaps most memorably, Deng donned a cowboy hat at a rodeo near Houston, creating an iconic image that humanized the Chinese leader for many people in the US. The famous photograph of Deng in a cowboy hat, which appeared in newspapers across the country, became a symbol of China's willingness to engage with the West."The visit was quite successful. The cities he went to were carefully chosen to highlight the goal of his visit," Zhu said. "During his visits to Coca-Cola and Boeing, Deng extended invitations to the US business community and welcomed them to invest in China."Ezra Vogel, the late socialist and renowned scholar on modern China, highlighted in his book Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China how Deng's visit fostered long-term US-China ties through business-oriented agreements and networking."American businesspeople who had heard Deng speak in the various cities immediately began to prepare for trips to China to explore business opportunities. Many of the 17 governors who met him in Atlanta planned delegations to China with local businesspeople," Vogel wrote.The then US secretaries of commerce, agriculture and energy also prepared to lead delegations in the months ahead to expand relations in their respective areas, Vogel said. "Members of Congress, even many who had complained about China in the past, vied to join these and other trips to China," he said.By visiting NASA and other institutions, Deng also helped establish the link between the scientific communities and encouraged scientific cooperation between the two countries, Zhu said.Deng's visit yielded immediate tangible results. On Jan 31, 1979, China signed a science and technology agreement with the US to accelerate scientific exchanges. That laid the foundation for extensive research cooperation that would benefit both countries and the rest of the world in the years to come.The 1980s, following Deng's visit, was a "golden period" or "honeymoon" in US-China relations, with "intensive cooperation between the two countries and growing US investment in China", Zhu said.The era saw rapid growth in trade, cultural exchanges and diplomatic cooperation. US companies began to view China as a promising market and manufacturing base, while Chinese students and researchers gained access to cutting-edge knowledge and technology in US institutions.The fundamental shift toward engagement and cooperation that Deng's visit represented has remained a significant factor in China-US relations, even as the relationship has experienced ups and downs over the decades.Despite the challenges, the importance of China-US cooperation in addressing global issues remains clear. As Deng himself stated during his visit, "Amicable cooperation between two major countries, situated on opposite shores of the Pacific, is undoubtedly an important factor working for peace in this area and in the world as a whole."China's ambassador to the United States said that "China's journey of reform and opening-up will never stop", which means "opportunity, opportunity and opportunity" for the US and the world.Ambassador Xie Feng also said that "cooperation is the only right choice" for China and the US."Not long ago, the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its third plenary session, which made systematic planning for further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization," Xie said."A new milestone in China's reform and opening-up, the meeting is also a gateway for the world to understand China," Xie said in the keynote speech via video at the sixth US-China Business Forum held by Forbes China on Tuesday in New York."It will both shape China's future trajectory and influence the world in a significant way," he said.Xie said that with greater depth of reform will come new opportunities for growth; with higher-standard opening-up will come new market opportunities; and with higher-quality development will come new opportunities for cooperation.He said that in the first half of this year, China's GDP grew 5 percent compared with last year, outperforming many other major economies. "This shows its resilience.""Opening-up is a defining feature of Chinese modernization," Xie said, and China is aiming "to make the pie bigger and the list of cooperation longer, so as to deliver win-win outcomes for all", which means "we will open up more doors" and "we will break down more barriers".Xie said that high-quality development is the "primary task" in building China into a modern socialist country.The newly launched Chinese video game Black Myth: Wukong is an example, he said, saying it "has recently become a global hit"."Within just one hour of its launch, its concurrent player count hit 1 million, and its collaboration merch quickly sold out," he said. "So you can see the huge consumption potential in the debut economy and also the magic of integrating traditional culture with modern technology."More than 120 people attended the forum, including US-China Business Council President Craig Allen; National Committee on US-China Relations President Stephen Orlins; the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, Sean Stein; and Hu Wei, the chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce.In his remarks, Xie also said that "scapegoating solves no problem, and trade war, industrial war or tech war produces no winner" when there are new circumstances and challenges."A major inspiration we can get from China-US relations over the past 45 years is that when we work together, both countries and peoples will fare well; but when we turn against each other, both sides and the world will suffer. Cooperation is the only right choice," he said.Xie said that China and the US need to "both expand cooperation in traditional areas including economy, trade and agriculture, and nurture cooperation in new areas such as climate change and AI, so that both our countries and the world will come out as winners".He said that "there is simply no reason" why the China-US relationship should be a zero-sum game."Tesla's Gigafactory Shanghai can now produce more than 950,000 vehicles per year, and its megapack factory there is nearly half complete just three months after construction started. Apple is ramping up its investment in China, expanding its applied research center in Shanghai and opening a new lab in Shenzhen," Xie said. "All these are evidence of the vigor of China-US business cooperation.""Our two countries can help each other succeed in a race to the top, and both develop ourselves and prosper together on this vast planet," Xie said.The ambassador noted that President Xi Jinping outlined three principles for the bilateral relationship: mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation."We are ready to work with the United States in that spirit, enhance dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, and expand mutually beneficial cooperation, so as to stabilize and improve the relationship and take it forward," Xie concluded.Beijing and Washington agreed to further roll out dialogues and collaboration involving areas such as the two nations' militaries, climate change and artificial intelligence, as senior Chinese and US officials wrapped up their two-day strategic communication in Beijing on Wednesday.Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who is also director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, co-chaired the high-level talks with United States National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.The two sides "had a candid, substantive and constructive discussion", a Foreign Ministry statement said on Wednesday.Observers said the productive Beijing meeting can help manage differences and stabilize bilateral ties in the near future. Wang and Sullivan previously held three rounds of strategic communications in Austria, Malta and Thailand.The two sides also discussed "having a new round of interactions between the two heads of state in the near future", the ministry said.They agreed to continue implementing the consensus reached at the San Francisco summit last year, and to maintain high-level exchanges and communication at various levels.As part of the meeting's outcomes, the two countries agreed to continue cooperation in areas such as counternarcotics, law enforcement and repatriation of illegal immigrants, and in addressing climate change.The two sides agreed on a number of institutional arrangements, including holding video conversations between military theater commanders at an appropriate time and convening the second round of the China-US Intergovernmental Dialogue on Artificial Intelligence."Strategic communication helps Beijing and Washington better understand each other in the context of the bigger picture, pave the way for future high-level interactions, boost progress on some specific issues and help to manage problems," said Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University's Institute of International Studies.The Beijing meeting also shows Washington's readiness to keep the ties steady during the remainder of Joe Biden's term as US president, Wu added.On the Taiwan question, Wang emphasized that China will surely be reunified. The US should put into practice its commitment to not supporting "Taiwan independence", adhere to the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, stop arming Taiwan, and support China's peaceful reunification, he said.Sullivan said the US upholds the one-China policy and does not support "Taiwan independence", "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan".On the economic front, the annual trade volume between the two countries exceeded $660 billion last year.Wang said "national security needs to have clear boundaries" and should be properly defined in the economic realm. He asked the US to stop suppressing China in the economic, trade and science and technology fields, saying that using "overcapacity" as an excuse for protectionism "will harm global green development and affect world economic growth".Sullivan said Washington agrees that the two sides should treat each other as equals, competition should be healthy and fair, and the US has no intention of decoupling from China.On the situation in the South China Sea, Wang asked the US "not to support and condone the Philippines' infringement of (China's) rights and interests".Su Xiaohui, deputy director of the Department of American Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, said, "If the US persists in perceiving China as an adversary, it will create huge uncertainty for bilateral relations, and also bring about greater risks."The two sides also exchanged views on topics including the Ukraine crisis, the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula. Regarding the Ukraine conflict, Wang said Washington should not shirk its responsibility or arbitrarily impose "illegal unilateral sanctions".zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com.cn BEIJING -- China's top diplomat Wang Yi and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan discussed a new round of interaction between the two countries' heads of state in the near future during their meeting in Beijing.The two sides agreed to continue to implement the important consensus reached at the San Francisco meeting between the two heads of state, maintain high-level exchanges and communication at all levels, and continue to carry out cooperation in drug control, law enforcement, repatriation of illegal immigrants, and climate change mitigation.Wang and Sullivan also agreed to institutional arrangements for holding a video call between theater leaders of the two militaries as well as the second round of China-US intergovernmental dialogue on artificial intelligence at an appropriate time.Shortly after United States National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan arrived in Beijing on Tuesday afternoon, he embarked on a new round of China-US strategic communication with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.In his opening remarks at the talks, Wang expressed his expectations for the two days of in-depth communication.He expressed hope that China-US relations would move in the direction of overcoming disturbances and removing obstacles, and "truly realize stable, healthy and sustainable development".Wang noted that the relationship is "vital to both countries and affects the world" and that "the past few years have been full of ups and downs".Sullivan thanked China for its thoughtful arrangements for his first China visit as national security adviser. He said that US President Joe Biden is committed to managing the US-China relationship responsibly, avoiding competition from veering into conflict, and cooperating in areas of common interest.Washington looks forward to having a fruitful dialogue with Beijing on a wide range of topics through this strategic communication and implementing the consensus reached by the two heads of state, said Sullivan.Wang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, previously held three rounds of strategic communications with Sullivan in Austria, Malta and Thailand.The strategic communications between Wang and Sullivan are part of the consensus reached at the summit between President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in Bali, Indonesia, in 2022.When disembarking his plane at Beijing Capital International Airport on Tuesday afternoon, Sullivan was welcomed by Yang Tao, director of the Foreign Ministry's Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs, who is also a veteran diplomat in handling US affairs. US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns also greeted Sullivan there.Sullivan's three-day trip, till Thursday, also marks the first visit to China by a US national security adviser since Susan Rice's trip in 2016.Speaking to Sullivan, Wang mentioned that under the strategic guidance of President Xi and President Biden, the two sides realized the Bali summit and the San Francisco summit in November."The experience therein is worth drawing on, lessons need to be learned, and the key is to pivot to the major direction of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation," Wang said, adding that implementing the consensus of the San Francisco summit "is the shared duty of China and the US, as well as the main task of this strategic communication".Teng Jianqun, professor and director of the Diplomacy Studies Center at Hunan Normal University in Changsha, said, "Since the two leaders' summit last year, the two sides have seen a recovery in cooperation in areas such as politics, the economy, diplomacy and security."Teng noted that Sullivan is a key policy assistant to the Biden administration, and his ongoing trip undertakes a series of important missions."Sullivan's China trip aims to keep afloat the good momentum of China-US interactions," he said.Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University's Institute of International Studies, noted that China-US relations are still plagued by constant friction because the US suppresses China in the areas of trade and commerce, as well as science and technology, and it keeps targeting Chinese companies."Sullivan's visit to China also provides an opportunity for both sides to discuss pressing concerns and manage differences," he said.In a recent video speech for the Second Fudan-Harvard China-US Youth Leaders Dialogue, Jing Quan, minister of the Chinese embassy in the US, noted the progress in bilateral cooperation in fields such as counternarcotics, people-to-people exchanges, the economy and trade."Over the past 45 years, the China-US relationship has kept forging ahead despite twists and turns, growing into the most important bilateral relationship in the world today," he said.An increasing number of Chinese students and tech professionals are expressing their alarm on social media about being harassed in what they described as a "small dark room" at the secondary inspection areas of immigration and border authorities in the United States. (Video)The trend has sparked heightened concerns among international students about traveling to the US, in turn fueling calls for the US to halt the revocation of legally obtained visas and stemming the disruption to people-to-people exchanges.Chinese student Chen Guo (not his real name) began his journey to Boston, Massachusetts, in 2022 after he was accepted by Harvard Medical School. However, his academic dream quickly turned into a nightmare when, on arrival in the US city, he was subjected to an 18-hour secondary inspection by US Customs and Border Protection officers.Sharing his harrowing experience on Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu earlier this year, Chen described how the officers scrutinized his emails and online browsing history and chat records.The ordeal reached its climax when they discovered a screenshot of a news photo celebrating a successful Chinese satellite launch in his digital album. Despite his legally obtained visa, Chen's entry was denied and he was unceremoniously deported."They made me stand against a wall with a measuring scale for a photo; isn't that how criminals are photographed?" Chen said. "I never thought I would face such mental humiliation."Two weeks after Chen was deported, he received a collect parcel from the US, which charged him $50 in postal fees and contained his electronic devices seized by US Customs.A Chinese employee surnamed Liu, from an international Internet company specializing in short video services, shared a similar ordeal through his WeChat public account.Liu had thought he was on a routine business trip, departing from Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on March 14, 2023.He wrote in his WeChat social media account, "Life has become increasingly simple in middle age, and a single backpack is enough for a five-day business trip across continents."However, his experience at the border in Houston, Texas, shattered his relaxed and cheerful mood after getting off the plane.A CBP officer subjected him to the secondary inspection area at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Liu's electronic devices were seized and he was interrogated for over 10 hours."They asked me if I and my company were engaged in data theft, spreading sensitive information and connected to Chinese governments," Liu said.Liu's valid visa was eventually revoked despite his role in company logistics strategy, leading to his deportation from the US and a severe blow to his career. Liu later learned from a CBP officer that his sufferings arose because his name was similar to that of a Chinese scientist.The secondary inspection area is referred to as the "small dark room" on Chinese social media, although interviewees clarify it is not literally small or dark, but labeled so due to the harassment and oppressive atmosphere.More than 30 Chinese students from computer-related fields have been subjected to unwarranted harassment, scrutiny and deportation by US authorities, according to latest accounts.Most were graduate students whose research areas included artificial intelligence, information science, cybersecurity, electrical engineering, software engineering and electronic information engineering."When the students applied for their visas, the US side would have done the necessary security background checks. That is to say, they passed the security risk screening to get the visa," said Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University's Institute of International Studies and director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University."But now even if you get a visa, it is highly possible that you can be refused entry and deported when you enter the US, which is not reasonable."Shi Yinhong, director of the Center on American Studies at Renmin University of China, said that these "absurd incidents" have been on the rise amid the escalating "China threat" rhetoric, with the US increasingly viewing China as its main competitor.Shi said that the focus on "national security" signals a rise in protectionism and underscores US insecurity about advancements in science and technology.Wu from Fudan University said the political motivation behind the phenomenon is clear — it aims to control and restrict cultural exchanges between the two countries for "national security", directly leading to a decline in people-to-people interactions.Many online discussion forums have been organized through Chinese social media platforms to address the concerns, with students sharing their educational backgrounds and internship experiences and asking whether their academic credentials might affect their visa applications and entry."For students majoring in business and data at my university, will there be issues with visa approvals? I believe my major isn't sensitive, but I'm worried that pursuing this degree might be futile," asked one forum participant."Depends on your luck," replied another forum user.Chen, the student who was heading to Harvard Medical School, advised through his social media account that Chinese students from universities identified as "sensitive "by the US should consider refraining from pursuing studies or postdoctoral positions in the country.A student surnamed Chou who graduated in 2022 from the University of California, San Diego, said the US has long claimed to be a "lighthouse of openness and inclusiveness", but its actions "run into the opposite direction"."Compared to the risk of being inspected and deported during each trip to and from the US, it is a wiser choice to pursue higher education outside the US," Chou said."We have already witnessed a significant decrease in the number of Chinese students studying in the US over the past two years, and this downward trend is expected to persist," Fudan University's Wu said.According to the Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange, while China remains the largest source of international students in the US, the total number has dropped from 372,532 to 289,526 in the past four years. India surpassed China to become the largest source of international graduate students in 2023. The proportion of Chinese students in engineering fields is also decreasing annually.A source from an overseas study consultancy firm in Shanghai said that US visa rejection rates for doctoral students in high-tech fields are notably high. Even when they are not rejected, the students face rigorous scrutiny, prompting many to seek study opportunities in other countries like Britain, Singapore and Australia or at European universities.Experts said that under the pretext of safeguarding national security, US law enforcement authorities have overstretched the concept of national security and arbitrarily interrogated and repatriated Chinese students, which has caused a "chilling effect "and seriously affected the atmosphere of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries."The US attitude toward cultural and educational exchanges might be influenced by the US election and political situation," said Wu from Fudan University, adding that the US should act responsibly and be more open and inclusive in people-to-people exchanges.In a move that could further strain China-US relations and potentially hamper technological advancement, the United States government is expected to impose new restrictions on the use of Chinese-made software in autonomous vehicles.The latest development is part of a broader trend of increasing scrutiny and limitations placed on Chinese tech companies operating in the US, raising concerns about their impact on economic ties and consumer interests.According to sources cited by Reuters, the US Department of Commerce is set to propose regulations that would ban the use of Chinese-made software in autonomous and connected vehicles in the coming weeks.The move, which is expected to target vehicles with Level 3 automation and above, will effectively prevent Chinese companies from testing their autonomous vehicles on US roads.Additionally, the proposal might seek to prohibit vehicles equipped with Chinese-developed advanced wireless communication modules from operating in the US.A US Commerce Department spokesperson said the department "is concerned about the national security risks associated with connected technologies in connected vehicles".The anticipated move of the administration of US President Joe Biden has drawn criticism from experts who argue that it prioritizes "national security" concerns over consumer interests and technological progress."This is unfortunate. It's another case of 'national security' concerns trumping consumer interests, while further harming economic ties between the two countries," Zhiqun Zhu, a professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, told China Daily.The anticipated ban could have a huge negative impact on the global autonomous vehicle industry, given China's dominance in key technologies such as light detection and ranging, or lidar, experts said.Hesai Technology, a Shanghai-based lidar enterprise with an office in Palo Alto, California, has faced increasing scrutiny in recent months. It was added to the US Defense Department's list of "Chinese military companies" earlier this year.Hesai sued the Pentagon, arguing that there was no evidence of its connection to the Chinese military. Although the company was subsequently removed from the list, the incident highlights the precarious position of Chinese tech enterprises operating in the US.Regarding the anticipated software ban, a Hesai spokesperson told China Daily that the company is not likely to bear the brunt, as it is essentially a hardware company and doesn't make software or handle data storage and transmission.While the US is considering banning vehicles with Chinese-made systems, some Chinese companies are making progress in the US market.WeRide, a Chinese autonomous tech company, recently received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission to test its self-driving vehicles with passengers in San Jose and nearby areas. This three-year permit allows the company to operate test vehicles both with and without a driver.WeRide said it is aware of the anticipated regulations to ban the use of Chinese-made software in autonomous vehicles, but declined to comment because "it is not a rule yet".The Biden administration's anticipated move is just one example of the challenges facing Chinese tech companies that are seeking to expand their operations in the US. Several other Chinese companies, particularly in the electric vehicle industry, have encountered rising suspicion of and obstacles to their US expansion plans.One notable case involved Gotion, a Chinese EV battery manufacturer, whose planned $2.4 billion factory in Michigan has faced significant setbacks.Despite promising to create 2,350 jobs with competitive wages, the Gotion project has been mired in controversy and legal disputes. Local opposition and concerns raised by US lawmakers have stalled the development plan.Zhu, the professor, argued that restrictions on Chinese investments in the US would result in a lose-lose situation for both countries."Many Chinese companies would like to expand their businesses abroad to enhance their profiles, create new markets and become more competitive globally," he said. "If they invest in the US, they will not only create new jobs for local communities here, but also offer American consumers more options of the goods and services available."Experienced Chinese construction companies could potentially help US cities and towns address outdated infrastructure, but they are being shut out due to so-called national security concerns, he said.As China-US tension continues to escalate in the technology sector, there are growing calls for a more balanced approach."The two governments need to establish some protocol on 'national security', in order to avoid political intervention in normal business dealings," Zhu said, adding that high-tech competition is good for businesses and consumers on both sides.BEIJING -- The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) announced on Saturday that Assistant to the US President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) Jake Sullivan will visit China from August 27 to 29 at the invitation of Wang Yi, Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, to hold a new round of China-US strategic communication. In a press briefing on Sunday, the leading official of MFA's Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs gave further information and took questions from the media.The leading official said that holding strategic communication between the Director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission Office and the National Security Advisor to the US President was an important consensus reached between the Chinese and US presidents at their Bali meeting in November 2022. Since the meeting, Director Wang Yi and NSA Sullivan have held three rounds of strategic communication in Vienna, Malta and Bangkok respectively, all of which were substantive and constructive, and produced good results. Both sides agreed to continue making good use of this channel of strategic communication.The upcoming visit will also be the first visit to China by a National Security Advisor to the US President after eight years, and the first visit to China by NSA Sullivan. It is an important step for the two sides to implement the common understandings the two presidents reached at their San Francisco meeting. After San Francisco, the diplomatic, financial, law enforcement and climate teams and the militaries of the two sides have maintained communication, and the exchanges between the two peoples have increased. Meanwhile, the United States has kept containing and suppressing China. And China has taken resolute countermeasures. The China-US relationship is still at a critical juncture of being stabilized.Against this backdrop, Director Wang Yi will have an in-depth exchange of views with NSA Sullivan on China-US relations, sensitive issues, and major international and regional hotspots. The two sides will jointly take stock of the progress made by the two countries in implementing the common understandings of the two presidents in San Francisco, give full play to the 20-plus dialogue and communication mechanisms that have been established or resumed, and continue to discuss the issue of strategic perception and the boundary between national security and economic activities. The Chinese side will focus on raising serious concerns, articulating its position and laying out serious demands on issues related to the Taiwan question, the right to development and China's strategic security. The Taiwan question is the first and foremost red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations, and "Taiwan independence" is the biggest risk to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The US side must abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiques, and honor its commitment of not supporting "Taiwan independence." The US side's continuous arbitrary measures against China in the areas of tariffs, export control, investment review and unilateral sanctions seriously undermine China's legitimate rights and interests. China demands that the US side stop turning economic and trade issues into political and security issues. As the foundation of the China-US relationship lies in grassroots connections, the United States should work in the same direction with China and take more measures to facilitate the flow of people between the two countries. China will also urge the United States to fulfill its responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and play a constructive role for the political settlement of major, salient international and regional issues, not the contrary.The leading official emphasized that China's US policy is consistent, which is underpinned by the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation put forward by China. These principles are the lessons learned from the 50-plus years of China-US relations as well as the conflicts between major countries in history. China and the United States should put in a lot of efforts to follow them. China has all along believed that major-country competition is not the solution to the problems facing the United States or the world.The leading official also took questions from the media. On Ukraine, the official said that China's position is aboveboard, and it will continue to promote peace talks, work for political settlement and carry out mediation diplomacy. The United States should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and stop smearing, framing, pressuring and blackmailing China. China will continue to take strong and resolute measures to safeguard its major interests and legitimate rights.On the South China Sea issue, the leading official emphasized that China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the region have sufficient historical and legal basis, and that countries in the region have full confidence, wisdom and capability to properly handle the issue. Countries outside the region should not do things that provoke confrontation or increase tensions.The leading official pointed out that on the Middle East issue, China is committed to promoting peace and justice and supports all parties in safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests, especially the restoration of the legitimate national rights of Palestine. The immediate priority is that all parties to the conflict must earnestly implement the relevant Security Council resolutions and create conditions for an early comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza. The international community should pool their efforts to this end. It is hoped that the United States will heed the voices of the majority of the international community and adopt a responsible position.Responding to the US's unwarranted accusation that China is a threat to the international order, the leading official said that China's development is an important part of human progress and an inevitable trend in the evolution of history. China does not follow the old path of Western colonization and plundering, nor the wrong path of seeking hegemony with growing strength. Nor does it seek to export its ideology. China is committed to peaceful development and win-win cooperation, and is a firm defender of the UN-Centered international system and international order, which contributes to the force for peace and the stabilizing factors in today's world.United States National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's plans to visit China next week, marking an important step for the two countries to carry out the consensus of the San Francisco summit last year, a leading official from the Foreign Ministry's Department of American and Oceania Affairs said on Sunday.Sullivan will visit China from Tuesday to Thursday to hold a new round of China-US strategic communication with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who is also director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.In Beijing next week, Wang will have an in-depth exchange of views with Sullivan on China-US ties, sensitive issues and major international and regional hotspot issues.The two sides will take stock of the progress made by the two countries in implementing the consensus reached at the San Francisco summit, and give full play to the more than 20 dialogue and communication mechanisms established and resumed in between.At the talks, Beijing and Washington will "continue to discuss the strategic perception of China and the US, as well as the boundary between national security and economic activities", the unnamed ministry official said in a media briefing.China will focus on expressing serious concerns, stating its position and making serious demands on matters such as the Taiwan question, its right to seek development and China's strategic security, the official added.This will be Sullivan's first visit to China under his current title, and will also mark the first visit to China by a US national security advisor in eight years.The recent rounds of strategic communication between Wang and Sullivan are part of the consensus reached at the summit of the two heads of state in Indonesia's Bali in 2022.Previously, Wang and Sullivan have three rounds of strategic communications in Vienna, Malta and Bangkok respectively.The talks "were substantive and constructive, and achieved positive results", and "both sides agreed to further make good use of this channel of strategic communication", the ministry official said.On overall China-US relations, Beijing has always believed that "the competition between major countries does not solve the problems faced by the US and the world", the ministry official said.Regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait, the official said the US side must strictly observe the one-China principle and the provisions of the three landmark China-US joint communiqués, and carry out its commitment of not supporting "Taiwan independence".Washington has continued to take unreasonable measures against China in terms of tariffs, export controls, investment reviews and unilateral sanctions.China asks the US to "stop politicizing and securitizing economic and trade issues" and "take more measures to facilitate people-to-people exchanges between the two countries", the official said.Beijing will also urge Washington to fulfill its responsibility as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and "play a constructive role in the political settlement of current major and prominent international and regional issues, rather than the other way round," the official said.Responding to a question on Ukraine, the official said China's position is clear and candid, and it will continue to promote peace and talks, push for a political settlement and carry out mediation-based diplomacy."The US side should stop arbitrarily imposing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and stop smearing, framing, pressurizing and blackmailing China," the official said.On the South China Sea issue, the official emphasized that countries in the region are fully confident, knowledgeable and capable of handling the South China Sea issue, and that "countries outside the region should refrain from doing things that provoke confrontation and heighten tensions".Speaking about the situation in Gaza, the official said it is imperative that all parties to the conflict must effectively implement the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and create conditions for the realization of a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible, for which the international community should form a united joint effort."It is hoped that the US side will listen to the voices of the majority of the international community and take a responsible stance," the official said.BEIJING - China resolutely opposes the move of the US side to place some Chinese entities on its export control "entity list," a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said Sunday.The spokesperson made the remarks in response to a media query on the US Department of Commerce recently putting a number of Chinese entities on its export control "entity list" under so-called Russia-related excuses.The move is a typical act of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, said the spokesperson in an online statement.It undermines the international trade order and rules, impedes normal international economic and trade exchanges, and affects the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains, the statement said.The US side should immediately stop its wrong actions, said the spokesperson, adding that China will take necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will visit China from August 27 to 29 and the two sides will hold a new round of China-US strategic communication.In a positive sign for air travel between China and the United States, Hainan Airlines has announced the launch of a new route connecting Haikou, capital of South China's Hainan province, and Seattle, starting next month.The once-weekly round-trip flight will start on Sept 26 and include a stopover in Chongqing, in Southwest China.Flight HU445 will depart Haikou every Thursday. Both the outbound and inbound flights will include a stopover in Southwest China's Chongqing municipality.The outbound flight from China will depart Haikou Meilan International Airport at 7 am Beijing time, arriving in Chongqing at 9:10 am. It will leave the Chongqing airport at 11:20 am and arrive at Seattle Tacoma International Airport in Washington state at 9 am Seattle time. The flight time is expected to be 17 hours.The return flight will leave Seattle at 11 am local time, arriving in Chongqing at 4 pm Beijing time the next day. It will depart Chongqing at 6:30 pm and arrive at the Haikou airport at 8:45 pm, for an expected flight time of 18 hours and 45 minutes.Hainan Airlines has been flying to Seattle, but via Beijing.The new route will be the first from Haikou to the US operated by Hainan Airlines. It is expected to also support the development of the Hainan Free Trade Port.In recent years, Hainan has increased efforts to resume and launch international air routes. As of May, the province had 46 overseas passenger routes, with the number expected to reach 62 by the end of this year.The flight also could contribute to Haikou's efforts to attract international talent.In June, the city issued the "Announcement on the Recruitment of Urgently Needed Talents from Foreign College Graduates for Enterprises and Institutions in 2024".The initiative aims to recruit 342 talents from among international college graduates for enterprises and institutions.Of the positions, 19 are designated for public institutions, 10 for statutory institutions, 61 for State-owned enterprises, and 252 for enterprises within the city's key industry parks.Hainan Airlines, which was established in 1993, and its subsidiaries operated nearly 1,800 domestic and international routes as of 2023.In February 2024, Hainan Airlines was awarded the "One Star Flight Safety Diamond Award" by the Civil Aviation Administration of China for achieving 10 million consecutive hours of safe flight.US-China air travel, however, is still far below pre-pandemic levels and also has been slowed due to political tensions.The number of international flights by international airlines from North America and Europe to China is down more than 60 percent this summer from the 2018 peak of more than 13,000, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing data from industry tracker OAG.Chinese airlines, however, have reduced their flights on such routes by only 30 percent since their 2019 peak, the FT reported. And they are providing twice as many flights to those routes this summer as their Western counterparts are.The US Department of Transportation approved increased frequency for US-China flights in February, allowing Chinese passenger airlines to boost their weekly round-trip US flights to 50 from 35, as of March 2024. Still, that number is only one-third of pre-pandemic levels, airlinegeeks.com reported.Editor's note: As Chinese companies move their operations to Mexico, they are not just sidestepping tariffs but also sparking a surge in local investment and job creation. China Daily looks at how international politics and economics are intertwining to drive significant shifts in manufacturing and trade.When you buy drinks from McDonald's, Wendy's, or Dunkin', the straws and cups you use are likely from a Chinese company, while the drinks are either produced in Mexico or the United States and are a product of a complex trilateral trade relationship.After former US president Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports and restricted Chinese investments starting in March 2018, the company making the cups, Fuling Plastics, began to face tariffs on many of its products.As a result, Fuling moved a factory to Indonesia. Around 2019, it also moved some production to Monterrey, Mexico. And then, Fuling opened a factory in Pennsylvania.Fuling Plastics is not the only Chinese company moving factories to North America amid rising US-China geopolitical tensions.Monterrey is the capital of Nuevo Leon, a state in Northern Mexico. Chinese corporations last year were responsible for more than 30 percent of the foreign investment in the state, second only to the US at 47 percent, The New York Times reported."A lot of our customers that are close to the border of Mexico can take advantage of competitive pricing and shorter lead times. Not only do we avoid the tariffs coming out of China, but customers within a reasonable distance of Monterrey can enjoy the same type of products manufactured in Mexico at a fairly competitive price," Tom Melchiorre, president of Direct Link USA, a joint venture of Fuling Plastics, told China Daily.The company currently has about 120 employees in Mexico operating out of a facility of 80,000 square feet (7,432 square meters), but soon it will expand to more than 200,000 square feet and about 400 employees. Only the management is from China, while all other employees are Mexican.The Ministry of Economy of Nuevo Leon reported that the state received $13 billion in investments from October 2021 to April 2023, creating 88,000 new jobs.The Mexican Ministry of Economy recorded 378 foreign direct investment announcements in 2023, worth $110.7 billion. The US led with $42.1 billion, followed by China with $11.2 billion.In 2022, China's direct investment in Mexico rose 48 percent year-on-year. Chinese companies now represent the fastest-growing source of foreign investment in Mexico.The trend of Chinese investment in Mexico started around 2019 and will likely continue as the US imposes more tariffs on Chinese products and industries.The increasing tariffs from the US have been imposed on items from China such as solar panels, electric vehicles and EV batteries, which have led to shipping costs rising about six times, Melchiorre said."When you're producing commodity products, and shipping costs rise that much, your product is now 15 to 20 percent higher. So, I think it becomes more and more attractive to manufacture in Mexico as we continue to face these challenges," Melchiorre said.Mexico's exports to the US last year surpassed China's for the first time in two decades, a development linked to the political tensions between China and the US. However, the trade relationship between China and the US is resilient, even under strained conditions.Researchers analyzed the evolution of the trilateral trade relationship between Mexico, the US and China from 1993 to 2020, and found that, in general, for every 1 percent increase in Mexico's exports to the US, Mexico's imports from China increased by 1.06 percent.Xuedong Liu, professor of economics and engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, noted that since 1993, about half of the US trade surplus with Mexico has been offset by a growing deficit with China, making Mexico a key assembly hub for North America, and China an influential player in the region's trade.Cost-effective goodsMexico chose Chinese products, not for political reasons, but for their high cost-effectiveness and the lack of substitutes from other countries, Liu told China Daily."The primary reason is that Mexico's local supply chain is not robust enough to meet all its needs. To increase exports to the US, Mexico must also increase its imports. These imports don't necessarily have to come from China; they could come from other countries," he said."However, Mexico ultimately chooses Chinese products due to their competitive pricing. This choice isn't driven by any specific policy or political measure but by market economics."Chinese products offer better value for money compared to those from other countries. If this weren't the case, local manufacturers in Mexico would opt for imports from countries like Vietnam, Indonesia or Brazil. However, these countries either lack competitive pricing or a complete supply chain for certain products," Liu added.The Joe Biden administration in July announced new tariffs on imports of Mexican steel containing Chinese components. The US will now impose a 25 percent tariff on such steel, the same rate imposed on steel from China. Previously, Mexican steel with Chinese components was exempt from duty."These tariffs that the United States put in place specifically to try to prevent metals that come from China from entering their country represent a risk for Mexican exports, because part of the exports are produced in China and not in Mexico, and in the short term, it is very unlikely that Mexico will be able to change that so those commodities are produced here," Ana Azuara, commodity markets specialist at Grupo Financiero Base, told BNamericas, an online source of daily business information and intelligence on Latin America.The tariffs were costly for Mexico, and to compensate for the economic toll, the US and Mexico agreed that steel imported from Brazil that is processed in Mexico and then exported to the US will not be subject to tariffs, Liu said."But Brazilian steel is not as cost-effective as Chinese steel. It is currently very difficult to estimate the potential economic impact on Mexico," he said."Unlike Vietnam and Malaysia, Mexico has a stronger industrial base (to manufacture its own products), especially after joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the predecessor to the USMCA, in 1994."USMCA is a free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada, which replaced NAFTA in 2018.Still, Mexico faces challenges with its supply chain, lacking intermediate and capital goods, which limits its export capacity. So, to increase exports, Mexico needs to increase imports, Liu said.Mexico is now importing more products from China which used to come from North America. In 2019, 17.7 percent of Mexico's imports in electronics such as mobile phones, auto parts and motor vehicles came from China, sectors where the US was traditionally the main supplier, according to Americas Quarterly, a nonprofit publication.Some believe that in the contest between the two major powers, the US and China, Mexico has not yet found a strategy to address the increasingly complex trilateral trade relationship. Caught between US-China trade dynamics, Mexico's relationship with China has become more politically complicated.In January 2023, the US, Mexico and Canada established a committee to substitute imports from Asia with products manufactured in North America.Before 2021, trade between China and Mexico was primarily driven by mutual benefit and market principles, Liu said.Since 2023, bilateral trade between China and Mexico "has not only been influenced by economic and market factors but also political ones", Liu said. He said that it is a new characteristic of the trade relationship.Mexico welcomes Chinese investment. In 2019, ahead of his visit to China, former Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said the country wants to deepen economic ties with China by increasing its exports and attracting more Chinese investment.Ebrard told reporters via a video link from the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in 2019 that he would be prioritizing the expansion of business ties during his visit to China."What we're interested in is increasing Mexico's presence in China, Mexico's capacity to export to China, and China's investments in Mexico," he said, according to Reuters."The structural reasons that are bringing capital to Mexico are here to stay," said Juan Carlos Baker Pineda, Mexico's former vice-minister for external trade. "I have no indication that the trade war between China and the US is going to diminish any time soon."While the Chinese origin of the capital coming into Mexico may be uncomfortable for the policies of some countries, according to international trade legislation, those products are, to all intents and purposes, Mexican," the BBC quoted him as saying.Citing examplesAn example of such products is Mexico's auto manufacturing industry. In 2023, Tesla announced plans to establish a factory in Mexico, which attracted a large number of suppliers to the country.Many of those suppliers were already producing components or raw materials for Tesla in China. The Chinese auto parts makers are rapidly setting up plants on the outskirts of Monterrey, where Tesla plans its manufacturing plant.While "Made in Mexico" is gaining ground in the North American market, Chinese companies still hold an advantage due to their stronger technical and supply chain foundations, experts said."Mexico now aims to strengthen local supply chains and increase production value, but this has been a long-standing issue. While China has invested heavily in technology and research over the past 50 years, Mexico has not, making it difficult to achieve these goals quickly," Liu said."Most of the companies going to Mexico are bringing skills that we don't currently have in Mexico," Jose Luis Enciso, business intelligence director for Keno Consulting in Beijing, told China Daily. "This will benefit us by introducing new skills and creating new suppliers. It will also benefit the Chinese investors because they will gain access to a new market and become more efficient."Meanwhile, it is not easy for Chinese companies, capital and technology to enter the Mexican market.Going to Mexico "has helped reduce lead times, which is an advantage for our customers, not having such a long lead time coming from China. You're cutting your lead time from 100 days to 30 days to two weeks. So, there are a lot of advantages to producing in Mexico," Melchiorre said.There also are some disadvantages. Resin, the raw material for Melchiorre's company's products, is more expensive in Mexico, he said. Compared with China, the cost of labor also is higher in Mexico. And shipping is very expensive, especially when the company produces and ships throughout North America."The further north we go, the more expensive and less competitive we are out of Mexico," Melchiorre said.Cultural differences are another issue for Chinese companies operating in Mexico. There are not many Latin Americans who speak Chinese, and not many Chinese who have Spanish skills and industry experience.That can lead to misunderstandings and make it difficult for companies to understand the local context, said Enciso, whose company provides consulting services for Chinese businesses entering Mexico.While Mexican companies are accustomed to working with European and US firms, integrating Chinese companies can be challenging. That is due to the need for local expertise in engineering, legal and accounting services, which also must align with the practices of Chinese companies, Enciso added.Enciso, who also served as minister counselor for trade affairs at Mexico's embassy in China, remains positive about the future development of economic and trade relations between the two countries."While we don't have a free trade agreement in place, Mexico and China have developed a very good economic and policy dialogue over the past 10 years," he said.The recent efforts to strengthen ties between China and Mexico involve multiple sectors.China Southern Airlines announced a direct route from Shenzhen to Mexico City in May, and Hainan Airlines resumed direct flights between Beijing and Tijuana and Mexico City in July.The connectivity is really going to help enhance people-to-people exchanges, Enciso said.Several major ocean carriers have opened new China-to-Mexico trade routes in recent months. At the government level, Mexican Tourism Secretary Miguel Torruco visited China in July, which led to support from both governments to continue strengthening bilateral relationships."Certainly, the global policy environment will continue to evolve, unfortunately, with more protectionist measures and security concerns. However, I believe it's only a matter of time until common ground is found to recognize the positive aspects of increasing trade and investment," Enciso said.Trina Solar US has secured $235 million in financing for its planned 1.35 million-square-foot solar plant in Wilmer, a small city about 15 miles south of downtown Dallas in Texas.The company, a subsidiary of Trina Solar, which is based in China's Jiangsu province, will use the loan to construct and operate a solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing plant.Standard Chartered, the London bank that arranged the deal, announced the "green" loan in a news release on Aug 7.Trina Solar leased the space at Tradepoint 45 West to set up a factory to manufacture and assemble high-power solar panels and PV modules, a company statement said.The plant is expected to be operating by year-end and provide 1,500 local jobs when at full capacity."We were thrilled to bring together this group of leaders and community members to celebrate our commitment to the City of Wilmer and the clean energy industry," Steven Zhu, president of Trina Solar North America, said in the company's first announcement of the factory."This facility represents a significant investment in American manufacturing that will bolster the US solar market in addition to positioning Texas as a leader in the transition to a sustainable future," he said.Jerry Wu, CFO at Trina Solar, said in a statement that the project is "the first non-recourse syndicated project financing in the United States raised by a PV module manufacturer and renewable enterprise".The factory capacity is 5 gigawatts, the company said.A recent analysis by Reuters concluded that Chinese companies will have at least 20 gigawatts of annual solar panel-production capacity on American soil within the next year. Chinese companies account for about one-fifth of the solar factories announced since the United States adopted new climate subsidies under Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act program.There are a few major solar panel projects underway by Chinese companies. Illuminate USA, a joint venture between Chinese solar equipment maker Longi and US company Invenergy, began manufacturing at a 5-gigawatt plant in Pataskala, Ohio, in February. The project is expected to employ 1,000 workers at full capacity.China-based solar cell and module manufacturer JA Solar will establish a 2-gigawatt production facility in Phoenix, Arizona. Expected to be operational by year-end, the company said the $60 million investment will create 600 new jobs.Another Chinese company, Runergy, is building a 5-gigawatt solar module plant in Huntsville, Alabama, which is creating 800 jobs.Some experts say that China's presence in solar panel production on US soil will help the domestic solar manufacturing industry mature while creating jobs."They have a lot more experience building factories and setting up supply chains," David Feldman, a solar market researcher with the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told Reuters.Zhu told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that the US market needs Chinese solar manufacturers for their technological know-how, ability to bring suppliers from China, capital, and appetite for investment.China is a leading producer of solar energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that in 2023, 407-446 gigawatts direct current of photovoltaics was installed globally, and China represented 60 percent of 2023 global total installs.While the United States was the second-largest market in terms of cumulative and annual installations, it lags with 26.3 gigawatts installed in 2023, according to the IEA.China's recent retrieval of the first-ever samples from the far side of the moon has renewed talks about the possibilities of the United States and China joining in space-based research programs aimed at addressing global challenges, particularly climate change."The US and China each have very innovative space programs, and one area, for example, where the US and China could work together today would be space-based solar," Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, and founding director of the university's Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory, told China Daily.Space-based solar power, a concept involving the collection of solar energy in outer space via satellites and its distribution to Earth, has been gaining traction globally. As countries worldwide invest in research and development for the technology, international organizations are simultaneously pushing for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.The decreasing costs associated with launching materials into space have made the idea of deploying large solar panels — which beam power back to Earth using microwaves — increasingly feasible.Kammen suggested that the US and China could challenge each other to collaborate on making space-based solar a reality.'No nighttime'He emphasized the continuous nature of this energy source: "Space-based solar is on 24/7. There is no nighttime in space."Both nations already have made significant strides in this field. In the US, Caltech's space solar power prototype, launched into orbit last year, has successfully demonstrated its ability to wirelessly transmit power in space and beam detectable power to Earth for the first time.China, for its part, has achieved a milestone in its efforts to build a space solar power station in 2022. The China Academy of Space Technology has plans for a space high-voltage transfer and wireless power transmission experiment to be conducted in low Earth orbit by 2028, as outlined in its 2022 publication in the journal China Space Science and Technology.Drawing inspiration from popular culture, Kammen referred to the movie The Martian, in which a stranded US astronaut is rescued through a joint effort between the US and China. He saw the fictional scenario as an example of how the two nations could work together in reality, combining their respective technological strengths to achieve common goals."There's an opportunity to work peacefully together in space, to show that no matter who's going to be on the moon next, we have a chance to do clean energy in space as a bridge," said Kammen."That's an exciting opportunity," he said, and stressed the urgency of doing so. "We're going to need those breakthroughs because both the US and China are behind schedule to meet their climate goals."The US has aimed to cut emissions in half by 2030, and the Chinese goal is to realize carbon neutrality before 2060.The increase in extreme weather events in recent years highlights the urgency for the world to tackle climate change together, Wang Zhen, a research professor of international politics at the Institute of International Relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told China Daily.China and the US, the two largest economies in the world, have great potential for cooperation, particularly in areas of climate change and clean energy, Wang said.China is a pioneer in clean energy development in terms of solar power and electric vehicles, while the US holds strengths in software development and artificial intelligence, reflecting strong complementarity, he said."Cooperation between the US and China will strengthen both countries and benefit the world," Wang said.During the friendly matches played on Aug 16, Shanghai Jiao Tong University's men's and women's basketball teams emerged victorious against their counterparts from New York University, drawing the curtain on the 2024 Buick Campus Invitational held at SJTU's Minhang campus. Zay Freeney, a member of the NYU men's basketball team, told China Daily that the trip to Shanghai has been nothing but a blessing for him.The United States should respect China's core interests, uphold the one-China policy, and avoid sending erroneous signals to forces advocating for "Taiwan independence," according to Sun Yafu, vice-chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.Speaking at a cross-Strait relations seminar over the weekend, Sun highlighted the complex and severe situation in the Taiwan Strait, attributing it in part to increased foreign interference, particularly by the US. He said that since 2017, the US has intensified its efforts to suppress and encircle China, including actions related to Taiwan that have significantly altered China-US relations and impacted the Taiwan Strait's stability.Sun noted that without US support, the Democratic Progressive Party authorities in Taiwan would likely be less assertive. He stressed that as the US presidential election approaches, Beijing is closely monitoring US policies on China, including economic, trade, technology, financial issues, and Taiwan.The US should adhere to the one-China policy, Sun said, and not enable "Taiwan independence" forces. He criticized the US for not opposing Taiwan's new leader Lai Ching-te's "two-state" theory, viewing it as a failure to uphold commitments to the one-China policy and non-support for "Taiwan independence."Sun warned that such actions negatively affect the peace and stability of China-US relations and the situation in the Taiwan Strait. He reaffirmed China's commitment to peaceful reunification while preparing to counter external interference and "Taiwan independence" separatism if necessary.Many Chinese students and tech professionals are increasingly expressing their alarm via social media about being harassed in what they described as a "small dark room" at the secondary inspection areas of US immigration and border authorities.The trend has sparked heightened concerns among international students about traveling to the United States, in turn fueling calls for the US to halt the revocation of legally obtained visas and stemming the disruption to people-to-people exchanges.Watch the video for more details.They are on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean, but the dynamic economic hubs of Shenzhen and Los Angeles share many similarities."Both are vibrant global cities, have large ports, which are among the busiest in the world, and possess a strong atmosphere for innovation and entrepreneurship," Peng Jing, the Chinese commercial counselor in Los Angeles, told business leaders and officials from the two cities on Friday.Peng spoke at the 2024 Shenzhen-Los Angeles Economic and Trade Exchange Meeting in the City of Industry in San Gabriel Valley, California, at which collaborative opportunities, mutual growth strategies and innovative partnerships for the two cities were explored.She noted that despite a lackluster global economic recovery and geopolitical tensions, the international community continues to share a common desire for peace, cooperation and development."The impact of the pandemic on the global economy, supply chains and businesses has not yet been fully overcome. However, globalization persists, and stakeholders in the supply chain — including enterprises from Shenzhen, Los Angeles, and other regions — have made significant contributions to China-US trade cooperation," Peng said.China and Los Angeles have maintained a robust economic and trade relationship for many years, Peng said.In 2023, China remained Los Angeles' largest trading partner, with a trade volume exceeding $147 billion, accounting for nearly 30 percent of the city's total international trade. Last year saw 246 Chinese enterprises invest in Los Angeles, creating more than 3,000 jobs and contributing an estimated $370 million in payroll.Los Angeles-based companies also have seen significant success in China. Amgen, a global biotechnology pioneer, now operates in more than 100 Chinese cities and has had seven innovative therapies approved in the country.Similarly, the footwear company Skechers, founded in Manhattan Beach, California, has grown into a widely recognized brand with more than 3,500 stores across China."We hope that both sides can further strengthen communication and collaboration, leveraging their respective advantages to deepen practical cooperation in areas such as green ports, clean energy, cross-border logistics, culture, education and tourism to make a greater contribution to local exchanges between the two regions," Peng said.Liu Junlin, executive vice-president of the Shenzhen General Chamber of Commerce, highlighted Shenzhen's status as one of China's most innovative and economically significant cities.In the first half of 2024, Shenzhen's regional GDP reached 1.73 trillion yuan ($139.6 billion), marking a 5.9 percent increase over the same period in 2023 and placing the city at the top among China's first-tier cities.Shenzhen now has 2.6 million households, and the number of domestic and foreign-listed companies there exceeds 560, ranking it among the leading large and medium-sized cities in the country, she said.Back in 2010, Shenzhen and Los Angeles signed a memorandum of cooperation, establishing a friendly exchange-city relationship. Over the years, the two cities have had frequent official visits and close people-to-people exchanges, serving as vibrant examples of friendly interactions between China and the US."We both have unique charm and value, contributing to the diversity and richness of the world," Liu said. "I hope that our two cities will further strengthen communication, enhance cooperation in areas such as economy, trade, investment, culture, sports and tourism, and build even closer ties through these exchanges."The Los Angeles business community has shown strong interest in Shenzhen and anticipates future collaboration.Joanne McClaskey, executive director of the Industry Business Council, welcomed guests to the City of Industry, emphasizing its business-friendly environment and resources."Our city is home to over 3,000 businesses, employing more than 70,000 people. We hope to see more Chinese companies come here and thrive," she said.Luis Portillo, president and CEO of the San Gabriel Valley Economic Partnership, noted the number of Chinese businesses in the region and the significance of the area's diversity in relation to its economic potential."The San Gabriel Valley, which is located in eastern Los Angeles County, is home to 31 cities," Portillo said. "We actually have eight out of the top 10 cities, with the largest percentage of Chinese Americans … located in the San Gabriel Valley. That's something that we really value."Paul Thomas, deputy-president and CEO of SGVEP, who lived in Guangzhou for more than five years, expressed his desire to foster greater business exchanges between the San Gabriel Valley and Shenzhen."We collaborate closely with many small businesses, and much of our trade activity involves Shenzhen and Guangzhou," Thomas told China Daily. "I hope to bring more businesses from San Gabriel Valley to Shenzhen, and vice versa."Both sides underscored a continued commitment to strengthening economic ties across the Pacific. The meeting was followed by a series of signing ceremonies formalizing cooperation between Chinese and American enterprises.A group of senior officials from the administration of United States President Joe Biden departed on Monday for Shanghai for another round of high-level discussions with their Chinese counterparts, to keep the economic and trade relationship between China and the US going, according to US media.They are expected to meet with Xuan Changneng, deputy head of the People's Bank of China, and other senior Chinese officials, The New York Times and Bloomberg reported.The US delegation is led by Brent Neiman, the US Treasury Department's assistant secretary for international finance, and will include officials from the US Federal Reserve and the US Securities and Exchange Commission.The talks are expected to take place on Thursday and Friday through the platform of the China-US Financial Working Group, with discussions planned on maintaining economic and financial stability.Charles Foster, vice-chairman of the George H. W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, said he welcomed the new talks."It should be self-evident to both US and China leadership that dialogues between the US and China at a high level and under the auspices of the US-China Financial Working Group benefit the two countries with the largest economies in the world," Foster told China Daily."Working successfully together in areas where both countries have mutual interests can only be confidence-building measures that may allow the US and China to work together to resolve our differences in other areas where there are significant differences between our two countries," Foster said.Neiman was quoted by US media as saying, "We intend for this financial working group meeting to include conversations on financial stability, issues related to cross-border data, lending and payments, private-sector efforts to advance transition finance, and concrete steps we can take to improve communication in the event of financial stress."The Financial Working Group was created last year, along with an Economic Working Group, and directly reports to Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Four Financial Working Group meetings have previously been held, and the Shanghai meeting will be the second to be held in China.Nicholas Tabor, deputy assistant secretary for international financial markets at the US Treasury Department, said at a symposium on the international financial system in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in June that the two countries had "begun to establish new channels for communication on financial policy" in 2023.The US and China are the two largest economies in the world and together account for some 40 percent of global banking assets, and are home to 12 of the world's 30 banks considered most important to the global system, Tabor said. "The domestic financial stability of the US and China has significant implications for global financial stability, and our policies have an outsized effect on how financial risks evolve globally," he said at the symposium.Tabor said the process of building new communication channels "has let Financial Working Group participants begin building the relationships necessary for a mutual understanding of policy, identify areas where cooperation can yield mutual benefits, and provide the space to communicate clearly about areas of disagreement."Agencies contributed to this story.Accompanied by strains of Chinese classical music and cheers from a crowd of onlookers, the San Diego Zoo's Panda Ridge officially opened on Thursday, a tribute to the remarkable achievements of China and the United States in giant panda and wildlife conservation.Officials from both nations gathered at the ceremony, celebrating the moment by highlighting the symbolism of the exhibit as a bridge between the two countries.When Chinese Ambassador to the US Xie Feng mentioned that fans in California of the two young pandas had written letters proposing that the US give China grizzly bears in exchange for the pandas, the guests at the ceremony laughed warmly.Xie noted that in November, President Xi Jinping announced in San Francisco that China is ready to continue cooperation with the US on panda conservation and "do our best to meet the wishes of the Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples"."Your dream has come true even without giving us grizzly bears," Xie told the audience members, who held traditional Chinese paper fans symbolizing good luck.Yun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived at the end of June. The first character in the name of Yun Chuan is a nod to his grandma Bai Yun, the previous superstar at the zoo, who gave birth to six cubs during her 23 years in San Diego. The first character in the name of Xin Bao means a treasure of prosperity and abundance.Xie said the arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao during the celebration of the 45th anniversary of US-China diplomatic ties has sent a clear and important message.It was another US-China exchange, only this one was not focused on weighty issues such as trade or politics but on literary scholarship.About a dozen literary scholars from China and the United States gathered at the University of Houston on Tuesday for a symposium on topics including literature and art criticism, translation, and artificial intelligence and human writing.Also featured was the book Essentials of Chinese Literature and Art Criticism Volume I. The collection of theoretical critiques penned by eminent contemporary Chinese literary and art critics offers a detailed analysis of China's view of literature and art theory, as well as critical practice from the ancient to the modern period. The book will be available to the public in November.Xu Yuechun, vice-chairman and secretary-general of the Chinese Literature and Art Critics Association, and director of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Literature and Art Criticism Center, is the book's co-editor."I hope this book will work as a bridge for the exchanges on literature critics between China and the world, and for deepening such dialogues," Xu said, adding that the book collected the best works in 2021 and 2022.The US already has a rich collection of Chinese traditional artworks, he said, and the two countries share a long history of cultural and art exchange and cooperation, with influences on both sides to inspire each other.Xu said Chinese tradition calls for "harmony in diversity" and that he hopes the book will help the world better understand Chinese scholars' literary thinking.Karen Thornber, professor of literature and East Asian languages and civilizations at Harvard University, said via video link that although she had only enough time to skim through the book, she deemed it "a wonderful opportunity for English-speaking scholars to have access to first-rate or more first-rate Chinese scholarship on a range of topics in the arts and humanities".Fundamental reasonZhang Qingmin, director of the Literature and Art Research Center at Henan University, who shared his thoughts on current Chinese literary and art criticism, said the Chinese scholars essentially presented the fundamental reason "why we view art and aesthetics 'this way, not that way'"."I believe that our American colleagues have received these messages," he said.Haun Saussy, a professor at the University of Chicago, using a 1687 Latin translation of Confucius' sayings, showed how translation does not actually reproduce an original. Instead, it produces an interpretation of an original — but in another language.Zhang said Janell Watson, a professor from Virginia Tech, "focused on the topic of whether AI brings unlimited possibilities to artistic creation or the 'death of the author', and explored how literature and art can … influence technology in the process of technological innovation and artistic development"."Many new ideas and new viewpoints presented by everyone are very inspiring for us to explore and build a Chinese literary theory and criticism discourse system from a global perspective," Zhang said.Alessandro Carrera, chair of the Department of Modern and Classical Languages at the University of Houston, shared his love of Chinese literature. Carrera said he has a collection of Chinese classics in translation, such as The Book of Changes, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The Dream of the Red Chamber.He said the first Chinese novel he read was The Chess Master by Ah Cheng, published in 1984, which he called "a short novel that really opened a world for me and made me want to read more and to look for other authors".Recalling Europe's interactions with Chinese literature, Carrera, a native of Italy, talked about Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit priest who was the first European man to enter the Forbidden City in Beijing, in 1601, and became "a great scholar of Chinese culture".SAN DIEGO, the United States - To celebrate the highly anticipated public debut of two giant pandas -- Yun Chuan and Xin Bao -- at the San Diego Zoo on Thursday, California Governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday proclaimed Aug 8 as California Panda Day.The two iconic black and white bears landed in California from China on June 27 for 10-year international giant panda protection cooperation with San Diego Zoo, marking a new round of such collaboration between the two nations.Newsom called the newly arrived panda pair "envoys of friendship" in a statement, wishing the beloved bears would lead to further exchanges and cooperation between California and China.He pointed out that San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance was the first organization in the United States to establish a cooperative panda conservation program with China."Their innovative conservation science has advanced efforts to protect and care for giant pandas around the world," explained the governor, noting that as a testament to its success, Yun Chuan, the five-year-old male panda was the son of Zhen Zhen, a female panda born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007.Newsom said the conservation collaboration is part of California and China's long history of working together toward shared goals, adding that the Golden State, the largest economy and most populous state in the United States, and China have enjoyed "strong foundation of partnership and deep cultural and economic ties".The governor also pointed out that giant pandas are beloved around the world and their conservation story is an inspiring example of strong partnerships and innovative strategies to protect the world's natural heritage."As the San Diego Zoo welcomes visitors to Panda Ridge this week, I encourage Californians to take this unique opportunity to appreciate one of the most iconic wildlife species and recognize the important partnerships at work to help them thrive for generations to come," he concluded.San Diego Zoo is one of the most visited zoos in the United States. Located north of downtown San Diego in Balboa Park, it is home to more than 12,000 animals representing over 680 species and subspecies.China's recent retrieval of the first-ever samples from the far side of the moon has renewed talks about the possibilities of the United States and China joining in space-based research programs aimed at addressing global challenges, particularly climate change."The US and China each have very innovative space programs, and one area, for example, where the US and China could work together today would be space-based solar," Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, and founding director of the university's Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory, told China Daily.Space-based solar power, a concept involving the collection of solar energy in outer space via satellites and its distribution to Earth, has been gaining traction globally. As countries worldwide invest in research and development for the technology, international organizations are simultaneously pushing for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.The decreasing costs associated with launching materials into space have made the idea of deploying large, kilometer-square, mylar solar panels — which beam power back to Earth using microwaves — increasingly feasible.Kammen, who was a coordinating lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Nobel Peace Prize-winning report in 2007, suggested that the US and China could challenge each other to collaborate on making space-based solar a reality.He emphasized the continuous nature of this energy source: "Space-based solar is on 24/7. There is no nighttime in space. And so, adding space-based solar could be beaming power to Los Angeles to Beijing, to Guangzhou to Shenzhen to San Francisco."Both nations already have made significant strides in this field. In the United States, Caltech's space solar power prototype, launched into orbit last year, has successfully demonstrated its ability to wirelessly transmit power in space and beam detectable power to Earth for the first time.Meanwhile, NASA is developing technologies that will indirectly benefit space-based solar power, including projects focused on autonomous systems, wireless power beaming and in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing, according to a NASA report early this year.China, for its part, has achieved a milestone in its efforts to build a space solar power station in 2022. The China Academy of Space Technology has plans for a space high-voltage transfer and wireless power transmission experiment to be conducted in low Earth orbit by 2028, as outlined in its 2022 publication in the journal China Space Science and Technology.Kammen acknowledged the political sensitivities surrounding such collaboration, particularly regarding data transfers and information-sharing. Despite those challenges, he saw opportunities for cooperation in other areas as well, such as fusion power.He cited the advanced research being conducted at Tsinghua University and China's fusion reactor as potential areas for joint efforts in deployment and new research.Drawing inspiration from popular culture, Kammen referred to the movie The Martian, in which a stranded American astronaut is rescued through a joint effort between the US and China. He saw the fictional scenario as an example of how the two nations could work together in reality, combining their respective technological strengths to achieve common goals."There's an opportunity to work peacefully together in space, to show that no matter who's going to be on the moon next, we have a chance to do clean energy in space as a bridge," said Kammen. Both countries have interests in lunar exploration, with the discovery of significant water ice on the moon opening up new possibilities. Potentially high-value materials on the moon, as well as resources on Mars and asteroids, present further opportunities for joint ventures that could benefit both nations while protecting their individual intellectual property, he said."That's an exciting opportunity," said Kammen, and stressed the urgency of doing so. "We're going to need those breakthroughs because both the US and China are behind schedule to meet their climate goals," he said.The US has aimed to cut emissions in half by 2030, and the Chinese goal is to realize carbon neutrality by 2060.The Chinese consulate general in New York has rarely seen so many young faces from China and the United States gather under the same roof, and those who did on Tuesday were accompanied by the shared cheers of youths from both countries for a joint music performance.The China-US joint performance gathered about 300 young musicians from the Beijing Youth Orchestra and the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America for the last musical event on the final day of New York's World Orchestra Week.What the young musicians demonstrated "is not just in the profession of music but also in the desire of human beings for peace, unity, solidarity and prosperity. It is with this spirit that I'm here to host you today", said Huang Ping, Chinese consul general in New York.The performance began with the NYO-USA playing A Western Fanfare, followed by the BYO performing the Chinese folk song A Moonlit Night on the Spring River with Western instruments. Musicians from both countries then played Going Home, adapted from Dvorak's Symphony No 9, which was also later adapted in China. The concert concluded with You and Me, the theme song of the 2008 Beijing Olympics."The China-US relationship is now the most important relationship in the world. Needless to say, we have had ups and downs over the past 45 years since normalizing our relationship, but our people remain the same, and the friendship remains unchanged," Huang said."Music and art are universal languages that transcend boundaries and bridge gaps. By watching young musicians from around the world work together, I am confident we can build a better future. I believe that if we can play together, we can work together," he said.Clive Gillinson, executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, said: "One of the most important things about music is that if you don't listen, you can't make music. One of the challenges in the world we're living in at the moment is that so many people are not listening. Everybody wants to talk. They don't agree with others."This year, Carnegie Hall brought five youth orchestras from Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America to New York for World Orchestra Week from Aug 1 to 7. Over 100 musicians from the BYO performed at Carnegie Hall on Sunday. The young Chinese musicians also attended peer exchange workshops at the Iris Cantor Theater at New York University.On Monday, all festival participants, about 700 musicians from more than 40 countries, joined a "play-in" event at New York's Jacob Javits Convention Center.'Friends for life'These young people "will remain connected and friends for life because this is an experience you never forget. It will be one of the greatest experiences of their lives. This will inform their relationships and their ability to communicate in meaningful ways throughout the future, bringing countries together in a way that maybe not all of us are very good at in today's world", Gillinson said.The BYO is a new ensemble jointly curated by China's National Centre for the Performing Arts and the Beijing Municipal Education Commission in June. NCPA President Wang Ning said that it was Gillinson who suggested that he should establish the BYO."We greatly value the friendship between the Chinese and American arts communities, which has led to many artist exchanges and collaborations," Wang said in a video speech.The youth music exchange took place after President Xi Jinping met with US President Joe Biden in San Francisco in November. Xi said that the hope of China-US relations lies in the people, and its future lies in the youth. Since then, China has been working to establish communication channels with young people in the US to promote bilateral people-to-people exchanges.The NYO-USA will visit China next year, with a return performance at the NCPA as a key part of its tour."It was very interesting to see how the diplomacy factored into the playing," Diogo Feldman, a NYOUSA member who played trumpet on A Western Fanfare, told China Daily, adding that it was really interesting to hear the musicians from China and the US play together.Many young musicians from both countries, who have become friends over the past few days, have exchanged gifts and contact information and plan to reunite in Beijing.Members of the NYO-USA "were very enthusiastic", said An Yixuan, a member of the BYO. "After we finished performing, they cheered for us. They would even come to the airport to see us off."Lyu Zening, who was one of the Chinese musicians on Going Home, said she was delighted because "I had never had such an experience".Ana Isabella Espana, a violinist with the NYO-USA, said: "To get to know these people all of the way from Beijing was such a positive experience and they are all so sweet. And to be able to collaborate together with music, it's just so special and it's great."minluzhang@chinadailyusa.comEditor's note: As the People's Republic of China celebrates the 75th anniversary of its founding this year, China Daily asked prominent international figures to reflect on their relationship with the country and to talk of the direction in which they see it going.A veteran of US-China business relations and an advocate for engagement, Ker Gibbs offers a unique perspective on the dramatic changes China has undergone over the past two decades, such as the "golden age" of cooperation and the current complexities of navigating the Chinese market.Gibbs' early years in China, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, coincided with the country's reform and opening-up to the world. He described this period as a "magical time" characterized by optimism and a shared vision of China's integration into the global economy."The atmosphere was filled with optimism and energy. Foreigners working in China saw the obvious potential if our two systems could somehow become compatible. Our Chinese counterparts were eager to learn and open to adopting new methods and management techniques," Gibbs told China Daily in a recent interview.Gibbs, then working for the Boston Consulting Group in Shanghai and San Francisco, said they shared with their local teams in China the expertise in modern business practices, such as inventory management, quality control and worker safety.Looking back, Gibbs called this period "a golden age for US-China relations", in contrast to the current environment.Acknowledging that China was "a rugged place" in those days, Gibbs said, "Living conditions were difficult and my work environment was nothing like it would have been in San Francisco or Boston, but China was fun and exciting. Every day was different, better than the last, and the optimism was infectious."Since then, he split his time between Asia and Silicon Valley, serving in executive positions with Apple, Disney, and high-growth internet businesses. He moved to Shanghai in 2002, where his career in high tech led him to banking and then to direct investments. He had served as president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai since 2019 before returning to the United States in 2022.He is now an executive in residence with the China Business Studies Initiative at the University of San Francisco, and a member of the National Committee on US-China Relations.Gibbs' firsthand experience in China is captured in his recently published book Selling to China, and upcoming work on the early days when US and Chinese people were just starting to learn from each other."That was a golden age of cooperation, although profits were thin in those early days. The growth years would come later, after China joined the World Trade Organization," he said, referring to the book he is currently working on.A co-author and editor of Selling to China, Gibbs said the book aims to refocus the conversation on the opportunities and successes that emerged from US-China commercial ties and promote continued business cooperation."The conversation about the US and China had shifted in a bad direction. The media only described the conflicts and disagreements, and people were losing sight of the incredible benefits that have been enjoyed by both sides as a result of our commercial relationship," he explained.Chinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng said on Monday the "low-hanging fruits" of reform have been reaped, and all that is left are "hard bones to chew". To live up to the expectations of the people and the world, China's reforms have to be "more targeted, systemic and comprehensive".The overriding theme of the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is "further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization", Xie said in an interview published in US media outlet Newsweek.China is at "a pivotal stage for transforming its growth model and optimizing its economic structure", he said."It is only natural that there will be some growing pains. All these issues have arisen in the course of development and transformation."The communique issued after the Third Plenary Session says China "will deepen comprehensive reform in education, deepen structural scientific and technological reform and deepen institutional reforms for talent development".In the resolution adopted at the plenum, "reform" as a keyword appeared 145 times, and "opening-up" 35 times, Xie said.The Chinese economy is facing difficulties in consumption, real estate and local government debt. To address these issues, China will "advance high-standard opening-up", he said. "We will continue to invigorate growth through reform, unleash productivity and create stronger impetus for Chinese modernization."China plans to boost economic growth by modernizing industries, developing new sectors such as artificial intelligence and biomedicine, and enhancing urbanization to drive consumer spending and investment, he said. The government will promote urban-rural integration and increase public services for rural migrants.China is adopting "a new development model for the real estate sector", Xie said. The focus is on meeting the demand for both essential and improved housing by increasing government-subsidized housing. Additionally, municipal governments will be granted more decision-making powers to regulate the property market effectively, he said.Mitigating risksTo mitigate local government debt risks, China will increase local tax revenue sources to provide more fiscal resources to the local governments. This involves reforming excise tax collection, granting greater tax management authority to local governments and expanding the use of funds from special-purpose bonds. A monitoring and oversight system will also be established to enhance debt management, Xie said.Xie said he is confident that China will meet its economic growth goal of about 5 percent this year and "also build momentum for sustainable development in the long run".The International Monetary Fund released the final report for China's 2024 Article IV consultation on Friday, saying China's economy "has remained resilient" even though the property sector is experiencing continuing difficulties.The IMF increased its growth forecast for the Chinese economy through 2024 to 5 percent, an upward revision of 0.4 percentage points compared with the projections released in the IMF's World Economic Outlook in April.This expectation aligns with China's goal, announced earlier this year, of reaching 5 percent economic growth this year.China is committed to "market-oriented reform", Xie said. The country aims to balance the roles of the market and government by allowing the market to efficiently allocate resources while enhancing government's macroeconomic governance, he said."Opening-up is the hallmark of Chinese modernization," he said. China's modernization focuses on opening up its economy by reducing restrictions and enhancing foreign investment.Key measures include shortening the negative list for foreign investments, removing market access restrictions in manufacturing and ensuring equal treatment for domestic and foreign enterprises, he said.According to a recent report by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, more than 40 percent of the surveyed foreign-invested companies see China's market as more attractive, and nearly 50 percent expect their profit margins to increase in the next five years, with US companies being the most optimistic, Xie said.Chinese media has given positive reviews on the recently concluded Third Plenary Session, while Western media has been more critical. Xie said the difference in perspectives highlights the importance of firsthand experience."Seeing is believing. The best way to understand a country is to be there," he said, highlighting China's visa-free entry to a growing number of countries and regions. Citizens from 54 countries, including the US, can now benefit from the 72/144-hour visa-free transit policy."To all American friends, you are most welcome to embark on an on-a-whim trip to China," he said.The granddaughter of US General Claire Lee Chennault, the founder of the World War II-era Flying Tigers, said he remained in China because he "heard the cries for help".When Chennault decided to stay behind and offer his services to China in July 1937, the US government threatened to revoke his citizenship if he did not return home and cease helping China.However, his compassion was unwavering and he accepted his new role as an adviser to the Chinese Air Force, said his granddaughter Nell Calloway, director of the Chennault Aviation and Military Museum in Monroe, Louisiana.Calloway recalled her grandfather's story at a recent gathering of the new generation of Flying Tigers, formerly known as the American Volunteer Group, during the 45th Anniversary of US-China Diplomatic Relations Forum hosted by Flying Tigers-friendly organizations.The celebration was held in Whittier, California, a city in Los Angeles County and the hometown of former US president Richard Nixon, as the Flying Tigers organizations aim to carry on the fighter pilots' spirit and their friendship between the two peoples.Chennault arrived in China on June 1, 1937, but it was not easy for him to stay in a foreign land as he was hard of hearing and did not understand the language."He stayed because he heard the cries for help from a people in desperate need," Calloway said. "He did not let cultural differences, political affiliation or ideology stand in the way of his humanity or serving his fellow man."When the war was over, Chennault wrote in his 1949 memoir Way of a Fighter, "It is my fondest hope that the sign of the Flying Tiger remains aloft just as long as it is needed and that it will always be remembered on both shores of the Pacific as the symbol of two great peoples working toward a common goal in war and peace."The legacy of the Flying Tigers shows how much the United States and China can accomplish together over the course of history, said US Representative Judy Chu of California.Risking lives for peace"I was so impressed that so many brave young men quit their jobs to volunteer to fight with the Chinese to protect China from her enemies," Chu told the audience. "And they weren't even an official part of the US military because the US was not yet at war with Japan, but these men were still willing to risk their lives for peace."The Flying Tigers produced 39 US aces during their brief combat history. The official tally of the American Volunteer Group at the time was 299 Japanese planes destroyed in seven months.In March 1943, Chennault, then a major general, was made the commander of the 14th Air Force, which was formed out of the China Air Task Force.When the US eventually entered World War II, thousands more went on to serve in both Asia and Europe, including another 20,000 Chinese Americans like Chu's father, who fought for the US despite facing racial discrimination at home because of the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882-1943)."For my father's whole life, he was so proud of his service to his country. Of course, I thought of him when Congress passed legislation in 2018 to finally award the 20,000 Chinese American veterans who fought in World War II with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor," Chu said.Reciprocal gratitudeAs the Flying Tigers fought alongside the Chinese people to resist Japanese aggression, the Chinese were deeply grateful for their contributions and went to great lengths to rescue and protect them.Hundreds of Flying Tigers were saved, at the cost of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians who sacrificed their lives."This is a glorious and honorable chapter written by the people of our two great nations with flesh and blood in defending world peace and justice," said Chinese Consul General in Los Angeles Guo Shaochun.In the 1970s, in a demonstration of political courage and strategic vision, Chinese and US leaders made the historic decision to reopen exchanges.In 1972, Nixon visited China, and a handshake extended to Premier Zhou Enlai crossed the Pacific, ending decades of disengagement. The two countries established formal diplomatic relations on Jan 1, 1979, which marked the beginning of a new chapter in friendly bilateral exchanges.Over the past 45 years, the China-US relationship has forged ahead despite twists and turns, growing into the most important bilateral relationship in the world, Guo said."There are so many lessons we may learn from the 45-year history. The most important one is that both China and the US gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, and working together is our only correct choice," he said. "The broadest consensus is that we should make the China-US relationship work rather than mess it up. The only right way to get along is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation."This year, efforts have increased on both sides to collect and promote the stories. Local schools, especially the alma maters of Flying Tigers veterans, have joined the Flying Tigers Friendship School program.More US teenagers are visiting China to attend Flying Tigers-themed summer camps, helping to build bridges of mutual understanding and friendship between China and the US, Guo said."This year marks the 45th anniversary of the China-US diplomatic relationship. We have every reason to carry on the friendship forged by the Flying Tigers, promote its spirit among the younger generation and inject youthful strength into China-US relations," he said.renali@chinadailyusa.comFrom July 24 to Aug 2, the 2024 Camp Gung Ho in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, brought together 46 students from seven US states and 48 Chinese students for a unique cultural exchange experience.The camp offered a range of activities designed to immerse students in Chinese culture. Highlights included crafting purple clay teapots at the Yixing Ceramic Museum, exploring local history at the Helyu City Site Museum, and enjoying adventures in Huishan Ancient Town.At the Wuxi Modern Agriculture Expo Park campsite, students were divided into five groups to participate in various courses and sports activities, working together on numerous tasks.The camp also featured special guests such as a local entrepreneur, a piano master, rap artists, and street dancers, who shared their knowledge and experiences with the participants.The camp concluded on Aug 1 with a performance showcase by each group, culminating in a heartfelt rendition of "See You Again," which left a lasting impression on all present.Reflections from the camp during their 10-day adventure included Chinese student Bu Ruitao's comment, "Despite my struggles with making the purple clay teapot, I succeeded with my friends' help, and I think that is the Gung Ho spirit.""I learned a lot from special guests, and they encouraged me to pursue my dreams. I hope we can continue to work hard and work together. May our friendship last forever," said Aurelia Niamh Thompson from the US.The 2024 Camp Gung Ho was sponsored by China Prospect Program, a public welfare promotion center in Shanghai, and the Helen Foster Snow Foundation.US chipmaker Intel, citing "geopolitical and trade tensions", saw its second-quarter business drop in China and overall while announcing a major workforce reduction to reduce operating expenses."Our Q2 2024 revenue was unfavorably impacted by the revocation of certain licenses for exports of consumer-related items to a customer in China," the company said in its 10-Q filing Thursday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Among the business risks the company cited in the forward-looking statements section of the report were "macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including geopolitical and trade tensions between the US and China".The Silicon Valley company, in Thursday's earnings release, said that it will lay off more than 15 percent of its workforce, which amounts to about 17,500 employees, by year-end and suspend its dividend. Intel's quarterly revenue was  $12.8 billion, down 1 percent year-over-year.Intel also has been picked to receive billions of dollars in federal government subsidies under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act — which is aimed at competing with China.The company has struggled to compete in artificial intelligence, while other US chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have done well. Intel's lagging position in the market for AI chips has contributed to its shares falling more than 40 percent this year, Reuters reported."Share loss and structural shift from traditional CPU-centric compute to AI-accelerated continues to weigh on Intel," wrote Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer, reported Barron's.Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, is in the middle of a turnaround plan aimed at developing advanced AI processors and expanding its for-hire manufacturing as it looks to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSCM), the  largest contract chipmaker in the world."Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we've yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low," CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a memo to staff Thursday.In July 2023, at the Aspen Security Forum, Gelsinger noted that China represents 25 percent to 30 percent of semiconductor exports."If I have 25 percent to 30 percent less market, I need to build less factories," Gelsinger said. "You can't walk away from 25 to 30 percent and the fastest-growing market in the world and expect that you (continue) funding the (R&D) and the manufacturing cycle that we've released."CFO David Zinsner said on an earnings call Thursday that the chipmaker expects weaker consumer and enterprise spending in the current quarter, especially in China.Intel shares closed at $21.48 on Friday in Nasdaq trading, down $7.57, or 26 percent.The White House, in an Aug 9, 2022,  "fact sheet", said that the CHIPS and Science Act would provide $52.7 billion for American semiconductor research, development, manufacturing and workforce development.In addition to the CHIPS Act, the US also has restricted exports by American tech companies to China.Export licenses that were revoked in May also hurt Intel's business in China in the second quarter, Zinsner said. Intel warned in May that its sales in China would suffer after Washington revoked some of the export licenses for a customer there.The New York Federal Reserve, in an April research paper, wrote: "Amid the current US-China technological race, the US has imposed export controls to deny China access to strategic technologies. We document that these measures prompted a broad-based decoupling of US and Chinese supply chains."Once their Chinese customers are subject to export controls, US suppliers are more likely to terminate relations with Chinese customers, including those not targeted by export controls," the paper said. "However, we find no evidence of reshoring or friend-shoring."As a result of these disruptions, affected suppliers have negative abnormal stock returns, wiping out $130 billion in market capitalization, and experience a drop in bank lending, profitability and employment."In an opinion piece in the New York Post on Friday, conservative economics commentator Stephen Moore and free market analyst Phil Kerpen wrote: "Intel was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the CHIPS Act, receiving an $8.5 billion grant announced in March, a $25 billion sweetheart tax incentive and likely the lion's share of an $11 billion federal loan program."This CHIPS Act was supposed to be the Biden-Harris crowning achievement. A giant job creator," Moore and Kerpen wrote. "Hundreds of billions of government handouts to bring the semiconductor industry back home. Now, it's looking like the Titanic."On March 20, in an appearance in Chandler, Arizona, US President Joe Biden said: "I'm thrilled to announce the latest public-private partnership and one of the largest investments in semiconductors in the United States ever: the landmark — a new landmark agreement under the CHIPS and Science Act between my administration and Intel for up to $8.5 billion. It's a smart investment."And that's being paired with over $100 billion from Intel, including $30 billion in Arizona and $30 billion in Ohio," he said. "It's among the largest private-sector investments ever in the history of Ohio and in Arizona.The Washington Post reported on Friday, however, that Intel has yet to receive the funds, and a Commerce Department spokesperson declined to say whether Intel's announcement Thursday would affect the grants.Agencies contributed to this story.China and the United States have taken another major step forward in antinarcotics cooperation, with both sides pledging shared efforts in response to global drug challenges during the first senior officials' meeting of their Counternarcotics Working Group.At the meeting convened in Washington on Wednesday, both sides reviewed progress in bilateral counternarcotics efforts, including cooperation regarding relevant cases, technique exchanges, multilateral cooperation and clearing up of online advertisements, Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday.They also had exchanges about their respective concerns and clarified the direction of cooperation going forward.Both sides agreed to further strengthen dialogue and communications, and deepen counternarcotics cooperation on the basis of "respecting each other, managing differences and conducting mutually beneficial cooperation".During its visit to the US, the Chinese delegation had bilateral exchanges with a number of US authorities, including the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.It will also have in-depth discussions over key cases with front-line investigators of the US Drug Enforcement Administration's San Francisco office.According to a readout released by the White House, the meeting was attended by Wei Xiaojun, director general of the Narcotics Control Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, who led the Chinese interagency delegation, and Jennifer Daskal, US deputy assistant to the president and deputy Homeland Security advisor.The meeting came about six months after China and the US launched the Counternarcotics Working Group, one of the many common understandings that the two countries' heads of state reached at their summit in San Francisco in November.The talks also focused on accelerating the scheduling of synthetic drugs and precursor chemicals, addressing the illicit diversion of precursor chemicals and exchanging information on emerging threats, the readout said.US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said on his X account that the CWG meeting is part of "critical cooperation" that "can save lives".Beijing and Washington have so far held several rounds of high-level talks on antinarcotics cooperation, with the Chinese side reaffirming its commitment to strengthening bilateral and multilateral antinarcotics exchanges and cooperation.Wang Dong, executive director of the Institute for Global Cooperation and Understanding at Peking University, said the counternarcotics meeting is important in terms of delivering on the consensuses between the heads of state and stabilizing bilateral relations.China and the US share common interests in drug control, Wang said, adding that it's necessary for the two countries to expand their common interests and effectively manage their differences.This year, China and the US have maintained exchanges in narcotics control, with a recent engagement being State Councilor and Director of China National Narcotic Control Committee Wang Xiaohong meeting with visiting White House Director of National Drug Control Policy Rahul Gupta in Beijing in June.Wang Dong said the US' "narrow and hegemonic mindset" will hamper its antinarcotics cooperation with China and called for Washington to correct its "misperception of China's strategic intentions", adding that the two sides should keep up exchanges in various sectors to gradually rectify misperceptions.China and the United States agreed to enhance cooperation to tackle the global drug issue during the first senior officials' meeting of their Counternarcotics Working Group.At the meeting convened in Washington on Wednesday, both sides briefed each other about the latest progress made in their anti-drug work, including substance control, cooperation over relevant cases, technique exchanges, multilateral cooperation and clearing up of online advertisements, Xinhua reported.They also had exchanges about their respective concerns and clarified the direction of cooperation.Both sides agreed to further strengthen dialogue and communications and deepen counternarcotics cooperation on the basis of "respecting each other, managing differences and conducting mutually beneficial cooperation".During its visit to the US, the Chinese delegation had bilateral exchanges with a number of US authorities, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy of the White House.The delegation will also have in-depth discussion over key cases with front-line investigators of the US Drug Enforcement Administration's San Francisco office.In a world riddled with political and economic competition, it remains universally acknowledged that cultural appreciation forms the cornerstone of international understanding. Despite current tensions between the United States and China, the currency of soft power — based on cultural understanding and mutual respect, especially among young people — can bring about peace and prosperity.Following President Xi Jinping's invitation to 50,000 American youths to visit China over the next five years, China's central and provincial governments are bolstering efforts to give them opportunities for engagement with Chinese society, realizing the strategic value of cultural familiarity.Short-term exchange programs for students and intensive Mandarin language courses, for instance, improve language skills and foster a sophisticated understanding of China's long history and diverse cultural heritage.The one-week immersion program that Duke Kunshan University and Jiangsu province developed for 70 students from Duke University and other American colleges powerfully exemplifies this investment in mutual understanding. This initiative, which will take place in August, promises to be an exciting voyage through the cultural, historical and economic strongholds of Nanjing, Suzhou and Shanghai — cities that have witnessed China's remarkable present and the ebb and flow of the country's storied past.Short-term exchange programs apparently have the potential to improve understanding. However, a Harvard Business Review insight — a customer retained is several folds less costly than a new one acquired — suggests that investing in US students already enrolled in full-time degree programs in China could be more advantageous and economically cost-effective.Schools such as DKU are trailblazers in providing a global-oriented degree education in a Chinese setting, giving students a global outlook and the capacity to prosper in a multicultural society. Immersed in China's educational and cultural environment, international students have the potential to become genuine ambassadors of cultural understanding, bridging gaps through their first-hand accounts.As the executive vice chancellor of DKU, an English-speaking, research-oriented liberal arts and sciences university located just outside of Shanghai, I am quite familiar with the powerful results that these kinds of exchanges can deliver.Consider the case of Peter Ballentine, an American student of the DKU Class of 2022. DKU prides itself on having a truly international campus community, with about 30 percent of its student body being international. International students account for no more than 20 percent of all students at most other universities. While attending DKU, Ballentine made friends with students from all over the world and worked together with his professors and fellow students on everything from the curriculum to the school's culture, which gave him invaluable experience collaborating with people from different cultural backgrounds. After graduation, he received funding from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program of the United States for his work with a Duke University research team and is currently pursuing a PhD in electrical engineering at Columbia University.By observing the success stories of Ballentine and many of his peers, it becomes clear to me that it is imperative to establish more incentives, such as scholarships, for American students to enroll in degree programs in China, live here, learn about its transformation into the second-largest economy in the world in merely four decades, something unprecedented in human history, and recognize the complexity of its culture.It becomes even more urgent that more Americans can study full-time in China, especially considering that the number of Chinese students studying in the US far exceeds that of American students in China. That is a challenge not only for China but also for the US, regardless of whether the US considers China a major rival or a potential partner in solving global problems. This disparity suggests that Chinese students and likely future leaders of China are far more knowledgeable about the US than Americans are about China.Of course, cultural exchanges, which go beyond student exchanges, include organizing academic and business conferences that emphasize global issues like public health and environmental conservation. As the two biggest economic powers, China and the US can use such forums to advance initiatives that prevent pandemics and address climate change.In addition, China's history, culture and 59 UNESCO World Heritage sites remain huge attractions to many Westerners. More accessible or visa-free agreements may inspire more Americans to travel to China more than once by showcasing attractions beyond Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an.Linguistic proficiency is also essential for cultural diplomacy. More accessible Chinese-language training at institutions in the US will allow American students to engage more deeply with Chinese culture and ideas, building enduring appreciation and relationships.Not to be overlooked is the role of sports and performing arts in diplomacy. Friendlies in soccer and basketball, along with global tours from institutions like the New York Philharmonic, convey heartfelt exchanges that create lasting memories for participants and spectators alike. As with the symbolic Ping-Pong Diplomacy 40 years ago, such events spawn friendships beyond the realm of politics. China's adorable envoys, the giant pandas, also have a unique role to play, as they transcend language and politics to generate goodwill and improve conservation.In summary, the key to overcoming geopolitical tensions lies not necessarily in grand gestures but in a constant flow of cultural exchanges across a wide range of fields, including language, art, education, sports and wildlife diplomacy. Every little bit helps. Every single person-to-person interaction counts. By improving cultural understanding at the individual level, the US and China can develop a spirit of cooperation that is the best guarantee of long-lasting peace.The author is executive vice chancellor and distinguished professor of social science at Duke Kunshan University and the John deButts professor of practice at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business.A Chinese organization dedicated to promoting international trade and investment between China and foreign businesses expanded what it called its "circle of friends" in Washington on Tuesday, a move that a United States trade group sees as a positive sign for bilateral trade.The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, founded in 1952, works to strengthen the bonds between Chinese and foreign businesses and advances international economic and trade exchanges.The organization, which opened an office in Maryland in 1988, moved to a new location in the US capital on Tuesday, sharing the same building with the US Chamber of Commerce. Around 130 business representatives from about 60 US companies and 40 Chinese companies attended a reception held to mark the opening of the office.Chinese Ambassador to the US Xie Feng noted that the CCPIT hosted delegations from the US Chamber of Commerce in February, and from the US-China Business Council in July."The representative office of CCPIT has served as an important bridge and bond (for) Chinese and American business activities. It has played an important role in strengthening bilateral economic and trade relations," Xie said.Tuesday's event followed the conclusion on July 18 of the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which highlighted expanding market access in various sectors and promoting an open economic system to benefit global cooperation."The session has made the arrangements for opening-up, including steadily expanding institutional opening-up, broadening market access and effectively protecting the legitimate rights of foreign investment companies," Xie said.He emphasized that the plenum represented "a clear signal of China's commitment to expanding a high-level opening-up".China "will continue to forge a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based and international, offering even greater opportunities for businesses from all countries," he said.Xie told the business representatives that "we welcome you to continue the investment and business ties with China, to share in the dividends of this high-quality development"."This will bring benefits to both our two peoples and help the two countries to embark on the right way to get along in the new era under the principle of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation," he said.A delegation from the board of directors of the US-China Business Council visited China last week.Ren Hongbin, chairman of the CCPIT, along with a delegation of about 50 Chinese business representatives, made a reciprocal visit this week.In the first half of 2024, bilateral trade between China and the US grew 2.9 percent year-on-year, and the number of US companies investing in China increased by more than 20 percent in that same period, with the amount of actual investment doubling, according to Ren.He said that the two countries' industrial and supply chains are deeply integrated. In November, companies from the US sent the most exhibitors of any foreign country to the China International Supply Chain Expo, the world's first national exhibition focusing on supply chains.Cliff Seagroves, principal deputy director of the Office of Foreign Missions of the US State Department, said he was pleased to see the CCPIT's new location finally opening in the heart of Washington."We're confident that this space will help bridge the gap between US and China and strengthen our economic cooperation for both US businesses and Chinese businesses," he said.Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, said the opening of the new office is a positive sign for returning to a growth track, increasing trade and investment and benefiting the people of both countries.Charles Freeman, senior vice-president for Asia of the US Chamber of Commerce, said: "We're living in the age of small yards and high fences.…It's up to the business communities to move past all the frictions and the challenges and really implement what is at the heart and soul of the US-China relationship, which is the people-to-people relationship."There is no question in my mind, whenever someone asks, are the United States and China, are we actually going to enter into some real conflict? I say no. Because the relationship between people is so strong and so permanent that I think it can overcome," he said.The Chinese delegation visited New York on Monday, continued to Washington, DC, and Maryland on Tuesday, and will go to Seattle, Washington, next.A national agency promoting international trade and investment between China and foreign businesses "expanded its circle of friends" in the US capital on Tuesday, a move that an American trade group sees as a "positive sign" for bilateral trade relations.The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), founded in 1952, is an organization that strengthens the bonds between Chinese and foreign businesses and advances international economic and trade exchanges.The agency, which opened a representative office in Maryland in 1988, moved to a new location in Washington on Tuesday, sharing the same building with the US Chamber of Commerce. Around 130 business representatives from about 60 US companies and 40 Chinese companies attended the opening reception.Chinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng noted that in February and July, CCPIT was the agency hosting delegations from the US Chamber of Commerce, and then the US-China Business Council."The representative office of CCPIT has served as an important bridge and bond within the Chinese and American business activities. It has played an important role in strengthening bilateral economic and trade relations," Xie said.Tuesday's event followed the July 18 conclusion of the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China."The session has made the arrangements for opening-up, including steadily expanding institutional opening-up, broadening market access and effectively protecting the legitimate rights of foreign investment companies," Xie said.He emphasized that it represents "a clear signal of China's commitment to expanding a high-level opening-up".China "will continue to forge a world-class business environment that is market oriented, law based and international, offering even greater opportunities for businesses from all countries," he said.Xie told the business representatives that "we welcome you to continue the investment and business ties with China, to share in the dividends of this high-quality development"."This will bring benefits to both our two peoples and help the two countries to embark on the right way to get along in the new era under the principle of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation," he said.A delegation from the board of directors of the US-China Business Council visited China last week.Ren Hongbin, chairman of the CCPIT, along with a delegation of about 50 Chinese business representatives paid a reciprocal visit this week.In the first half of 2024, bilateral trade between China and the US grew by 2.9 percent year-on-year, and the number of US companies investing in China increased by more than 20 percent over the same period the previous year, with the amount of actual investment doubling, according to Ren.He said that the industrial chains and supply chains are deeply integrated between the two countries.

About 515 companies from 55 countries, including more than 50 Fortune Global 500 companies, sent their CEOs to the expo.Jonathan Webb, CEO of Packable, formerly Pharmapacks, told reporters at the forum that the company is the largest seller on Amazon and Walmart in the US, shipping 60,000 to 100,000 orders a day."We're here to connect with people who can help us integrate into the Chinese infrastructure, such as Temu and TikTok," Webb said.China is crucial "because 90 percent of everything sold online comes from there", Webb said, adding that the US market has "a huge appetite" for Chinese-manufactured goods, from selfie sticks to EV charging stations.All of those goods are being manufactured in China and brought to the US, said Webb, but "everyone is nervous about the tariffs. We need to figure out how to mitigate these issues."Continuous cooperation between the US and China is essential for maximizing global supply chain benefits, he said.Furthermore, "working with China creates jobs in the US" and stimulates the local economy, Webb said.If tariffs are increased, many US innovators that manufacture in China might have to move to other countries, which could affect supply chains, he added.Participants at Monday's forum also included Huang Ping, consul general of the Chinese consulate general in New York, and Peter Tichansky, president and CEO of the Business Council for International Understanding. More than 300 representatives from Chinese and US businesses and trade communities also attended.A delegation from the board of directors of the US-China Business Council visited China last week after the third plenary session concluded on July 18. The delegation included FedEx President and CEO Raj Subramaniam, United Family Healthcare founder Roberta Lipson, Boeing Global President Brendan Nelson and Educational Testing Service CEO Amit Sevak.Promising market potentialChina's market potential offers huge opportunities for cooperation, as the country imports $2.5 trillion worth of goods and services annually and ranks second in attracting foreign direct investment, said Huang, the consul general.He noted that the recent plenary session highlighted expanding market access in various sectors and promoting an open economic system to benefit global cooperation."Fighting against each other is not going to lead us anywhere. So I really hope that we can seize this opportunity of China's continued reform and opening-up policy," Huang said. "This momentum allows us to strengthen our relationship and do business together. Both countries, and the whole world, will benefit from this."Ren, head of the Chinese delegation, said: "Under current circumstances, the common interests between China and the US are increasing instead of decreasing. Whether in traditional areas like trade and agriculture, or emerging areas like... artificial intelligence, companies in both countries have shared interests and broad cooperation prospects."Sun Xiao, secretary-general of the China Chamber of International Commerce, said, "We aim to convey the important new openness measures established at the plenary session to the American business community and look forward to hearing their responses and demands."Supply chains were in the spotlight on the first day at a forum as a Chinese business delegation made a reciprocal visit to the United States after the conclusion of a major government session in Beijing.The delegation was the first to visit the US after the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. An American business delegation visited China last week.Lin Shunjie, chairman of the China International Exhibition Center Group Ltd, told China Daily that many foreign entrepreneurs have expressed a desire to restore and perfect their global supply chain layouts, which they believe "cannot be done without China", he said.

We will lift restrictions on the market while ensuring effective regulation, striving to better maintain order in the market and remedy market failures".The government "will continue to provide guidance and support for industry supply chains, while the private sector drives growth and innovation". That strategy has already been successful in the electric vehicle and battery sectors, and China plans to extend it to key areas such as semiconductors, medical equipment and machine tools, Lee said.China has a major economic goal to lift per capita GDP to that of a mid-level developed country by 2035, and to reach that target, China's economy would need to grow at about 4.5 to 5 percent annually, she said.According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on July 15, China's economy grew by 4.7 percent in the second quarter of the year after 5.3 percent growth in the first quarter."It's clear to me from the third plenum document that the Chinese leadership has decided that to sustain this level of growth, China needs systemic upgrading along the global value chain, not just short-term stimuli," Lee said.Bert Hofman, an honorary senior fellow on Chinese economy at the ASPI's Center for China Analysis, said the document is "about high-quality development, the high-standard socialist market economy as being the tool for this Chinese modernization".Hofman saw a consistent policy on the supply side. He said that the policy is about significantly increasing investment in science and technology and integrating it with industrial policy. The goal is to use various tools to link current and future technologies with high-quality productive forces.Hofman also said that one of the most important points of the third plenum is the reaffirmation of a key principle acknowledged by the third plenary session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 2013: that the market plays a decisive role in allocating resources.He said that he believes that the government-market balance is now even stronger than in 2013.Although this principle wasn't mentioned in the communique, it is reiterated in the resolution, emphasizing the need to leverage the market's role, he noted.The plenum clearly recognizes the fiscal problems in China, particularly at the local level due to issues in the real estate sector, he said.There are promises of tax and transfer reforms, centralizing expenditures and improving budget management. The resolution provides a clearer framework and direction for addressing those issues, he added.The more than 200 people who gathered in San Francisco to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the establishment of China-US diplomatic relations heard insights from China's ambassador to the United States and exchanged ideas on maintaining stable ties between the two countries.Ambassador Xie Feng, in a recorded speech played at Saturday's event at the Hyatt Regency, called the establishment of the China-US relationship in 1979 not only "a milestone in China-US as well as international relations", but also "a significant event that benefited the two nations and contributed to world peace and prosperity".Bilateral trade has since grown more than 200-fold, accounting for one-fifth of global trade; two-way investment has topped $260 billion, he said.Xie said that more than 5 million people traveled across the Pacific every year before the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that the two nations have worked together to combat terrorism, financial crises and climate change and assumed responsibilities on almost all global challenges."The relationship has grown into one of the most deeply intertwined bilateral relationships with the broadest areas of shared interest and cooperation," he said.While he detailed the positives, Xie also told the audience that antagonism harms both sides while partnership benefits all.The root cause for the ups and downs over the past few years is that the US side looks at China as its main competitor, said Xie, and some even refer to China as an "existential threat"."Containment and regime change, typical in the Cold War years, are short-sighted and dangerous, as pointed out already by many fair-minded people," he continued."The key is to manage differences properly, not allowing them to dominate the relationship," Xie said.The ambassador also noted that "decoupling leads to nowhere, and we need to work together to win-win results".More than 70,000 American companies are sharing in the dividends of China's development, with exports to China supporting 930,000 American jobs, according to Xie."If the US really gets 'disadvantaged', how is it possible for cooperation to have lasted for 40 to 50 years? Is it really in the US interest to focus solely on containing China, even at the cost of abandoning free trade, market principles and the spirit of contracts?" Xie asked."Trade war, industrial war and tech war have no winners. Decoupling will not bring the wanted results," he continued. "Statistics show that ending the permanent normal trade relations with China would lead to a $1.6 trillion economic loss for the US."Amy Tong, secretary of Government Operations in California, moved from China's Guangdong province 40 years ago with her family to the Golden State.She said her father, now in his mid-80s, is still active in the Chinese community. "Why? Because I do feel it's very important to continue to provide insight and leadership in fostering mutual understanding and cultural exchanges to build the bond (between the two countries)."California Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Tong to lead people-to-people exchanges with China."Facing the most critical juncture between our two nations, the California government has added people-to-people exchanges to the workload in addition to climate change and economic exchange with China," she said.Jin Lan, president of the Oregon-based China Council, recently celebrated with friends from home and abroad the 20th anniversary of his grassroots organization.In two decades, Lan and the council have sponsored conferences, exhibitions and seminars to bolster people-to-people exchanges and have hosted delegations from various parts of China.Lan told China Daily that while many US politicians have an "adverse perception of US-China relations" now, "We will foster a more nuanced culture of grace between the peoples of America and China."Academic and scholarly interaction is a major component of the exchanges, said Scott Rozelle, an economic policy researcher and professor at Stanford University.As the co-director of the Stanford Center on China's Economy, Rozelle led his students through his Rural Education Action Program to conduct research and study trips in China."Among the most productive research collaborations in all academia — including science, technology, engineering and mechanics, and social science and humanities — is between scholars in the US and China," Rozelle told China Daily."The number one relationship that is behind the China-US relationship is the China-US academic exchanges. It's us (scholars) really behind the inventions, new technologies," he said.Chinese scholars and students also frequently visit the US, giving lectures to increase research enthusiasm and strengthen collaboration."We will always be great friends as long as we continue our people-to-people relations," said David Haubert, Alameda County supervisor for District 1. "If you go there (China), you will understand."Haubert has been to China 16 times in 10 years and visited 25 cities. "The hospitality of Chinese people is overwhelming," he said.Amid accumulating risks and challenges in relations between China and the United States, Beijing has again urged Washington to return to a rational and pragmatic policy toward China and to properly manage their differences, in order to promote a stable, healthy and sustainable bilateral relationship.During a meeting in Laos on Saturday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned that the bilateral relationship is at a critical juncture and needs to be stabilized, requiring managing risks, properly handling differences, eliminating disturbances and promoting cooperation.Wang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, also reiterated China's position on the Taiwan question, which is at the very center of China's core interests. Beijing has said on many occasions that the Taiwan question is the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations.Wang emphasized that "Taiwan independence" is incompatible with peace across the Taiwan Strait. "We will counter every provocation by the 'Taiwan independence' forces, keep narrowing the space for 'Taiwan independence', and work toward the goal of a complete national reunification," he said.The meeting took place at the request of the US side on the sidelines of a series of meetings of the foreign ministers of Southeast and East Asian countries in Vientiane, the capital of Laos.It also came as China-US relations continue to be mired in a situation in which the US does not refrain from moving to contain and suppress China, although the diplomatic, financial, law enforcement and climate teams of the two sides, as well as the two militaries, have maintained communication in the past three months.Blinken's stop in Laos was part of his visit to multiple Asian nations, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore and Mongolia.In June, the US State Department approved arms sales to Taiwan, including drones and missiles, for an estimated $360 million, a move that Beijing criticized, saying that Washington was sending a serious, erroneous signal to separatist forces seeking "Taiwan independence".Furthermore, on July 12, US President Joe Biden signed into law the so-called Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act, which China considers to be another manifestation of the US practicing hegemonism, manipulating the rhetoric of democracy and freedom, and interfering in China's internal affairs.During a news conference at the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting held in Brazil on Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she would press China to address the country's macroeconomic model that has led to what she called "overcapacity".Beijing criticized Yellen for engaging in a political show to shift the blame for the US' domestic problems to China, saying that the real purpose behind the US' hyping of China's so-called new energy "overcapacity "is to contain China's advantage in the new energy industry.Wang told Blinken that China's policy toward the US has always been consistent and follows the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.He criticized Washington for adhering to the wrong perception of China, and said China is not the US and does not want to be. He also said that China does not seek hegemony or power politics and, as a major country, has the best record on peace and security.During the meeting, Wang also urged the US not to stir up trouble and undermine maritime stability regarding China's Ren'ai Reef in the South China Sea.He said that China has reached a temporary arrangement with the Philippines to manage the situation, and the Philippines should honor its commitments to refraining from sending construction materials to its illegally grounded vessel at China's Ren'ai Reef.Both sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis, the situation in Gaza, and the Korean Peninsula, among other matters.On the Ukraine crisis, Wang said that China's position is fair and transparent, and it will continue to promote peace talks. He urged the US to stop abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction.China rejects false accusations and will not succumb to pressure or blackmail, and it will take resolute measures to protect its major interests and legitimate rights, Wang said.Blinken said Washington is committed to stabilizing US-China relations and adheres to the one-China policy.The US looks forward to maintaining regular communication with China for cooperation on anti-drug efforts and artificial intelligence and in other fields, he said, adding that the US is willing to manage differences with China to avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations.Both sides agreed to maintain communication at all levels and further implement the important consensus reached at the San Francisco meeting in November between the two heads of state.A generally stable China-US relationship is indispensable for the peaceful development of the world, and it is vital to value peace and put a foundation of no conflict and no confrontation under that relationship, Beijing's top envoy in Washington has said."When we choose peace and solidarity, a war, either cold or hot, will not break out. And when we choose openness and cooperation, global development and prosperity will have greater hope," Ambassador Xie Feng said on Thursday.The envoy made the remarks at a reception at the Chinese Embassy in the United States to celebrate the 97th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China.The event highlighted the PLA's commitment to fostering cooperation and peace with the global community.In his remarks, Xie noted that next year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory in the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations, of whose Security Council the two largest economies are permanent members."Major-country conflict and confrontation is not a distant memory, and the original aspiration of the UN to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war must not be forgotten," Xie said."Major countries shoulder critical responsibilities for global strategic stability," he added.Differences between China and the United States are no cause for alarm. What is vital is that they should not let differences define the bilateral relationship, nor should they amplify differences or intentionally create new ones."We need to responsibly manage differences, and handle any accident in a prudent way, so as to maintain the overall stability of the relationship," Xie said.The ambassador said China does not bet against the United States, and will not interfere in US domestic affairs, including its elections."Likewise, the US side should not suppress China's development, interfere in China's domestic affairs, or exploit China-US relations in this election year," he said. "The right thing to do is to jointly explore the right way to get along in the new era."He further noted that it is also important to uphold credibility and step up exchanges and cooperation."China and the United States need to honor their commitments to each other with action, faithfully implement the two leaders' common understandings, strengthen dialogue in a mutually respectful way, and advance cooperation in the spirit of mutual benefit, to turn the San Francisco vision into reality," he said.The future-oriented San Francisco vision was jointly outlined by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden during their summit meeting in San Francisco last November."It is hoped that the US side will work with China in the same direction, to stabilize and improve the bilateral relationship in the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, with a sense of responsibility for the people, for the world and the future," Xie said.Fern Sumpter Winbush, the US Principal Deputy Director for the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, said it was "heartwarming" to hear the ambassador talk about peace and tranquility and cooperation between the two nations."We have our challenges, we have our history. But we (are) really focused on the future and moving forward together in a cooperative way," Winbush told China Daily."I think the more that our leaders talk face to face, the more they have an understanding that peace is more important than war," she said.Winbush's remarks were echoed by Sherwood (Woody) Goldberg, a retired US Army Officer."We need to tie China and the United States together politically, economically, socially, trade-wise, and military, So we do not have a Cold War," Goldberg, now the Senior Advisor to the Foreign Policy Research Institute Program on National Security and associate professor at US Military Academy, West Point.He said that people in both countries and the world want peace, stability, and prosperity; and that more military talks are needed, as well as people-to-people relationships through cultural exchanges."Certainly, no one is a winner when there's a conflict," he added.He also said that the US should take the commitment to China seriously."We need to be very careful. We need to keep our commitments so that we are trusted," Goldberg said.Thursday's reception was attended by more than 300 guests, including US government and military officials, diplomats and military attachés of other countries, and representatives of overseas Chinese communities and Chinese institutions in the US.A river dialogue between Shanghai and New York was held on Friday, aiming to increase cooperation across economic and trade, cultural exchange, waterfront development as well as other key areas of mutual interest of the two cities.With the theme Common Ideals and Common Future, the event promoted discussion between government officials, business leaders and urban experts from the two global metropolises through three-panel discussions on economic and trade cooperation, cultural exchange and sustainable waterfront planning.The Huangpu River for Shanghai and the Hudson River for New York have both witnessed the development and transformation of the cities, and these metropolitan areas blessed with waterways will help deepen ties between the East and West, said Sha Hailin, president of Shanghai Public Relations Association.Zhou Hanmin, president of the Shanghai Public Diplomacy Association, mentioned that Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng and New York City Mayor Eric Adams signed a letter of intent for friendly cooperation in May, ushering in this new chapter of partnership."This exemplifies the vital roles our cities can play in promoting positive China-US relations through cooperation in areas like trade, technology, culture, urban development, environmental protection and people-to-people ties," Zhou said.He Weiwen, former economic and commercial counselor at the Chinese Consulate General in New York, noted the resilience of bilateral trade despite tensions."No matter how strained China-US relations become or how severe trade frictions are, after a few quarters of decline, bilateral trade will rebound from the bottom up — a very flat growth curve over the long run. This is the reality underpinned by industrial complementarity and market-driven motives of enterprises in both countries to trade with each other," said He.Chinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng told representatives from the US political, business and academic communities that China and the US should complement each other and promote stable, sustainable relations.The ambassador delivered a keynote speech on Monday at the "Global Opportunities in Deepening China's Reform in the New Era", part of the Global Dialogue Series session held in New York on Monday.Xie said the ups and downs in the China-US relationship over the past few years show that "dialogue, cooperation and stability are better than confrontation, decoupling and volatility"."With the bilateral relationship coming to a crucial stage of restabilization, we must cherish what has been achieved and meet challenges ahead," Xie said.He stressed that for the good of the two nations and beyond, "China and the United States need to complement each other, progress together and promote the sound, stable and sustainable development of the bilateral relationship under the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation."Xie's speech was delivered shortly after the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which concluded on July 18.He called the session a "blueprint" for further deepening reforms comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization.He said the meeting was a "step forward in China's consistent reform efforts and its pursuit of Chinese modernization".Xie noted three signals from the meeting: "Efforts to further deepen reform will be more systematic and integrated, the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics will be further refined, and Chinese modernization will embrace broader prospects."The meeting will unlock three categories of opportunities: market opportunities generated by deepening reform, growth opportunities from all-out innovation and cooperation opportunities from high-level opening-up," Xie said.China's annual imports of goods and services amount to $2.5 trillion, Xie said. In the first half of the year, new foreign enterprises in China increased by 14.2 percent year-on-year, he said.Chief executives from US companies such as Goldman Sachs, Starbucks and Nike have visited China recently to witness the country's pace of opening up, Xie said.The envoy also said China would deepen reform, which would "generate market opportunities for the world". Xie said China would upgrade market mechanisms and improve intellectual property rights protection, information disclosure, market access and accountability."We will ensure that companies of different ownerships are treated as equals in terms of accessing production factors, competition and legal protection," he said. "We will further eliminate market barriers, clarify market rules and optimize the market environment."The Global Dialogue Series session was held by China Media Group, or CMG.Those who gave speeches at the session also included Shen Haixiong, the vice-minister of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee and the president of CMG, Robert Lawrence Kuhn, chairman of the Kuhn Foundation, and Stephen Kennedy Smith, board member of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. Nearly 100 guests from diverse US communities attended the event.It was an occasion to celebrate the personal experiences of the sister-city relationships over the years.Alix Nathan, president of the Portland-Suzhou Sister City Association in Oregon, said at the sixth US-China Sister Cities Summit on Friday in Tacoma, Washington state, that one of the most crucial aspects of the exchanges and relationship with sister city Suzhou, in East China's Jiangsu province, is in education."For more than 20 years, Portland has been using and working with schools in the US and Suzhou to facilitate reciprocal school-to-school bilateral group programing for students," Nathan told China Daily.His association has assisted in the effort by spending a minimum of one week visiting each other's classrooms, city attractions, parks and museums, as well as spending time with host families."Obviously, during the pandemic, many of these programs were shut down," he said. "However, now we're very excited to rekindle this relationship, as we have many schools restarting their activities to promote American students from Portland going to China, with more than 12 schools now enlisted in activities to foster exchanges in the coming year."During the summit, a delegation of 13 students from the Affiliated High School of Fuzhou Institute of Education in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian province, arrived in Tacoma for an 11-day educational exchange program."Besides the beautiful country and the delicious food we had, making friends and talking to people was the best part," Izabell Saldana, a 12th grader at Lincoln High School in Tacoma, said of her multicity trip to China last month. "I do believe that this is absolutely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."Celeste Nunez Salcido, director of international business resources for the New Mexico Trade Alliance, was the US fellow during the 2023 Gansu International Fellowship Program organized by the Gansu provincial government.The fellowship convenes professional candidates from around the world to learn about Gansu's and China's economic development efforts, cultural heritage, language and history to promote mutual understanding and peaceful cooperation.Salcido's participation in the program marked the first exchange opportunity between Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Lanzhou, Gansu province, since the pandemic."Here, every one of you is a citizen diplomat," she said in her speech at the end of the summit. "Every one of you has the ability and power to strengthen these friendships that lead to cooperation."She said cooperation is important for the shared challenges of the future."The US and China are the top two global economies. This is not going to change in the near future. And that means that we need people to understand each other," she said.Yang Wanming, president of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, told China Daily it will launch a youth exchange program next year, inviting and organizing trips for 1,000 US high school and university students aged 16 to 22 to China."Through a seven-to-10-day visit, students will experience a real, multidimensional and comprehensive China. They will become young ambassadors for promoting Sino-American relations," Yang said.Openness leads to progress while isolation brings stagnation, said Chinese Ambassador to the US Xie Feng in his keynote speech at the "Global Opportunities in Deepening China's Reform in the New Era" Global Dialogue Series US session on Monday. He emphasized that China's openness will provide much-needed stability and certainty in a turbulent world.The experiences of China-US relationship in the past few years tell us that dialogue, cooperation and stability are better than confrontation, decoupling and volatility, said Chinese Ambassador to the US Xie Feng in his a keynote speech at the "Global Opportunities in Deepening China's Reform in the New Era" Global Dialogue Series US session on Monday.Locality exchanges between China and the United States can help stabilize bilateral relations by addressing the challenges and opportunities ahead, participants at the sixth US-China Sister Cities Summit said.The two-day summit on Friday and Saturday, themed "Shared Visions for a Brighter Future", was co-hosted by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, or CPAFFC, and Sister Cities International, or SCI, of the United States.Featuring keynote addresses, panel discussions and case studies, the summit brought together more than 300 representatives from 14 Chinese provinces and 21 US states.Chinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng, who delivered remarks at the opening ceremony via video, said that sister cities serving as bridges for mutual understanding and trust have injected vigor into China-US relations.In 1979, Hubei province and the state of Ohio became the first sister province/state, and Nanjing and St. Louis, Missouri, forged the first sister-city relationship, marking the start of friendly exchanges at the locality level.Forty-five years later, China and the US have produced 286 pairs of sister relationships at different levels.Xie said the bilateral relationship is still facing "grave challenges" and encouraged joint efforts to improve the relationship."As China and the United States celebrate the 45th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year, it is hoped that all participants will continue participating in and supporting sister-city cooperation and make greater contributions to turning the San Francisco vision into reality and ensuring the stable, sound and sustainable development of China-US relations," he said.The envoy encouraged the participants to seize the historical opportunities unleashed by China's openness and development, tap the large potential of China-US subnational cooperation based on complementarity, and promote common development for the wellbeing of the two peoples.US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns also gave congratulations at the summit."Sister cities' relationships spur investment, expand exchanges in education and culture and encourage people to learn more about their counterpart cities through tourism," said Burns. He said that "it is heartening" that so many Americans and Chinese are gathering in Tacoma for 'reinvigorating and expanding the people-to-people connections"."Sister provinces/states and sister cities are important platforms for promoting mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and the United States and important windows for deepening exchanges and cooperation for mutual benefit and win-win results," said Yang Wanming, president of the CPAFFC, at the summit.Symbol of friendship"The city of Tacoma and the state of Washington are the symbol of friendship between the people of China and the United States."Tacoma, a port city about 50 miles southwest of Seattle, was an important witness to China-US friendship.In 1994, with the personal commitment of President Xi Jinping, then Party secretary of Fuzhou, the Chinese city and Tacoma became sister cities. In 2015, President Xi made a special trip to Lincoln High School in Tacoma during his US visit.Tacoma Mayor Victoria Woodards, who returned from a trip to China two weeks ago, said her delegation visited many Chinese cities, including Fuzhou in Fujian province and Ningbo in Zhejiang province.Woodards said she was excited to welcome the same people she recently met in China."I truly believe that if we work together to address the challenges and opportunities ahead, we can create a bright and prosperous future for all our communities," she said.Joe Vinatieri, mayor of Whittier, a city in Southern California, expressed his excitement about participating in the summit in a post on Facebook."I'm excited to speak at this week's 6th US-China Sister Cities Summit about the benefits of Whittier's partnership with Changshu (Jiangsu province), which aims to foster economic development, cultural exchange, and cooperation between both cities," he wrote.Tourism from China has declined since COVID-19, and interactions have dwindled."We want to encourage people to come. We haven't done anything with them recently," Vinatieri said. "I want to see what we can do to reestablish the relationship and have them come over here."In March, Jesse Armendarez, a member of the Board of Supervisors of San Bernardino County, California, visited Wuxi, Jiangsu province, for the second time.He was there to celebrate Wuxi International Month and to establish a sister-city relationship."Our friendship cities with China and San Bernardino County have been vital to helping us promote business, education and culture," Armendarez told China Daily.China setting high-quality development as its top mission at the recent Third Plenary Session is "entirely correct", experts say."The transition from high-speed growth to high-quality development is both timely and necessary," Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Institute for China-America Studies in Washington, said.Anthony Moretti, department head and an associate professor in the Communication and Organizational Leadership Department at Robert Morris University in Pennsylvania, said: "That's what China needs to move its economy forward. That's what the world needs to ensure it can get its hands on better goods, and likely at an affordable price."The Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China concluded on Thursday in Beijing. Attendees discussed the economic landscape, proposed reforms and outlined key economic policies moving forward at this high-level meeting held every five years."It was stated that high-quality development is our primary task in building China into a modern socialist country in all respects," the session's communique said.Gupta said no economy, without abundant natural resources and which had transitioned from middle-income to high-income status, has managed to do so without shifting focus from "extensive growth "based on quantitative increases in land, labor and capital to "intensive growth" driven by overall total factor productivity gains."To realize a high-quality development framework, China must continue shifting to a more balanced economic structure driven by consumption and services-led growth," he said." (China should) continue moving toward high-standard international openings that organically combine the domestic and international cycles. It (should) continue upgrading its industrial structure to a more science- and technology-led advanced manufacturing ecosystem. The emphasis on new quality productive forces cuts across these domestic, international and S&T (science and technology) domains."The communique mentioned "reform" more than 50 times. Moretti said this emphasis underscores China's philosophy of shifting from exporting large volumes of cheaper goods to exporting higher-quality products suitable for 21st century consumers and beneficial for the climate.Gupta had expected six priorities at the Third Plenary Session: building out the science and technology new innovation system; preventing major economic and financial risks; calling for high-level liberalization, high-standard liberalization and opening-up to the world; balancing reform and development with economic security; promoting common prosperity; and transitioning to a greener and cleaner China and a low-carbon economy.He said the meeting and the communique "for the most part, seem to meet expectations"."Indeed, four of the six key areas of reform — reforming and deepening of the S&T ecosystem; deepening high-level ... opening-up; accelerating integrated rural-urban development; and sound macro regulation, effective governance and controlling risks — were listed at the front end of the communique," he said.Brighter outlookRecent data from China's National Bureau of Statistics revealed a 5 percent year-on-year GDP growth in the first half of the year, with the secondary industry expanding by 5.8 percent. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund updated its World Economic Outlook on Tuesday, forecasting China's economy to grow by 5 percent this year, a 0.4 percentage point increase from its April estimate."There is no doubt that there has been an improvement in business sentiment, which is in no small part owed to the many large and small business operating environment reforms undertaken by (the government) over the past year," Gupta said, emphasizing the importance of government support on the demand side of the economy while continuing to deepen these reforms.Chinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng told nearly 300 participants at the opening ceremony of the sixth China-US Sister Cities Summit that over the past 45 years, the relationships "have nurtured goodwill between the two peoples and injected vigor into China-US relations".Speaking via video link on Friday, Xie extended congratulations on the successful convening of the summit in the port city of Tacoma, Washington.The event brought together representatives from 14 Chinese provinces and 21 US states. They exchanged insights and discussed common challenges affecting both nations.Xie said China-US sister-city relationships have continued to grow, noting that there are 286 pairs of sister provinces/states and sister cities.In 1979, Hubei province in Central China and the state of Ohio became the first sister province/state, and Nanjing and St. Louis, Missouri, forged the first sister-city relationship, marking the start of friendly exchanges at subnational levels.Xie said that China-US relations are still facing grave challenges and encouraged all to pool their strength to improve the relationship."As China and the United States celebrate the 45th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year, it is hoped that all participants will continue participating in and supporting sister-city cooperation and make greater contributions to turning the San Francisco vision into reality and ensuring the stable, sound and sustainable development of China-US relations," he said.Xie shared three proposals for boosting subnational cooperation.He encouraged the participants to seize the historical opportunities unleashed by China's openness and development, tap the large potential of China-US subnational cooperation based on complementarity, and promote common development for the well-being of the two peoples."Rick Snyder, former Michigan governor, had visited China eight times, more than any other US governor. With the visits, he brought back Chinese investment of $1.2 billion and more than 6,300 jobs for the state," Xie said."Today, China is the top export market for three US states, in the top three markets for 32, and in the top five for 43. Such subnational cooperation is mutually beneficial and has yielded fruitful outcomes," the ambassador said.He said that China just held the third plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee in Beijing, sending a strong message of further deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernization.He said there are new challenges facing subnational exchanges."In recent years, the so-called 'political correctness' of being tough on China has been spreading in the United States, casting a chilling effect on sister-city cooperation and subnational interactions," Xie said. "But the friendship between our two peoples is deeply rooted in our long history of exchanges. Neither setbacks in bilateral relations nor headwinds against people-to-people connections will ever change the fundamental wish of our peoples for friendship and cooperation."Since the start of last year, more than 10 subnational delegations from the United States have traveled to China, and more than 30 delegations from Chinese provinces and cities have visited the United States.Xie said all the trips have helped stabilize the China-US relationship, and he encouraged the two sides to conduct more visits, contacts and exchanges, "so that drop by drop, they can thaw the ice of misunderstanding and ultimately form a vast ocean of friendship between the two peoples".Xie stressed the importance of adding new dimensions to sister-city relationships and said that from trade in agricultural products like soybeans and lobsters, to subnational climate action for green and low-carbon growth, and to smart-city building and the innovation economy, China-US sister-city cooperation is happening on diverse platforms and in increasing areas.The ambassador continued: "We hope our sister cities will further enrich their cooperation in more forms. For instance, they are most welcome to be part of President Xi Jinping's initiative of inviting 50,000 American teenagers to China for exchanges or study in the next five years, to explore cooperation between the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the San Francisco Bay Area and the New York Bay Area, and between the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the Mississippi River area, and to hold events such as the China-US Agriculture Roundtable and the China-US Bay to Bay Dialogue. In this way, we can further expand and grow our sister-city relationships."US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns also sent his congratulations to the summit."Sister cities' relationships spur investment, expand exchanges in education and culture, and encourage people to learn more about their counterpart cities through tourism," said Burns. He said "it is heartening" that so many Americans and Chinese are gathering in Tacoma for "reinvigorating and expanding the people-to-people connections".The sixth China-US Sister Cities Summit, themed "Shared Visions for a Brighter Future", was co-hosted by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) and the Sister Cities International (SCI) of the United States.CPAFFC President Yang Wanming, SCI Chair Carlo Capua, Consul General of China in San Francisco Zhang Jianmin, and Tacoma Mayor Victoria Woodards attended the opening ceremony. Washington state Representative Derek Kilmer and others sent congratulatory letters.A summer study program inviting students from prestigious universities in the United States to explore China concluded on Thursday, strengthening cultural exchange and friendship between Chinese and American youth.Dozens of American students from top institutions such as Harvard University, the University of Chicago and Cornell University participated in the 2024 China Deep Dive Program with Peking University students to attend lectures and visit multiple cities in China in different batches starting late last month.The program, hosted by PKU, is part of China's initiative launched in November to invite 50,000 young people from the US to visit the country and experience exchanges and study programs over the next five years.A total of 44 American students and several Chinese students set off last week on a route involving Beijing, Xi'an in Shaanxi province, and Chengdu in Sichuan province, to gain a deeper understanding of the country's development and cultural heritage.Nicholas Ludford, a student from the University of Minnesota, said he was impressed by the architecture in Xi'an, which combines traditional and contemporary aspects of China, while he also enjoyed the spicy food in Chengdu.Majoring in global studies and having learned about "fluctuations in China-US relations", Ludford said he was thankful to have the opportunity of visiting China and was "overwhelmed by the warmth of Chinese people"."I'm feeling optimistic about the future of the two countries and glad to meet so many Chinese people. The program deepens my understanding about China," the 20-year-old said.Braumon Creighton, a student of economics and anthropology at the University of Chicago, made a plate of three glutinous rice balls each with an image of a giant panda during the trip to the Sichuan Cuisine Museum in Chengdu on Tuesday.With 10 students at the university, he visited scenic spots including the Sanxingdui Museum in Guanghan and the Dujiangyan base of China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda."I'm most impressed by two high school students who showed how to change faces (an art of Sichuan Opera) in the Qingchengshan Senior High School. I've taken many photos and will show them back home," he said.Leo Glasgow, a junior from Cornell University, was excited to take a photo of a giant panda in Chengdu. "I am so lucky. I have never seen them so close," he said.After visiting pedestrian streets in the style of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and BYD's largest new energy vehicle plant, Glasgow said the exchange program has given him a deeper understanding of China's traditional culture, economic development and openness to the world. "China is an ancient yet modern and vibrant country," he said.On Thursday, Zhi-Xing China: US-China Youth Leaders Dialogue, an event hosted by PKU and China Education Association for International Exchange, was also held at the university.Zhi-Xing refers to the ancient Chinese philosophy of "Zhi Xing He Yi," or "unity of knowledge and action", conveying the organizers' hopes that the young visitors from the US can get a deeper understanding of China while traveling around the country.PKU president Gong Qihuang said the university will continue to promote China-US educational exchanges."We will strengthen dialogue and cooperation with partner universities in the US, and foster mutual understanding between the youth of the two countries," Gong said at the event.Vice-Education Minister Chen Jie encouraged US students to seize the opportunity for an "immersive experience" in China, which allows them to obtain a comprehensive view of the country.The open and friendly younger generations of China and the US represent the hope for the development of both nations and the future of Sino-US relations, he said.Peng Chao in Chengdu and Qin Feng in Xi'an contributed to this story.Contact the writers at zhaoyimeng@chinadaily.com.cnThe San Diego Zoo announced on Friday that the eagerly anticipated public debut of the giant pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, who arrived from China earlier this summer, will take place on Thursday, Aug 8. These pandas are the first to enter the United States in 21 years."We are delighted to introduce Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to our San Diego Zoo community," Paul Baribault, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, said in a statement. "Our newest residents will bring joy to our visitors and symbolize the enduring spirit of international conservation efforts. Together with our partners, we continue to make significant strides in ensuring a hopeful future for this iconic species."Yun Chuan and Xin Bao have been at the zoo for 21 days. After this period of adaptation, both giant pandas are in excellent condition and have adjusted well to the food in the US, according to Huang Shan, breeding expert and director of the Animal Management Department at the Dujiangyan Base of the China Giant Panda Conservation and Research Center."Our feeding team has also prepared steamed buns and a variety of bamboo for them. Currently, there are six types of bamboo that our giant pandas really like, so both pandas are now very well adapted," Huang told China Daily.Experts from China and the San Diego Zoo have collaborated on feeding exchanges, promptly documenting their opinions in writing and forming necessary procedures, including feeding protocols and training guidelines. Many of these guidelines are formulated into written rules for implementation, according to Huang.Since their arrival in late June, the panda pair has been acclimating to their new home in the reimagined Panda Ridge space, which is four times larger than the zoo's previous panda habitat. It was inspired by famous geological formations in China and emulates mountains, canyons and cliffs and features new shade trees for climbing, a diverse array of plants, and rolling hillsides, allowing Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to navigate and explore vertically.Ling Shanshan, veterinary expert, director of the Disease Prevention and Control Department at the China Giant Panda Conservation and Research Center, said she appreciates the "lush and full of vitality" new panda enclosure provided by the San Diego Zoo."The enclosure features wide slopes, climbing frames, and thriving vegetation, creating a natural and comfortable new home for the pandas. Additionally, the bamboo landscaping not only provides food for the giant pandas but also offers an ideal space for them to play," said Ling.Yun Chuan, a male nearly five years old, is identifiable by his long, pointy nose. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. Xin Bao, a nearly four-year-old female, is best recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears.The Zoo offers three ways for guests to experience the giant pandas. Visitors can obtain a complimentary Giant Panda Timed Ticket or join the standby line on the day of their visit. Additionally, guests can reserve an exclusive 60-minute early morning panda walking tour. renali@chinadailyusa.com"Please bring my song back to your home" (a line from "Song and Smile…", a popular Chinese youth song) — hundreds of US and Chinese students sang together at the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC at an art exchange gala to mark the 45th anniversary of China-US diplomatic relations on Tuesday.The Beijing Golden Sail Art Troupe, composed of teachers and students from Beijing 101 Middle School and Zhongguancun No. 3 Elementary School, as well as students from the Chinese embassy's Sunshine School and 14 American schools from around DC, jointly presented cultural performances, showcasing that the future of the China-US relationship lies in the youth. More than 400 people attended the event.Minister Jing Quan delivered remarks at the event. He said that since China and the United States established diplomatic relations 45 years ago, the two peoples have enhanced mutual understanding and friendship through exchanges. In particular, youth exchanges have played an important role. In San Francisco last November, President Xi Jinping announced that China is ready to invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years. Since then, many young American students have eagerly embraced the opportunities to experience China firsthand. They were amazed by China's culture and long history and marveled at China's progress in green transition. He encouraged the students attending the gala to understand each other better and become friends.From yarns and fabrics to finished garments and home products — each stitch connects China's textile industry to the world.This week, more than 500 Chinese companies are displaying their latest innovations and sustainability efforts at a major industry event at the Javits Center in New York City.The 25th China Textile and Apparel Trade Fair, Texworld New York City, Apparel Sourcing New York City, and Home Textiles Sourcing Expo New York City are participating in the three-day exhibition at the sprawling convention center in Manhattan, which started on Tuesday.It primarily focuses on two major themes: "Future Trends" and "Sustainability". More companies are joining the eco-friendly movement; 137 Chinese companies have environmentally friendly certifications, about 29 percent of participants.The semiannual exhibition is jointly organized by the Sub-Council of Textile Industry, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and Messe Frankfurt North America.More than 700 enterprises from 22 countries and regions will converge in an exhibition area of more than 21,500 square feet (20,000 square meters).Long lines formed in the registration area, made up of buyers from the textile and apparel industry, including retail giants Target, Macy's, Walmart, JCPenney, Athleta, American Eagle and Ralph Lauren.Chinese companies also featured those companies' logos at their booths, indicating who buys their products."We have participated in this exhibition for more than a decade. The biggest change we've seen is the gradual upgrading of the Chinese textile industry," said Sheng Wubin, CEO of Ningbo Mondiland Fashions, a maker and distributor of men's suits and coats."We are now producing more advanced products, with faster response times in product development, higher technical requirements and superior quality," Sheng told China Daily.The company has annual revenue of $30 million, with markets in the Americas, Europe and Japan."Ningbo is the hometown of tailors. Our local industry integrated with the development of Ningbo and Shanghai very early," he said. "In the 1920s and 1930s, we introduced many Italian, Japanese and German suit-making technologies and equipment into our garment town, forming a complete system."Sheng said that the company's greatest strength "lies in our understanding of different markets and meeting their stylistic needs with significant changes and improvements"."Ningbo's strong supply chain has also provided us with substantial support," he said. "We hope to see Chinese diplomats wearing suits designed and made in China on the international stage."Zameer Syed, the operational director of SNS Fashion Ltd, noted that speed of delivery and fabric innovation are strengths of the Chinese manufacturers.SNS, which started operations in China in 2002, supplies fabrics to most US apparel branches."All the Chinese supplies are not regular supplies; they have innovations and sustainability," Syed said.Constantin von Vieregge, president and CEO of Messe Frankfurt, said: "There was always the 'stigma' that Chinese exhibitors are lower quality, the cheap fashion. But that has changed completely over the years. So you can see they're getting better and better from a quality perspective."The company has been cooperating with the CCPIT for years, bringing Chinese companies and exhibitors to North America, France, Brazil, and Singapore as well as international exhibitors to Shanghai.The locations are hubs of international sourcing for yarns and fabrics and serve as selling windows for knitting, hosiery, sports and outdoor wear and digital intelligence technology in the industry."It [the partnership with China] is a very, very important one for us because obviously, the Chinese economy is such a strong economy; there are so many great exhibitors," von Vieregge said. "Everybody needs clothes, and we all need affordable clothes."Von Vieregge said "the consumer wins" in a competitive situation.He said that having so many Chinese companies participating in the global textile market is not overcapacity but vibrancy."The demand will regulate the market," he said. "The strongest partner, or the strongest company, will always win.""Now we see there are more and more coming from Chinese exhibitors, the awareness about sustainability and you can see every year it's getting better and better," von Vieregge said.Erin Baker, a fashion student from Kent State University, told China Daily that it's been "really cool to see, just different kind of ways people are trying to implement sustainability into their brands"."They were able to kind of show us insight into how more brands are the more sustainable, what is behind the scenes," she said. "Sustainability is a trend."Gigi Marinho, also a fashion student at Kent State, said she was "wowed" watching a demonstration of the design and manufacturing process of a Chinese textile company.China's textile and apparel exports totaled $115.84 billion from January to May 2024, a 1.4 percent increase over the same period in 2023, according to the General Administration of Customs. In May, export value exceeded $26 billion, a year-on-year increase of 4.5 percent.Exports to the United States rebounded, growing by 9 percent year-on-year, while exports to ASEAN countries saw a jump year-on-year of 21.3 percent.Kuliang is not only a famous summer retreat on the hilly outskirts of Fuzhou, but also a longtime haven for friendly exchanges between Chinese and US people.In the 1880s, foreign expats including doctors and engineers from France, the United Kingdom and the United States who resided in or near Fuzhou, the capital of East China's Fujian province, built holiday villas in Kuliang, and lived in harmony with local villagers for decades.Last month, Kuliang and Fuzhou hosted the Bond with Kuliang: 2024 China-US Youth Festival — the largest youth exchange event between the two nations since diplomatic relations were established in 1979.More than 200 young people from the US attended the five-day festival, together with over 300 Chinese youths.In a congratulatory message sent to the opening of the festival on June 24, President Xi Jinping said that young people are energetic and full of dreams, and "the future of China-US relations lies in young people"."If there is anything that I've seen so far throughout this trip, it's that although we may have different cultures, there are things that we share," said Zev Curiel-Friedman, a festival participant and a member of the communication staff at the University of California, Davis.Curiel-Friedman's enthusiasm for interaction led him to participate in a friendly three-on-three half-court basketball match. "I've played basketball my whole life," he said.The match stood out as a highlight of the dozens of activities held during the festival, such as roundtable discussions, bazaars, documentary screenings, art salons and concerts.Krista Chan, a San Francisco Bay Area resident, often contemplated the striking contrast between the region's affluence and the persistence of homelessness. That led her to seek answers in the documentary Voices from the Frontline: China's War on Poverty, now a focal point in a censorship controversy."How can we learn from what they did?" Chan asked. "After watching this documentary, I can tell you it took a lot of innovative business models, anti-corruption efforts, planned relocation, and incredible sacrifice and hard work on the part of the Chinese people."Produced by PBS in 2019, the film, a collaboration between investment banker and China expert Robert Kuhn and Emmy-winning director Peter Getzels, documented China's methods to lift 800 million people out of extreme poverty in the past 40 years.The film crew traversed China, engaging with locals for in-depth discussions and exploring bottom-up poverty-alleviation programs that played a crucial role in eradicating poverty for the final 100 million people impoverished.However, after its initial release, the documentary faced harsh criticism from anti-China politicians, who accused it of portraying China in an overly positive light. Their pressure led to PBS taking down the film after a single showing.PBS didn't respond to a request for comment from China Daily."I have seen this documentary and also traveled to China since I was a young child, witnessing firsthand how China has modernized and uplifted the poorest," said Chan, a volunteer with the "China is not our enemy" campaign of the anti-war group CodePink.She cited the World Bank's 2022 report, which revealed that China contributed "close to three quarters of the global reduction" in extreme poverty over the past 40 years. "That's pretty incredible," she added.One of the key takeaways for Chan from the film was the unwavering political will demonstrated by the Chinese government.From young cadre in small villages to Chinese President Xi Jinping himself, "this has been their priority — to dedicate themselves to serving people through poverty alleviation," she explained. "Maybe that's the little secret PBS doesn't want us to know. They don't want us to know that China is working hard to meet people's needs while Americans grapple with student debt and a soaring cost of living."The censorship of the documentary has sparked growing concern among peace and human rights activists. CodePink has been actively raising awareness of the film, hoping to encourage broader discussion among Americans.The group stressed that the documentary provides not only insights into successful poverty alleviation but also a deeper understanding of China, a country often demonized in the public eye in the US."Censoring the documentary only serves those wanting to escalate divisions between the US and China," warned CodePink on its website. "By censoring Voices from the Frontline: China's War on Poverty, they also deprive the public of the opportunity to learn about poverty-alleviation policies that have changed millions of lives. Right now, amidst an increasingly dangerous climate crisis and high poverty rates, we need understanding and cooperation instead of censorship and fear."The organization encourages the public to contact it for access to the full film. Last month, they delivered a petition with more than 5,800 signatures to PBS national headquarters in Virginia, demanding the release of the documentary. Similar petitions have been delivered to local PBS stations across the country, including in Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Maine and New Hampshire.In San Francisco, peace groups, including CodePink, Pivot to Peace, ANSWER Coalition, and Veterans for Peace, rallied on Saturday in front of KQED, a PBS affiliate, demanding the airing of the documentary."People deserve to see the positive things that are going on in China," said CodePink San Francisco organizer Cynthia Papermaster at the rally. "PBS is supposed to be an educational broadcasting company. So, show the film and have discussion."Richard Becker, West Coast coordinator of the ANSWER Coalition, noted that poverty, once a prominent topic in US presidential campaigns, has been sidelined."Maybe there's a fear of the elite that if they showed something about how this miraculous transformation has happened in China — alleviating poverty for 800 million people — that you might have to start talking about poverty in the United States," he said.Julie Tang, a retired San Francisco Superior Court judge and co-founder of Pivot to Peace, recounted her own experience witnessing China's transformation. When she visited China 20 years ago, she saw people living in shabby houses next to mountains in a dangerous environment. "Today, those things are no more. We see beautiful houses lined up," she said."People are prevented from seeing the truth of what's happening in China. It is a shame because a documentary like this can help ameliorate a lot of the tensions that are going on in the US-China relationship right now," said Tang.Groups of children in colorful outfits gulped soft drinks from cups as they wandered and explored cultural booths at the Chinese Consulate General in New York over the weekend.Nearly 300 children from six schools in New York City and Beijing gathered at the consulate on Saturday afternoon for the "Understanding Each Other, Building Closer Bonds, and Working Hand in Hand" special performance, promoting art exchange between American and Chinese youth.The students sang and danced and participated in drama presentations, instrumental music and martial arts. They also sang popular songs bilingually in Chinese and English, including Listen to Me, Thank You and Singing and Smiling."This is the largest group we have hosted. I only regret that our space is too small; otherwise, I would have liked to invite all 650 children to visit," said Consul General Huang Ping.Huang also introduced the "Young Envoys Scheme (YES)" program, which offers short-term exchange programs, international summer school programs, youth forums and fellowships. The program supports students from China and the US in furthering cross-cultural exchanges, not only in academics but also in music and art, helping children develop their interests.The initiative started after President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden agreed in November in San Francisco to promote further youth exchange. Students from both countries are already participating and traveling this summer.Throughout the week, the Beijing Student Jinfan Art Troupe, with students from more than a dozen schools in the Haidian and Xicheng districts of Beijing, had a packed schedule in New York. They interacted with students at the United Nations International School, held a special performance at Lincoln Center, and also engaged in a dialogue with Nobel Prize laureates at Columbia University. The visit marked the group's first trip to the United States since 2018.The Beijing Student Jinfan Art Troupe has regularly toured the world and hopes to return to the US again during the winter vacation."This trip was filled with diverse activities, and we hope that American children can find time to visit China and explore, too. We would be delighted to host them in Beijing," Yao Wei, the executive director of the Beijing Shengtao Institute of Education Development and Innovation, told China Daily."No matter what form of art it is, art knows no borders, and there should be more exchanges between young people," he said. For example, the children not only performed traditional Peking Opera but also showcased gymnastics."Art helps people from both countries discover the beauty in each other. We welcome American schools to establish more connections with Chinese schools and invite them to visit Beijing," he added."Our students are currently learning dragon dancing in Sichuan. After just two or three days, I can see that they are already able to perform the dance beautifully," said Bo Yingkan, HuaXia Chinese school board chair."This is the first group from our school, and they have already arrived in China," he said. The school now has 22 locations on the US East Coast with more than 5,000 students."In the exchange between Chinese and American children, we have all learned a lot from each other. I see the enthusiastic smiles on the children's faces," he said. "As a promoter of cultural exchange between China and the United States, I believe it is very important. It allows children born in the US to understand Chinese culture because their roots and their parents have a deep cultural background in China."Beijing has made strong protests against Washington after United States President Joe Biden signed into law on Friday the "Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act," urging the US to refrain from implementing the Act, which undermines China's interests.The Act gives recognition to the notion of "Greater Tibet," made up by the Dalai group, and asks the US government and the United States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to counter "disinformation about Tibet" from the Chinese government.The Act violated the US government's long-held position and commitments and the basic norms governing international relations, a spokesperson said in a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.It also grossly interfered in China's internal affairs, and sent a severely wrong signal to the "Tibet independence" forces, the spokesperson added.Noting that Xizang has been part of China since ancient times, the spokesperson said Xizang affairs are China's internal affairs, which brook no interference by any external forces.As Xizang today enjoys social stability and harmony, with sound economic performance and people's well-being fully protected, the spokesperson said no one and no force should ever attempt to destabilize Xizang in order to contain and suppress China."Such attempts will never succeed," the spokesperson said, while urging the US to take concrete actions to honor its commitments of recognizing Xizang as part of China and not supporting "Tibet independence.""If the US continues down the wrong path, China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests," the spokesperson said.China has taken countermeasures by sanctioning six United States defense-related companies and five senior executives after the US recently announced another arms sale to China's Taiwan region.The six companies targeted by Beijing's countermeasures, which came into effect as of Friday, are Anduril Industries, Maritime Tactical Systems, Pacific Rim Defense, AEVEX Aerospace, LKD Aerospace and Summit Technologies Inc.These companies' movable and immovable properties, as well as other kinds of assets within China, will be frozen, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.The five senior executives include three from Anduril Industries. They are CEO Brian Schimpf, Chief Operating Officer Matthew Grimm and Senior Vice-President of Global Defense Gregory Kausner.The other two are from AeroVironment. They are Wahid Nawabi, chairman, president and CEO of the company, and Kevin McDonnell, senior vice-president and CFO.These executive's movable and immovable properties, as well as other types of assets within China, will be frozen. All organizations and individuals within China are prohibited from engaging in transactions, cooperation and other activities with them.Also, the five senior executives will be denied visas or entry into China, including Hong Kong and Macao. The countermeasures come less than a month after China sanctioned entities and senior executives of Lockheed Martin for the same reason.China has on many occasions voiced its firm opposition to the US selling arms to the Taiwan region, saying such moves are serious violations of the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques.US college students are experiencing China firsthand through a cultural exchange program that aims to dispel stereotypes and foster environmental awareness.The China-US Youth Exchange Camp, which began on Monday at the Xiamen campus of Huaqiao University, is jointly organized by the Fujian Provincial Department of Education and Huaqiao University. About 110 students from the United States will visit cities including Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou during the 10-day exchange program, which is focused on music, the environment and culture.Han Mei, director of the Chinese Music and Culture Center at Middle Tennessee State University, said the US students had been diligently preparing for months, studying and practicing Chinese musical instruments. Han and two other teachers are leading a group of 16 TSU students at the camp.The camp aims to promote educational exchanges and cooperation between Fujian province and the US, fostering mutual understanding and building bridges for future cooperation between young people from both countries.Beyond cultural immersion, the camp prioritizes environmental sustainability. Students participated in "Xiamen Practice" environmental volunteer activities, gaining firsthand knowledge of river management and ecological governance. They cleaned tidal flats of garbage and learned about "sponge campus" construction, a water management system."We in America get a lot of interesting things told to us about the people here and the culture," said William Sprayberry, a freshman at Middle Tennessee State University."But you don't really see that as reality because it's so far from our everyday depictions of China. As a matter of fact, we're all just people. We have different cultures, different customs, but at the end of the day, we're all just trying to live here."Yang Jie contributed to this story.Contact the writers at lipeixuan@chinadaily.com.cnThe San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance on Tuesday shared the first photos of the highly anticipated panda pair, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, as they settled into their new home at the zoo.According to a statement from the alliance, the pandas are the first to enter the United States in 21 years, arriving in San Diego on June 27. They are currently getting acclimated to their private habitat and will not be viewable to the public for several weeks.Yun Chuan, an almost 5-year-old male, is "identifiable by his long, slightly pointed nose". He is the offspring of Zhen Zhen, who was born in 2007 and was the fourth cub born at the San Diego Zoo. Yun Chuan "seems to be extremely comfortable exploring the grass or climbing trees", the statement said.Xin Bao, a nearly 4-year-old female whose name means "precious treasure of prosperity and abundance", is notable for her large, round face and big, fluffy ears. She enjoys sunbathing quietly and focusing on her favorite food, according to the zoo.Over the past week, the zoo has collaborated closely with Chinese experts to cater to the dietary needs and preferences of the giant pandas. The teams have provided a variety of fresh bamboo and created a local adaptation of wowotou, a traditional Chinese bun also known as "panda bread".To help the pandas adjust to their new home, the teams conducted food-adaptability exercises and weight-monitoring sessions. The statement said that "veterinary teams from both countries are diligently monitoring the pandas' health, tracking their weight, appetite, and other health indicators daily to ensure they thrive in their new environment".The arrival of the pandas marks a significant milestone in wildlife conservation and in the ongoing collaboration between the San Diego Zoo and its Chinese counterparts.The San Diego Zoo is the first US zoo to have a cooperative conservation program with Chinese partners. Located north of downtown San Diego in Balboa Park, it is home to more than 12,000 rare and endangered animals representing over 680 species and subspecies.The increased US tariffs on China's electric vehicles (EVs) will have a negative impact on EV adoption worldwide, according to Bloomberg.The United States in May raised the tariff on EVs imported from China from 25 percent to 100 percent, effective Aug 1.The European Union is imposing new tariffs ranging from 17.4 percent to 37.6 percent on China's EVs, in addition to the current 10 percent.China is "the only large auto market that has reached the point of consumer-led takeoff for EV sales", according to Bloomberg's recent Electric Vehicle Outlook.China's "formidable lead" in batteries and the EV supply chain and its "incredibly cheap" batteries are "a major factor driving prices lower", Bloomberg reported. But it said Europe, the US, India and others are pushing back against China's dominance, and tariffs and further protectionist measures could "slow down global EV adoption in the near term".Anticipated high prices also are leading almost half of American owners of EVs to consider switching back to gasoline-fueled vehicles, according to the newly released 2024 McKinsey Mobility Consumer Pulse survey.The survey showed that 46 percent of current EV owners in the US said that they are likely or very likely to switch back to a traditional gas car, primarily due to the high price of EVs and anxiety over long-distance driving because of an insufficient number of public charging stations.In China, where EVs accounted for 40 percent of new passenger-car sales as of May, the percentage of car owners saying they will likely return to a gas car was 28 percent.Overall, 29 percent of all surveyed global EV drivers said they are likely to switch back to a gas car with their next purchase.The McKinsey survey questioned almost 37,000 drivers in 15 countries, including 4,100 in the United States. The respondents included drivers of both EVs and gas-powered cars. The survey covered more than 80 percent of the global EV markets.A recent analysis by Bank of America also found that the high prices of EVs in the US are slowing their sales. Its analysis showed that the EV penetration rate has dipped slightly, and EVs are expected to make up only 8 percent of vehicle sales in 2024 in the US, down by 1.5 percent from last year.Most American consumers will buy an EV if the price is competitive with an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, the analysis showed. It said, however, that manufacturers "are unlikely to achieve ICE-comparable costs on EVs until 2028".In the US, only 3 percent of EVs are priced below $37,000, according to Bank of America research, while more than half of gas-powered or hybrid vehicles are priced below that figure.The US needs to reduce EV costs and expand its battery-charging infrastructure to improve the transition to EVs, said the analysis.That could be helped by partnering with "private Chinese companies such as CATL, the leading battery manufacturer in the world, or BYD … a leading EV producer in China and the leading one in the world", said William Kirby, a professor of China studies and business administration at Harvard University.In a recent interview with Harvard Magazine, Kirby said that such a partnership would benefit the US because China is the leader in clean technology — from solar panels to batteries to EVs. He said a number of Chinese companies would like to manufacture EVs in the American market, but politics get in the way.He pointed to the collaboration between Ford and CATL, saying "political pressures on Ford, both from politicians and unions, made this very difficult to do".Ford announced last summer that it would invest $3.5 billion in the battery venture but had to suspend the project after Congress initiated two federal investigations into its license deal with CATL.According to Bridge Michigan, Ford resumed the construction this year, but the investment was reduced by $1 billion, and the number of new jobs will be reduced by 800.Kirby called the US tariff on China's EVs "a statement of a kind of technological isolation that to me makes no sense for us"."We need to take a step back and think of why are we doing this. If we could partner with several of these competing companies, Ford and CATL, or General Motors and BYD, why would it be in the national interest of the United States to oppose this?" he said.China's EVs have a much larger presence in the EU market than in the US. According to data from Rhodium Group, European Union imports of Chinese EVs surged from $1.6 billion in 2020 to $11.5 billion in 2023. Overall, Chinese and Chinese-owned EV brands accounted for 19 percent of Europe's EV market in 2023.The McKinsey survey found that 27 percent of European consumers who already own an electric vehicle said they are likely or very likely to consider purchasing one from a Chinese brand in the future.They have good reasons to consider Chinese EVs in the future. According to industrial analysts, Chinese EVs are competitively priced — $5,000 to $10,000 cheaper, with comparable features to other brands in the EU market.Chinese EVs are known for their innovation and technology. Companies such as NIO, BYD and XPeng are recognized for their technological advancements, including battery technology, autonomous driving features and smart connectivity. Those innovations appeal to European consumers looking for the latest technology in their vehicles, the McKinsey report said.As a result, the report showed that in the EU, roughly one-third of current EV owners, young consumers and premium-brand owners are more likely to consider a Chinese brand than other consumers.Agencies contributed to this story.For some it's a trip of cultural discovery filled with awe-inspiring moments; for others it's a journey to seek heritage and identity, which can be intense and sometimes emotional.Whatever the experiences bring them, US students traveling to China this summer to take part in theme camps have learned to appreciate differences. More importantly, the exposure to China's culture and people is conducive to forming a well-rounded and profound perception of the country."These 10 days will definitely broaden my vision," said Amy Gao, 12, a seventh grader who flew from the San Francisco Bay Area to attend an exchange and study program in Hebei province. With 174 other peers and team leaders from across the United States, Amy started her "exploration and adventure" in China on June 26.A culturally rich ceremony was organized in Shijiazhuang, Hebei's capital, to welcome the young visitors. Hebei, one of the birthplaces of Chinese civilization, was called the State of Yan and Zhao during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods (770-221 BC)."Organizers are so welcoming that they spare no effort showcasing to us literally, everything," Amy said. The wonders they encountered ranged from an internationally recognized Wuqiao acrobatics performance to Hebei bangzi, a genre of local opera featuring singing, reciting, acting and martial arts performances with accompanying Chinese instruments such as the banhu, a two-stringed fiddle, and dizi, the bamboo flute.Ren Zhuoping, vice-chairwoman of the Hebei Provincial Overseas Chinese Federation, told US students at the ceremony that they would get to immerse themselves in China's 5,000 years of history and culture, experience the rapid growth and changes of contemporary China, and gain a deeper, vivid understanding of the country's breadth."Through what you see, hear and feel in Hebei, each and every one of you can serve as a young ambassador for cultural exchanges between China and the US and a bridge connecting peoples," she said.Samantha Tow, a second-year high school student from California, was making her first trip to China. "The acrobatic performance at the opening ceremony is simply breathtaking and astounding," she said, adding that she also tried on Chinese costumes with traditional makeup and hairdo. "The color of my outfit is peacock green and azure, very Chinese."Campers also went sightseeing at an ancient Buddhist temple and a section of the Great Wall and learned paper-cutting, Chinese painting, calligraphy and tea presentation."Lots of different activities, very interesting," said Selina Fang, a middle schooler from California.The eye-opening activities also included observations on the street. "I don't see so many electric vehicles on American streets as opposed to China," she said.Dong Xudong, who spent two months starting in April helping recruit US students for the Hebei camp, said such programs are important because they improve understanding and exchanges."To maintain healthy and normal China-US relations, we need to sow seeds of mutual understanding and friendship in the hearts of young generations in China and the US," he said.Interaction between youthAt a summit in San Francisco in November China said it would invite 50,000 US students to visit on exchange and study programs in the next five years to increase interaction between the two peoples, especially between youth.Young people are quick learners, they have many common interests transcending national boundaries, and they naturally befriend each other, said Xiaopei He Gelb, founder of a dance troupe in Tri-Valley, California.Last month Gelb took her students to the Dance Academy of Southern China, a local professional dance school in Dongguan, Guangdong province, for a camp at which her girls received eight days of intensive professional training."My students only went to dance class twice a week in two-hour sessions in the United States," Gelb said. "So it came as no surprise that they called the first day traumatic and catastrophic after learning to bend, stretch, split, glide and jump in a professional way. Many were crying due to pain, swelling limbs, fatigue and frustrations."However, Gelb's students persevered because "local dancers, bigger sisters and brothers at the academy have set good examples"."They impress our children not only because they can deliver very difficult moves, but their grit, their pursuit to be a better self. Those (are) stellar traits that I want my students to cultivate and possess."Kelly Ma, just 12, but who has been learning from Gelb for more than seven years, attended the camp."We've learned and changed so much because of the amazing teachers that helped us grow from the second they met us," Kelly said. "It may have been difficult and different from what we were used to, but no one gave up."The "difficult and different" aspects of the programs, said Alan Gao, a parent team leader with the Hebei camp, are an integral part of cross-cultural exchanges and collaboration."The American children encounter language barriers, cultural shock, homesickness and unfamiliarity with team members, different kinds of challenges besides scorching weather there. But they learn and grow from overcoming obstacles.""With only one shot, capture the moment you think most represents the word bond," was the task set by China Daily reporter Yan An for the American youths attending the week-long "Bond with Kuliang" event in Fuzhou, East China's Fujian province.Kuliang, a renowned summer retreat in the mountainous outskirts of Fuzhou, has a history of fostering harmonious coexistence. Over a century ago, foreigners living in or near Fuzhou built villas in Kuliang, blending seamlessly with the local villagers.In 2024, the "Bond with Kuliang" event brought together over 200 American youths and more than 300 of their Chinese peers. This festival marked the largest and most diverse youth exchange since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the US.Click the video to see the photos taken by the American youths with an instant camera and hear why they cherish these moments.US ports are pushing back against the recently proposed 25 percent tariff on Chinese-made ship-to-shore (STS) cranes, warning that the increased costs would have a "substantial negative" impact on the economy.In a series of letters to the US Trade Representative (USTR), port authorities, terminal operators and industry groups across the country have called for the decision to be reversed or delayed, arguing that the tariffs will harm port efficiency, disrupt supply chains and ultimately raise prices for consumers.The tariff, which was announced by the White House in May as part of a broader trade initiative targeting Chinese goods, is set to take effect on Aug 1. Despite mounting opposition, President Joe Biden's administration has defended the move as necessary to protect American manufacturers and rebuild domestic industries.Critics argue, however, that the tariff will do little to achieve those goals, as there are currently no US manufacturers of STS cranes, and the global market is dominated by Chinese companies.Currently, at least seven ports in the United States have 35 cranes on order from Chinese manufacturers, with an average cost of $15 million per crane. According to the American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA), the ports now face at least $131 million in new, unexpected costs if the tariff is implemented."The tariff, if imposed, will not meet its stated objectives," AAPA President and CEO Cary Davis wrote in a letter to US Trade Representative Katherine Tai on June 28. "Instead, it will only result in negative outcomes, including grave harm to port efficiency and capacity, strained supply chains, increased consumer prices, and a weaker US economy."The Port of New Orleans, for example, is planning a major expansion of its container capacity. It estimates that the tariff would cost $52 million for its new Louisiana International Terminal alone.The Port of Virginia has already signed contracts for 12 cranes from Chinese companies at a cost of $161.52 million and could face an additional $40.38 million in costs due to the tariff.The AAPA also noted that a recent survey suggested at least an additional 61 cranes were expected to be ordered in the next five years to meet growing demand.The new tariff targets STS cranes, which are used to load and unload containerships, amid claims by some officials and media reports that the cranes made by Chinese manufacturers may be vulnerable to data breaches due to remote control capabilities.In February, Biden announced a $20 billion investment to build STS cranes in the US, citing cybersecurity concerns around Chinese-made cranes.Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co (ZPMC), the world's largest manufacturer of port equipment, has denied the allegations.The US ports industry also has dismissed the claims as "largely unfounded" and points out that multiple federal agencies are already addressing any potential security concerns. "It's unnecessary to impose a tariff to secure US ports," said the AAPA.That was echoed by another letter submitted by Port Houston and jointly signed by 14 other ports and groups. "Imposing tariffs on these high cost, low tech pieces of equipment would, in fact, damage an important strategic objective of modernizing and improving US infrastructure and put the economic health of our communities and our country in jeopardy," they warned.The opponents also highlighted the lack of viable alternatives to Chinese-made cranes. ZPMC dominates the global market, while Germany and Finland, the other two countries producing a small fraction of STS cranes, source most of their components from China, making their products subject to the 25 percent tariff as well.Currently, there are no manufacturers of STS cranes in the United States, nor have there been for nearly four decades. Therefore, there is no timeline for when STS cranes might be available domestically, and the tariff on Chinese cranes "will do nothing to protect American manufacturers from unfair practices", said the AAPA.Critics also noted that the tariff contradicts the Biden administration's commitment to infrastructure improvement and emission-reduction. Delays in port investments, including those in zero-emission equipment, would negatively impact the domestic green economy and the industries the tariff aims to protect, they said.When it comes to securing steady, lasting progress in China-United States relations, "it boils down to listening to public opinion and responding to the people's aspirations", a former senior diplomat said.Yang Wanming, who is president of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, told China Daily in a recent interview that "the more frequently the people of the two countries interact with each other, the more solid the foundation of public opinion for the development of China-US relations will be".Looking back on history, he said that every pivotal moment in the China-US relationship was made possible by the people of the two countries, who made concerted efforts to work toward the same goal.The enduring friendship and goodwill between the two peoples "have been the foundation and source of strength for the development of China-US relations", he said.President Xi Jinping has always attached great importance to, supported and encouraged China-US people-to-people exchanges, Yang said, noting that Xi not only attended a welcoming banquet held by friendly groups and individuals in San Francisco in November, but also delivered a heartwarming speech."He affectionately recounted friendly stories of his interactions with the American people, and he used the word 'people' more than 60 times in his speech," Yang said.Over the past 45 years, since the establishment of China-US diplomatic relations, there have been frequent and close exchanges between the people of the two countries, covering a wide range of fields. This has brought "substantial benefits "to the people of both countries, Yang said.Demonstrating how much he values youth exchanges, Xi visited schools in the US and wrote letters to students to encourage more US youths to learn Chinese and understand China, "sowing a large number of seeds of friendship", Yang added.In 1985, Xi, who was then secretary of the Communist Party of China Zhengding county committee in Hebei province, led a five-person delegation to the US state of Iowa for a two-week trip that included visiting farms, feed suppliers and grain-processing companies."The story about him and his old friends from Iowa... is time-honored and widely celebrated," Yang said, adding that the anecdotal account was also profoundly enlightening.Last year, Xi unveiled in San Francisco the plan to invite a total of 50,000 young people from the US for visits and exchanges in China over the next five years.In recent months, many US students have come to China, including those from Cascade Elementary School in Utah, Muscatine High School in Iowa, Columbia University, the University of Virginia and Stanford University.As part of its efforts to fulfill the youth exchange plan at the subnational level, Yang's association — a flagship Chinese organization working on public diplomacy — co-hosted an event titled Bond with Kuliang: 2024 China-US Youth Festival, which was held last week in Fuzhou, Fujian province. The event gathered more than 200 young people from the US to meet with more than 300 Chinese peers.The association plans to host in China a few more student delegations from reputable US schools, colleges and universities this year, Yang said. These guests "will have exchanges and interactions with national ministries and commissions, university experts, local officials and Chinese peers on topics such as China-US ties, China's history and culture, and the path of development", he said.Yang said his association has invited a 190-member student delegation from 14 schools across seven US states to visit China. It will further encourage young people in both countries to collectively act as a bridge in China-US relations and establish more contacts and exchanges, in order to "reduce misunderstandings and stereotypes ...and build up friendships and a rational perception", he said.As this year also marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of his association, Yang said the organization looks to write more chapters on people-to-people friendship and cooperation.China's move to criminally punish "Taiwan independence" separatists for conducting or inciting secession is a serious warning to them, experts say.For ringleaders or those committing significant crimes, life imprisonment or a term of imprisonment of more than 10 years can be imposed, with the possibility of the death penalty for those causing particularly severe harm to the country and the people, judicial guidelines issued on June 21 said."It is a heavy and head-on blow to the activities of 'Taiwan independence' separatists, and it comes in a very timely fashion," said Wu Huiqiu, chairman of the board of the Washington China Unification Promoting Association.The guidelines, jointly issued by the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the ministries of public security, state security and justice, allow for trial in absentia in some cases.The move comes amid escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait triggered by repeated separatist attempts made by those advocating "Taiwan independence", particularly since the island's new leader Lai Ching-te, who holds strong separatist views, took office in May.Anthony Moretti, department head and an associate professor of the Communication and Organizational Leadership Department at Robert Morris University in Pennsylvania, said that if the separatists continue to see the island as an independent country and themselves as "friends of the United States" and the West, that is "the equivalent of walking past a fire and throwing more gasoline on it"."The fire only gets hotter and bigger, and there's even more potential for problems," Moretti said.Clear signalBy issuing the judicial guidelines, the central authorities are sending another clear signal and serious warning, that Taiwan's hard-core separatists will be severely punished, and they should not have the slightest illusion regarding that, Wu said.On Thursday Taiwan's "mainland affairs council" said it would raise the travel alert for the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Macao Special Administrative Region to the second-highest orange alert, advising residents to avoid nonessential travel.The next day the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said the judicial document does not target most people in Taiwan, but a few die-hard "Taiwan independence "separatists."Taiwan compatriots should not have any concerns about traveling across the Strait," said Zhu Fenglian, spokeswoman for the office.The guidelines deal with stubborn "Taiwan independence" supporters rather than ordinary people of Taiwan, Wu said. "The line is drawn very clearly."Moretti said the in absentia provision seems reasonable, because those identified by the Chinese mainland but living in Taiwan are unlikely to travel there for any trial."Outside of the likely harsh comments that the US and the West will offer, I don't see any penalties or sanctions coming," Moretti said. "China will remind the global audience that outside governments should not interfere with the domestic issues of any country."Wu said the judicial guidelines also send a "clear signal" to the world."That is to say, the Taiwan question is one that China can solve by itself, and it is reasonable, legitimate and necessary for China to use its law and legal procedures to punish the 'Taiwan independence' separatists."There is no position for external forces to intervene, and there is no reason for them to say anything about the guidelines."Wu said he hopes the Democratic Progressive Party realizes the seriousness of the problem, abandons its position on "Taiwan independence", and returns to the basis of the 1992 Consensus so that it can embark on the path of peaceful development toward reunification."It should be said that the only hope for Taiwan's fate and future is the ultimate reunification of the motherland."Xinhua contributed to this story.Giant pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived at Los Angeles International Airport in the United States on Thursday morning local time, according to the China Wildlife Conservation Association.After going through customs and other procedures, a temperature-controlled transport vehicle transported the two giant pandas from the airport to the San Diego Zoo.The two giant pandas have entered the panda isolation quarantine facility for a one-month quarantine period. Following examinations by professional keepers and veterinarians from both China and the US, the two giant pandas were declared to be in good health.Two Chinese experts escorting Yun Chuan and Xin Bao will stay in the US for at least three months to accompany them through the quarantine period and help them adapt to their new life.In the future, various methods will be used to introduce the daily lives of the two giant pandas to the public.Vice-Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, on Thursday, held a phone call with the United States Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, urging the US to effectively respect China's sovereignty, security and development interests.The Taiwan question is at the core of China's core interests and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations, Ma said, adding that "Taiwan independence" would lead to a dead end while indulging and supporting "Taiwan independence" would ultimately backfire.The US should fully recognize the nature of the Democratic Progressive Party authorities in Taiwan to seek "Taiwan independence" and the serious harm they pose to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, he said.He urged the US to adhere to the three China-US joint communiques, cease arming the island and translate its commitment not to support "Taiwan independence" into concrete actions.Xizang-related issues concern China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Ma said, adding that the US should stop endorsing the "Xizang independence" forces in any form and refrain from interfering in China's internal affairs.Regarding the South China Sea, he said the current tension at Ren'ai Reef lies in that the Philippines breaches common understandings with China and challenges its sovereignty and territorial integrity.He pointed out that Manila persists in transporting large quantities of construction materials to the illegally grounded warship in an attempt to permanently occupy the Ren'ai Reef.He called for Washington to stop condoning and supporting Philippine provocations and disturbances, and take practical actions to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.Noting how China maintains an objective and just position on the Ukraine issue, Ma said the US should stop leveling groundless accusations against, as well as smearing and shifting blame onto China.The US should also cease obstructing normal economic and trade exchanges between China and Russia, he added.While expressing firm opposition to US' arbitrary imposition of illegal unilateral sanctions and extraterritorial jurisdiction, Ma said China would steadfastly uphold the legitimate rights and interests of its entities and individuals.China's historic feat of successfully retrieving the first-ever samples from the far side of the moon has ignited discussions about the United States' approach to exclude China from space projects, with experts emphasizing that the US should focus on inclusion rather than exclusion.The Chang'e 6 probe returned to Earth on Tuesday, bringing back rock and soil samples from the lunar far side, which always faces away from the planet.The probe landed on the moon on June 2 and lifted off two days later to start its journey back to Earth. The far side of the moon presents unique technical challenges for both landing and liftoff, yet China managed to land the probe, collect samples and bring them back safely.The retrieved samples are expected to shed light on the origins of the solar system, while the potential for tapping lunar resources offers a promising path for collaboration between the US and China, particularly in advancing artificial intelligence technologies, according to an editorial posted by a Silicon Valley-based think tank and consultancy Sinotalks."Prior to the Chang'e 6 mission, China published the world's first high-definition lunar geologic atlas to, among other goals, facilitate scientists' identification of a proper site for a potential lunar station. New knowledge acquired from analyses of samples brought back by the Chang'e 6 probe will enrich the content of the atlas, making the establishment of a lunar station more promising," Mei Gechlik, founder and CEO of Sinotalks, told China Daily.When the lunar station is established, in-depth studies on the moon's resources and evolution as well as studies on the whole solar system can be conducted more effectively, which could lead to the discovery of new lunar resources for the development of AI hardware more powerful than existing semiconductors, she said.In addition, innovative AI applications could be tested at the lunar station under conditions not available on Earth, Gechlik said. "These long-term and expansive benefits should motivate China and the United States to collaborate by contributing the financial capital and human capital needed to pull off this feat."Taylah Bland, a researcher at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, also sees potential for China-US cooperation."China's latest achievement as the first country to land on the far side of the moon reinforces its space exploration strengths and capabilities," Bland wrote in a newsletter. "Despite an ongoing space race with the United States, China's collaboration with the European Space Agency on the Chang'e 6 mission highlights the potential for cooperation, not competition," she said.However, a major hurdle stands in the way of such collaboration — the ongoing tensions between the two nations. The US has actively excluded China from NASA projects since 2011, and has intensified restrictions to limit China's access to US-developed technologies to contain its AI development.This exclusionary approach of the US, according to Sinotalks, is meant to weaken China's space technology advancement, but it might be backfiring, as it bars US participation in China's space missions."Unlike their counterparts from France, Italy and Sweden engaging in moon-related research supported by payloads carried by the Chang'e 6 probe, US scientists have missed these opportunities because US restrictions have also excluded them from participating in China's space projects," Sinotalks said.The think tank's editorial board further questioned whether the restrictions would genuinely hinder China's AI development, given its ability to overcome obstacles and continue with its space exploration.The US restrictions are unlikely to be dismantled soon, but China's historic lunar mission presents an opportunity for a shift in its stance, said Gechlik, the Sinotalks CEO.The 4 billion-year-old lunar samples brought back by the Chang'e 6 probe are 1 billion years older than samples brought back by the US and the former Soviet Union decades ago, she said, noting that China has "a good opportunity to extend an olive branch" to the US by inviting the country's scientists to study the new samples together.The determination of US scientists to stay competitive in lunar exploration may prompt them to urge US authorities to accept China's olive branch, she said, adding, "If this occurs, a new era of 'moon diplomacy' will begin." China's anti-doping authorities have hit back at what is described as groundless accusations made by overseas media and, in particular, its United States counterpart for manipulating facts and undermining the country's anti-doping efforts.The China Anti-Doping Agency, known as CHINADA, issued a statement on Thursday against misrepresentations made by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) at a congressional hearing on Tuesday.During the hearing, USADA CEO Travis Tygart made baseless accusations against CHINADA and the World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, claiming they were involved in "covering up an intentional doping case" involving 23 Chinese swimmers in early 2021. A comprehensive investigation had found that the swimmers were not at fault due to a mass contamination incident."This has severely undermined the reputation of CHINADA, WADA and the global anti-doping system. USADA's brazen 'long arm' jurisdiction is undoubtedly a manifestation of out-and-out hegemonism and imperiousness," said the CHINADA statement."Its intention to manipulate the case for political purposes is all too clear, which runs counter to the principles of fairness, justice and integrity it has claimed to champion."USADA is seeking to undermine the well-functioning world anti-doping order that the anti-doping community has worked hard to build and shake up, or even subvert the global anti-doping governance system, which is designated to serve the athletes all over the world equally so as to seize the global anti-doping leadership role. We strongly reject and oppose such move."In response to the 2021 incident, WADA ran its own investigation on reports by CHINADA and reviewed the case strictly supported by an external consultation, before concluding that no athletes should be held accountable for doping violations. The 23 swimmers involved were proven to have ingested banned substance trimetazidine, or TMZ, unwittingly after inadvertently being exposed to it at a hotel so that their tests at the competition returned positive results for an "extremely low concentration" of the substance.The case files, which were supposed to be kept confidential after having been concluded as contamination in order to protect the athletes involved, were somehow leaked to New York Times and the German radio network ARD, which published hyped reports on an otherwise would-remain-undisclosed case in April, three months ahead of the Paris Olympic Games, which open on July 26."Regarding the request of the USADA CEO at the hearing to review the case file of the TMZ contamination case, its purpose is to legitimize the illegal access to and unauthorized disclosure of the information in the case file by media outlets including the New York Times and ARD, and then form distorted and misleading conclusions through the so-called review and investigation with already preconceived judgement, so as to reach the purpose of politicization of the contamination case," CHINADA said in its statement.WADA also responded fiercely to USADA's misleading accusation, criticizing the agency for politicizing anti-doping and calling it hypocritical and displaying double-standards in a statement published on Wednesday.WADA President Witold Banka gave the example of a case involving US athlete Erriyon Knighton to illustrate USADA's double standard.The promising sprinter tested positive for a banned steroid earlier this year but was allowed to compete in the US trials for the Paris Olympics after an arbitrator ruled this as a no-fault contamination case in mid-June."Without commenting on the merits, it is difficult to understand how USADA can declare in a statement that 'justice was served' in this case, given it had argued in the hearing that the analytical result was incompatible with meat contamination and had sought a sanction of four years against the athlete. It is particularly intriguing that USADA made this sudden U-turn in its opinion without even having seen the reasoned decision, which is not yet available," Banka said."I cannot help but wonder what USADA would be saying if this had involved an athlete in China."Capital market decoupling between the United States and China is occurring to some extent, and US restrictions targeting China have played a significant role, experts said.The US Department of Treasury issued a statement on Friday saying that Washington would draft rules to carry out an Aug 9 executive order that called for limiting US investments "in certain national security technologies and products in countries of concern".The rules, applying to artificial intelligence, semiconductors and quantum information technologies, would prohibit some transactions in certain technologies and products that "pose a particularly acute national security threat to the United States", or would require that the Treasury be first notified of the transactions.US venture capital firms are also pressuring technology startups to cut ties with Chinese investors, as they expect Washington to tighten controls on foreign ownership, the Financial Times reported on June 7.HeyGen, a generative AI startup founded in Shenzhen in 2020 that later relocated to Los Angeles, asked its Chinese investors to sell shares to their US counterparts, FT reported."There is no question in my mind that these developments are hugely influenced by the US government's tech bans and inbound and outbound investment screening and denial orders," Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Institute for China-America Studies in Washington, told China Daily."The VC market, understandably, is simply reacting to the US government's heavy-handed de jure and de facto prescriptions."In 2018, then-US president Donald Trump signed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Act, which applied greater scrutiny to certain equity investments in areas related to critical technologies, critical infrastructure or businesses with sensitive personal data, as well as certain types of real estate transactions, without explicitly naming China.Gupta said that since then, the US government's goal has been to shut down any gaps in those areas to prevent Chinese entities from using even a minority investment position in early-stage companies to obtain new technology.US President Joe Biden signed an executive order last August to establish a foreign investment review mechanism to restrict US entities from investing in China's semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technology, and artificial intelligence fields.In September 2022, Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, listed three "families of technologies" — advanced computing, including chips, AI and quantum; biotechnologies and biomanufacturing; and clean area technologies — where the US would seek to maintain a lead.Gupta said those areas are where the US side would essentially seek to "decouple" from China."I think the impact of these policy decisions in the medium to long term will be momentous," Gupta said.On Monday, China's Ministry of Commerce said the US has repeatedly emphasized that it has no intention of "decoupling" from China or hindering China's economic development. However, it insists on issuing proposed rules to restrict US companies' investments in China and suppress the normal development of Chinese industries, the ministry said in a statement.Gupta noted that US-China economic interdependence over the past four decades was built on their different endowments and comparative advantages.However, as China "has raced up the technology ladder", the difference in comparative advantage in the technical areas has shrunk markedly, leading to greater resemblance than difference today in industrial structures, particularly in advanced manufacturing sectors.Goal laid bare"And so, the goal for the US going forward is to decouple and suppress China in these sectors rather than countenance fair competition," Gupta said.William Jones, a nonresident fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, said US venture capitalists would certainly like to get a "piece of the action" in China's high-tech area while the US government is taken aback by China's rapid progress in high-tech, and it seeks to restrain that progress by preventing venture capital from getting involved in China."There is also pushback from some of the major business organizations that would like to see a less restrictive policy toward China from the US government. Restrictions by the US government on semiconductors and other fields will slow down, but not stop the development of these technologies by China."According to Global Corporate Venturing data, US corporate venture capital investors backed just 48 China-based startup financings in 2022, a 48 percent decrease from 2021."It is inevitable that more foreign investment will pour into China in the medium term, seeking to cater to final demand locally rather than to produce and export to third-country markets from China," Gupta said. [Video/Zheng Chenxiao]Giant pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao set out on their journey to the United States on Wednesday evening, marking a new round of China-US cooperation on the conservation of the protected species.A vehicle carrying the panda bears departed from the Ya'an Bifengxia Base of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan province. They will board a chartered flight from Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport to San Diego in the US state of California.The pandas are accompanied by five experienced caretakers and veterinary experts from China and the US. To ensure the health and safety of the animals during the long-haul flight, Chinese experts have arranged food, such as fresh bamboo, bamboo shoots, fruits, vegetables and specially made bread, and drinking water.After Yun Chuan and Xin Bao settle in at the San Diego Zoo, Chinese experts will stay there for about three months to see them through the quarantine period, helping them to quickly adapt to their new living environment. Panda enthusiasts in both China and the US will have various means of learning about the pair's daily lives and adjustment process, according to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration.Since the 1990s, China has collaborated on giant panda conservation with 26 institutions in 20 countries, including the US, Spain, Japan and France.The San Diego Zoo was one of the first institutions in the US to engage in cooperative research on giant pandas with China. Over more than 20 years, the two sides have cooperated and solved a series of technical challenges in key areas such as captive panda breeding, habitat protection and panda supplemental nutrition, according to the Sichuan center.A delegation from Beijing celebrated the 44-year sister-city relationship with New York City with musical performances and speeches from representatives of both cities at China's New York Consulate General.More than 150 people participated in the event on Monday, aimed at enhancing city tourism, cultural exchange and economic cooperation."Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you," lyrics from a song by popular American singer Taylor Swift could be heard at the event. The song has garnered more than a million streams across China's top three music platforms and highlights New York's status as one of the most popular tourist destinations for Chinese travelers.As a "must-visit" destination for Chinese tourists in the US, New York mirrors the importance of Beijing for American tourists visiting China. The two cities have enjoyed the sister-city relationship established soon after China and the US formalized diplomatic relations."Over the years, the two cities have enjoyed close economic cooperation, cultural exchanges and frequent interactions among the people. Together, the two cities have witnessed the development of our state-to-state relations, serving as a model of friendly exchanges," said Xia Linmao, executive vice-mayor of Beijing municipality.He also noted previous cooperation and exchanges on music, including the strategic partnership between Beijing's National Center for the Performing Arts and New York's Carnegie Hall. Those led to the establishment of the World Association for Performing Arts and tourist attractions like the Universal Beijing Resort, jointly developed by New York City-based NBC Universal, which has attracted more than 20 million visitors since opening in 2021."These are vivid illustrations and splendid reflections of the interactions between the two countries and cities," Xia said, adding that he welcomed New Yorkers to share development opportunities in Beijing, strengthen business and trade cooperation, deepen cultural exchanges and contribute to subnational exchanges between China and the United States."These relationships between New York City and Beijing are a powerful example of how international cooperation can lead to shared success. Both cities benefit immensely from their collaborative spirit," said Edward Mermelstein, commissioner for international affairs of New York City. He listed several bilateral cooperation examples such as cultural performances, education and program exchanges and mutual business opportunities."Having Beijing and New York sisters is even more interesting because they're both dynamic and influential in their own ways, and that's why they're more like sisters because two sisters are never really completely the same," Gabby Gabriel, the founder and CEO of Gab China, told China Daily. "So one is older and has a rich history. One is newer and brings a lot of dynamism to the world."One of the things that I think that I love about America and China, what makes us the same is we're both very hardworking. I think that both Americans and Chinese are very interested and committed to trying their best to push, push their goals forward," she said.Gabriel said the two cities and two countries can learn from each other: "They are two leading economies in the world, and there's lots of opportunity between the two regions."Tourism and travel between Beijing and New York are resuming, with 27 direct flights from Beijing to major US cities each week, including five weekly flights from Beijing to New York.Two large COSCO cargo ships filled with containers were anchored at the bustling Port of Long Beach, south of downtown Los Angeles, standing out prominently on the vast ocean and highlighting the scale and significance of international trade.The Long Beach port, one of the busiest in the world, serves as a critical gateway for goods entering and leaving the United States, particularly from Asia."We're the second-busiest port in America after LA ... (collectively) the ninth-largest port complex in the world, and we're proud to be in a partnership with Shanghai, the largest container port in the world," Joel Perler, the port's economic development manager, told China Daily at a side event of the Select LA Investment Summit on Thursday in Long Beach.The Port of LA and the Port of LB comprise the San Pedro Bay port complex, handling almost 19 million 20-foot equivalent unit containers each year. Asia is their top foreign trade route, with China being the leading trading partner, according to LA port statistics.Felipe Cusnir, executive director of World Trade Center Long Beach, said the collaboration with China is particularly important for the port complex.He highlighted efforts to promote green shipping by lobbying for incentives that encourage shipping companies to adopt more sustainable practices."This way, we get more shipping plans to commit to serving the Chinese market and the American market through the ports," he said.In September, the Shanghai Port-Los Angeles Port Green Shipping Corridor Implementation Plan Outline was launched, establishing the world's first trans-Pacific green shipping corridor for one of the busiest trade routes.Starting next year, shipping company partners will deploy vessels capable of full life cycle low-carbon or zero-carbon emissions along the corridor. The aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of the world's first full life cycle zero-carbon emission container ship on this route by 2030.Members of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group attended a workshop in Shanghai last week to explore global climate solutions for zero-emission trans-Pacific container shipping."They negotiate incentives for shipping lines to receive benefits," Cusnir said. "This could include discounts on shipping rates if they're using green fuels or connecting to electricity instead of running on diesel generators."Supply chain resilience and adaptability have undergone various challenges over the past years. The trade wars during former US president Donald Trump's administration led to shifting cargo volumes, reducing them to below-normal levels in 2019.In 2020, the pandemic caused another shift, with a focus on workforce protections and coordination. Despite such challenges and present tariffs on Chinese imports, there is still a strong demand for Chinese products in the US, Cusnir said.Manufacturing center"We're going to continue trading for Chinese products to access the US because Americans like to consume, and China is an amazing manufacturing center that continues to provide a lot of goods to the US, and we don't see any supply chain going away."At Thursday's annual summit, speakers discussed the challenges and opportunities faced by the ports, emphasizing their focus on technology and sustainability, with a goal of achieving zero-emission cargo handling equipment and trucks by 2030.While large cargo volumes have come through the complex every year, the ports are focusing on increasing volume in line with projections for a green shipping corridor and infrastructure, Avin Sharma, senior director of workforce and government affairs at the Port of LA, said.Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of LA, and the Port of LA's Executive Director Eugene Seroka also attended the Shanghai workshop last week to find solutions for alternative marine fuels.Reducing emissions by just 10 percent on the route from the Port of Shanghai to the Port of LA equates to the total emissions in LA over a year, Sharma said."As the economies of both countries remain strong, and consumers continue to purchase import-export products, the route between Shanghai and LA, as well as other ports in the Pearl River Delta and surrounding areas, will continue to be important."A $760 million budget has been approved for the Port of Long Beach for fiscal year 2025, establishing a plan to fund new capital improvements in rail, zero emissions and other infrastructure.Casey Hehr, managing director of commercial services at the Port of LB, said the port is working closely with Shanghai on a green shipping corridor."The cargo volume from China has increased ... 5 to 10 percent over the previous year," Hehr said. "We continue to push forward on trade corridors between Shanghai and Long Beach."Regarding sustainability, clean technology and green infrastructure, Allison Clark, vice-president of business and international trade development at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, emphasized the importance of collaboration with China to create green shipping corridors."It's vitally, vitally important for our ports to work with China on this plan," she said. "The agreement is paving the way for collaboration with other countries, making it a wonderful example."renali@chinadailyusa.comFour Chinese students who recently traveled to the United States to study and participate in academic conferences suffered unwarranted harassment, interrogation and repatriation by the US side, sources said.The four students have scientific and technical backgrounds, and two of them have research interests in artificial intelligence, the sources familiar with the matter told China Daily on the condition of anonymity.US Customs and Border Protection officers took the four Chinese individuals to a darkened room for more than 10 hours of continuous interrogation, repeatedly questioning them with a baiting, coercive approach, the sources said.The officers repeatedly questioned them about their personal and family information, their studies and internships in the US, whether they were members of the Communist Party of China, and whether they had cooperated with the Chinese government.The officers "paid particular attention to political backgrounds such as CPC membership, and to scientific research backgrounds related to computers", one of the sources said.The US side also refused to allow two of the individuals to contact their families and friends, causing one of them to be out of contact with the outside world for more than 30 hours, the source said.In addition, without evidence or valid warrants, the US side arbitrarily seized the electronic products of one of the Chinese individuals and repatriated the other three students. How the fourth student's case was resolved was not disclosed.The US side in recent years has conducted unwarranted harassment, interrogation and repatriation of more than 30 Chinese students majoring in computer-related fields, according to incomplete statistics.The vast majority of them are master's or doctoral degree candidates, with more than half of them being PhD candidates, and most of them are studying in well-known universities in the US.Their research interests cover fields such as artificial intelligence, information science, network security, electronics, software engineering and electronic information engineering."Mostly, these students were harassed and interrogated by the US side for more than 10 hours upon entering the country, and the longest time of being held was even up to five days, and ultimately, without exception, their visas were canceled and they were repatriated," another source said.The US practice is "far beyond the realm of normal law enforcement, is strongly ideologically biased, and is not aimed at maintaining so-called 'national border security'," the source said, adding that the aim is to hold back China's scientific and technological development and maintain US scientific and technological hegemony, which "fully reflects the hegemonic, bullying nature of the US side, as well as its anxiety and lack of self-confidence in the realm of science and technology".Such practices will only give rise to a serious "chilling effect" inside and outside the US, poison the public opinion environment for China-US relations, and impede the mutual visits and exchange of talent between the two countries, the sources said.The US will eventually damage its own international image and innovation vitality, leading to a serious backfire, a third source said."Chinese students should assess the risk with great caution and think twice before going to the US to study," the source added.Su Xiaohui, deputy director of the Department of American Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, said that Washington is sparing no effort to fan competition among major countries and secure its hegemony, and such harassment aims to disrupt and frustrate regular exchanges between the two countries on education, science and technology.Behind such harassment is the fact that some anti-China forces in the US have constantly hyped the so-called "China threat", and this kind of harassment "serves to build on their anti-China narrative and China-threat narrative", Su said."Fundamentally, this is an issue of perception," she said. "When Washington views China as a rival and a threat, it seeks to undermine China in a relentless way."In a move to promote subnational cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, the Jiangsu Provincial government became the third local government from China to promote its tourism at the United Nations headquarters in New York this year.The opening ceremony of the art exhibition titled "Dialogue between Jiangsu and the world, sharing a better life" was held at the UN headquarters in New York on Friday. Hosted by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism and the Jiangsu Provincial Foreign Affairs Office, the 12-day exhibition will feature the works of Chinese and international photographers, showcasing Jiangsu's natural landscapes, cultural charm and human spirit to the world."Jiangsu is a major province in eastern China known for its robust economy, rich culture, extensive tourism and openness. It stands out as the only province in China to boast major rivers, vast lakes and access to the sea. On this ancient yet vibrant land, water and culture reflect each other magnificently, and humans coexist harmoniously with nature," Li Chuan, deputy director of Jiangsu Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism, said at the opening ceremony though video."Culture and tourism are vital for global exchanges and mutual learning," Li said. To support UN cultural values and boost international tourism recovery, Jiangsu has introduced eight measures to enhance inbound tourism services, including easier foreign currency exchange, payments and venue reservations, he added."We eagerly invite you to Jiangsu to experience its scenic beauty, rich flavors and vibrant culture, and to discover even more," Li said.Elizabeth Chin, executive director of the Pacific Asia Travel Association; Fred Teng, president of the America China Public Affairs Institute; and Wenyan Yang, chief of Social perspective on Development Branch at the United Nations also attended the event."This year marks the 35th anniversary of the sister-state relationship between Jiangsu province and New York State. As a native New Yorker, this connection truly warms my heart. Congratulations to this wonderful partnership," Chin said. "If you have not been to Jiangsu, I encourage you to see for yourself how beautiful it really is in Jiangsu," she added.The sister-state relationship between the two regions was officially established in 1989. Since then, the two regions have engaged in exchanges and cooperation in fields includes economy and trade, education, culture, and tourism. The art exhibition also features over ten photographs that review the history of exchanges between the two regions.Xinyang, a city of Henan province, and Nanjing, capital of the Jiangsu province, also held tourism promotion events at the United Nations earlier this year.minluzhang@chinadailyusa.comRecently, four Chinese students who travelled to the United States to study and participate in academic conferences suffered from the US side's unwarranted harassment, interrogation and repatriation, sources said.All of them have scientific and technical backgrounds, and "two of them have research interests in artificial intelligence", the sources familiar with the matter told China Daily with the condition of anonymity.The officers with US Customs and Border Protection took the four Chinese individuals to a dark room for more than 10 hours of continuous interrogation and repeatedly questioned them in a baiting, coercive approach, the sources unveiled.The officers repeatedly questioned them about their personal and family information, their studies and internships in the US, whether they were members of the Communist Party of China, and whether they had cooperated with the Chinese government.Such officers "paid particular attention to political backgrounds such as CPC membership, and to scientific research backgrounds related to computers", the sources said.In addition, in the absence of fact-based evidence and valid warrants, the US side arbitrarily seized the electronic products of one of the Chinese individuals and repatriated the other three.The US side also refused to allow two of the individuals to contact their families and friends, causing one of them to be out of contact with the outside world for more than 30 hours, the sources said.According to incomplete statistics, the US side in recent years has conducted unwarranted harassment, interrogation and repatriation upon more than 30 Chinese students majoring in computer-related fields.The vast majority of them are master's or doctoral degree candidates, more than half of them are PhD candidates, and most of them are with well-known universities in the US.Their research interests cover fields such as artificial intelligence, information science, network security, electronics, software engineering and electronic information engineering."Mostly, these students were harassed and interrogated by the US side for more than 10 hours upon entering the country, and the longest time of being held was even up to 5 days, and ultimately, without exception, their visas were cancelled and they were repatriated," the sources said.The US practices are "far beyond the realm of normal law enforcement, is strongly ideologically biased and is not aimed at maintaining the so-called ‘national border security'," they added.The purpose of such an approach is to hold back China's scientific and technological development and maintain US scientific and technological hegemony, which "fully reflects the hegemonic, bullying nature of the US side, as well as its anxiety and lack of self-confidence in the realm of science and technology", the sources said.The US practices will only give rise to a serious "chilling effect" inside and outside the US, poison the public opinion environment for China-US relations, and impede the mutual visits and exchange of talents between the two countries, they added.In doing so, the US will eventually damage its own international image and innovation vitality, and lead to a serious backfire, they said."Chinese students should assess the risk with great caution and think twice before going to the US to study," the sources said.Click the video and check out how a delegation of college student leaders from US universities, organized by the China-US Exchange Foundation, reacted to Shanghai's fast development while visiting some of the city's leading companies.Beijing expressed strong opposition on Thursday to Washington's second sale of arms this month to the Taiwan region, saying that what the United States has done to assist the Democratic Progressive Party authorities' attempt to seek "independence" through military buildup will only backfire.The remark was made as the US State Department approved on Tuesday the sale to Taiwan of drones and missiles for an estimated $360 million. It was announced only two weeks after the US administration decided to sell $80 million worth of F-16 fighter jet spare and repair parts to the island.Speaking at a regular news briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said the US' arms sales to the Taiwan region, regardless of China's opposition, seriously violate the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, especially the Aug 17 Communique of 1982.Such sales gravely undermine China's sovereignty and security interests, harm China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and send a gravely wrong message to "Taiwan independence" separatist forces, he said."China strongly condemns and firmly opposes the US' frequent arms sales to Taiwan, which embolden the DPP authorities as they stick to the 'Taiwan independence' position and make deliberate provocations on the one-China principle."It shows once again that the biggest threat to cross-Strait peace and stability, and the biggest source of damage to the cross-Strait status quo, are the separatist moves for "Taiwan independence "and connivance and support for such moves from US-led external forces, Lin said.Noting that the Taiwan question is at the core of China's core interests, and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations, Lin said no one should underestimate China's firm determination and strong ability to oppose "Taiwan independence "and safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity."China urges the US to ... stop the dangerous trend of arming Taiwan, stop its connivance and support for 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces, and stop endangering cross-Strait peace and stability."Chinese officials pointed on Wednesday to advancements in anti-drug cooperation with the United States this year, urging both sides to build on this momentum based on mutual respect and the management of differences.Wei Xiaojun, executive secretary-general of the China National Narcotics Control Commission, noted the achievements made by the China-US counternarcotics working group in aspects such as substance control, intelligence sharing, casework collaboration, anti-money laundering and technical exchanges.In November, the heads of state of both countries reached a consensus in San Francisco on cooperation in anti-drug efforts. Since then, senior officials from China and the US have maintained close communication through in-person meetings and videoconferences to enhance cooperation in various areas of drug enforcement.Wei highlighted progress on three fentanyl precursors of particular concern to the US. "We anticipate completing the relevant legal procedures within a few months," he said.Joint investigations into key cases are being conducted by Chinese and US drug enforcement departments, with some cases already making significant progress. For instance, a man surnamed Tong was recently investigated in Northeast China's Liaoning province in connection with a drug-related money laundering case based on leads provided by US authorities. Tong has been apprehended on suspicion of illegal foreign exchange operations, and the investigation continues. Wei highlighted this case as an example of success in Sino-US anti-drug collaboration.Technical exchanges between drug testing experts from China and the US have resumed, with two successful exchanges, held in February and March, yielding positive results. Another on-site exchange is scheduled for the end of this month.Additionally, China has launched a special campaign targeting online advertising related to fentanyl-like substances and their precursors, significantly reducing the quantity of such advertisements on various platforms. In response to US requests, China has been actively strengthening control over fentanyl and its precursors, conducting law enforcement efforts to address the fentanyl issue.In May 2019, at the request of the US, China was the first country to place the entire class of fentanyl substances under control, aiding the international community in managing the fentanyl problem. Since then, US counterparts have repeatedly indicated that they have not seized any fentanyl-related substances originating from China. Meanwhile, the US has not achieved comprehensive control over fentanyl substances despite facing a crisis, Wei noted.Over the past decade, China has supported all substance scheduling requests made by the US at the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, demonstrating China's commitment to assisting the US in addressing its fentanyl issue. Wei emphasized that baseless accusations and smear campaigns are not constructive, and effective cooperation between both parties is essential for resolving these problems.Regarding the regulation of synthetic drugs and precursor chemicals, Shan Yehua, deputy secretary-general of the National Narcotics Control Commission, said that in addition to substances regulated under international drug control conventions, China selectively expands the list of controlled substances based on regional and domestic realities.China has also established specific export control policies for precursor chemicals to combat drug production, requiring strict scrutiny of the export of specific chemicals to countries such as Myanmar, Laos and Afghanistan. As of May 1, 24 chemicals have been added to the list of controlled substances for export to specific countries, bringing the total to 41.Shan added that many uncontrolled chemicals have legitimate uses, and synthetic drugs cannot be effectively regulated through endless listings.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's recent statement on trade with China was overly broad and protectionist, according to trade experts."The US is doing what it can and using arguments that it can marshal … (to) keep Chinese goods out of its market," Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-American Studies, told China Daily."And that is protectionist, purely," he said.In her remarks at the Economic Club of New York last Thursday, Yellen blamed China's "over-concentrated supply chain" for posing a threat to US jobs and recent investments aimed at building America's green energy sector.She also said China's pursuit of its trade policies "may interfere significantly with our efforts to build a healthy economic relationship".Gupta said that Yellen may be asserting that China's high production capacity, high savings rate and low consumption ratio are putting pressure on international markets."But what economists would also say reciprocally is that the US runs a huge budget deficit and … that it is overconsuming at its end," Gupta said. "And therefore, the United States kind of sucks in imports from overseas because it doesn't employ or have a balanced budget. And therefore, there's excess consumption on its end."Yellen has more than once said that China's electric vehicles and other green industries have "overcapacity" that threatens the global supply chain. China has countered that the US is essentially using the "overcapacity" narrative to "kneecap" other countries' strong industries, practice protectionism and "trample" on market principles and international trade rules in the name of "fair competition".Gupta said most subsidies provided by the Chinese government on EVs are consumer subsidies, and "that is WTO legal".And it is "perfectly fine to subsidize" infrastructure such as charging stations because "the market would not do it on its own".Gupta said government subsidies are not uncommon for companies."They didn't just spring up one day. Governments gave them subsidies — even things like the United States chip industry in the 1960s," he said."But now the Chinese government is letting that (EV) industry run mostly on market force lines. And so, China has nothing to hide in this regard."Gupta described the US as "a completely protectionist and noncompliant client on trade issues", which, he said, was "the real opposition" to Yellen's assertion of macroeconomic imbalances hurting the US-China trade.He said that the US would prefer China to remain downstream of the value chain, but it is not for Washington to make that call."That is for China to make its own decisions, and for the market to make its own decisions," he said. "China is moving far up the value-added ladder very quickly in sophisticated export goods. And the important thing that the US needs to do is try to come back into WTO-compliant ways in which it deals with China."The day after Yellen's speech, the World Bank released its Global Economic Outlook, in which it raised China's GDP growth forecast from 4.5 percent to 4.8 percent in 2024.Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute of International Economics, said that Yellen's statement targeting China is "too broad" to "lead to a constructive outcome".Hufbauer said that the US has the right to criticize specific trade policies, but it "cannot dictate the shape of China's industrial development"."Good Chinese growth should attract more investment from Europe, Japan and Korea, but not from the US under current geopolitical circumstances. Moreover, if the US puts barriers on capital flows, that will discourage investment into China from all sources," said Hufbauer.Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, is one of the main designers of the US science and technology defense strategy against China, known as the "small yard and high fence".In an April speech, Sullivan said that US policy is to "de-risk" rather than "decouple" from China, which was called out by the Chinese side as rhetoric without substance."Unfortunately, there are no boundaries on Sullivan's 'small yard, high fence' policy. 'De-risking' may become more like 'decoupling,'" Hufbauer said. "Much will depend on the outcome of the November presidential election."Gupta said, "I think the simplest way to understand this is by understanding that the US wants to decouple from China in certain sectors and doesn't want to decouple in the other sectors."He said that substantial capital would flood into other industrial sectors, except in areas such as semiconductors, AI or quantum computing, where the US and perhaps even Western countries want to exclude foreign capital from entering China."The Chinese economy is huge, trillions upon trillions. And there's a lot of space for foreign investment to come in and earn rewards in the Chinese market," said Gupta. "Therefore, a lot of money will also come in now and continue to come in for the long term."A free trade group has requested another month to comment on plans by the United States to hike tariffs on Chinese imports such as electric vehicles, batteries, solar products and other goods.In a letter to Juan Millan, acting general counsel for the Office of the US Trade Representative, the Americans for Free Trade, or AFT, is seeking to delay the Aug 1 start date for the new duties."Comments are currently due on June 28, 2024. We believe an extension of at least 30 days — to July 28,2024 — is in the public interest," the group said in the June 6 letter, which was signed by 173 trade associations.AFT is a broad coalition of US businesses, trade organizations and workers united against tariffs. "Collectively, we employ tens of millions of Americans through our vast supply chains," it said in the letter.In May, US President Joe Biden announced tariff increases on $18 billion worth of Chinese imports targeting electric vehicles, advanced batteries, steel and critical minerals.The USTR later announced a 30-day public comment period, with a quadrupling of levies on Chinese EVs to 100 percent, starting this year.The tariff rate on semiconductors will surge from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year, while the tariff rate on battery parts will increase from 7.5 percent to 25 percent in 2024."Many of our members are small businesses and US manufacturers, critical stakeholders in this review process. We are actively surveying our collective membership to gather feedback on the projected impacts of the proposed modifications and document them in a manner that is most helpful to USTR," the letter said.The group said a public hearing would be consistent with past USTR practice regarding Section 301 tariff actions, when it held a hearing on its investigation in October 2017 and to receive stakeholder input on each collection of proposed tariffs and products from 2018 to 2019.Stakeholders' viewA hearing would also give the USTR the benefit of asking questions directly to stakeholders over the proposed modifications and exclusions, the letter said.Among prominent endorsers of the letter were the Consumer Technology Association, the National Retail Federation and the US-China Business Council.AFT also has a map of the US on its website that shows each state's tolls from the tariffs on China.Nationally, the group said the Section 301 tariffs have cost people in the US $129 billion since the trade war began in 2018.California, the US' most populous state, sustained the highest burdens from the tariffs, said the AFT, which estimated that free trade supports 5.1 million jobs in the state and that Section 301 tariffs have cost Californians $33.5 billion.California also saved $5.7 billion from Section 301 exclusions, but those expired in December 2020.Agencies contributed to this story.The Chinese ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, met recently with Dr. Rahul Gupta, the director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.They had a candid and in-depth exchange on promoting counternarcotics cooperation between the two countries on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.Xie welcomed Gupta's upcoming visit to China, briefing him on the recent efforts of China's drug control authorities and emphasizing that the fentanyl problem is not China's problem, nor was it caused by China. But out of humanitarian considerations, China has been doing its utmost to help the US deal with the fentanyl issue. China has made great efforts and demonstrated its sincerity for cooperation.Xie said that the US side needs to move in the same direction as China, take China's concerns seriously and earnestly address them to create a favorable atmosphere for cooperation.China has firmly denounced a US attempt to spread false information and smear the image of other countries, responding to a recent media report revealing a targeted campaign by the US military to discredit Chinese-made inoculations, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday.Health industry insiders have also warned of severe consequences from the spread of vaccine misinformation.Reuters reported on Friday that the US military had launched a secret program during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, using social media platforms to sow doubt about the efficacy and safety of vaccines made by Chinese developer Sinovac Biotech, among other medical supplies from China.Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a news conference in Beijing on Monday that such actions "only expose the hegemony and hypocrisy of the US," adding that the US "should behave the way a major country should"."It has always been the practice of the US to manipulate social media to spread false information, poison the public opinion environment, and smear the image of other countries. China firmly objects to this," Lin said.He added that when Washington wants to contain and suppress a country, it ignores the truth and "coordinates resources" to smear and discredit it. "This applies not only to the fabrication and dissemination of false information about Chinese vaccines, but also to various aspects, including defaming the popular Belt and Road Initiative and spreading rumors about the 'overcapacity' of China's new energy vehicles."The international community should keep clear-eyed about such US behavior," he said.Sinovac Biotech expressed concern over misinformation and rumors circulating online during the COVID-19 pandemic, suspecting organized and intentional campaigns aimed at attacking the company. In a written statement sent to China Daily on Sunday, the company emphasized that online misinformation about vaccines has not only affected its reputation but also undermined public trust in vaccines."Doubts over vaccines and other negative rumors could trigger panic, disrupt stability and bring pressure to families and individuals," the company said.Sinovac warned that long-term stigmatization of vaccines could impair the public's trust in science, public health institutions and governments, and affect the implementation of public health policies. The company said that it has released abundant data on the clinical trial results for its COVID-19 vaccines and the outcomes of their actual use. More than 600 studies carried out globally have proved the vaccines' safety and efficacy, it said."While the COVID-19 pandemic has been contained and Sinovac has made its contributions, the world is still not at peace," the company said. "We will continue to focus on controlling diseases to safeguard the health of humanity in the future."Global health experts have denounced planting skepticism and doubts over vaccines and called for concerted efforts to build public trust.Joseph Bresee, an epidemiologist and director of respiratory virus prevention programs at the Taskforce for Global Health, a nonprofit based in the US, said vaccine hesitancy and suspicion have become more serious compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic, with many populations less willing to be vaccinated. "Tackling this issue will require lots of resources, lots of tailored strategies for different people, lots of complexity, but obviously it cannot be ignored," he said in an interview with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, or Gavi, in May.Contact the writers at wangxiaoyu@chinadaily.com.cnDespite strained national relations, US and Chinese cities are forging strong partnerships in the fight against climate change, highlighting inspiring instances of joint work at the subnational level.Momentum for such cooperative efforts has been given a fillip through high-profile exchanges such as that of a visit to China by the Governor of California Gavin Newsom in October.This opened the door for further collaboration. Cities such as Rochester, Minnesota, followed suit, with its Mayor Kim Norton returning with a renewed commitment to clean energy."We came back as a city which made a pledge to be 100 percent renewable by 2030, and Rochester City Council has agreed to that," said Norton, inspired by China's dedication to electric vehicles.She talked of her experience in China late last year at a recent forum in Berkeley, California, at which local officials from both countries talked about best practices and lessons learned."Because we learned from another city, at the subnational level we came home with the energy to tackle these issues."Not only her own community but also other US cities could also benefit from such exchanges, she said.During her visit, she was particularly struck by China's aggressive pursuit of electrification."In Nanjing, 87 percent of the fleet is electric. We have two electric buses in my city, and two more ready for delivery. We wanted to purchase 10 more but are unable to get them."This stark contrast reminded US cities of "setting a goal for doing better in this country" by adopting similar strategies, she said.Electric vehicles were not the only thing Norton learned about. She pointed to China's innovative approaches to battery leasing and cooperative procurement as strategies that could help US cities.Another crucial area for learning, Norton said, was the management of heating, cooling and wastewater, areas in which Chinese cities have developed innovative, large-scale solutions that could inform US practices.Infrastructure developmentThe infrastructure development she witnessed in China also stood out to Norton as a potential area for further bilateral collaboration. This sentiment was echoed by Jin Xiaohu, deputy secretary-general of Suzhou, Jiangsu province, who detailed the city's progress in using clean energy, green manufacturing and data-driven energy management."We invite experts and colleagues from the United States to Suzhou," Jin said, highlighting the potential for collaboration to achieve carbon peak and neutrality goals.On the US side, the Mayor of Blytheville, Arkansas, Melisa Logan, recognizing the similarities between the Mississippi and Yangtze rivers, extended an invitation to Chinese counterparts to help in efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change in the Mississippi Delta.Since 2005 it has suffered significant economic losses as a result of flooding and droughts exacerbated by climate change, said Logan, who said working with China is crucial to mitigating these problems.She is calling for Chinese participation in the Mississippi River Cities and Towns initiative to foster mutual understanding and collaboration in managing river systems in the face of climate change.In a conference in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in September some guests from the Yangtze River region will come to talk about their experience with best practice, Logan said."We have a great relationship with China, and we want to keep that relationship, and we want to build upon it and grow it."This subnational collaboration is expected to yield tangible results this year. The collaborative efforts are scheduled for showcasing at events such as Climate Week NYC in September and COP29 in Azerbaijan in November, the California-China Climate Institute said.Partnerships are also expanding, as seen in the fourth China-Oregon Climate Change and Sustainability Forum, to be co-hosted by Oregon, the city of Tianjin and Fujian province this year.liazhu@chinadailyusa.comThe Second Track 1.5 Dialogue between China and the United States was held in Beijing on Thursday, which observers said serves as both an authoritative and flexible channel to bring together officials and scholars for in-depth and candid discussions on managing bilateral ties to avoid conflicts.Some 30 representatives from both China and the US, including John Thornton, co-chair of the board of trustees of the Asia Society in the US, attended the dialogue, under the theme of "sharing perspectives and finding solutions on key and urgent issues".The dialogue was co-hosted by the International Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Asia Society. The first such dialogue was held in October via video link. Track 1.5 means a gathering of government officials and scholars in less formal ways.Zhang Tengjun, deputy director of the China Institute of International Studies' Department for American Studies, said that the track 1.5 dialogue provides a valuable channel through which policymakers can convey authoritative information while sharing views in an unofficial setting."It plays a unique and important role during a time when Sino-US communication is not very smooth," Zhang said.According to a readout released by the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, both sides agreed that China and the US should adhere to peaceful coexistence and avoid conflict and confrontation, as well as strengthen communication and dialogue to enhance mutual understanding and trust.Both sides recognize the need to strengthen risk management and properly handle differences so as to shoulder their responsibilities as major countries in jointly addressing global challenges.Both sides agreed to continue deepening dialogue and communication, and make efforts to promote the stable and healthy development of bilateral relations.Zhang said it is necessary for China and the US to establish a jointly agreed upon strategic guiding principle in order to achieve peaceful coexistence, and the prerequisite is a correct understanding of the bilateral relationship.The current problems in mutual ties stem from misperceptions, in particular, Washington's misunderstandings about China's development and viewing Beijing as a strategic rival, Zhang said.The US needs to correct its misconceptions about China and view the country in an objective and rational manner, he said, adding that only on this basis can the two countries address specific issues and stabilize their ties.Since the summit between the two heads of state in November in San Francisco, official exchanges between the two sides have been resumed, including the bilateral high-level military dialogue, the first bilateral artificial intelligence talks and meetings of the financial working group.From May 30 to June 2, Vice-Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu visited the US, marking the latest bilateral engagement.Frequent and regular exchanges between top leaders of China and the US should be strengthened to lead and navigate bilateral relations, Zhang said, adding that various dialogue mechanisms among government departments are also expected to bring early results and achieve tangible outcomes."Areas like climate change, health and AI are less politically sensitive and are areas in which the two countries have fewer structural conflicts and more integrated interests," Zhang said.Expanding cooperation in these areas will help build up trust and cultivate consensus, in a bid to stabilize China-US relations, he added.Xinhua contributed to this story.While many are dismayed by the currently tarnished China-US relationship, artists and community activists are using arts to address estrangement between people in China and the United States through exhibitions, seminars and paintings.Song Min, president of the US-China Culture & Communication Association, headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area, believes in the important role that storytelling through art has been playing in facilitating goodwill and dialogue between people.Last fall, he led eight American artists to visit Xianning, Hubei province, and joined nine Chinese artists there for an activity — "Chinese in the Eyes of Americans — Telling the Story of Xianning, Hubei with a Paintbrush."During the week, "artists mingle with each other through paintings and artistic expressions", said Song. "Together, they toured scenic spots, visited schools and museums, checked street vendors, talked to locals and captured moments of significance. They reflected their findings on canvas through brush strokes and colors."The collective works of Chinese and American artists, 27 pieces in total, were first on display in Xianning before they were shown at an exhibition in late May at a public library in Cupertino, California, which has been in a sister-city relationship with Xianning since 2018.Sheila Mohan, mayor of Cupertino, said the event will enhance collaboration and exchanges between the two cities through the medium of art and is expected to propel the relationship to a new high.Olivia Edwards, one of the participating American artists said, "I have loved art all my life and I am further inspired when I visited Xianning. I remember the kindness, hospitality of the Chinese people there. Most importantly, I love the spirit of the people — their vision, their diligence, their hard work, their efforts to preserve the old neighborhood while building the new."Moreover, Chinese artists impressed her with their "brilliant talents", and "getting to know them is the highlight of this trip", said Edwards, adding that to paint together and communicate through artwork is "something that connects us. I just love them."Rebecca Jo Alex, another participant, said "There is no better way to see and visit a place than it is being painted. I saw great details of the beauty of China — their people are so warm; cuisines are diverse."The best memories are about time with my fellow Chinese artists. Although we don't speak the same language, we do communicate through the universal language of arts."Dacia Xu, director and co-founder of Qualia Contemporary Art, a gallery in Palo Alto, California, also believes in the enduring power of art exchanges in building relations.On May 18, Qualia unveiled Beneath the Golden Antlers, its first solo exhibition featuring Chinese contemporary ink artist Yang Jiechang, which runs to late June."This is part of our ongoing programmatic focus on contemporary artists from the Asian diaspora," said Xu, adding that her gallery continues to showcase stellar artworks, with influences and elements from different cultures and genres."To underpin understandings between peoples through the platform of art is our mission," she said.Xu noted that Yang's exhibition highlights his recent representations of animals."While he works in a variety of media, such as painting, sculpture, installation, performance and video, Yang is best known for his mastery of traditional Chinese media — brush and ink painting, meticulous color painting and calligraphy. This is a legacy and (Chinese) cultural tradition central to his work."Yang, a Cantonese-speaking native, was born and raised in Foshan, Guangdong province, where he inherited his conservative, reserved family values. He then went to the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts in 1982, where four years of academic training bolstered his professional pursuits.Since 1988, Yang has lived in Paris and Heidelberg, Germany, where he has honed his drawing skills and achieved international recognition."Isn't Yang's story interesting?" Xu said, adding that to orchestrate an exhibition such as this is also to build a bridge, to tell a story of human interest."We are committed to building lasting relationships with artists, collectors, curators and scholars, nationally and internationally," she said.The grassroots efforts, which may seem trivial at first, are like the dripping water that accumulates strength that ultimately can penetrate boulders, said Song.On June 10, Song led another delegation of 12 American teenagers and young adults on a journey of exploration in Hubei province. "This time, they will use cameras and painting brushes to capture and record anything they deem enticing, eye-opening or just different from that in the United States," he said.The Foreign Ministry rejected on Thursday Washington's smear over the normal trade and economic exchanges between China and Russia, as the United States intensified the pressure on Russia over the Ukraine crisis with a new round of sanctions also targeting Chinese companies.At a news briefing on Thursday, ministry spokesman Lin Jian said China and Russia are comprehensive strategic partners of coordination, and the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries is grounded in clear logic and strong resilience.China firmly opposes all unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, he said.On Wednesday, the US Treasury Department announced new sanctions on more than 300 entities and individuals both in Russia and outside its borders, including in China. The announcement was made on the eve of the G7 meetings in Italy.Regarding the Ukraine crisis, Lin said it is clear to all as for "who is calling for dialogue and striving for peace, while who is fueling the crisis and instigating confrontation".'Wanton' sanctionsThe US has been pouring weapons into Ukraine, while shifting the blame of undermining peace and protracting the crisis to other countries. It "even used the crisis as an opportunity to wantonly sanction and suppress other countries", he said.The ministry has rejected Washington's groundless accusations of China's normal trade with Russia multiple times, saying such cooperation is consistent with World Trade Organization rules and market principles, and should not come under external interference or coercion.China is not the creator or party of the Ukraine crisis, he said. "We will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies."More than 100 young students, experts and scholars from the United States arrived in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, earlier this week for the Sino-US Youth Exchange Week, which began on Tuesday.The All-China Youth Federation and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) organized the event to promote exchanges and cooperation between youths from the two nations.The participants will cover topics such as green and low-carbon development, youth entrepreneurship, cultural and artistic education, health and hygiene, economic cooperation, trade and innovation.Lionel M. Ni, the university's president, said he was glad to invite the young American guests to visit the school and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area."All teachers and students at the university are ready to communicate and interact candidly with American youths on various topics," he said.According to Ni, youths from China and the United States have a greater responsibility to deepen understanding, bridge differences, and contribute to humanity's peace and sustainable development.China on Wednesday expressed strong opposition and condemnation to the United States for banning imports from another three Chinese companies over the so-called forced labor allegations, vowing that it would continue taking resolute measures to defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies."The US once again fabricates and spreads false narratives regarding the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and imposes illegal sanctions on Chinese firms under the guise of human rights," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a news briefing on Wednesday.China has said multiple times that facts and data prove that claims of "forced labor" and "genocide" are completely groundless and are lies of the century, which are fabricated by a very small number of anti-China elements, aiming to sow discord in Xinjiang, smear China and hinder the nation's development.Lin said the US, in essence, is attempting to create "forced unemployment" in Xinjiang by using human rights as a pretext to infringe upon the rights to life, employment and development of the vast number of people in Xinjiang."The sinister intentions of 'containing China by using Xinjiang' are clear for all to see," he said.Washington has in recent years in the name of human rights arbitrarily imposed unilateral sanctions concerning economic and trade issues on China, which has been met with strong countermeasures by Beijing.Lin slammed the US for using lies as a basis and putting Chinese companies on relevant sanction lists, saying such moves severely interfere with China's internal affairs.They also disrupt normal market order and flagrantly violate international trade rules and basic norms of international relations, he added.Lin urged the US to immediately cease its smears against China, lift the illegal and unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies and refrain from harming the country's interests.As the US is faced with a sea of domestic problems, Lin said if the US truly cares about human rights, it should take measures to effectively address internal malaises, rather than meddle in internal affairs of and impose sanctions on other countries.Thousands of people enthusiastically participated in dragon boat races on the Charles River this weekend, along with the cultural fair celebrating the Chinese traditional event.This year's Boston Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival, held Sunday near the John W. Weeks Footbridge on the river, featured 68 teams with about 2,000 paddlers from across Massachusetts, other New England states and New York. They competed in 500-meter races, which started in 1979."We want to promote dragon boat racing; we want to use this platform to promote Asian culture … people come here to learn, for exchange or just for fun, too," Gail Wang, board president of the Boston Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival, told China Daily.Wang said that over the past year, dozens of volunteers for the 45th annual festival have been working diligently to preserve the tradition while also offering a fresh perspective to attendees."It's very important for [connections] of people … culture exchanges, and that's what we do," she said.The festival, also called Duanwu, is a traditional Chinese festival observed on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. It commemorates the life and death of Qu Yuan (340-278 BC), an exiled poet and politician during the Warring States Period (475-221 BC). Upon hearing that his state, Chu, had fallen, he committed suicide by drowning himself in the Miluo River.The recent words and actions of the United States, including those of President Joe Biden, on the Taiwan question have been detrimental to cross-Strait and US-China relations, and the US should stop its provocations, experts said."The US knows that China's red line is Taiwan. Yes. Don't cross it. Just do not cross it," Anthony Moretti, associate professor and department head of Communication and Organizational Leadership at Robert Morris University, told China Daily."The US has been blurring the one-China policy, trying to remove the core elements, and actually provoking the one-China principle recognized by the whole world, "Wu Huiqiu, chairman of the board of the Washington China Unification Promoting Association, said.In an interview with Time magazine, Biden said US military involvement in Taiwan would "depend on the circumstances". When asked whether he would deploy troops if necessary, Biden said he was "not ruling out using US military force".The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, under the US Department of Defense, announced last week that the US State Department had approved two potential arms sales of $300 million to Taiwan, including the sale of F-16 fighter jet spare parts and maintenance parts.Moretti said the US' calculation has to include a series of factors when deciding whether to use US military force.First, the Taiwan Strait is geographically far from the US. Second, "basically, you're playing on China's home turf" if the US sends troops to the Strait. Third, the US public would consider "the recent failures" because military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq ended poorly. And the cost cannot be ignored, Moretti said."You put it all together, and to presume that the US would send troops, I think, is a bad suggestion," he said.Wu described Biden's comment as "a hypothetical, vague and tactical expression" and another move of "playing the Taiwan card"."What's bad is that he's sending misinformation that the 'Taiwan independence' forces in the island would see as a statement that the US is going to act on. And that is negative for cross-Strait relations," Wu said.Wu also said he was concerned more about the "actions", including arms sales.A delegation of 27 US defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, visited Taiwan and held a closed-door "Taiwan-US Defense Industry Forum" with companies and organizations of the island in Taipei last week. Steven Rudder, former US Navy commander of the Marine Corps Forces Pacific, attended the opening ceremony."This is another example of the Biden administration's recent inconsistency in its words and deeds on the Taiwan question, which has made cross-Strait mutual trust even more fragile, and US relations even more fragile," Wu said. "The US has been 'playing the game' for a long time, and it is actually unwilling to see the two sides of the Taiwan Strait come together."Responding to Biden's comments on not ruling out military force, Mao Ning, spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, urged the US to stop arming Taiwan and stop sending any wrong signals to "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.Arms sales opposedCommenting on the latest US plan for arms sales, Zhang Xiaogang, spokesman for China's Ministry of National Defense, urged the US to revoke its plan and stop arming the region.Zhang said supporting "Taiwan independence" separatist forces will only escalate tensions in the region, push Taiwan into a dangerous situation, and ultimately harm the US itself.The Chinese People's Liberation Army has intensified military training and enhanced combat preparedness to resolutely safeguard China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Zhang said.Wu said the US wants to turn Taiwan into a "self-defense island "that "defends itself, rushes ahead, and serves as cannon fodder", while the US will hide far away when there is a real cross-Strait conflict."It is unbelievable and impossible for the US to engage in a head-on conflict with another major nuclear power," Wu said. "The more Taiwan provokes, the faster the reunification process will be."Moretti said he hoped the US could acknowledge that it would be good for people in the US and China, and for all of Asia and the world to have a cooling of tensions and act accordingly thereafter.But he said he does not expect the political leadership in the US to take action to dial down the situation because the existing political climate in Washington would see such behavior as a "weakness"."We can hope that there is not an accident of some kind that requires a response that could be very dangerous for all parties involved," Moretti said.He suggested that the US can pursue more conversations with China. "Common sense has to guide the conversation, and we're not seeing enough of that," Moretti said.Wu also said the initiative to end the "vicious cycle" of US-China relations as a whole and the Taiwan question lies more on the US side."It is the US that is constantly provoking, creating momentum and sending wrong signals to the 'Taiwan independence' forces and the world. The initiative lies with the US because the US is the provocative side," Wu said."US politicians should not be influenced by anti-China forces. They should have their own calm consideration about how to get along with another major power," he said."The good thing is that the mainland is very strategic in encouraging cross-Strait integration, development and more exchanges, especially among the youths."Under the watchful eyes of guests, Brenda He slowly walked to the center of the stage. Dressed in a turquoise hanfu and gradually adorning her head with ornate hairpieces, she completed her coming-of-age ceremony, witnessed by the community she serves.For her, the event on Saturday was special, as she celebrated the big day with her family and friends in a traditional Chinese Han-style ceremony, coinciding with the Chinese traditional Dragon Boat Festival."I really like being a part of the Chinese culture. Honestly, this is my first time working with a hanfu, but they've always been part of our event, and I'm grateful for that," the 17-year-old told China Daily. "That's my heritage.""I plan to wear my hanfu for my high school graduation that's in a few weeks," she said. Brenda said hanfu is good for big days like graduation and becoming an adult. "Hanfu is something that not everyone knows about, so we set up the hanfu club to spread our culture more," she said.As a Chinese American, Brenda has served as a student volunteer for three years, promoting Chinese art and culture in the Queens borough of New York City. She is also one of the recipients of the 2020 President's Community Service Award."I really love working with the community and with my volunteers," she said. "They're also my motivation to keep going."Born and raised in the United States, Brenda said she was not that "cultured" at the beginning, but found that serving the Chinese community is also a path for her to learn about herself, her identity and her community.A total of 23 young representatives, including college students, professors and engineers from Fortune 500 companies across the United States, kicked off a five-day visit on the "Bridge of the Future" China-US Youth Exchange Program Flagship event in Southwest China's Chongqing municipality on Friday.The "Bridge of the Future" program plans to invite American youths from various sectors and regions to visit China each year to facilitate exchanges and inspections between both countries on topics of mutual concern. The program is part of an initiative proposed last November that would invite 50,000 US youths to China over the next five years for exchanges and study.The organizers have arranged a variety of engaging visits and activities. For example, on Friday afternoon, the group visited SERES Auto Super Factory in the city's Liangjiang New Area to learn about the application of new-generation information technologies such as the Internet of Things, 5G, industrial big data, and artificial intelligence.During their stay in Chongqing, which coincides with the Dragon Boat Festival, the youths will experience a wide variety of local intangible cultural heritages in the city's Ciqikou Ancient Town and Songji Ancient Town.To boost the China-US people-to-people friendship, they will also visit the Chongqing Stilwell Museum, the late US Army General Joseph Stilwell's former residence in the city.On June 11, the last day of the Chongqing visit, a communication camp meeting themed on "Youth Shaping the Future with Smart Technologies" will be held in Chongqing's Yongchuan district.BEIJING -- A Chinese defense spokesperson on Friday urged the United States to revoke its plan to sell arms to China's Taiwan region, and to cease arming the region with weapons in any form.Zhang Xiaogang, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, made the remarks in response to a media query on the US Department of Defense's recent approval of arms sales worth approximately 300 million US dollars to Taiwan.The US arms sales to China's Taiwan region have severely violated the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, particularly the August 17 Communique, Zhang said.The move has seriously undermined China's sovereignty and security, and posed a grave threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. China is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes the US arms sales to China's Taiwan region, he added.Zhang said that the Taiwan question is the first red line that shall not be crossed in China-US relations, and that supporting "Taiwan independence" separatist forces will only escalate tension in the region, push Taiwan into a dangerous situation, and ultimately harm the United States itself.The Chinese People's Liberation Army has intensified military training and enhanced combat preparedness to resolutely safeguard China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Zhang said.BEIJING -- China hopes the United States will contribute real money to and do something concrete for the development and revitalization of Africa, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Friday.Spokesperson Mao Ning made the remarks at a regular press briefing when asked to comment on US President Joe Biden's negative comments on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Mao said the people of the BRI participating countries have the best say on the initiative. China has signed in excess of 200 Belt and Road cooperation documents with more than 150 countries and over 30 international organizations since the initiative was put forward over a decade ago.She noted that Belt and Road cooperation has brought tangible benefits to the people of participating countries and has been widely welcomed by the international community.Africa is one of the regions actively participating in the Belt and Road cooperation, Mao said. Thanks to the Belt and Road, many African countries have built their first highways, first sea bridges and first industrial parks, and Africa has seen the construction of its first disease control center with complete facilities, covering the whole continent, she added."It is easy to criticize others in doing something, but the hard part is doing it better than others," Mao said. "We hope the United States will contribute real money to and do something concrete for the development and revitalization of Africa," Mao said.Despite ambitions for enhanced food self-sufficiency, China is projected to continue relying heavily on US imports of soybeans and sorghum for decades to come, according to a food policy expert.Ye Yujiang, a vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), highlighted these findings during the release of the academy's annual Agricultural Sector Development Report on Friday. The report forecasts that by 2050, China will still depend on the US for approximately 39 percent of its soybeans and a substantial 60 percent of its sorghum.Acknowledging the importance of stable trade ties with the US, Ye emphasized the need for a two-pronged approach: maintaining a strong trade relationship with the US while diversifying sources through strategic partnerships."It is essential to maintain stable trade relations with the United States and make every effort to uphold this stability," Ye stated. He further stressed the importance of exploring new channels and strengthening ties with agricultural powerhouses like Brazil and Argentina, as well as other countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.The CAAS report outlines projections based on various factors, including a declining population. It anticipates China's population to reach 1.38 billion by 2035, with urbanization reaching 75.8 percent.To meet the evolving demands of its population, the report projects that China will need to significantly increase production of key food groups. By 2035, production is expected to rise by 29.64 million tons for meat, 6.13 million tons for eggs, 9.58 million tons for dairy products, and a significant 19 million tons for aquatic products. These figures are expected to climb further by 2050.This projected growth will have a substantial impact on animal feed demand. The report recommends a 12 percent increase in planting area for corn and soybeans, critical animal feed crops, by 2035. This translates to an expansion of 6.8 million hectares. By 2050, the report forecasts a need for a 32 percent increase, reaching 17.3 million hectares.Ye underscored the significant challenges this expansion presents in terms of land use. He emphasized the crucial role of technological innovation in enhancing production efficiency to address these challenges.The event also saw the launch of the 2024 Global Food Policy Report by the International Food Policy Research Institute, Pascal Lamy, board chair of the institute, highlighted the complementary nature of the reports, emphasizing their shared goal of fostering sustainable and inclusive food systems focused on health, equity, and resilience."While the Global Food Policy Report offers a broad perspective on nutrition and food policy globally, the China Agricultural Sector Development Report provides a localized lens," Lamy said. This localized perspective, she noted, underscores the importance of context-specific approaches in tackling food security and nutrition challenges.Instead of doubling tariffs on Chinese solar products, the United States should embrace their affordability, according to one expert.David Fickling, a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion who covers climate change and clean energy, wrote on Wednesday: "We are still not building enough solar and wind farms, nor enough factories for the components they'll use, to make the switch work. Yet President Joe Biden's justification for doubling tariffs on imported solar to 50 percent is that, to the contrary, the world has too many production lines for green tech."In the article, Fickling noted that Chinese industrial policy caused the price of solar panels to fall from about 90 cents per watt in early 2012 to just over 10 cents per watt now."We should welcome that. Reducing the cost of green power is the single best thing the world can do if we're to escape catastrophic warming in our lifetimes," Fickling wrote.Biden contended last month that the low cost of China's solar panels are a result of "policy-driven overcapacity" in manufacturing, "flooding global markets with artificially cheap solar modules and panels".The White House announced on May 14 that tariffs on solar cells and modules will increase from 25 percent to 50 percent in 2024.Fickling said that Chinese clean technology isn't "artificially cheap"; it's just cheap.In an appearance on Bloomberg: The China Show on Thursday, Fickling said that "we're (the US is) still well below the capacity we need"."The amount of renewables waiting to get connected to the US grid is greater than the amount of generating capacity on the US grid as a whole at the moment. So there are these huge bottlenecks." He said "a lot" of it has to do with permitting and grid access, and some of it has to do with finance.But Fickling said, "You can't ignore the tariffs issue. It's clearly something that's not going to change. It's an election year issue. It's not going to change imminently."He said that the United States has installed about one-tenth of the renewable power that China has installed.Fickling said that "it needs to really increase that rapidly" to achieve 2035 net zero emissions.Biden said he put the tariffs in place to protect the American solar industry and companies.But Fickling said that all production lines are going to be needed if the US is to meet the target of decarbonizing its electricity grid by 2035.He cited September's Group of 20 meeting, which called for a tripling of renewable power globally by 2030.Fickling argued that by the end of this decade, the power grid will require about twice as many gigawatts of generators connected to it "as the current one we've spent more than a century building, and all of the net increase has to come from clean power".A two-year US moratorium on tariffs on solar products from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam expired on Thursday.A report released Thursday by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that China installed almost 350 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable capacity in 2023, more than half the global total, and if it maintains that pace, it will likely exceed its 2030 target this year.Global investment in clean energy technology and infrastructure is set to hit $2 trillion this year, the IEA's World Energy Investment report said. Total energy investment is expected to exceed $3 trillion for the first time in 2024."For every dollar going to fossil fuels today, almost two dollars are invested in clean energy," said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.China is set to account for the largest share of clean energy investment in 2024, with an estimated $675 billion, while Europe will account for $370 billion and the United States $315 billion."The United States is now playing catch-up on a technology that has really matured in China, and it's going to be very difficult to recreate those supply chains in a short period of time at a low cost," Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Yahoo Finance. "It's entirely feasible, but it's going to be a long time horizon, and it's going to be far more costly."The IEA report also cautioned that in 2024, the share of global clean energy investment in emerging markets and developing economies outside China is expected to remain around 15 percent of the total."Both in terms of volume and share, this is far below the amounts that are required to ensure full access to modern energy and to meet rising energy demand in a sustainable way, the report said.Agencies contributed to this story.China said on Thursday that it is always open to space exchanges and cooperation with the United States, and called on the US to clear obstacles to such exchanges and cooperation.The remarks were made by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning who acknowledged the attention and recognition the Chang'e 6 mission has received from many countries.The ascender of the Chang'e 6 probe lifted off from the lunar surface on Tuesday, carrying the first ever collection of samples from the far side of the moon. It is reported that NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's extended his congratulations on the success of the mission.China and the US established the working group on Earth science and space science cooperation and the China-US civil space dialogue, Mao said.At the US' request, authorities of the two countries also established a mechanism to exchange orbit data on each other's Mars probes, the spokeswoman said.China-US space cooperation, however, is facing difficulties due to the US domestic legislation, such as the Wolf Amendment, Mao said."If the US truly wants to push forward space exchanges and cooperation with China, it needs to take concrete steps to remove these obstacles," the spokeswoman said.NEW YORK -- David Fickling, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, argued on Wednesday that the United States should embrace affordable clean energy products, especially solar panels from China, rather than double tariffs.Chinese industrial policy caused the price of solar panels to fall from about 90 cents per watt in early 2012 to just over 10 cents per watt now."We should welcome that. Reducing the cost of green power is the single best thing the world can do if we're to escape catastrophic warming in our lifetimes," Fickling said.Chinese clean technology isn't "artificially cheap," a terminology used in Washington D.C., and it's just cheap, he said.The result of capacity in excess of demand is a virtuous cycle of falling prices, innovation and industry consolidation while capacity that falls short of demand causes only inflation and shortages, said Fickling.If Biden's promise of a carbon-free grid by 2035 is to have any chance of materializing, the United States needs to speed up its rates in connecting with wind and solar power farms at nearly 13 times of current rates and 3.5 times that in 2023, according to Fickling.U.S. President Joe Biden is going to need all of the Chinese production lines if he is to meet the target of decarbonizing the U.S. electricity grid by 2035, Fickling said.Globally, the building of solar and wind farms as well as relevant component factories are still not enough to make the energy switch work, he said.The world is falling well short of the tripling in renewables that G20 leaders have committed to in last September and installations will roughly double, instead, according to a recent study by the International Energy Agency.The Harvard Krokodiloes collaborated with East China Normal University's VIVA choir to perform the Mandarin song "On the Field of Hope" at an exchange concert in Jing'an district, Shanghai on May 28. Click the video to enjoy their performance.Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun called for the avoidance of confrontation between the Chinese and United States militaries, despite their differing paths. He made these remarks during his keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Sunday.Dong emphasized that the stability of China-US military relations is crucial to global security and stability. "China's position is consistent and clear: we have always been open to exchanges and cooperation, but this requires mutual effort towards the same direction," he said."We believe that because there are differences between our two militaries, it is even more important to engage in more communication. Even if our paths diverge, we must not engage in confrontation," Dong added.He stressed the importance of prioritizing peace, stability, and trust, finding the right way to coexist, and providing more positive expectations for the world and the region.Chinese Minister of National Defense Admiral Dong Jun told United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday in Singapore that the two militaries must adhere to the bottom line of no conflict and no confrontation, emphasizing that the current momentum of stabilization of military relations is hard-won.Their meeting, which was conducted on the sidelines of the elite security forum — the Shangri-La Dialogue — marked the first face-to-face talks between the defense ministers of China and the US since 2022.China's Ministry of National Defense spokesman Senior Colonel Wu Qian said the two defense chiefs engaged in "positive, pragmatic and constructive strategic communication", which touched on a wide range of topics, including Taiwan, the South China Sea, the Ukraine crisis and the Palestine-Israel issue.According to a news release from the ministry, Dong said that the healthy development of Sino-US military relations is in the common interests of both parties and is a general expectation of the international community.He said the purpose of military communication is to enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstandings and build mutual trust.Dong expressed hope that the US would match its words with actions and work with China to genuinely implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state.He stressed the importance of prioritizing peace, stability and trust, enhancing communication, taking responsibility, advancing exchanges, and exploring a proper way for the two militaries to coexist that aligns with both parties' interests and global expectations.Dong reiterated China's stance on Taiwan and the South China Sea, stressing that the Taiwan question is purely China's internal affair, and external forces have no right to interfere.China firmly opposes the US severely violating its commitments and sending wrong signals to "Taiwan independence" forces, said the minister, urging the US to correct its mistakes and not support "Taiwan independence" by force in any form.Regarding the Ren'ai Reef in the South China Sea, Dong said that China's attitude and bottom line are clear. He noted that while China insists on resolving differences through equal consultation, it will not ignore actions that escalate provocations.After the defense chiefs' meeting, Wu briefed the media on further details of the talks, adding that Dong and Austin also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis and the Palestine-Israel issue.Dong emphasized that China always maintains an objective and fair stance to promote a political resolution and does not supply weapons to either side of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, enforcing strict controls on exports of dual-use items lawfully.Regarding the Palestine-Israel issue, Dong pointed out that China, along with the vast majority of countries, has been actively promoting a cease-fire and peace. He expressed hope that the US would act responsibly as a major power and abandon double standards to contribute positively to regional peace.The spokesman said the 75-minute meeting was aimed at implementing the important consensus between the head of states of the two nations."Overall, the talks help both sides increase understanding and avoid misjudgments, yielding good results. Moving forward, the two sides will maintain communication and exchanges through military and diplomatic channels." Wu said, adding that the meeting also included next steps for military exchanges, such as those among military academies.Wu emphasized that high-level communication and exchanges between the Chinese and US militaries are crucial, but also added: "We cannot expect that all questions between the two militaries can be resolved through a single meeting. From the Chinese perspective, we believe it is better to meet than not to meet, and better to talk than not to talk. More communication and interaction are completely necessary and conducive to the further development of military relations."Gu Juan, an associate research fellow at the People's Liberation Army Academy of Military Sciences, said that the meeting was crucial for eliminating misunderstandings between the two nations."Eliminating misunderstandings involves understanding each other's bottom lines," she said."The US must understand China's bottom line in military relations, which is that China's sovereignty, dignity and core interests are inviolable. The US should genuinely respect China's interests and major concerns in practical actions," said Gu.Joan Rose, member of US National Academy of Engineering, spoke highly of China's role in global research on health-related water microbiology, saying the newly-launched China Chapter of the International Water Association would be a model for other countries.China expects the United States to act on the commitments made by President Joe Biden and meet each other halfway to further stabilize and develop the bilateral relations, a visiting Chinese diplomat said on Thursday."I have made it clear to the US that China is committed to the stable development of China-US relations, while at the same time firmly safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests," Vice-Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu told a briefing Thursday afternoon in Washington."It is not feasible to seek dialogue and cooperation while undermining China's interests, and the Chinese government and people will never accept containment, suppression and deprivation of China's legitimate right to development," Ma added.The top Chinese diplomat made the remarks after talks with Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer in separate meetings on the first day of his four-day trip to the US.Ma said he had an "extensive and in-depth" exchange of views with Campbell on China-US relations and international and regional issues of common concern, and the discussions were "candid and constructive".Ma noted that it is in the interests of both countries and the expectation of the international community for China and the US to implement the important consensus reached by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Biden during their San Francisco meeting in November and to further stabilize and grow the bilateral relations.China will continue to develop bilateral relations based on the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, as proposed by President Xi, the vice-minister said.He said that during his talks with Campbell, he asked the US side to honor the commitments made by President Biden.During the November summit with Xi, Biden noted that he has always believed that the US-China relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the world.Biden reaffirmed the five commitments he made in Bali, Indonesia a year before, i.e., the United States does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to change China's system, does not seek to revitalize its alliances against China, does not support "Taiwan independence", and has no intention to have a conflict with China, according to a Chinese readout of the summit.At Thursday's meeting, Ma underscored that the Taiwan question is the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations."If the US really hopes for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, it should abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués and honor its promise not to support ‘Taiwan independence,'" Ma said.On the Ukrainian issue, Ma said China has always maintained an objective and fair position, committed to promoting peace and dialogue, and pushing for a political solution to the crisis.Ma also met with US Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer, and the two sides had a candid and constructive conversation, building on the summit between the presidents in Woodside, California last November, said a readout from the White House.The two sides discussed ongoing work to continue military-to-military communication and advance cooperation on areas in which their interests are aligned, such as counternarcotics, according to the readout.It said US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stopped by the meeting and exchanged views with Ma on key issues.Vice-Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu will pay a visit to the United States from Thursday to Sunday at the invitation of the US side, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Wednesday.During the trip, Ma will hold consultations with US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, and also engage and communicate with US representatives from various sectors, Mao said.BEIJING -- The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China on Wednesday released a report on human rights violations in the United States in 2023.The following is an abstract of the report. The full text is in the attached file.The Report on Human Rights Violations in the United States in 2023AbstractThe human rights situation in the United States continued to deteriorate in 2023. In the United States, human rights are becoming increasingly polarized. While a ruling minority holds political, economic, and social dominance, the majority of ordinary people are increasingly marginalized, with their basic rights and freedoms being disregarded.Gun violence spills over, while the government's control policies are ineffective. There were at least 654 mass shootings in the United States in 2023. Approximately 43,000 people were killed by gun violence in 2023, averaging 117 deaths per day. Driven by partisan polarization and interest groups, a growing number of state governments have taken the initiative to push legislation to expand residents' rights to own and bear arms. In 2023, at least 27 states did not require a license to carry a handgun.The government has abused its power to monitor citizens' privacy, suppressing freedom of speech and expression. The FBI redirected Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to conduct domestic surveillance, "persistent and widespread" monitoring of the communications of members of the Congress, congressional campaign donors, and anti-racist protesters. A growing number of states have passed legislation banning public schools from using educational materials and books that address specific topics such as race, history and gender. The number of faculty members punished or fired for speech and expression on U.S. college campuses has reached a 20-year high.Deaths from police brutality hit a record high, rendering the police enforcement accountability system virtually non-existent. Police brutality persisted and at least 1,247 deaths were attributed to police violence, an average of roughly three people killed by officers each day. Internal-affairs departments are often more interested in exonerating colleagues than investigating misconduct, making it difficult for police to be held accountable, and more than half of police killings were incorrectly labeled as "general homicide or suicide" in CDC's official death statistics database.The prominent issues of mass incarceration and forced labor make it a "prison nation." The United States is home to 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of the world's prisoners, making it the country with the highest incarceration rate and the largest number of incarcerated individuals globally. Prisons force inmates to work for low or no pay, without benefits, while generating billions of dollars' worth of goods and services annually.The two parties continue to manipulate the election. On the opening day of the 118th U.S. Congress in January 2023, the House of Representatives faced a "Speaker crisis," and 2023 was the lowest water mark for Congress' productivity ever since the American Civil War. The two parties continue to change their ways to manipulate the redistricting and distort public opinion for the sake of party self-interest. There are 16 states that have significant manipulation of congressional district boundaries, and 12 of them are states with serious manipulation of districts as a whole. The general public in the United States is extremely disappointed with the federal government and politics at all levels. A staggering 76 percent of Americans believe that their nation is in the wrong direction.Ethnic minorities in the United States face systematic racial discrimination, as the chronic disease of racism persists. African American are three times more likely to be killed by police than whites, and 4.5 times more likely to be incarcerated. Nearly three quarters of Chinese Americans had experienced racial discrimination in the past year, and 55 percent feared that hate crimes or harassment would jeopardize their personal safety. Native Americans have lived in a constant state of cultural oppression, with their religious beliefs and traditional practices ruthlessly stifled. Racist ideology is spreading virulently in the United States and spilling across borders.Growing economic and social inequality makes life extremely difficult for the poor. The United States has been refusing to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The wealth gap has hit a record high since the Great Depression of 1929 under systematic designs to exploit the poor, subsidize the rich, and segregate the classes. The "working poor" caught in structural poverty lack equal opportunities and are difficult to move upwards. The number of homeless people in the United States exceeds 650,000, the highest since reporting began in 2007. Drug and substance abuse keeps raging. Suicide rates continue to rise.The United States has not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and remains the only UN member state which has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The U.S. Constitution does not prohibit gender-based discrimination. It is also the only country in the world that sentences children to life in prison without parole. The number of people dying from pregnancy-related causes in the United States has more than doubled in the last 20 years. More than 2.2 million U.S. women of childbearing age do not have access to obstetric care. At least 21 states in the United States ban or severely restrict abortion, where safe abortion is largely unavailable. Pregnancy discrimination is widespread, forcing nearly 54,000 women in the United States to leave their jobs every year. Millions of children have been excluded from the federal government's Medicaid health insurance program. Thousands of foster children go missing every year. Audits found state agencies failed to report an estimated 34,800 cases of missing foster kids across 46 states.The humanitarian crisis along the border has escalated, causing heart-wrenching struggles of undocumented migrants. The U.S.-Mexico border is the world's deadliest land migration route, according to the United Nations migration agency. At least 149 migrants perished in the El Paso border patrol region in the 12 months ending on Sep. 30, 2023. In the fiscal year 2023, the number of immigrants apprehended or deported at the U.S. southern border reached more than 2.4 million, another record high. Migrants are also subjected to torture and other forms of inhuman treatment. U.S. border policies facilitate modern slavery. The U.S. government's border policies exacerbate the problem of human trafficking. Unaccompanied migrant children suffer from brutal forced labor and exploitation.The United States has long pursued hegemonism, practiced power politics, and created humanitarian crises. In the theaters of war where the United States conducted overseas "counter-terrorism" operations following the 9/11 attacks, the total death toll ranges from at least 4.5 to 4.7 million people. The U.S. military violates the sovereignty and human rights of other nations via "proxy forces" programs and continued providing arms to conflict zones, resulting in massive civilian casualties. The notorious Guantanamo prison which severely violates human rights is still in operation. Prolonged and indiscriminate use of unilateral sanctions has caused serious humanitarian consequences. The United States has used more sanctions than any other country in the world.In the United States, human rights is essentially a privilege enjoyed only by a few. The country's various human rights problems seriously threaten and hinder the healthy development of the world human rights cause.Full text: The Report on Human Rights Violations in the United States in 2023BEIJING -- China's State Council Information Office on Wednesday issued the Report on Human Rights Violations in the United States in 2023, revealing the country's deteriorating human rights situation with facts and figures.The report calls on the U.S. government to take concrete measures to tackle its human rights problems, and respond to the expectations of the American people and international concerns.The human rights situation in the United States continued to deteriorate in 2023, the report said, adding that human rights are becoming increasingly polarized in the country."While a ruling minority holds political, economic, and social dominance, the majority of ordinary people are increasingly marginalized, with their basic rights and freedoms being disregarded," it said.Noting that civil and political rights have been reduced to mere talk in the United States, the report draws attention to worsening problems including gun violence, partisan fights, police brutality and the ineffective police enforcement accountability system, mass incarceration and forced labor, political polarization, election manipulation, and the declining government credibility."The chronic disease of racism persists," the report said, highlighting that African Americans face serious racial discrimination and inequality in fields such as law enforcement and medical services.Asian Americans have experienced intensified discrimination, the rights of Native Americans have been constantly violated, and "racist ideology is spreading virulently in the United States and spilling across borders," it added.Growing economic and social inequality makes life extremely difficult for the poor, the report said, noting that the United States has been refusing to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.Economic, social and cultural rights are stigmatized as "welfare cheese" in the United States, and the phenomenon of "in-work poverty" is widespread, with the gap between the rich and the poor further widening, it added.The United States has not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and remains the only UN member state which has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, it said, warning of the persistent violations of the rights of women and children in the country.Meanwhile, politicians have "forsaken the rights and welfare of immigrants," it said.Overseas, the United States has long pursued hegemonism, practiced unilateralism and power politics, and created humanitarian crises, it said."In the United States, human rights is essentially a privilege enjoyed only by a few. The country's various human rights problems seriously threaten and hinder the healthy development of the world human rights cause," said the report.The report consists of Foreword; Civil and Political Rights Become Empty Talk; The Chronic Disease of Racism; Growing Economic and Social Inequality; Persistent Violations of the Rights of Women and Children; Heart-wrenching Struggles of Undocumented Migrants; and American Hegemony Creates Humanitarian Crises.More than a month ago, high school students from China and Iowa in the United States' Midwest inaugurated and planted the first batch of trees for the China-US Friendship Youth Woods in Hebei province's Zhengding county, where President Xi Jinping worked as a senior local official from 1982 to 1985.Zhou Yitian, a senior high student from Shijiazhuang Foreign Language School, planted a tree with her new friend, Grace Zorich from Muscatine High School."This is the first time I've planted a tree as big (as this), but I planted a tree before… a very little, little one," said Zorich. Her horticultural skills, including her proficiency with a shovel, impressed her Chinese teenage peers.Zhou said: "I hope the tree grows robustly alongside our friendship. Of course, I'll be back someday to revisit these trees."The woods, which feature species such as the North American red maple, are lush and thriving, and are expected to welcome more US students.In San Francisco last November, President Xi proposed an ambitious program to invite a total of 50,000 American youths to visit China for exchanges over the next five years.Hebei and Iowa are natural choices for boosting subnational bonds as they have enjoyed a sister relationship since 1983 and have had ongoing exchanges in the agricultural sector.Two delegations from Muscatine High School have traveled to China and Hebei this year. The second delegation of 32 students and eight teachers stayed in Hebei from April 19 to 22 at the invitation of the Shijiazhuang Foreign Language School, one of the leading middle schools in the province.It was the first time any of the US high school students had visited the country beyond the Pacific Ocean. They arrived in Beijing first, and then traveled to Hebei before heading to Shanghai to end the tour.During the trip, students from both countries, such as Zhou and Zorich, were paired together.Versed in cultureLiu Feng, vice-principal of Shijiazhuang Foreign Language School, which is affiliated with the main school, said they arranged for the US students to take part in calligraphy and paper-cutting classes so they "can have a taste of Chinese teenagers' school life".They consulted the visitors in advance over the trip's arrangement, agenda, and itinerary to ensure adequate communication between students from both sides during the limited time they had together over four days.The US students said they wanted to take Mandarin lessons with Chinese students.Liu's school selected an ancient Chinese poem "Rural Life" as the centerpiece of the lesson:"Over green grass orioles fly in vernal sky/The mist intoxicates the willow trees./Back early after school, the children try/To fly the kites in eastern breeze."Kristina Devries, one of the US students, admitted that the poem was a bit difficult for her. "It's mainly the tones," she said.Yet after the class, most students could read the poem properly in Mandarin.Observing that the poem echoed the then season of spring, Jasmine Montes, another US student, said, "It is really pretty and I like it."When asked if US children fly kites these days like people did decades ago, Ryan Castle, principal of Muscatine High School, said: "Not as much any more. We used to. With phones and iPads, it's hard to get kids to fly kites."Lyu Fei, an English teacher at Shijiazhuang Foreign Language Primary School, was involved in the special class for the guests and she had no language difficulties when talking to the US students. Her recipe for successful communication included body gestures and the use of humor."They are real quick learners," she said, saying the visitors mastered the poetry faster than she had expected."So, we had some extra minutes to review and practice more. I'm so proud!" she laughed.Another first for the trip was the host school arranging a musical performance that involved collaboration between the Chinese students and their foreign guests.The US students split up and went to several classrooms to be taught how to play the hulusi, or gourd flute, an easy-to-learn Chinese folk music instrument.Later that afternoon, they joined the Chinese students on stage and together they played the song Auld Lang Syne using the hulusi. The performers received warm applause from the audience.Washington's provocative moves in the waters off China's doorstep were among the top concerns raised by Beijing at the recently concluded second round of China-US consultations on maritime affairs.The Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that the meeting was held via video link on Friday.Analysts noted that the meeting was among a number of recent significant official dialogues between Beijing and Washington, including the first meeting of the China-US Intergovernmental Dialogue on Artificial Intelligence earlier this month in Geneva.Such talks are helpful in minimizing miscalculations and for rolling out necessary crisis management measures on sensitive topics or aspects, such as the Taiwan question and the South China Sea issue, they added.The co-chairs of the maritime dialogue were Hong Liang, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs, and Mark Baxter Lambert, the US State Department's China coordinator and deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs."The two sides exchanged views on the maritime situation and ocean-related issues", and the two countries agreed to "carry forward dialogue and communication, avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation, and manage and control risks at sea", the ministry said.China voiced its solemn concern over the US violating China's rights and the US' provocative acts in waters around China.It urged the US to "seriously respect China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and refrain from meddling in maritime disputes between China and its neighbors", the statement said.Beijing asked Washington not to gang up with allies to contain China using the oceans, and not to undermine the peace and stability of the region.On the Taiwan question, China emphasized that the one-China principle is the political foundation of China-US relations and an important basis for dialogue between the two sides on maritime issues.Beijing stressed that so-called "Taiwan independence" activities are the biggest threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.The US should immediately stop supporting and condoning the forces of "Taiwan independence" and put into practice its commitment to not supporting "Taiwan independence", it said.Diao Daming, a professor of US studies at Renmin University of China's School of International Relations, noted that although China-US ties have stopped their free fall, as the two sides have rolled out cooperation in some areas, "this does not necessarily mean that China can live with the US' suppression and containment moves in some other areas"."While China sincerely looks to stabilize its US ties, we have also seen the twofold approach of the US," he said. "The perpetuation of such an approach is not conducive to the stabilization of China-US relations and will bring more potential harm."The two nations held the first round of maritime affairs consultations in Beijing in November.Last month, Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Beijing, and the two sides reached a five-point consensus that included the convening of the second round of consultations on maritime affairs.Also last month, the two countries' militaries held the annual working group meeting of the China-US Military Maritime Consultative Agreement mechanism in Hawaii.zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com.cnBeijing blasted Washington's baseless slander of a Chinese enterprise engaging in subsea espionage on Monday.US officials are privately delivering an unusual warning to telecommunications companies including Google and Meta that undersea cables that ferry internet traffic across the Pacific Ocean "could be vulnerable to tampering by Chinese repair ships", The Wall Street Journal reported last week.US State Department officials claimed a state-controlled Chinese company, S.B. Submarine Systems, that helps repair international cables, appeared to be hiding its vessels' locations from radio and satellite tracking services, which the officials and others said defied easy explanation.The company said in a statement last week that it strictly complies with relevant laws and regulations, international practices and industry standards, and its daily operations are in line with the regulations set by the International Maritime Organization.China firmly opposes the US practice of overstretching the concept of national security to attack and smear Chinese enterprises, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday.The Chinese government always encourages its companies to operate under market principles and international rules, Mao told a daily news conference.The US government has deliberately discredited and oppressed telecommunications companies in China and around the world, aiming to create a global surveillance network dominated by the US with no rival and under no oversight, so as to leave a door open for its blatant eavesdropping and espionage, she said. "The higher the pitch of US framing of others, the clearer the world will see what a 'hacking empire' the US truly is," Mao said.She urged the US government to reflect on its behavior and stop vilifying Chinese companies.zhoujin@chinadaily.com.cnPARIS -- Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he opposed US tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs)."Neither Tesla nor I asked for these tariffs," Musk said Thursday when answering audience questions via video link during VivaTech, an annual technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups in Paris."In fact, I was surprised when they (the tariffs) were announced," said Musk when asked about the Biden administration's decision to raise tariffs on imported EVs from China to 100 percent."Tesla competes quite well in the Chinese market, with no tariffs and no deferential support. In general, I am in favor of no tariffs," he said. "Things that inhibit freedom of exchange or distort the market are not good."Tesla broke ground on a mega factory in Shanghai on Thursday to manufacture its energy-storage batteries, Megapacks, a project hailed by the company as a "milestone."The mega factory is the first of its kind built by Tesla outside the United States and the second plant of the company in Shanghai, following the inauguration of its gigafactory in 2019 with an initial investment of over 50 billion yuan (about 7 billion US dollars).California and China have maintained a strong partnership, marked by a dynamic economic relationship and deep people-to-people exchanges.This enduring connection was displayed at the recent China-California Business Forum, where speakers explored potential collaboration, highlighting trade reciprocity between the Golden State and the world's second-largest economy.In remarks at the forum, Bobby Kotick, founder of Activision Blizzard, emphasized the importance of finding common ground, drawing on his company's two-decade partnership with China."Now, we've had our most talented, productive, capable engineers and programmers working in the studio in Shanghai," he said."If you look at the experiences that I've witnessed firsthand, there's just nothing but opportunity for growth and continued collaboration."Of course, the road ahead is not easy for both sides to get caught up in the rhetoric of "division and distrust", he said."We should focus on embracing the power of collaboration and finding common ground. We need to focus on trade reciprocity, ensuring that the benefits of our academic partnerships are shared," he said.Jeff Leader, founder of Hermes Deployment, said there is a "very, very strong" partnership between California and China."We've run into difficulties from time to time from both sides, but we have successfully transferred technologies between the US and China. It's difficult, but it's very meaningful," he told China Daily.Dee Dee Myers, senior adviser to the California governor and director of the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, pointed out that while national governments primarily manage international relations, diplomacy should be practiced at all levels, including cities and states."California is the fifth-largest economy in the world. So, we need to continue to find ways to leverage that power and use it to help solve our collective challenges," Myers said. "We're really glad to continue to work with our Chinese partners on some critical issues like climate change."Huge potentialStephen Cheung, CEO of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, told the audience that China's economy is strong and will continue to grow in the next few years, and there are a number of different sectors in which LA wants to work with China."China is the eighth-largest foreign investor in California, primarily in the manufacturing sector. These investments have created 90,000 jobs across the state, with 700 businesses already located throughout California, and have contributed close to $2 billion in wages every single year," Cheung said.Richard Swanson, senior adviser to the US Department of Commerce's Pacific South Operations of the International Trade Administration, told the audience about the importance of seeing firsthand where one is investing."I personally invested in China when I found out that my grandfather studied at Peking Union Medical College in Beijing. When I first visited Beijing and toured the Forbidden City in 2005, I didn't realize how close the college was," he said. "Now I am eager to go back and visit my grandfather's college, hopefully very soon."Jim Doucette, EY partner and leader of EY's Global Retail and Consumer Products, said in a panel discussion that there is a significant trend in both the US and China, with younger consumers particularly interested in ecofriendly products."Chinese consumers are consistently across a pretty broad range of goods and services as they want to spend more than the US consumer," he said. "Middle-class growth in China is expected to continue, presenting essentially strong opportunities in both countries over the next five-plus years."The United States and China must strive to maintain their crucial trade relationship, as it is "vital" for the success of both large and small businesses worldwide, according to attendees of the Canton Fair conference in New York.The promotional conference, held in Manhattan on Wednesday, welcomed representatives from the Chinese Consulate General in New York and the China Foreign Trade Centre, which organized the fair, along with Bank of China representatives and small and large global importers and exporters.Hu Wei, president and CEO of the Bank of China US, told China Daily the conference enables business leaders from both countries to "gather and promote trade and investment to China and from China". He said it was "really a testimony of the intertwined business relationship, which is so important"."Unfortunately, we do see some of the changes of back and forth recently (between the US and China)," he said. "We do believe that the two governments can solve them properly to provide a level field for both sides and to provide an acceptable atmosphere for business, so that we can have more opportunities for both sides."The Bank of China is working with businesses at the fair to provide a range of investments.Big Lots Stores, a US discount retail chain, has worked with Chinese manufacturers for more than 30 years.Kevin Kuehl, senior vice-president and general merchandise manager of home, apparel and global sourcing at Big Lots, first visited the Canton Fair in the 1990s."We still have long-term partnerships with our factories in China and those partnerships go anywhere between 20 and 30 years," he told China Daily."The political situation regarding trade doesn't typically come into the conversation because we work as a business group and we continue to stay very close in that aspect."Kuehl cautioned that the company, like many others, is monitoring whether any additional US tariffs on China will be enacted. If so, he said Big Lots will have to "make adjustments to be thoughtful on how we present bargains to our customers".The chain buys furniture, home textiles, pet products, outdoor patio furniture and other goods from China. It recently opened a buying office in Shanghai.Kuehl acknowledged that while the last couple of years had been challenging, having overseas partners was very important."There are certain categories that China just is very efficient and cost-effective at, that even if we wanted to transition products out of China and into other countries, we're not capable of capacity or quality in those categories," he said. "We will continue to partner with China in categories that we know are critically important, and cost is important to our customers."Yao Wenliang, economic and commercial counselor for the Chinese Consulate General in New York, told China Daily that the conference was "a very good opportunity" because China and the US economies are closely intertwined."It's vital, as there's great opportunities for both business communities, so this is a platform," Yao said.Chinese Consul General in New York Huang Ping said the fair showed China's strong commitment to opening its market to the world. He said decoupling was not an option, as the two countries "need each other".Mike Carpenter, who works for the Global Sourcing Group in the US, said he visited the fair in China seven or eight times before the COVID-19 pandemic and described it as "fantastic" and "absolutely huge"."If you go there trying to find, for example, a factory that makes pens, you'll have 5,000 choices," he said.The Canton Fair takes place twice a year in Guangzhou and focuses on technology, production and other industries exporting from China. The next fair is scheduled to be held in October.The United States and China must strive to maintain their crucial trade relationship, as the partnership is "vital" for the success of both large and small businesses worldwide, according to several attendees of the Canton Fair Conference in New York.Hu Wei, president and CEO of Bank of China US, told China Daily: "Unfortunately, we do see some of the changes of back and forth recently (between the US and China).

It was estimated that more than 10,000 American companies participated in the event — the largest foreign group.Big Lots Stores, a US discount retail chain with headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, has worked with Chinese manufacturers for more than 30 years.Kevin Kuehl, Big Lots senior vice-president and general merchandise manager of home, apparel and global sourcing, first visited the Canton Fair in the 1990s."We still have long-term partnerships with our factories in China and those partnerships go anywhere between 20 and 30 years," he told China Daily."The political situation regarding trade doesn't typically come into conversation because we work as a business group and we continue to stay very close in that aspect."Kuehl cautions that the company, like many others, is monitoring whether any additional US tariffs on China will be enacted.

It includes an exhibition hall and convention and business center, covering an estimated 1.1 million square meters with the indoor exhibit at 338,000 square meters and an outdoor area of 43,600 square meters.Mike Carpenter, originally from England, works for the Global Sourcing Group in the US to get global clients unique products.

Seventy percent of participating California companies successfully entered the Chinese markets," she said.A Chinese envoy to the United Nations said that tea is a driving force for economic and social development, as it helps eliminate poverty, improve health and living standards, promote urban and rural development and enhance women's empowerment."Tea is a vivid embodiment of the harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. Tea fields not only bring the joy of harvest to tea farmers but also form a sustainable ecological cycle by sequestering carbon, producing oxygen and conserving water and soil, perfectly interpreting the sustainable development concept of 'lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets,'" said Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN.He gave the speech at an International Tea Day event on Tuesday, organized by China's Mission to the UN and the Xinyang Municipal Government of Henan province, at UN headquarters in New York.Since 2005, tea-producing countries, including China, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Uganda and others, have celebrated International Tea Day. The UN General Assembly selected May 21 as International Tea Day in 2019."Tea is a messenger that promotes exchanges between civilizations among various countries. For thousands of years, tea has traveled along the Silk Road and sea lanes to thousands of households in different countries, creating cultural connections," said Dai."We hope that everyone can feel the charm of tea and share the story of tea through tea appreciation and tea tasting, so that tea can become a link to enhance communication and friendship, help implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and jointly draw a beautiful picture of a community with a shared future for mankind," he said.Sri Lanka, famous for its Ceylon tea, has a history of 300 years of tea drinking, said Mohan Pieris, Sri Lanka's permanent representative to the UN. He added that the tea history goes much further back in China, when Emperor Shennong accidentally discovered tea when leaves from a tree blew into his boiling water.International Tea Day aims to "raise awareness about the impact of tea on workers and growers", "promoting fair trade and sustainable practices within the industry", said Pieris, noting that tea has a long history and significant cultural and economic importance worldwide. He emphasized that tea plays a vital role in rural development, poverty reduction, and food security in developing countries.Drinking tea promotes social interaction and facilitates conversation, providing opportunities for people to come together and fosters inclusivity within the community, Pieris said.Sharing a cup of tea encourages egalitarianism, cultural exchange and mutual learning. Tea drinking can be an educational experience where participants learn about different traditions and rituals.Tea also reduces stress, promotes relaxation and serves as a symbol of hospitality and respect, he continued. Unlike coffee, tea gatherings offer a setting conducive to resolving conflicts and strengthening community bonds, contributing to a shared sense of identity, Pieris said."You see in Chinese culture, in the spring, the jasmine tea is the best. In summer, we drink green tea. In autumn and winter, we drink black tea," Dai told UN employees as they were trying the tea at the event.A whole process of preparing a cup of tea includes boiling the water, warming the teapot and cup, measuring the tea, pouring the water and steeping the tea, removing the tea leaves and serving.Ernest Rwamucyo, Rwanda's permanent representative to the UN, described his whole tea drinking experience as "fabulous".The tea feels soothing, and especially "the process of making the tea, the art, preparing the tea is just so enchanting," he told China Daily. "By the time you take the tea, you really feel that way, you're calming down. It was very nice."It was the first time the ambassador had witnessed the tea-preparation process, which he said was "very special"."The single act of preparing a cup of tea can be an act of kindness, care and connection in the way of the sharing of content and concepts," said Li Junhua, UN undersecretary-general for economic and social affairs. He also emphasized the tea industry's role in job creation, empowering women and improving social conditions.The annual global tea production has exceeded $18 billion, and the trade volume has reached $9.8 billion. It is an important source of income for low-income and emerging economies, Li said.Xu Haoliang, UN under-secretary-general and associate administrator of the UN Development Programme, along with permanent representatives and deputy representatives from more than 50 countries, including Pakistan, France, Switzerland, Austria, Indonesia, Kuwait, Ethiopia, Guyana, and Morocco, participated in the event.During the event, guests attended tea ceremonies, along with paper cutting, dough modeling and shadow puppet performances and participated in a virtual reality experience of traveling through the tea mountains of Xinyang.The accusation made by the United States of China's "overcapacity" in the new energy sector is a "complete deviation from facts", China said, slamming the US for practicing protectionism."China's capacity in the new energy industry is an advanced capacity urgently needed by the green transition of the world economy. It's not overcapacity," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday.Wang made the comments at a regular news conference, dismissing US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's remarks.Yellen said in Germany on Tuesday that China's industrial capacity is "leading to production that significantly exceeds global demand in key sectors, including electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and solar", and that this will be a focus on the Group of Seven meetings in Italy this week.In response, Wang said the US accusation is protectionist in nature.If overcapacity means an increase in exports, "don't the large annual exports of soybeans, planes and natural gas by the US constitute overcapacity?" he said.Setting up barriersThe US is trying to coerce G7 member countries into setting up barriers against China's new energy products under the pretext of "overcapacity", Wang said."This goes against the trend of openness and win-win cooperation, not only harming the interests of consumers in related countries, but also disrupting and undermining the global green transition," the spokesman said.Wang called on the US to abandon protectionism to better address climate change.The US should not ask China to take on more responsibility to respond to climate change on the one hand, while engaging in protectionism and stopping the world from benefiting from China's green products on the other, he said.The growth of China's new energy sector is a result of its companies' technological development and open competition, Wang said, adding that China hopes to deepen supply chain cooperation with all other countries."We hope all countries will stick to open cooperation and reject protectionism," he said.Beijing announced countermeasures on Wednesday against 12 military-related companies in the United States and their senior executives, including units of Lockheed Martin, in response to Washington's arms sales to China's Taiwan region and its unilateral sanctions against Chinese companies.The measures, which include freezing their movable, immovable and other types of assets in China, as well as banning entry for senior executives, took effect on Wednesday, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry.The ministry said that for some time, the US has, in disregard of China's just position and constructive role on the Ukraine issue, imposed illegal unilateral sanctions on many Chinese entities for so-called "Russia-related factors"."Washington's engagement in massive unilateral bullying and economic coercion has severely violated the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, institutions and individuals," the statement said.The ministry also said that the US, at the same time, has been continuously selling arms to Taiwan, which seriously breaches the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, gravely interferes in China's domestic affairs and harms China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.The countermeasures were announced just one day after the ministry announced sanctions against former US lawmaker Mike Gallagher, including a ban on entering China, for his blatant, serious interference in China's internal affairs out of his own considerations and prejudice against China.Gallagher, who stepped down in April, led the pushback from the US House of Representatives against China, including helping to pass a bill that could ban popular video app TikTok if its China-based owner doesn't sell its stake.Speaking at a regular news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said China has unwavering resolve in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and development interests.He added that the nation "will severely punish any individual or organization that goes all out to counter and contain China".Lyu Xiang, a US studies researcher at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the countermeasures announced by the Chinese side are in response to a series of hostile actions by the US against China."The defense companies have, to different extents, been involved in the Ukraine crisis and arms sales to Taiwan, so China is justified to conduct these countermeasures," Lyu said, adding that the sanctions will also have a substantial impact on their businesses.Though the impact of the sanctions on the former lawmaker could be limited, Lyu said China's countermeasures could make companies think twice before doing business with him.Mike Gallagher has seriously undermined China's interests and disrupted China's ties with the United States, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said, commenting on China's sanctions against the former member of the US Congress.China on Tuesday announced its countermeasures against Gallagher.All Gallagher's assets in China will be frozen. Organizations and individuals in China are banned from making transactions or cooperating with him. He is also banned from entering China."In recent years, out of his own selfish interests and bias against China, Gallagher has seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, harming China's sovereignty and territorial integrity," Wang said on Wednesday, adding that his behavior has harmed not only China's interests but the shared interests of China and the US.China is firmly determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and will "impose serious punishment on any person or organization obstinately acting against China," Wang said.When Shanghai meets California, the two major economic entities across the Pacific express their commitment to further develop economic and trade ties while maintaining strong subnational cooperation.Chinese Consul General in Los Angeles Guo Shaochun — addressing the China-California Business Forum in Los Angeles on Monday, at which hundreds of officials and businesspeople from both sides gathered, stressed that the vitality of China-US relations lies with subnational entities."Both California and related provinces and municipalities in China have developed and benefited greatly thanks to mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation between them," he said, citing that opening up at a higher level is an important part of China's efforts to develop new, high-quality productive forces.Guo said that China was California's No. 1 trading partner with two-way trade amounting to over $137 billion in 2023. More than half of the containers entering and leaving the Port of Los Angeles are for trade with China, and 70 percent of the cargo volume at the Port of Long Beach is China-related."The security and stability of the industrial chain and supply chain across the Pacific Ocean matters to both sides," Guo added.California Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis emphasized the importance of maintaining friendly relations between China and California."I hope people take the opportunity to develop friendships and relationships that are so important to us," she said.In his keynote remarks, Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng expressed the metropolis' expectation to further enhance substantive cooperation with California."Shanghai maintains close economic and trade cooperation with the United States. California, in particular, is a key partner for Shanghai," he told the forum.Since 1980, when Shanghai and San Francisco became sister cities, many Bay Area companies have used the relationship as a gateway to enter the Chinese market. In recent years, friendly exchanges between Shanghai and California cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco have been continuously strengthened."Looking to the future, we aim to deepen comprehensive and pragmatic cooperation, achieving a higher level of mutually beneficial and win-win development," Gong said.While welcoming the delegation composed of over 150 top business leaders and trade officials from dozens of Chinese provinces, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass highlighted the economic ties and climate cooperation between Shanghai and LA."Chinese ports are the most significant trading partners for the Port of Los Angeles. Our ports are also leading efforts to decarbonize marine time shipping and port operations," Bass said.She said that China is the sixth-largest source of foreign-owned businesses in Los Angeles and the third-largest export market for LA carrier companies. Nearly 250 businesses from China have expanded to Los Angeles, creating jobs and economic opportunity. Over the last two years, LA companies have exported more than $60 billion in goods to China."The LA-Long Beach-Shanghai green shot shipping corridor is one of the first, the longest, and the busiest transpacific routes to take up this challenge," said Bass. "This important climate cooperation has continued without interruption and with increasing urgency over the past two years."Looking forward to hosting major international events, like the FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2028, Bass said there are "more and more" reasons for Chinese visitors to invest in and partner with Los Angeles.Secretary of California Government Operation Amy Tong, who was born in Guangdong and moved to the US with her family when she was a teenager, shared with audiences how Chinese culture has significantly enriched the state of California, benefiting American communities in numerous ways.California has long been a hub for culture exchange between China and the US, helping Chinese visitors to feel "welcomed at home" and fostering rich artistic dialogue, she said."Numerous museums, galleries and cultural institutions of California have events showcasing Chinese arts, calligraphy, music and dance events like the Chinese New Year celebration, and cultural festivals further strengthen ties and promote mutual understanding," she said, noting that the state has attracted a many Chinese students and scholars.Recalling Governor Gavin Newsom's trip to China last fall, Tong said she appreciated watching his visit with President Xi Jinping, highlighting the importance of people-to-people cultural exchange."The governor's trip was courageous no matter what your political affiliation is," she said. "We need to focus on the culture, the economics and the mutual respect. This is the foundation to our shared relationship."The forum highlighted the important partnerships between China and California, as a a series of memorandums of understanding (MOU) were signed. Among them were agreements between the Shanghai International Port Group and Matson Inc to promote green shipping corridors; the World Trade Center Los Angeles and the Shanghai Foreign Investment Development Board to strengthen economic ties; and San Francisco International Airport and the Shanghai Airport Authority to promote cultural and tourism exchange.Since its inception in 2016, the forum has welcomed thousands of guests from academia, business and government from China and the US, in which participants have engaged in professional discussions on topics, including clean tech, e-commerce, agriculture and innovation cooperation. Shanghai is the Guest City of Honor this year.China's Foreign Ministry issued a set of countermeasures on Tuesday against former US congressman Mike Gallagher, including the freezing of movable and immovable property and other kinds of property in China.China "prohibits organizations and individuals in its territory from conducting relevant transactions, cooperation and other activities with him, and denies his request for visa or entry into its territory", the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.Gallagher, a former US representative, was a Wisconsin Republican and former chairman of the House select committee on Chinese competition. He left Congress earlier this year.He has "frequently resorted to words and taken actions in recent years to interfere in China's internal affairs, undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and infringe on China's interests", Beijing said on Tuesday.The countermeasures against him were based on the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law of the People's Republic of China, the Foreign Ministry said. The decision came into effect on Tuesday.Negative narrativesObservers noted that Gallagher has been among junior members of Congress that frequently participate in negative narratives blasting China, so as to climb higher in their political careers.Since 2017, he has proposed a slew of China-related bills, and The Associated Press called him someone who "has spearheaded House pushback against the Chinese government".Last year, he proposed a bill seeking to block companies of China and other "foreign adversaries" from purchasing land near military bases and other sensitive sites.Last month, Gallagher worked together with congressional fellows, including Representative Jimmy Panetta, on proposing a bill to impose sanctions on any Chinese military firm that provides material support to Russia.The first intergovernmental dialogue between China and the US is a positive sign for collaboration between the two leading countries in artificial intelligence, experts say, which has established a new platform to draw on each other's governance experiences and contribute to global AI regulation.Both sides labeled the meeting "constructive" after talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on May 14.Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Institute for China-American Studies in Washington, said there was a genuine sense of "constructiveness" at the AI meeting, "given that it opened a channel for communication on an issue that will require a degree of cooperation and coordination from both sides for a long time and given its importance"."AI is not going away anywhere," Gupta said, adding it is "ground enough" to label the meeting as "constructive" as the two sides were able to take a preliminary step in establishing a framework for dialogue.Zhu Rongsheng, an expert from Tsinghua University's Center for International Security and Strategy, said that in an era of rising geopolitical competition, it is a significant step for the two leading AI powers to sit down and discuss global AI governance."This new dialogue mechanism not only meets the international community's urgent call for AI governance but also showcases the responsible roles both nations can play," Zhu said."AI-related technologies like deepfakes and misinformation have shown their global impact. By collaborating, the US and China can enhance their regulatory frameworks to protect their citizens and offer guidance to other countries."Responsible roleIt is hoped the United States can work with China in this field to play a responsible role as major powers, jointly establishing rules to protect the interests of the global majority, said Zhu, who is also a senior researcher at Meta-Strategy Institute, a think tank in Beijing.Gupta said: "There's value in all the big players in the system coming and proposing common rules by which AI is regulated at the international level. And so that's also a useful area of dialogue within the framework of this conversation."In the context of current China-US relations featuring a mix of competition and cooperation, this intergovernmental dialogue mechanism opens new communication channels that help both sides clearly express their AI-related security concerns and development goals, reducing misunderstandings and strategic misjudgments, Zhu said.However, the US' suppression and containment of China regarding AI have increased the difficulties in bilateral dialogue in this field, he said.On May 8, a bipartisan group of members from the US House of Representatives unveiled the Enhancing National Frameworks for Overseas Restriction of Critical Exports Act, which seeks to restrict the export of US AI systems to prevent "foreign rivalries" from using US AI technology.Restricting exportsIt also aims to restrict the export of the systems to foreign competitors and authorizes the US Department of Commerce to prohibit US people from working with foreigners to develop AI systems that allegedly pose a risk to US national security.The act defines an AI system as "any software or hardware implementation of artificial intelligence, including artificial intelligence model weights and any numerical parameters associated with the AI implementation".The previous gradual tightening of US restrictions on advanced chips and the consideration of licensing US cloud computing companies to provide advanced AI computing power to foreign customers — especially those in China — are measures to escalate export controls in AI.Such actions are intended to "raise the fences", Gupta said.Zhu said: "The US approach is like 'cutting off your nose to spite your face'."It might also be impractical because AI system encompasses multiple facets such as hardware, software and data. Banning software, in particular, is especially challenging."If the US continues to contain China in this manner, it risks losing potential users and partners for American AI products and services in China. This would not only hinder short-term profits but also pose potential long-term losses for the US."Contact the writers at yifanxu@chinadailyusa.com.Emmy Award-winning producer Bill Einreinhofer digs into the glory of the American Flying Tigers, celebrated in China but forgotten in the United States. His documentary "Valor and Memory" explores the history of China and the US as they fought together against the enemy during World War II, bridging the gap between cultures.Beijing expressed strong condemnation and firm opposition on Tuesday to the so-called forced labor allegation against Chinese companies, vowing to take resolute measures to safeguard legitimate rights and interests of its enterprises.The US congressional investigation released on Monday claimed that carmakers BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and Volkswagen had used components from a Chinese supplier banned in the US over alleged forced labor links.At least 8,000 BMW Mini Cooper cars were imported into the US with components from banned Chinese firm Sichuan Jingweida Technology Group (JWD), according to the report by US Senate Finance Committee chairman Ron Wgden's staff.The so-called Uygur Forced Labor Prevention Act by the US not only sanctioned Chinese companies, but also hijacked companies from all countries onto the chariot of suppressing China in the name of compliance in an attempt to create an economic coercion alliance, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said.Out of self interests, such practice disrupts international trade rules and international industrial and supply chains, which represents US hegemony and bullying, Wang told a daily news conference.Wang said that the so-called act is not about preventing forced labor but about creating unemployment.It does not protect human rights but, under the guise of human rights, harms the survival, employment and development rights of the people in Xinjiang, he said, adding that it is the most notorious act infringing upon human rights in the 21st century.The US Congress in 2021 passed the Uygur Forced Labor Prevention Act law to strengthen enforcement of laws to prevent the import of goods from Xinjiang over the so-called forced labor, which has been repeatedly refuted by China, calling it nothing but an egregious lie propagated by anti-China forces.Students from the United States joined physical education classes at Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU) on Monday, exploring Chinese culture through table tennis and Kung Fu.Dozens of students from Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) played table tennis with their Chinese counterparts and discussed their school experiences.Kayla Kristchil, who has played table tennis at home in America, matched evenly with her Chinese partner during the class. Kristchil, whose father introduced her to the sport, shared that she used to play for hours with her elder sister.During breaks, Kristchil and BFSU students exchanged insights about their respective cities and school life. "We talked about the city and how it is different from American cities. She was wearing a gym shirt, and we love gym shirts too," Kristchil said, noting that physical education classes are not mandatory at IUP.The United States has been celebrating Asian and Pacific American Heritage Month in May, which has prompted reflection on the challenges Chinese Americans face despite their integration into US society, says Zhou Min, a professor of sociology and Asian American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles."Although Chinese Americans are integrating well, they are still affected by dual stereotyping," Zhou said.In 1882 the US Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which was signed by president Chester Arthur, introducing a 10-year ban on Chinese laborers immigrating to the US. The act was the first significant law restricting immigration into the country."As we celebrate Asian Heritage Month it's imperative to acknowledge and address the persistent barriers to equality and inclusion faced by Chinese Americans and other Asian communities," Zhou said.Intertwined with historical discrimination and perpetuated through stereotyping, racial profiling and hate crimes, "modern exclusion" persists, she said."On the one hand, they are lauded as the model minority for their extraordinary achievements. On the other hand, they are considered forever foreigners because of their look."And old negative stereotypes, such as the yellow peril, the threat, are often invoked when the US and China are at odds with each other."For example, in recent years the China Initiative, which focused on alleged Chinese economic espionage, has negatively affected many China-born scientists working in US research universities, she said.The most prominent case was that of Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Gang Chen, a mechanical engineer and nanotechnologist arrested in 2021 and charged with concealing his affiliations with Chinese government institutions, wire fraud, making a false statement on a tax return and failing to disclose a foreign bank account.Even though he was ultimately exonerated, the shadow of suspicion lingers, perpetuating narratives of disloyalty and espionage."Although all the charges against him were dismissed, damage has already been done and is hard to be undone," Zhou said. "Chen's case suggests that Chinese Americans are still suspects of being disloyal Americans, having connections to and spying for China, when China is perceived as America's enemy."Broader challengesZhou, who last year was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences just as Chen was the same year, identifies deeply with the broader challenges facing Chinese Americans, as they may still be viewed with suspicion and mistrust, particularly when geopolitical tensions are high."Such perceptions not only harm individuals' reputations but also undermine efforts toward genuine inclusion and recognition of their contributions to American society," Zhou said.The China-US relationship and the experiences of Chinese Americans are deeply intertwined and complex, she said, and geopolitical tensions between the two countries can have significant direct and indirect effects on the lives of Chinese Americans."US-China relations are good, we are good. (If) these relations are bad we will be negatively affected."Worsening US-China relations would hurt the US, and it would lose out in the global competition for foreign talent from China and elsewhere, she said. Poor relations would also reinforce negative societal stereotypes against Chinese Americans and create new barriers for immigrant integration even among the better off, such as in the case of Chen."For us, China is our ancestral homeland, and the US is our new homeland. It's our obligation as Chinese Americans to facilitate communication, understanding and cooperation between our adopted homeland and ancestral homeland."Chinese Americans have made great contributions to the economic and social development of the US, particularly in science, engineering and medicine, the effect being significant and multifaceted.The demographics of Chinese Americans have undergone major changes over the past few decades, reflecting a shift toward greater cultural diversity. Chinese Americans today come from a broader range of regions within China compared with what they used to.Another shift — a wave of highly skilled professionals and investors compared with low-skilled laborers — is diversifying occupations and income levels, creating a more complex Chinese American community."These changes were driven by international migration, which was affected by the normalization of US-China relations, China's (reform and opening-up), and US immigration policy," Zhou said.The new tariffs that the United States has imposed on a series of products from China is a move by US President Joe Biden to make China a scapegoat for the US' own problems and will eventually make businesses suffer, a British business leader and trade expert said.Jack Perry Jr, chairman of the 48 Group Club, which promotes equal and mutually beneficial trade between the United Kingdom and China, told China Daily he felt strongly over the US decision to impose tariffs on imports from China such as electric vehicles, solar panels, semiconductors and batteries."What they're doing is trying to attack China and make themselves look good … They're trying to point the finger at China, making their own economy worse, but really they should be looking at themselves," Perry said."The American businesses are the ones that are going to suffer from this. American people will have to pay more for the retail price, and businesses will have to pay more for the wholesale prices … It's not about building America better," he said.Referring to the "overcapacity "claim made by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Perry said it is "about positioning America against China, and don't want China to be strong"."The US is talking about (Chinese products) flooding the market. That's not true," he said."Someone asked me, where do you think that America is going to have an issue with, in what sector with China next? And my answer was: whatever sector China is strong in, that's where the Americans are going to have an issue," he said. "It's not about EV cars. It's not about overcapacity. It's not about flooding the market. It's not about anything that they're talking about."It's about the fact that China has evolved. There's no other country that's taken a billion people out of poverty in 30 years. There's no one (like China) that was the factory to the world, but now is where you go for innovation," he added.In April, Perry visited southern China's Guangdong province for the China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair, following a series of business visits to dozens of companies in six provinces across the country.Huge possibilities"Every Chinese enterprise that I speak to out there is looking to do trade. These are successful businesses looking to trade in foreign markets. There are huge possibilities for Western countries," he said about the recent trip to China.The 48 Group Club signed an agreement with the China Foreign Trade Centre during the Canton Fair that gives Western companies more access to products at a reduced price, said Perry, who is also the CEO of London Export Corporation, one of the first companies to trade with China in the early 1950s."Looking at trade and business cooperation between China and the West, it benefits the West to be able to do business with China," Perry said. "If you don't do business with China, your products are going to cost a lot more. They're going to take a lot more time to get there. It's not going to be manufactured at a high quality. China has evolved. They are spearheading and ahead in innovation in so many different areas."Perry said the current geopolitical situation is scaring people from trading with China and working with Chinese companies, but "there are huge opportunities and possibilities, huge roads and paths to be able to succeed in times like this".He said the 48 Group Club will continue to invest in the Chinese market, announcing the launch of two funds later this year at the opening of the 48 Group's China membership in October, and he will take a delegation consisting of executives of private equities, biotechnology and agriculture companies to visit three or four provinces in China for potential cooperation."Whenever there's bad weather, there's sun behind it. I believe business can bring the sun out," he said.BEIJING -- With a claimed purpose of enhancing America's economic future and national security, Washington has launched a fresh round of tariff war against Chinese products, which industry insiders and experts say will actually cripple US economic resilience and could even put American lives at risk.Once on shore, pray no moreOf more than a dozen categories of newly-targeted Chinese goods with an aggregate value of $18 billion, medical supplies once badly needed in the US battle against COVID-19 stand out, as they face unreasonably high tariff adjustments this year despite a significant decline in their sales to the world's largest economy."This round of US tariff hikes was retaliatory and doesn't make sense," Wang Jie, head of a leading medical supplies manufacturer in Central China's Hubei province, told Xinhua.China has been the largest supplier of epidemic prevention products to the United States. From January to October 2020, the latter imported $11.1 billion of epidemic prevention materials from China, accounting for 67 percent of its total imports of such goods.Among them, face mask imports from China hit $6.3 billion, accounting for 85 percent of its total imports of face masks, according to the Office of Textiles and Apparel of the US Department of Commerce.If the new additional tariff rate, a jump from 0-7.5 percent to 25 percent for face masks, was imposed at that time, Americans had to foot an extra bill of at least $1.1 billion on their personal protective equipment expenditure.In April 2020, at the peak of the global battle against COVID-19, the US government banned exports of respirators, masks and gloves, all deemed as "scarce and threatened materials." Export detainments at airports and customs were frequently reported, drawing outcries from other countries.Wang recalled her company, specialized in producing personal protective equipment, including masks, protective suits, and medical caps, had worked overtime to meet surging demand of masks for the United States during COVID-19.Dangerous tariff stuntTo the affected Chinese mask manufacturers, the tariff move has shown a willful America dropping its benefactors as soon as their help is not required."Some US politicians and businesses believe China profited significantly from mask sales during the pandemic, turning a blind eye to the increased costs due to emergency response measures during that time," Wang explained.As the pandemic has gradually waned since 2021, the company saw a sharp decline in overseas orders. Currently, masks account for less than 10 percent of the company's exports to the United States."The impact of higher tariff rates on our goods is minimal," Wang said. "Ultimately, the raised tariffs will not be paid by China, but by US importers and consumers."Observers said that the US move had been driven by politicians' fear of the country's excess dependence on the Chinese industry, as US-based medical mask and glove makers have largely flamed out after surging during COVID-19.It was reported that the Federal Government had funneled $1.2 billion to help boost domestic production of key medical supplies like masks and gloves. But domestic customers willing to pay the price of made-in-the-US alternatives have been hard to find.US mask makers have been lobbying for federal support to tackle with the huge inventories they can't sell. The Biden Administration claimed its actions are "carefully targeted at strategic sectors" and will "protect American workers and businesses."Ironically, some major US clients of Wang's company have already protested to the US government, as using tariff barriers to shore up domestic manufacturing has proven to be an unwise move.It is more of a political stunt failing to address any real challenge smothering the industrial growth on US turf. Serious considerations are needed to clear deep-rooted obstacles, from the persistent demand deficiency, high costs, modest profits to the absence of long-term plans on coping with the need of strategic stockpiles for public health emergencies.Putting up tariff barriers and scapegoating China will do no good to the United States, as such moves could translate into a self-inflicted cutoff of Chinese supplies in any future crisis, observers said.If mutual trust in trade and economic cooperation is damaged, how can Washington expect China to give a helping hand again in case of an epidemic resurgence, they questioned.Setback in green transitionAnother hole in the US tariff politics relates to its unwise stance concerning the EV sector which is dampening its green transition.Bill Russo, founder & CEO of Automobility Limited, a Shanghai-based strategy and investment advisory firm, said tariff walls do nothing to improve the competitiveness of US domestic carmakers. Worse, it creates a security blanket and extends the life of their gas powered vehicles.As a result, US domestically produced goods may struggle to compete in international markets, ultimately jeopardizing the longevity of these businesses in a fiercely competitive landscape, Russo added."Despite all these losses, the US continues to expand the policies that created them," Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor from East China Normal University, told Xinhua.Their objective is to increase economic pressure on China to induce popular discontent, frustrate China's structural reforms, push China into a middle income trap, and derail China's increasingly vanguard positions in tech and green innovation, said Mahoney.He doesn't think the US tariff policy will help the country develop new manufacturing capacities, because "what helped China's EV industry was making it internationally open and competitive."The reality is that the new tariffs are the latest in a succession of anti-trade initiatives, which, taken together, are pushing the United States even further to the outside of norms of free-trade-based protocols, said Ker Gibbs, who led AmCham Shanghai during three US administrations and who is now executive-in-residence at the University of San Francisco.Protectionist practices can threaten the common interests of humanity, said Qu Fengjie, a researcher with the Academy of Macroeconomic Research under China's National Development and Reform Commission.The right solution would be to strengthen cooperation and technological exchanges with China's new energy industry and develop together amid competition and exchanges, Qu said.In response to the new tariffs imposed by the United States, Wang Jie said her company has been considering how to enhance competitiveness and indispensability, including increasing investment in research and development."We're not passively reacting to changes in the international business environment caused by political shifts; instead, we're actively diversifying our options. Even if US buyers choose not to cooperate with us in the future, we're prepared with alternative plans," she said.As a bridge of emotional communication, people-to-people exchanges are crucial to enhancing mutual understanding and trust between countries. Looking back, such exchanges and interactions between China and the United States have never been interrupted, and the stories of China-US cooperation have become more vivid from generation to generation. Themed "My Impressions of China - 100 Stories of China-US Friendship", the fifth edition of the "My China Album" video series comprises 12 episodes from the perspectives of music, film, tea, kung fu, animal protection and more, recording the important moments and touching exchanges between China and the United States and demonstrating the interactions and profound friendship between the two peoples.China and the United States have a responsibility to jointly uphold peace, and there is no single justification to incite confrontation, Beijing's top envoy in Washington said on Thursday."China is willing to be a friend and partner of the US. In the era of war, we fought side by side; in the era of peace, we should also be each other's partner," said Ambassador Xie Feng.Xie made the remarks at the "My China Album: Sharing Our Stories about China" event at the embassy, attended by more than 200 guests, including Harry Moyer, a Flying Tigers veteran, now age 103.During World War II, Captain Moyer fought shoulder to shoulder with Chinese soldiers against invading Japanese forces.Xie said that the foundation of the Sino-US relationship was laid by the two peoples, and its future will be created by them."Currently, China-US relations are still facing serious challenges. We need to forge a closer bond between our peoples and open our hearts to each other, so as to inject more warmth and impetus into this relationship," he said.Since its start in 2019, the "My China Album" video series has rolled out five editions, with the fifth featuring stories of Moyer; Ambassador Winston Lord — US ambassador to China from 1985 to 1989 and a member of the US delegation on the historic trip to China in 1972; and other noteworthy US citizens in 12 video episodes, collectively themed around "My Impressions of China — 100 Stories of China-US Friendship".They capture the heartwarming moments and memories of people-to-people friendships, showcasing the historic interactions and profound bonds between the peoples of the two nations.Xie noted that such stories have shown time and again that the two peoples can forge a profound friendship despite all the differences in systems, cultures and languages.He said that it is important to develop a proper perception of each other, and be friends rather than rivals."Seeing the other as a primary strategic competitor, the most consequential geopolitical challenge and a pacing threat, in disregard of our peoples' will for exchanges and cooperation and the world's expectations for a stable China-US relationship, would only push our two countries toward antagonism, plunge the world into division and turmoil, and ultimately lead to 'self-fulfilling prophesies'," he said.The envoy also said it is important to stay undistracted by domestic politics and avoid creating new hurdles for China-US relations.He added that while China will not interfere in US domestic affairs, including its presidential election, it also firmly opposes any attempt to manipulate China-related issues, exploit China-US relations and damage China's interests during the election.In his first comments on Washington's latest round of tariffs imposed on electric vehicles and other Chinese imports, Xie said the move was driven by domestic politics."This is protectionism in the name of fair competition. The real aim is to contain China's new energy sectors, hamper China's high-quality development and get an advantage in the elections by competing to be tougher on China," he said.The launch of the "My China Album" event serves to amplify the crucial role that people-to-people exchanges have been playing in enhancing China-US relations, said Qu Yingpu, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily.Over the past five years, China Daily has been a partner of "My China Album", focusing on stories of China-US friendship, of endearment and goodwill, and reciprocal kindness between the two peoples, Qu said in a video speech.For example, the 2019 edition focused on the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, and the following year, it featured people from China and the US helping each other combat the COVID-19 pandemic.The 2021 edition of the album, released in May 2022, captured the thrill of athletic competition featuring the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the 50th anniversary of giant pandas in the US became the most popular theme of the 2022 edition."We believe stories of this kind are monumental and worthy of being recorded and retold," said Qu."The more we have explored the domain of China-US people-to-people exchanges, the more deeply we feel obligated and duty bound as China's national English-language news media. We are more committed now," he said.Steve Blake, chief representative for environmental group WildAid in Beijing, said the "China Album" project offers a "really great" opportunity for people like him to tell a story about China."There's so much you hear in the news about challenges between the US and China, but there are millions of people just like me that have a personal story to tell, that our lives have been changed by our experience, whether we're Chinese people in America or Americans like myself in China," he said.huanxinzhao@chinadailyusa.comThe awards ceremony and story-sharing event for the fifth edition of "My China Album" was held Thursday at the Chinese embassy in Washington DC. As one of the 17 winners, John Smagula, the assistant dean of the law school at Temple University in Philadelphia, said that tea culture can enhance China-US relations. Here is what else he had to say.WASHINGTON -- China urges the US side "to stop arming Taiwan and its provocative moves of using Taiwan to contain China," the Chinese Embassy in the United States has said at a press briefing."The US side needs to take concrete actions to preserve the overall as well as mil-to-mil ties between China and the US, and safeguard regional peace and stability," Minister Counselor Liu Pengyu said Tuesday as he elaborated on China's position on the Taiwan question.On the upcoming "inauguration" on May 20 in the Taiwan region, Liu, also the embassy's spokesperson, said the elections in Taiwan are local elections.The result cannot change the basic fact that there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of China; nor can it alter the historical trend of Taiwan's reunification with the motherland, Liu said.The Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China, which is an undeniable, universal consensus of the international community and a basic norm in international relations, said Liu.The Democratic Progressive Party authorities are constantly promoting "de-sinicization" and undertaking separatist activities step by step and attempting to expand Taiwan's so-called "international space," Liu noted.Promoting peace across the Taiwan Strait means opposing separatist moves, and the stronger the commitment to the one-China principle, the more peaceful the Strait will be, he said.Noting that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests and the most important and sensitive issue in China-US relations, Liu said China urges the US side to act on US President Joe Biden's commitment of not supporting "Taiwan independence," "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and not taking Taiwan as a tool to contain China.The US side should stop official interactions with the Taiwan authorities and not make them feel supported in seeking "Taiwan independence," he added.The Taiwan question is China's internal affair, which should be left to the Chinese people, Liu stressed."We will strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the utmost sincerity and the utmost effort. In the meantime, we will not allow anyone to separate Taiwan from China by any means. No one should underestimate China's determination, resolve and capability to safeguard her sovereignty and territorial integrity," Liu said.Noting the recent negative moves and statements by the US side on the Taiwan question, Liu said that the Taiwan question is the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations.The US side invited the Taiwan region to participate in the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer, and certain US officials have made misleading remarks on United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758."We stress that UNGA Resolution 2758 and WHA Resolution 25.1 fully reflect and recognize the one-China principle. They should not be challenged or tempered with. Taiwan's participation in international organizations must be and can only be approached under the one-China principle," Liu said.On US congressional visits to Taiwan and the second phase of negotiations under the so-called "US-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade," Liu said that China firmly opposes official interactions between the United States and the island or US interference in Taiwan affairs that are China's internal affairs.Liu also pointed out that US arms sales to the Taiwan region is a "dangerous bet," which violates the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques.China and the United States have only the responsibility to jointly uphold peace, and no single reason to incite confrontation, Beijing's top envoy in Washington said on Thursday."China is willing to be a friend and partner of the United States," said Ambassador Xie Feng. "In the era of war, we fought side by side; in the era of peace, we should also be each other's partner."The ambassador made the remarks at the "My China Album: Sharing Our Stories About China" event at the embassy, attended by more than 200 guests, including Harry Moyer, a Flying Tigers veteran, now age 103.During World War II, Captain Moyer fought shoulder to shoulder with Chinese soldiers to defend against invading Japanese forces.Xie said that the foundation of the China-US relationship was laid by the two peoples, and its future will be created by them."Currently, China-US relations are still facing serious challenges. We need to forge a closer bond between our peoples and open our hearts to each other, so as to inject more warmth and impetus into this relationship," he said.Since its start in 2019, the "My China Album" video series has rolled out five editions, with the fifth featuring stories of Moyer; Ambassador Winston Lord, a member of the US delegation on the historic trip to China in 1972, and other Americans in 12 video episodes, collectively themed around "My Impressions of China-100 Stories of China-US Friendship".They capture the heartwarming moments and memories of people-to-people friendship, showcasing the historic interactions and profound bonds between the peoples of the two nations.The Chinese embassy in the US hosted the fifth My China Album Award Ceremony and Story Sharing Event on Thursday. Joshua Chiatovich, a kung fu practitioner, was one of the 17 honorees. He said, "I think that events like this need to happen more and more. I think that America and China, my personal belief is that the thing that connects people is culture."The awards ceremony and story-sharing event for the fifth edition of "My China Album" was held Thursday at the Chinese embassy in Washington DC. As one of the 17 winners, Steve Blake, who is enthusiastic about China's environmental protection efforts, said that "(this event) connects our two countries more."Here is what else he had to say.The US' decision to impose additional tariffs on Chinese imports marks a further escalation in Washington's efforts to curb emerging industries in China, forcing Beijing to adopt measures to defend its interests, said analysts and heads of business associations on Thursday.In addition to the existing tariffs under the Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, the US announced on Tuesday additional tariffs on a range of Chinese imports, including electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, photovoltaic cells, critical minerals, semiconductors, steel and aluminum.Notably, a World Trade Organization panel found in September 2020 that the Section 301 tariffs contravened its regulations.After China's Ministry of Commerce vowed to take resolute measures to safeguard the rights and interests of Chinese companies, market watchers said that China has many options to counter Washington's actions that may not necessarily target US industrial goods, but could focus on other sectors.The US' protectionist measures could reignite a "trade conflict "with China and damage the US economy in the process. Since tariffs essentially tax US businesses and consumers by raising the cost of imported goods, this could lead to inflation and harm job growth, said Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University's Institute of International Studies.In the short term, the US might seem aggressive in its efforts to target emerging Chinese industries, but this approach is unlikely to yield practical results in the long run, said Chen Bin, deputy director of the expert committee at the Beijing-based China Machinery Industry Federation.As China has already taken the lead in the new energy sector, with the largest industry chain globally, additional tariffs cannot fundamentally alter the inherent comparative advantages of the Chinese manufacturers, he said.Dismissing the "China overcapacity" narrative, He Yadong, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, told a news conference that the so-called "overcapacity" perceived by some Western countries is not an excess of capacity but rather an excess of anxiety.It shows worries of some countries about their own competitiveness and market share, which they use as a pretext to discredit and suppress China, said He.According to research by the Paris-headquartered International Energy Agency, to achieve carbon neutrality goals, annual global sales of new energy vehicles need to reach about 45 million units by 2030. This is more than three times the global sales in 2023, far exceeding the current global supply capacity.As technology products in the new energy sector are updated and iterated more rapidly, new demand will continually emerge, said He."Overall, the global new energy industry is still in its early stages of development and rapid growth. Rather than overcapacity, there is a relative shortage of production capacity," he said.Sun Xiaohong, secretary-general of auto branch of the Beijing-based China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products, said that share of Chinese EVs exported to the US is fairly small compared to other markets.The number of Chinese EVs exported to the US sharply declined to fewer than 2,000 units in the first quarter of this year, cutting the US market's share of China's global EV exports to less than 0.5 percent, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.With such a minimal export volume, the impact of US tariff increases on Chinese EVs is essentially negligible, said Sun.In a statement released by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade on Wednesday, industries like EVs, lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic cells in China are at the forefront of technological innovation and market competition, deeply embedding themselves in global supply chains and making significant contributions to global efforts in energy conservation and sustainable growth.Concurrently, the US government is providing significant subsidies to domestic industries like EVs and semiconductors, a move that starkly contradicts the principles of a market-driven economy and international trade norms, and threatens the stability and security of global industrial and supply chains, according to the statement.zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cnThe fifth edition of "My China Album", which features 12 video episodes collectively themed around "My Impressions of China-100 Stories of China-US Friendship", will be celebrated on Thursday at the Chinese embassy in the United States.Highlighting people-to-people exchanges over the years, the video collection reveals heartwarming anecdotes, captures moments of historical significance, and tells tearjerking stories of wartime comradeship.There are retrospective stories.A story based in Kuliang traces footprints of an American family, detailing how four generations initiated, cultivated, safeguarded and nurtured a profound respect for and understanding of China, its culture and people.Davyd Booth, a violinist with the Philadelphia Orchestra who was in the troupe during its historic visit to China in 1973, considers music a powerful adhesive that has strongly connected the Chinese and American peoples. He believes the two countries "should become not just friends but great friends".Harry Moyer, 103, is a Flying Tigers veteran. During World War II, he fought shoulder to shoulder with Chinese soldiers to defend against invading Japanese forces. China never forgets American friends and their devotion, Moyer said, because Chinese people are practitioners of, "A drop of water given in need shall be returned with a burst of spring".A family in Muscatine, Iowa, shares firsthand information about hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping in the 1980s, which led to an enduring friendship of 40 years. When members of an American household opened their doors to a Chinese visitor with hospitality, they sowed the seed of goodwill and kindness, which later blossomed into a much-told tale praised far and wide.There are stories depicting young generations and their cross-border collaborations.Students at Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Washington, have made many tours across China. With their Chinese counterparts, they visited scenic spots, tasted authentic delicacies, learned calligraphy, listened to operas and shot hoops.More importantly, the youth of both nations realized the necessity and urgency of being open-minded, understanding and respectful of cultures other than their own.There are stories documenting ongoing scientific cooperation.Chinese and American scientists since the 1990s have engaged in extensive collaboration in various fields, including wild panda ecology, genetic structure, monitoring techniques, captive breeding and disease prevention and control.Experts from the National Zoo in Washington and the San Diego Zoo participated in giant panda conservation and research.It's always important to promote such exchanges, more than ever, said Winston Lord, an American diplomat and US ambassador to China in the late 1980s."'My China Album' and programs like that are needed now to increase understanding and relationships between our two peoples," he said.The fifth season of the "My China Album" is jointly produced by the Chinese embassy in the US, the Chinese consulates general in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago, and China Daily.Chinese display manufacturers are making significant strides in the global market, showcasing their commitment to cutting-edge technology and sustainability at a leading industry exhibition.This year's Display Week, organized by the Society for Information Display in San Jose, California, saw a strong presence from Chinese companies, eager to unveil their latest advancements and expand their international reach.BOE, a Chinese display panel manufacturer and a global leader in the semiconductor display industry, took center stage with more than 50 new products and innovative technologies.Among the highlights were a 110-inch 16K glasses-free 3D display, which the company billed as the first of its kind in the world. Another innovation combined AI with display technology, reducing power consumption of OLED (organic light-emitting diode) displays by more than 20 percent while enhancing image quality.BOE also unveiled its first electric flexible cockpit product, comprising a 17-inch central display with a curvature gradient on the driver's side and a 15.05-inch electric foldable screen in the front passenger area.Sustainability was a key theme for BOE, with a dedicated "green and low-carbon" zone showcasing eco-friendly products like power-efficient laptops, monitors and smartphones.BOE Chairman Chen Yanshun attributed the company's success and the overall progress of the Chinese display industry to an unwavering commitment to globalization and continuous innovation."The semiconductor display industry is a globalized one, with BOE, a company with 30 years of experience in the industry, as an example," Chen told China Daily. He highlighted BOE's global presence, with nearly 60 percent of its market share coming from overseas and seven of its top 10 customers being overseas clients.The company has 20 subsidiaries and nearly 90,000 employees worldwide, with branches in North and South America, Asia and Europe, and manufacturing bases in Mexico and Vietnam.Other Chinese display companies echoed BOE's sentiment.Tianma, a Shenzhen-based display panel maker, reported positive feedback at the exhibition.At the company's booth, the marketing director, Feng Xiuzhen, was busy introducing their new products to visitors. "We have participated in the exhibition every year," Feng told China Daily. "Our primary goal at the exhibition is not to sell our products, but to showcase our technologies and gain insights into customer needs to further expand our global presence."The global display industry is booming, with a projected market size of $314.8 billion by 2032, according to a report by Precedence Research. The growth presents opportunities for Chinese companies, both established players and innovative startups.SeekInk, an e-paper company in Jiangxi province, is riding the "green" wave, capitalizing on the demand for innovative and environmentally conscious display solutions. It is the first time the company has attended Display Week."Our energy-efficient and cost-effective e-paper displays cater to diverse applications, from retail price tags to educational tools and healthcare signage," said Erika Xiao, senior business development manager at SeekInk.She said the company's products have received a positive reception in Europe and expressed her optimism about the US market, highlighting the potential savings in human labor and energy consumption associated with e-paper technology.This confidence in Chinese technological prowess is shared by Sun Mingming, regional director of overseas business development for EverFine Corp, a Hangzhou-based company specializing in near-eye display evaluation solutions.Sun acknowledged China's initial gap in display technology but proudly emphasized the country's rapid progress in catching up and offering competitive solutions at lower costs."Chinese companies are now at the forefront of innovation in the global semiconductor display industry, and the driving force is innovation," said BOE's Chen, adding that the company has invested a total of 12.6 billion yuan (about $1.7 billion) in research and development over the past years.The commitment to innovation has translated into dominance in the LCD market, with China accounting for two-thirds of global production capacity and more than 60 percent of global shipments, according to Chen.Chinese companies also are making significant headway in the OLED field. BOE, for example, has experienced rapid growth in just three years, capturing nearly 20 percent of the global market share in 2023, said Chen."Chinese companies are also making rapid progress in various new display technologies, such as 3D, light field display, quantum dot, and printing display," he said.The Biden administration's new and continuing tariffs on China are opposed by some US industry groups, which fear they could raise already high prices for American consumers and hamper supply chains."Tariffs are regressive taxes that are paid by US importers and US manufacturers and ultimately passed along to US consumers," said Steve Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, in a statement. "At a time when hardworking American families are struggling with inflation, continued tariffs on consumer necessities are entirely unwelcome."The fresh levies announced Tuesday are on $18 billion worth of Chinese imports, including electric vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaic cells, critical minerals, semiconductors, steel and aluminum products.The latest tariffs were the result of a 193-page, four-year review of Section 301 tariffs, released by the Office of the United States Trade Representative on Tuesday. Section 301 is part of the US Trade Act of 1974.The duties are in addition to those on more than $300 billion worth of Chinese goods imposed during the Trump administration."Over the last five years, US businesses and consumers have paid more than $215 billion in higher tariffs for a failed experiment in trade policy," said Blake Harden, vice-president of international trade for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, in a statement."Leading retailers have worked hard to bolster their supply chains to be more agile and resilient in the face of uncertain economic conditions, and shield customers from feeling the impact of these high tariffs; but after carrying the weight of Section 301 tariffs for over five years, one thing is abundantly clear: tariffs are taxes ultimately paid by American businesses and consumers — not China," he said."Broad-based tariffs are not strategic and will impede US economic growth — ultimately hamstringing American businesses trying to compete globally and negatively impacting the paycheck of American workers," Harden said.The tariffs are "unfortunate for American consumers, who are still feeling the pain of inflation eating into their annual household earnings", said Yael Ossowski, deputy director of the Consumer Choice Center, a non-partisan advocacy group, to The Washington Times. "This is going to add price inflation across the board all in the name of ‘tough guy' election-year politics."The US Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Wednesday that the consumer price index increased 3.4 percent in April year-over-year, after rising 3.5 percent in March.Ryan Hass at the Brookings Institution wrote last month that the trade war with China "came at a heavy cost to the American economy, with job losses, and a regressive tax on consumers from higher import costs.At a briefing at the Chinese embassy in Washington on Tuesday, spokesperson Liu Pengju said that the new tariffs will significantly drive up the cost of imported goods and inflict more losses on American companies and consumers.He said that the World Trade Organization (WTO) "has drawn a clear conclusion that the Section 301 tariffs violate WTO rules and international law"."As one of the founders of the WTO, the United States has not only failed to be a role model in complying with WTO rules, but taken the lead in breaching them," he added. "By so doing, the US can hardly embody the ‘fair competition' it champions, nor can it keep its credibility in the international community," Liu said.US Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, expressed concern Tuesday over the tariffs' impact on his Midwestern farming state, which is an exporter of agricultural products."I'm for free trade, because Iowa manufactures and does services, and does agriculture way beyond what we consume domestically, and we must be exporting," Grassley told AgriTalk, a radio show and podcast. "I think that this is going to invite retaliation by China, and it's possible retaliation could be (against) agriculture," he said.A 2021 working paper, "Trade Protectionism and US Manufacturing Employment" by Chunding Li, Jing Wang and John Whalley found that protectionist measures reduce jobs in manufacturing.The economists' models showed that in a scenario of unilateral US action against Chinese imports, tariff rates of 30 percent, 45 percent and 60 percent would reduce American manufacturing employment by 1.3 percent, 1.8 percent and 2.15 percent, respectively.In a bilateral trade standoff scenario with China, tariffs of 30 percent, 45 percent and 60 percent would reduce US manufacturing jobs by 2.6 percent, 3.3 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively. That would translate into between approximately 300,000 to 850,000 jobs lost, the economists found."This suggests that the US wanting to save manufacturing employment through trade protection measures may be unachievable," the paper concluded."Most economists view tariffs as a bad idea because they prevent a country from reaping the benefits of specialization, disrupt the movement of goods and services, and lead to a misallocation of resources," wrote Ryan Sweet. chief US economist at Oxford Economics, CNN reported.Agencies contributed to this story.Analysts said Beijing and Washington have taken a step forward together in a responsible way to boost global awareness and concerted actions on artificial intelligence, as the first meeting of the China-United States intergovernmental dialogue on AI was held in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday."The two sides had in-depth, professional and constructive exchange of views on AI science and technology risks, global governance, and other issues of concern," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.At the meeting, both sides acknowledged that the development of AI technology poses both opportunities and risks.They also reaffirmed their continued commitment to the implementation of the important consensus reached by the two heads of state in San Francisco in November.Co-chairs of the meeting were Yang Tao, director-general of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Seth Center, US State Department's acting special envoy for critical and emerging technology and Tarun Chhabra, senior director for technology and national security at the White House National Security Council."The two sides shed light on their respective views on the risks of AI technology and governance initiatives, as well as measures taken to drive AI to empower economic and social development," the ministry said.China said it wants to ensure AI technology is "helpful, safe and fair".During the meeting, China also made clear its position on the US side's restrictions and suppression of China in the field of AI.Yang Mingjie, president of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said China-US cooperation on artificial intelligence is "of paramount importance "in terms of strategic implications.He said both China and the US, to some extent, are forerunners in the AI sector. "What the meeting conveys is actually the responsible attitude of the two countries toward the next step in the development of AI.""China and the United States, as major AI countries, have the responsibility to jointly study and think about countermeasures in advance against the risks that may arise in the development of this technology," he said.Yang pointed out that the current global science and technology community is facing the effects of AI and other new technologies that are like "a double-edged sword", and the disparity is widening among countries in the field of science and technology.Su Xiaohui, deputy director of the Department of American Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, said China is working hard to shorten this gap and enable more countries to grab this opportunity."So when it comes to setting rules for AI governance, China underscores important multilateral organizations and tapping the due role of the United Nations to make sure the AI does not end up as a vehicle for some countries to realize their own selfish interests or to suppress, frustrate and encircle other nations," she added.During Tuesday's meeting, Beijing expressed support for strengthening the global governance of AI and emphasized the need for utilizing the role of the United Nations as the main channel for the purpose.China said it is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with the international community, including Washington, to form the global AI governance framework and standards that enjoy broad consensus.Yang, the CICIR president, said the efforts of developing countries to catch up with and even to overtake richer nations in science and technology may face "systematic crushing" by some leading nations.Yang warned that some nations leading in technology are introducing export control measures and building protectionist "walls" and their own "yards".At the meeting, the Chinese side was also represented by officials from the Ministry of Science and Technology, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Cyberspace Administration of China and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.The US side was represented by officials from the National Security Council, the State Department, and the Department of Commerce.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the United States has urged the US to "earnestly" abide by World Trade Organization rules and immediately cancel the additional tariffs it decided to impose on electric vehicles and some other products from China.The United States is increasing tariffs on $18 billion worth of Chinese imports, targeting a variety of imports from China, including electric vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaic cells, critical minerals, semiconductors, steel and aluminum products.The fresh levies come on top of the already massive tariffs imposed on more than $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, which were introduced during the Trump administration, according to the results of a four-year review of the Section 301 tariffs, released by the Office of the United States Trade Representative on Tuesday."The latest move by the US is typical unilateralism, political maneuvering and hegemonic bullying," embassy spokesperson Liu Pengju told a briefing in Washington on Tuesday.Liu, also a minister counselor, said that the US side is using its Section 301 tariff review in an "arbitrary" way, and that instead of correcting its wrong practices, the US is going further down a wrong path.China is gravely concerned about the US moves and will do whatever necessary to defend its own interests, he said.Slapping new tariffs on Chinese products runs counter to US President Joe Biden's words of "not seeking to contain China's development" and "not seeking to decouple with China", and it contradicts the spirit of mutual understandings between the two presidents and severely undermines the atmosphere of bilateral cooperation, Liu said.Liu noted that the US move will only significantly drive up the cost of imported goods, inflict more loss on American companies and consumers, and make the US consumers pay even more."The WTO has drawn a clear conclusion that the US' Section 301 tariffs violate WTO rules and international law," the spokesperson said.As one of the founders of the WTO, the United States has not only failed to be a role model in complying with WTO rules, but taken the lead in breaching them, he added."By so doing, the US can hardly embody the ‘fair competition' it champions, nor can it keep its credibility in the international community," Liu said.He stressed that the US' move will not stop China's development and rejuvenation, but will only spur the Chinese people to forge ahead with greater determination.Taiwan question 'first red line'Also at the briefing, Liu commented on the recent negative moves and statements by the US side, stressing that the Taiwan question is the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations. Recently, the US official invited the Taiwan region to participate in the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer, and certain US officials have made misleading remarks on United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758."We stress that UNGA Resolution 2758 and WHA Resolution 25.1 fully reflect and recognize the one-China principle," Liu said. "They should not be challenged or tempered with. Taiwan's participation in international organizations must be and can only be approached under the one-China principle."On US congressional visits to Taiwan and the second phase of negotiations on the 21st Century Trade Agreement, Liu said that China firmly opposes official interactions between the US and the island or US interference in Taiwan affairs that are China's internal affairs.Liu also pointed out that US arms sales to the Taiwan region is a "dangerous bet", which violates the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués."We urge the US side to stop arming Taiwan and its provocative moves of using Taiwan to contain China. The US side needs to take concrete actions to preserve the overall as well as mil-to-mil ties between China and the US, and safeguard regional peace and stability." Liu said.The United States' additional tariffs on certain Chinese products are unlikely to have a severe impact on the industries concerned in China, said analysts, noting the US move is motivated not by economic factors but by political purpose, designed to demonstrate a tough stance against China.On top of existing tariffs under the Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, the US government decided on Tuesday to impose additional tariffs on its imports of Chinese products like electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, solar cells, critical minerals, semiconductors, steel, aluminum, port cranes and personal protective equipment.Starting this year, the US government will increase tariffs on imported Chinese EVs from 25 percent to 100 percent.Additionally, the import tax on Chinese solar cells will rise from 25 percent to 50 percent. Tariffs on certain Chinese steel and aluminum imports will also see a significant hike from 7.5 percent to 25 percent.After China's Ministry of Commerce vowed on Tuesday to take resolute measures to safeguard rights and interests of Chinese companies, market watchers said China has a number of options to respond to this move that might not necessarily target US vehicles but could affect other areas.Currently, Chinese EVs have a small market share in the US, so the immediate effects of increasing tariffs would be relatively limited, said Dong Chao, head of the institute of circulation and consumption under the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.However, the rationale behind the US approach is that without intervention, the market share of Chinese EVs in the US would inevitably rise. Taking action after becoming dependent on the Chinese supply chain would entail greater costs, said Sun Lei, a senior partner at Beijing Dacheng Law Offices.The pressure on Chinese companies to invest and build factories in other parts of the world will increase, accelerating their decision-making processes, said Sun.Because the automotive supply chain is extensive, relocating car assembly lines and production to other countries could affect the entire supply chain, including steel, aluminum, engine technology and lithium batteries, he said."Take lithium batteries for another example. Many global EV brands rely on China's supply chain, from Tesla and Toyota to BMW and Mercedes-Benz. With the new US tariffs, the costs for these automakers' EVs are likely to increase, ultimately affecting consumers," said Ding Rijia, a professor specializing in energy economy at the China University of Mining and Technology in Beijing.Highlighting that China's steel, aluminum and automobiles currently constitute only a small portion of the US supply chain, Ding said that rather than suppressing niche markets, the latest measures by the US government are more about curbing anticipated import growth.Sharing similar views, Lin Boqiang, head of the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University in Fujian province, said that the purpose of the US' additional tariffs on Chinese solar products is still to suppress the industry's development. China's photovoltaic industry has a significant advantage in technology, prices and after-sales service, thanks to years of large-scale development and technological iterations."They are worried that China's PV industry will quickly dominate the global market, leaving limited growth space for them," said Lin."However, the direct impact of this move on China's PV industry is limited, as exports to the US are not significant. It may have a certain impact on market expectations though."According to data from the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, solar modules export market had become more diversified last year. However, in the first 10 months of 2023, the top 10 export markets did not include the US, whose market share was lower than that of Germany's 2.6 percent at No 10.Liu Yiyang, deputy secretary-general of the CPIA, said the US sees about 40 gigawatts of new installations of solar power facilities each year on average, which is less than 10 percent of the global market share.Moreover, against the backdrop of global energy transition to the green mode, Chinese solar products have a strong price advantage, and global demand is still strong. The country's solar product exports are developing toward a diversified direction, said Liu.Contact the writers at zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cnForeign Minister Wang Yi accused the United States on Wednesday of repeatedly imposing unilateral sanctions to suppress China, vowing such bullying and hegemonic behaviors would be crushed by wheels of history.His comments came as the US slapped major new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaic cells and others on Tuesday.For some time, the US has launched the Section 301 investigation targeting Chinese maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors. It has also imposed sanctions on nearly 60 Chinese entities and revoked certain licenses for exports to Chinese tech giant Huawei.Wang said the US frequently imposing unilateral sanctions, abusing Section 301 investigation to suppress China's normal trade and economic activities are the most typical bullying behaviors in the world.It demonstrates that some people in the US have reached a level of irrationality in order to uphold US unipolar hegemony, he added.Wang said Washington resorting to all means to unscrupulously suppress China does not prove its strength but rather exposes a lack of confidence.It cannot solve the US' own existing problems but will further disrupt the normal operation of the international production and supply chains, he added.Instead of hindering China's development and rejuvenation, the foreign minister said such moves would inspire the 1.4 billion Chinese people to work even harder.The World Trade Organization has clearly concluded that the US Section 301 tariffs are violations of its rules and international law.Wang said International businessmen with basic common sense hold the view that the US actions harm others without benefiting the US itself.He slammed the US, as one of the founding members of the WTO, for not only refusing to set a good example but also leading in violating rules.Instead of righting wrongs, the US reinforces them, he added.Wang questioned the US: "How can the US explain the fair competition it advocates? How can it gain trust from the international community?"Wang reiterated that unilateral acts and protectionism go against the trend of the times. At this critical moment of global economic recovery, he said the international community should warn the US not to create new troubles for the world anymore. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday that the US tariff increases on electric vehicles and semiconductors from China is another mistake Washington has made after it continuously politicizes economic and trade issues."This will significantly push up the costs of imported products and it is the consumers in the US that will suffer more losses," Wang said at a regular news briefing in Beijing.US President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that he is quadrupling tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100 percent and imposing new levies on computer chips, solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.Wang cited a report from the rating agency Moody's Investors Service saying that US importers absorbed more than 90 percent of the additional costs caused by the increased US tariffs on Chinese goods.Wang said that Washington's protectionist measures will also further undermine the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains."As some European politicians have said that the increased tariffs is the worst policy that will undermine the global trade," he said."We urge the US side to abide by the World Trade Organization rules and immediately withdraw its tariff increases. We will do everything we can to safeguard our interests and rights," the spokesman said.The US government's latest move to slap heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, including electric vehicles and solar cells, shows protectionism and industrial policy is the new consensus approach to economic challenges, which is an "unfortunate shift" in US policy, a senior economist said on Tuesday.The United States is increasing tariffs on $18 billion worth of Chinese imports, targeting electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, steel and critical minerals, the White House said on Tuesday.The fresh levies come on top of the already massive tariffs imposed on more than $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, which were introduced during the Trump administration, according to the result of a four-year review of the China Section 301 tariffs, released by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on Tuesday.The review was undertaken under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which Trump invoked to first launch the China tariffs in 2018.The centerpiece of the new tariffs is a quadrupling of levies on Chinese EVs to 100 percent starting this year, an attempt analysts said would likely result in thwarting the Biden administration's own efforts to fight climate change by speeding up EV adoption.Erica York, a senior economist and research director with the Tax Foundation's Center for Federal Tax Policy, said that at present, consumers are not likely to see an immediate increase in costs because Chinese EVs are already locked out of the US market."Longer term though, it means American consumers will lack choices, including competitively priced and innovative Chinese EVs and face higher prices for green tech and green energy at home," York told China Daily on Tuesday.York's organization has estimated that the current tariffs and retaliation will reduce long-run US output by about 0.25 percent, costing thousands of jobs and reducing incomes.Maintaining the current tariffs, which have been costly to American consumers and the manufacturing sector, and doubling or quadrupling down on the approach, will further increase costs, insulate US businesses from competitive pressures that lead to long-run improvements, and put US manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage abroad, according to York."Protectionism and industrial policy are not a recipe for success; instead, policymakers should pursue reforms that encourage investment, innovation and competition," she added.The tariffs that take effect this year also cover solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminum products, according to a statement from the USTR.The tariff rate on semiconductors will surge from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year, while levies on Chinese EV batteries and battery parts will more than triple to 25 percent by 2026.Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, noted that as some tariffs are to be phased in over a couple of years, they won't have an "immediate" effect."But for sure they will delay the rate of EV adoption and hurt the clean-air agenda," Hufbauer said of Biden's climate agenda, which includes ramping up the adoption of EVs to cut US greenhouse gas emissions.The expert said that the tariffs are a "definite negative" for US-China relations.China's Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday that the US tariff hike goes against the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries and the promises of President Joe Biden, and will "seriously affect the atmosphere of bilateral cooperation"."I expect China to retaliate in a measured way against iconic US exports," Hufbauer said. "I'm sure Beijing is studying the menu."The Commerce Ministry said China will take "resolute" measures to safeguard its own rights and interests, according to a statement.US media reports on Tuesday pointed to the fact that the tariffs in an election year come in the middle of a heated campaign between Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, where they both resort to China-bashing tactics.A new set of polls show that Trump leads Biden in five of six crucial election battleground states, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania."The timing is specifically aimed at voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan — auto and steel states," Hufbauer said."Since Trump promises equal or higher tariffs, I doubt the announcement will shift many votes toward Biden, but it may avoid further losses to voters who welcome protection," he added.Douglas H. Paal, distinguished fellow of the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Tuesday's announcement of fresh tariffs constituted one form of the US response to the "serious trade issues" with China."When leaders are weak in election years, they resort to popular measures that may be less effective in reality than in rhetoric. That is where we are," Paal told China Daily.Trade bodies 'disappointed'Hours after the release of the results of the review of the China Section 301 tariffs, US trade organizations said they were highly disappointed by the outcome."The decision to extend Section 301 tariffs on a wide range of apparel, footwear, accessories, and textiles — while not unexpected — is a real blow to American consumers and manufacturers alike," said Steve Lamar, president and chief executive officer of the American Apparel & Footwear Association."The Biden Administration has had two years to get it right. Unfortunately, they doubled down on a flawed tariff policy, despite the Biden Administration's own acknowledgment that this policy has failed in its goals, and overwhelming public input that supported a different outcome," he said in a statement.The National Retail Federation also said it was "extremely disappointed" that the USTR and the Biden administration had chosen "to double down on a failed and inflationary strategy by sustaining and expanding the Section 301 China tariffs"."Maintaining these tariffs on consumer goods will increase costs that consumers pay on everyday products imported from China,"said David French, executive vice-president of government relations.The US-China Business Council, a nongovernmental organization representing many of the world's largest brands doing business in China, also noted that maintenance of the prior tariffs — with no reductions — and imposition of additional tariffs ultimately make it harder for American companies to compete in the US and abroad, cost American jobs, and increase prices for US manufacturers and consumers during a time of ongoing inflation."Additionally, levying new tariffs invites retaliation from China, which combined could further disadvantage US companies selling goods and services in China's market compared to their foreign competitors," USCBC President Craig Allen said.The Biden administration's plan to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and batteries has raised questions on social media, with some calling it anti-climate, anti-competitive and an election year gambit.Kristoffer Santucci, a stock trader, wrote on X: "Biden gives Plug Power (a US fuel cell company) a $1.66 billion loan commitment and simultaneously tariffs China green energy related EV parts and metals. That's exactly how you stimulate inflation, fueling the fire, trying to keep this boat afloat through fiscal spending.""I'm really curious how the team behind Biden's new China tariffs expects to hit 2030 targets for electric vehicles when they slap huge tariffs on batteries and components for batteries that fuel the EVs," posted "Will" on X."What to make of Biden's 100% tariff on Chinese EVs in light of the ‘existential crisis' posed by climate change that EVs are meant to combat? I look forward to the logical pretzels Biden's defenders are about to twist themselves into," wrote Marian L Tupy, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, on X."If climate change is an existential threat and your top priority, why would you quadruple tariffs on cheap, Chinese EVs? How is this going to achieve a zero-carbon economy by 2040?" wrote "ConservativeNotCrazy", publisher of InsideSourcesDC."You can't possibly think these people take climate change or inflation seriously if they want to increase the price of carbon reducing technologies," posted Sid Prabhu on X."Protectionism taken to an extreme. China makes affordable EVs that move the industry forward," posted David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital Management. "But they will be made artificially expensive by tariffs, thus further crushing the growth in EV adoption."Nikhil Tiwari, who works in capital markets, posted: "Just when China started to pocket the market share for EVs around the world, Biden imposed tariffs on China's EVs and ancillaries. This is the decade of trade wars. Trade wars are highly inflationary.""One year ago, people on X were telling me that nobody in the US or Europe would buy a Chinese EV. Today, automakers and politicians in America are freaking out about China taking over the electric car market," wrote S.L. Kanthan, a columnist and podcaster in India, to his 136,000 followers on X. "Hence the increase of tariffs from 25% to 100%. You can't hide from competition forever!""Early indications are that we'll see competition between the two US presidential candidates this November over who will introduce the biggest trade tariffs on Chinese EVs," wrote David Watson, a proponent of clean energy in the UK."While you may be right about there being situations where tariffs can work, such an approach does not look good for US EVs. I believe the US has had a 27.5% tariff on Chinese cars since the Trump years. Raising the levies further signals it's a long road to US EV competitiveness," wrote Ted Dixon, CEO of INK Research, a financial information firm in Vancouver."For what I believe is the umpteenth time — regardless of party or president — tariffs are paid by American consumers," wrote Kai Ryssdal, who works for nonprofit news organization Marketplace, to his 266,000 followers on X."Biden hiking tariffs on Chinese EVs is sad mostly because USA automakers refuse to produce an EV at $10K — which is what the Chinese are doing. I'm looking at you, Elon!" posted Joe Krulder, Ph.D.Shares of Austin, Texas-based EV maker Tesla, where Elon Musk is CEO, closed at $177.55, up $5.66, or 3.3 percent.Ben Chu, economics editor for BBC Newsnight, wrote: "The big deal in these new US tariffs on Chinese imports is not really the 100% tariff on electric vehicles (EVs), given US EV imports from China are negligible, but the increase in the tariff rate on lithium-ion batteries from 7.5% to 25%."Ricky J. Marc, J.D., M.S., posted on X: "Chinese EVs smacked w/a 100% tariff? I mean if you're scared, go to church or get a dog, because God-forbid we're all able to afford EVs, reducing emissions and a reliance on petrol prices, right? Teslas don't have to be the only major EV option."There aren't that many Chinese EVs currently in the United States, but with how cheap they are, it was only a matter of time before the tariffs started," posted Ryan Egan."These Biden tariffs hurt the American consumer. We are forced (to) pay more for Chinese EVs or buy … inferior American EVs. We are forced to subsidize an inefficient US auto industry," wrote Richard D. Cadena."An electric SUV that converts into a pickup truck in which you can camp out? Yep, China's Changan made one. Not a single US or European carmaker will take the risk to produce a ‘niche' EV like this. Get why US and Europe are scrambling to impose more tariffs on the Chinese?" posted "Facts Chaser" on X.Of the US move, Rukumis Geopolitics wrote "In the long term, it will have a more negative impact on the US than on China, as we saw how Huawei was able to circumvent and withstand the US pressure and sanctions."Chinese EV manufacturers are not only equipped to withstand the impact of US tariffs but can also leverage these challenges as catalysts for further growth and innovation."The Biden administration's doubling of the import tax on Chinese solar cells to 50 percent on Tuesday has been opposed by some US contractors.The increase "will protect against China's policy-driven overcapacity that depresses prices and inhibits the development of solar capacity outside of China", a White House fact sheet said. The administration is planning to exclude from tariffs equipment used to produce domestic solar panels.The issue of tariffs on solar products has pitted US manufacturers that want protection from what they see as cut-rate Chinese competitors against contractors and installers who seek low-priced imported panels.Jim, a house builder in Charleston, South Carolina, who asked that his full name not be used, said it was the wrong decision."South Carolina has the sunshine, and I need the solar panels to capture it," he told China Daily. "The new tariff will mean I will pay more and so will the customer."He noted that many of his customers are recent retirees who moved to the state because of a lower cost of living and he said they won't be able to afford any price increase.Keith, who said he has sold real estate in Charleston and the area for 15 years and asked that his full name not be used, told China Daily, "It's hard enough now with interest rates to sell anything. People want solar because it will lower their electric rates. But they will choose spending more money to put in a pool over a higher cost for many solar panels."Abigail Ross Hopper, the president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group whose membership includes importers and installers, said the new tariff also will effectively mean another hurdle in the Biden administration's goal of transitioning the US to cleaner energy."This misstep will have a devastating impact on the US solar market at a time when solar prices are climbing, and project delays and cancellations are adding up," she said in a statement.One of the key steps in the global solar industry supply chain — the production of polysilicon solar wafers that are processed into solar cells — takes place almost entirely in China.Although American companies can create raw polysilicon, and a handful of US factories produce solar modules, the industry is almost entirely dependent on China for the middle of the supply chain, according to solar industry experts. No American factory produces solar wafers or cells at scale.The Trump administration imposed a separate set of global tariffs on the solar industry in 2018. In February, the Biden administration extended those tariffs but reduced their scope by doubling the number of solar cells that can enter the US without facing any levies, an attempt to resolve the conflicting interests of the domestic producers and domestic installers.Chinese solar cells represented less than 1 percent of total US solar cell imports in the first half of 2023, according to data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.In 2012, the US barred almost entirely the use of solar cells and modules made in China with prohibitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties, which rerouted US solar supply chains to Southeast Asia, said Pol Lezcano, a senior solar analyst at BloombergNEF.Western officials and experts voiced deep concerns over US President Joe Biden's decision to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, solar cells, batteries, steel and aluminum, and critical minerals worth $18 billion.Tariffs on EVs from China will jump from 25 percent to 100 percent this year, while the tariffs on semiconductors from China will shoot up from 25 percent to 50 percent by 2025, the White House said on Tuesday. The tariffs on Chinese lithium-ion batteries will rise from 7.5 percent to 25 percent, and tariffs on Chinese solar cells will increase from 25 percent to 50 percent and tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum will go from zero and 7.5 percent to 25 percent, all starting this year.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson expressed their reservations about possible Europe Union tariffs on Chinese EVs when asked about Biden's announcement during their press conference in Stockholm on Tuesday."As far as tariffs are concerned, we are in agreement that it is a bad idea to dismantle global trade," Kristersson said.Scholz stressed that half of EVs imported from China were made by Western manufacturers."There are European and North American manufacturers that succeed on the Chinese market and which sell their vehicles in China, we need to remember that," Scholz said, noting the importance of trade between the West and China."Protectionism and election populism run wild," Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former Swedish prime minister, commented on Biden's message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he had just imposed a series of tariffs on goods made in China."This is horrible news for American consumers and a major setback for clean energy," Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, said on X."Tariffs are a direct, regressive tax on Americans and this tax increase will hit every family," he said.It is widely believed that Biden's decision is aimed to win more union voters just six months ahead of the 2024 US presidential election. But studies by multiple US think tanks have shown that former US president Donald Trump's punitive tariffs on China, which Biden has kept, have failed to bring jobs back to the US but hurt US consumers and drove up inflation.Clark Packard, a research fellow at the Washington-based Cato Institute, argued that Biden has put politics over good policy"New tariffs on imported EVs and other products from China are driven mostly by domestic political calculation in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election," he wrote in an article posted on Cato website on Tuesday."At the same time, the tariffs are bad news for American consumer and broad climate goals, and they're a blatant misuse of the Section 301 status. The US desperately needs a return to sound, rule-based trade policy," Packard said.Also on X, Dani Rodrik, a professor of political economy at Harvard Kennedy School, on Tuesday reiterated his message in a recent article titled "Don't fret about green subsidies"."What governments should not do is to decry green industrial policies as norm violations or dangerous transgressions of international rules," he said."The moral, economic and environmental arguments are on the side of those that subsidize green products, not those who want to tax them."Erica York, a US-based senior economist and research director of with Tax Foundation's Center for Federal Tax Policy, said on X that "today's Section 301 announcement and how the ‘strategic tariffs' we're seeing from Biden are just another flavor of protectionism that will bring the same economic tradeoffs as Trump's initial round of tariffs."Senseless, indeed," Scott Lincicome, vice-president of general economics at Cato Institute, commented on Tuesday on Biden's message in 2019 when Biden accused Trump of not caring about farmers, workers and consumers that are being crushed by the irresponsible tariff war with China."It's easy to act tough when someone else is feeling the pain," Biden said at the time. China has slammed the United States for "bullying" and "trampling on market economy principles", dismissing US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's recent remarks about China's new energy sector.In an interview with Marketplace news site published earlier this month, Yellen said the US, which is "very explicitly subsidizing investments" in strategic areas, does not want to see "massive Chinese subsidies to firms with huge overcapacity that will just drive our firms out of business".Criticizing Yellen's remarks, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday in a daily briefing that the United States is playing double standards by justifying its own subsidies and exports, while accusing other countries' subsidies and exports as "unfair" and "overcapacity"."It's just as a US expression goes: 'Do as I say, not as I do'," Wang said.The US is using the "overcapacity" narrative to suppress other countries' advanced industries and practicing protectionism under the pretext of "fair competition", he said.The spokesman reiterated that the competitive edge in China's new energy sector, such as electric vehicles, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products, is not a result of "subsidies".Instead, the sector's rapid growth is built on ongoing technological innovation, a sound supply chain and robust market competition, Wang said.Such rapid growth meets the needs of the global economy's green transition, and is beneficial for China, the US and the world.Wang went on to call the US "a big subsidizer to its industries"."The US, by contrast, has adopted the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act in recent years to directly and indirectly offer hundreds of billions of US dollars of subsidies," he said.Emphasizing that subsidy and protectionism cannot foster industries and companies that have a competitive edge, Wang called on the US to "abandon hypocrisy and double standards", and "stop repeating the old mistake of protectionism".wangqingyun@chinadaily.com.cnTo commemorate the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the United States, Catharine Kerr joined other descendants of World War II heroes to share their stories."The cooperation between Chinese and Americans during the difficult wartime is strongly remembered in my family," said the granddaughter of Flying Tigers lieutenant Donald Kerr at a recent commemoration hosted by the American Flying Tigers Communication Association. "I hope that the friendships (that started) 80 years ago continue forever."On Feb 11, 1944, Flying Tigers pilot Donald Kerr was part of a mission to bomb Kai Tak airport in Hong Kong.He downed a Japanese aircraft before finding himself being pursued by three Japanese fighter planes. His aircraft was hit and caught fire. He then parachuted and landed in Sha Tin Au in the New Territories of Hong Kong.Facing the imminent danger of the Japanese military's extensive manhunt, Kerr was saved through the efforts of the Dongjiang (East River) Column and the Hong Kong-Kowloon Independence Brigade.After enduring 48 days of uncertainty, Kerr was safely escorted back to the Guilin base in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. His rescuers gave him a map and ensured that he would get home safe and sound.This experience left Kerr with a profound appreciation for the friendliness and courage of the Chinese people. "Never be enemies of the Chinese," he once said to his eldest son Andy.In 2008, when Kerr's wife neared the end of her life, she entrusted Kerr's relics to their two sons and told them: "In the future, you must help the Chinese just like the Chinese aided your father."Kerr's rescue was later compiled into an escape manual by the Flying Tigers and was highly praised by general Claire Lee Chennault, a pivotal figure in the group's history.Extensive coverageThe America Magazine extensively covered Kerr's rescue in 1944, publishing the story worldwide. Consequently, the US military headquarters in China established intelligence collaboration with the Dongjiang Column, solidifying its role as a vital component in the global anti-fascist struggle.Kerr was not the only pilot rescued from Hong Kong during the Japanese occupation. In April 1984, US president Ronald Reagan said at Fudan University in Shanghai: "According to incomplete statistics, in 1944, in addition to Kerr, the Dongjiang Column also rescued seven Flying Tigers pilots."Catharine's father David Kerr and uncle Andy Kerr embarked on a profound journey to China since 2007 to fulfill their parents' wishes and express gratitude to those involved in Kerr's rescue.They have gone on more than 10 trips to Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Dongguan and Hong Kong, tracing Kerr's escape route and seeking out the guerrilla fighters who took part in the rescue. Along the way, they have connected with veteran soldiers and their descendants. Today, Kerr's family are friends with the third generation of Dongjiang Column veterans."I (once) went with my father to China in 2008 and met many of the villagers and soldiers who had rescued my grandfather," Catharine said. "We were able to thank the people for the many risks they took to help my grandfather."Nell Calloway, granddaughter of Chennault, emphasized the importance of coexistence between China and the US. She stressed the need to go back into history and "remember what brought us to the point of reunification".Importance of history"We cannot celebrate one anniversary without understanding the importance of history," Calloway said in a video to the event. "This history eventually leads us to becoming (great) powers. It is now our responsibility to maintain that."Calloway said her grandfather's Flying Tigers story illustrates two great people working toward a common goal to bring the world peace. "Let us all continue to work hard toward friendship, understanding the most important peaceful world."Mel McMullen, one of the few surviving members of the Flying Tigers, recounted the bravery of the Chinese people who risked severe punishment by the Japanese invaders to save the lives of hundreds of downed US pilots in the 1940s.While governments and politics may have shifted, he said the fundamental desire for peace remains unchanged among people."We were friends, comrades and partners in war. Why can't we be partners in peace?" the 99-year-old said at the event.The Flying Tigers witnessed a remarkable chapter in history when China and the US stood shoulder to shoulder against Japanese aggression."When American pilots found themselves in dire straits, they were rescued by Chinese troops who risked their own lives to ensure local stability," Wang Qi, a Chinese consul in Los Angeles, said."The story of the Flying Tigers is the glorious history of mutual respect, and joint defense for justice and peace by the Chinese and American people."We will always remember those who have made huge sacrifices and contributions. The deep friendship between China and the US established in the war should be inherited."US Congresswoman Judy Chu said cooperation between the two countries has been crucial throughout history, and the story of the Flying Tigers exemplifies this partnership."Let us celebrate this deep friendship and ensure we keep the memory of the Flying Tigers alive."Trade protectionism should never be the main theme of the new energy vehicle sector, an industry so globalized that it requires global vision and openness for its healthy development, said a renowned expert in China's automobile industry.The United States' ploy to overhype "overcapacity" in China's NEV sector and its national security concerns over Chinese electric vehicles are typical examples of trade protectionism, said Fu Bingfeng, executive vice-president and secretary-general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, in an exclusive interview with China Daily."It is palpably irrational to see Chinese NEVs, hailed as a collective creation for the common welfare of humanity, being restricted in the US market," Fu said.The remarks came amid the news of Washington's possible tariff hike and restrictions on Chinese NEVs.The Wall Street Journal quoted anonymous sources as saying that the US government is preparing to raise the tariff rate on Chinese EVs from roughly 25 percent to 100 percent.Last week, Reuters also reported that US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the country could take "extreme action" and ban or impose restrictions on Chinese connected vehicles after the completion of a national security investigation.Fu said it is very common to find differences regarding legal frameworks and consumption preferences when an industry enters different markets. "This is what makes dialogue and communication extremely important."He said that when smart vehicles enter the global market, they should integrate with local laws and consumer habits, and they also require certain levels of redevelopment to better suit local preferences such as privacy protection. "However, these issues cannot be resolved through trade barriers or protectionism."Fu said the association has noticed that many countries hope that China's automobile supply chain can extend overseas, including to Europe and Southeast Asia, in order to help develop local automotive industries, drive local employment and form new patterns of common growth.Experts noted that in contrast to the US' hostile attitude toward Chinese NEV makers, including the possibility of banning them without any factual evidence to prove their risks, China has always shown openness toward foreign EV companies.US carmaker Tesla, along with five Chinese carmakers, cleared a key data security test in China conducted by the association and a national computer network center in April, which proves how communication can help dismiss data security concerns regarding EVs, they said.Fu emphasized that China treats domestic and foreign carmakers as equals. "Ensuring automotive data security through tests is a new starting point in promoting the healthy development of intelligent vehicles," he added.Tao Lin, vice-president of Tesla, said the company's rapid growth in China over the past decade cannot be separated from the country's policy support and favorable business environment.With unmatched advantages and vast prospects, China is a "must-have" market for the US company, Tao said.China has been the world's largest NEV market for nine consecutive years. Latest data show that in April, the production of NEVs reached 870,000 and sales touched 850,000, up 35.9 percent and 33.5 percent year-on-year, respectively, indicating vigorous growth potential in the domestic market.On the "overcapacity" issue hyped by some Western politicians and media, Fu called for a more objective and open-minded view."A global perspective is a must to understand and support changes and development in a highly globalized industry like automaking, rather than viewing a specific market's production capacity in isolation," he said.According to the International Energy Agency, annual EV sales are projected to reach 45 million units by 2030, more than four times the demand in 2022."Given the development pattern of the automotive industry, maintaining the production capacity utilization rate at a relatively moderate level, typically between 70 percent and 90 percent, is considered a reasonable range," Fu said.Data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the capacity utilization rate of China's automobile manufacturing industry stood at 76.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023.Contact the writers at masi@chinadaily.com.cnChina and the US agreed to hold the first meeting of their intergovernmental dialogue on artificial intelligence in Geneva on Tuesday, in a latest move to implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state in San Francisco in November.During the meeting, the two sides will exchange views on the technological risks of AI, global governance and other issues of their respective concern.On the evening of May 10, 2024, Yang Tao, Director-General of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, held a briefing to elaborate on China's position on United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758.Yang said that for some time, the United States has been deliberately distorting and challenging UNGA Resolution 2758 adopted in 1971 on restoring the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and expelling the Chiang Kai-shek group. It has been trumpeting the notion that Taiwan's status is undetermined, and advocating support for Taiwan's participation in UN conferences and activities. Recently, Mark Lambert along with other US State Department officials blatantly asserted that UNGA Resolution 2758 "did not endorse, is not equivalent to and does not reflect a consensus for China's 'one-China principle,' has no bearing on countries' sovereign choices with respect to their relationships with Taiwan, does not preclude Taiwan's meaningful participation in the United Nations system and other multilateral forums, and did not constitute a UN institutional position on the ultimate political status of Taiwan." Moreover, the United States claims that its one-China policy is different from China's one-China principle. All this is a US attempt to invent a whole set of false narratives to mislead international public opinion and challenge the one-China consensus among the international community. In view of this, we deem it necessary to comprehensively and systematically explain the origin and facts of Resolution 2758, so as to set the record straight. We believe a lie, even told a thousand times, will not become truth.First, the one-China principle is very clear, that is, there is but one China in the world, Taiwan is part of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. UNGA Resolution 2758 fully reflects and solemnly reaffirms the one-China principle. Taiwan has been part of China since ancient times. This is a historical fact; it is also the international consensus. The 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation clearly stipulated that Taiwan, a Chinese territory stolen by Japan, shall be restored to China. These documents with international legal effect formed an integral part of the post-WWII international order and also established the legal foundation of Taiwan's status as China's inalienable territory. In 1949, the government of the People's Republic of China was established, replacing the government of the Republic of China as the sole legal government representing the whole of China. It was a change of government without changing China as a subject of international law. China's sovereignty and inherent territorial boundaries did not change. Rightfully, the government of the People's Republic of China fully enjoys and exercises China's sovereignty, including that over Taiwan. Due to continued civil war in China and the meddling of external forces, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have fallen into a special state of protracted political confrontation. However, China's sovereignty and territory have not been split and will never be split. Taiwan's status as part of China has not changed and will never change.On October 25, 1971, the 26th session of the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority. It states in black and white that the General Assembly "decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it." The Resolution resolved once and for all the question of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the United Nations as a political, legal and procedural issue. It made clear that there is only one China in the world and that Taiwan is a part of China, not a country. It also made clear that there is only one seat of China in the United Nations, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal representative, precluding "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."If Taiwan's status is undetermined, and if China's representation does not include Taiwan, why expel the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek? Why, for more than 50 years, has Taiwan's economic output been counted as part of China's GDP when calculating China's scale of assessment in the United Nations and many other international organizations? Why does the United States turn a blind eye to such clear facts and simple logic?Second, the UN system has always observed Resolution 2758 and upheld the one-China principle in dealing with Taiwan-related issues. Since the adoption of Resolution 2758, the UN and its specialized agencies, and also other intergovernmental international organizations have all adhered to it. They regard Taiwan as a province of China's and do not recognize the so-called international representation of the Taiwan authorities. The UN Office of Legal Affairs has issued legal opinions stating very clearly that "the United Nations considers 'Taiwan' for all purposes to be an integral part of the People's Republic of China," "the United Nations considers 'Taiwan' as a province of China with no separate status," "'authorities' in 'Taipei' are not considered to ... enjoy any form of governmental status," "use the term 'Taiwan, Province of China' when a reference to 'Taiwan' is required in United Nations Secretariat documents." For decades, the UN Secretary Generals and their spokespersons have made it clear when expressing their stance on Taiwan that the United Nations is guided by Resolution 2758 and adheres to the one-China principle.As part of China's territory, Taiwan has no basis, reason or right to participate in the UN or any other international organizations where membership is exclusive to sovereign countries. Any issue concerning the Taiwan region's participation in the activities of international organizations must be handled on the basis of the one-China principle, as reaffirmed by Resolution 2758. The principle is again confirmed in May 1972 by Resolution 25.1 of the 25th World Health Assembly (WHA), which was adopted in accordance with UNGA Resolution 2758. Hence, whether and how Taiwan participates in the WHA can only be decided by the central government of China. The Democratic Progressive Party authorities in Taiwan refuse to accept the "1992 Consensus" that reflects the one-China principle, and are hellbent on the separatist stance of "Taiwan independence." As a result, the political foundation for Taiwan to participate in the WHA no longer exists. This position of the Chinese government has received wide support from the international community. The WHA has rejected deliberations of Taiwan-related proposals for many consecutive years.Third, the international community overwhelmingly abides by Resolution 2758, and fully and faithfully implements the one-China principle. Resolution 2758 is a decision made by the UN General Assembly and must be observed by all member states. This is the requirement of the United Nations Charter, the written commitment made by all countries upon joining the UN, and also an obligation that all UN member states must fulfill. The one-China principle is also the fundamental prerequisite and political foundation for China to establish and develop relations with all other countries. From the very first country that established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China to the 183rd country, namely Nauru, they have all made political commitment to adhering to the one-China principle, and included this commitment in political documents such as communiqués and joint statements on the establishment of diplomatic relations with China. And they have all severed the so-called "diplomatic" relations with Taiwan. This shows that the one-China principle is a universally recognized principle and represents people's sentiments and a global trend.As a signatory to the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, the US is fully aware of the historical and legal facts that Taiwan belongs to China. Yet it openly challenges the post-WWII international order, as if it has "amnesia." As a founding member of the U.N. and a permanent member of the Security Council, the US not only fails to take the lead in complying with a UNGA resolution, but repeatedly questions and misinterprets it, eroding the foundation of the UN and trampling on the principles of international law. It also attempts to mislead international public opinion with its own malicious distortions, and seeks to force its wrong stance upon the international community. Is this the so-called "rules-based international order" the US has been preaching? Clearly, this is nothing but a hegemonic practice of applying international law in a selective way. The world has not forgotten that during the discussions that led to UNGA Resolution 2758, the US had teamed up with a few countries to try to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," and to push through a "dual representation" proposal against overwhelming opposition. Many countries had stepped forward, voicing their clear opposition and stressing that the proposal was "illegal and inconsistent with reality, justice and the principles of the UN Charter." In the end, the proposal failed to be put to a vote and was discarded. Today, the US is once again acting against the trend of history and trying to overturn the consensus of the international community. It must understand that what it failed to accomplish more than 50 years ago will have even less chances to succeed today.Fourth, the US must stop fudging and hollowing out the one-China principle. Once the biggest obstacle to the normalization of China-US relations, the Taiwan question had been fully resolved with the three China-US joint communiqués, and there should be no difference between the understanding and policies of the two sides. In the communiqués, the US clearly states that "the United States of America recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China as the only legal government of China" and that "the government of the United States of America recognizes China's position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of China." This is the political commitment of the US, the political foundation of China-US relations, and above all, the original and true meaning of the one-China policy of the US However, the fact that China and the US are still discussing the Taiwan question 45 years after the establishment of diplomatic relations is because the US keeps violating the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, and continues to interfere in China's internal affairs and obstruct China's reunification.The US claims that it adheres to the one-China policy, but it has added the "Taiwan Relations Act" and "Six Assurances to Taiwan" as precondition and proviso. The latter two, concocted by the US unilaterally, fundamentally violate the one-China principle and the consensus of the international community, and have never been recognized by China. The US claims that it maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan, but it has arranged meetings between US and Taiwan officials, signed agreements with sovereign connotations and an official nature, and provided arms and ammunition to the Chinese territory. How is this unofficial ties? President Biden has pledged that the US does not support "Taiwan independence," "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," and does not seek to use Taiwan as a tool to contain China. Has the US side honored its commitment?We remind the US that any move to reverse the course of history is doomed to fail, any effort to play the "Taiwan card" will only backfire, and any attempt to "use Taiwan to contain China" will be a dead end.We warn the US that with regard to UNGA Resolution 2758, the US has only the obligation to strictly abide by it, but no right to arbitrarily distort it or any privilege to act as the US sees fit.We urge the US not to stand on the opposite side of the international community, not to stand on the opposite side of international justice, and not to stand on the opposite side of the basic norms of international relations.China and the United States will intensify technical and policy exchanges on realizing their respective goals on energy transitions, and promote bilateral cooperation and capacity building on methane emissions control, according to a media release from China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment.The release was made public on Saturday following a meeting of the two countries' working group on enhancing climate action in the 2020s, which is co-led by, John Podesta, US' senior advisor to the president for international climate policy and China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Liu Zhenmin from Wednesday to Thursday.The in-depth discussions of the two sides recalled the San Francisco summit between presidents of the two countries in November last year, and focused on areas identified in the Sunnylands Statement, including energy transition, methane and other non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases, circular economy and resource efficiency, deforestation, and low-carbon and sustainable provinces/states and cities, the release said.The Sunnylands statement was released after Xie Zhenhua, China's former special envoy for climate change, met his US counterpart John Kerry at Sunnylands, California, from Nov 4 to 7.At the meeting, the working groups of the two countries also exchanged views over cooperating on multilateral issues related to promoting a successful COP29 United Nations climate change conference in Baku, Azerbaijan in November this year, the release added."They exchanged experiences and challenges with respect to their respective climate policies and actions, with a view to responding meaningfully to the climate crisis and beyond," it continued.Recalling the US' intent to achieve 100 percent clean power by 2035, and the Chinese intent to phase down coal consumption during the 15th Five Year Plan period (2021-25) and make best efforts to accelerate this work, including accelerating renewables deployment, the two countries intend to intensify technical and policy exchanges on realizing their respective goals, it stated.The two sides plan to host a second Methane and Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases Summit at COP29, it continued.The first Summit was held in COP28 in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates late last year.The release said the two sides are committed to promoting bilateral cooperation and conducting capacity building on deploying abatement technologies, as well as developing and/or improving respective measurement, reporting and verification systems and standards that aim to achieve significant methane emission controls and reductions in the 2020s.Noting with interest the Methane Alert and Response System of the United Nations Environment Programm's International Methane Emissions Observatory, the release said they will also engage in technical cooperation and capacity-building for measurement and abatement solutions of other non-CO2 greenhouse gases, including industrial nitrous oxide as well as tropospheric ozone precursors.The two sides recognize the importance of developing a circular economy and resource efficiencies in addressing the climate crisis. And they expect to conduct further technical exchanges on circular economy, including food loss and waste reduction, textiles, and recycling standards, it said.Both sides look forward to the US-China High-Level Event on Subnational Climate Action, to be held May 29 to 30, in Berkeley, California, it said.Language has served as a vital bridge, deepening understanding between China and the United States across generations of educators and students.In light of this, the Chinese Consulate General in New York hosted an open day, "Discover China: A Journey Through Language & Culture", for Generation Z students this week.Featured at the event were traditional Chinese intangible arts from Fujian province, including musical ensembles, folk dances and glove puppetry from the classic 14th-century Chinese novel Water Margin. There was also a panel discussion where participants shared their experiences related to the Chinese language and culture.Students and representatives from universities and high schools expressed deep interest in learning Chinese and are anticipating visits to China in the near future."Learning Chinese is really hard, but it's unique," said Khader Motan, a 16-year-old student from William Bodine High School in Philadelphia, who will be going to China soon."I'm really excited to go, see it, travel, and experience China. …Having the chance to experience different educational systems internationally is a really nice and good opportunity."Myelle Rodgers, a 16-year-old student from Brooklyn Latin School, said it would be an amazing opportunity to engage with and learn more about Chinese culture."Not only like learning about our own, but also kind of like teaching the cultures of other nations and countries," she said."When it comes to US-China relationships, we are taught that they're kind of like polar opposites in a sense, where that's not really the case because we've seen that a lot of times they have come together to work on amazing solutions and we kind of have to be more open to it and view it from a more collaborative perspective."Alexander Given, an international relations and Asian studies major at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, said his interest in China began with his father, who traveled there regularly. He has been studying Chinese for seven years."A lot of my generation are realizing that US-China relations are one of the most important relations for the world, and a basis of good relations is a basis with good understanding," he said.Lydia Simon, who graduated from The Ohio State University's advanced Chinese language and culture program, also studied at Peking University in Beijing. She started studying Chinese shortly after the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics."I'm so excited to see so many high school students here," she said."There was a lot of excitement internationally about China, and that was a moment for programs to be initiated and a lot of funding to be provided for students."Simon still remembers the time when she finished an 80-page-long thesis in Mandarin for the completion of her master's degree. At the time, she recalled her "hard" beginning with learning Chinese. But then, she found that she was able to do other things better with her earlier efforts in learning the language.Support and scholarshipsShe said she received a lot of support and scholarships to be able to study in China, adding that now is a good time for student exchange programs, following the "50,000-students exchange program in five years" agreement reached by the presidents of China and the US in their November summit in California.Simon, who currently works in the art industry, said learning Mandarin has helped to pique her interest in the country."Tension always comes from misunderstanding, and a lot of misunderstanding comes from not being able to communicate," she said. "It's important that Americans are learning Chinese so that we can better understand each other and have more empathy."Galal Walker, former professor in the Department of East Asian Languages and Literature at The Ohio State University, said combining the learning of a language while trying to use it can lead to results."Encouragement does not come from outside, it comes from inside," he said. "We have to find out how to put the learner in, and build everything around the learner."mingmeili@chinadailyusa.com  China on Friday urged the United States to strictly abide by the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, and refrain from exploiting Taiwan to contain China, a move which is doomed to fail.Speaking at a briefing, Yang Tao, director-general of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry, elaborated China's position on the UNGA Resolution 2758.For some time, the US has deliberately distorted and challenged Resolution 2758, hyped up the "undecided status" of Taiwan and advocated supporting Taiwan's participation in UN meetings and activities.The meaning of the one-China principle is crystal clear, namely there is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory and the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China, Yang said.Noting the 26th session of the UNGA on Oct 25th 1971 adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority Yang said once and for all, the Resolution 2758 resolved, politically, legally and procedurally, the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including the Taiwan region, at the UN.It also made it clear that there can only be one seat representing China at the UN, and no issues exist about "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", he added.Since the adoption of UNGA Resolution 2758, it has been observed by the UN and its specialized agencies and other intergovernmental international organizations, Yang said.Any issue regarding the Taiwan region's participation in the activities of international organizations must be addressed under the framework of the one-China principle, he said, adding Taiwan has no basis, reason or right to join the UN or other international organizations that require statehood.Yang said all member states of the UN should abide by the UNGA Resolution 2758, which is the requirement of the UN Charter and an obligation that must be fulfilled.He stressed that the US has neither qualification to distort the UNGA Resolution 2758, nor privilege to act recklessly.Yang also said the one-China principle is the fundamental prerequisite and political foundation for China to establish and grow its relations with others.The international community universally adheres to the UNGA Resolution 2758, and comprehensively and faithfully implements the one-China principle, he added.He urged the US not to stand on opposite from the international community, international justice and basic norms of international relations.As a founding member of the UN and a permanent member of its Security Council, Yang slammed the US for trampling on the principles of international law, and attempting to mislead international public opinion and impose its wrong stance on the international community."Is this the 'rules-based international order' that the United States chants?" Yang questioned, saying it reflects US hegemony and a selective approach to international law.The US and a few other countries once put forth the "dual representation" proposal in an attempt to create "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan", but the proposal ultimately failed to be put to a vote and was abandoned, Yang said.The US must stop hollowing out and obscuring the one-China principle, Yang said, warning that the US running counter to the trend of history will not succeed.He said the US claims that it adheres to the one-China policy but is using more descriptions to modify its one-China policy, including its unilaterally-concocted Taiwan Relations Act and Six Assurances.Such moves violate the one-China principle, breach the international consensus and have never been recognized by China from the very beginning, he added.Yang reminded the US that playing the "Taiwan card" will backfire, and engaging in using Taiwan to contain China will inevitably end in failure.China-Europe cooperation on the environment and climate is of special significance amid the escalating global climate crisis and sluggish world economy, and China looks forward to consolidating consensus with Europe to boost confidence in global environmental and climate governance, officials said.In an exclusive interview with China Daily, Zhou Guomei, director-general of the Department of International Cooperation of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, stressed that China and Europe are key drivers in the global environmental and climate governance process.The environment and climate have always been focal points of China-Europe cooperation, representing one of the earliest areas of collaboration and a consensus-building topic in high-level exchanges, she noted.China and Europe have been actively promoting bilateral and multilateral cooperation to address climate change and environmental concerns since the mid-1990s, she added.That cooperation has evolved into the China-European Union High-Level Environment and Climate Dialogue, a vice-prime ministerial-level mechanism, and separate ministerial dialogues on environmental policy and climate change, she stated."Since the establishment of the high-level dialogue in 2020, leaders from China and Europe have repeatedly emphasized the need to work together to address global challenges such as climate change and deepen the China-Europe green partnership," Zhou said.They have so far held four high-level dialogues, she said, and have reached important consensus on cooperation in areas such as climate, environment, energy transition and the circular economy.These dialogues have not only resulted in a list of 17 cooperation outcomes, but also specified the focuses of future cooperation, and enriched the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the EU, she added."Currently, global issues such as climate change, energy security, environmental pollution and biodiversity conservation are becoming increasingly prominent, necessitating enhanced unity, cooperation and effective joint efforts to tackle global environmental and climate challenges," she stressed.Against this backdrop, China and Europe have huge potential for cooperation in renewable energy, green low-carbon technology, green transportation, carbon trading markets, climate adaptation, biodiversity conservation and chemical management, she said."China looks forward to fostering greater consensus, enhancing mutual trust, enriching and expanding practical green and low-carbon cooperation with the European side under the high-level dialogue mechanism, with focuses in some key sectors ... to jointly boost confidence in global environmental and climate governance," the official noted.Zhou also depicted long-standing and close environmental cooperation between China and France.In 2019, for example, the leaders of both countries issued the "Beijing Call for Biodiversity Conservation and Climate Change", clearly identifying biodiversity conservation and climate change as priority areas for future cooperation, she said.Upon China's invitation, French President Emmanuel Macron visited China in April 2023. The countries made a joint statement during the visit, confirming that tackling climate change and conserving biodiversity are their common priorities, the official added.Also in an exclusive interview with China Daily, Pan Jiang, director of the Department of International Cooperation at the National Development and Reform Commission, emphasized cooperation on green development as the topic with the highest consensus between Chinese and European leaders in recent years."The common concept China and Europe hold in green and sustainable development has laid a solid foundation for their cooperation in green and low-carbon development," he said.With complementary advantages in industries, technologies, funds and markets, he said China and Europe have vast and enormous potential for cooperation in green development, especially against the backdrop of the accelerated low-carbon transformation around the globe."We are willing to enhance exchanges and collaboration with the EU and European countries in energy transition, energy conservation and efficiency, circular economy, green technologies, and related regulations and standards."Together, we aim to promote the development of green and low-carbon technologies and industries for the benefit of people in all countries, making a greater contribution to global efforts in addressing climate change and achieving sustainable economic and social development," he said.Contact the writers at houliqiang@chinadaily.com.cn East China's Fujian province was in the spotlight over the weekend at the Chinese embassy's open house."Refreshing Fujian: Starting Point of the Maritime Silk Road" was featured at the embassy as part of the Around the World Embassy Tour of Washington DC.More than 200 guests attended a VIP session, and over 5,000 local residents visited on a rainy day. The visitors experienced Fujian's hospitality and beauty and embraced China's charisma.Following a promotional film titled The Mountains, Seas and Culture of Fujian, Jing Quan, the minister of the Chinese embassy, said that Fujian's story is not only one of an open, enterprising and beautiful China but also one of China-US friendship.He said that last November, President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden agreed at their summit in California that the two countries would jointly promote people-to-people exchanges and support greater interactions."At the open house today, you will see the best of Chinese culture, have a bite of Chinese delicacies and witness a developing China," Jing said. "I wish you all a most pleasant and unforgettable experience."Jiang Erxiong, the vice-governor of Fujian, said that Fujian is "an amazing land of beauties and blessings" on China's southeast coast and "China's only province with its name symbolizing happiness and fortune".She detailed Fujian's geography, tourism resources, transportation and culinary culture. Jiang said that more than 100 years ago, American friends took refuge from the summer heat in Kuliang, a resort in Fuzhou.Wei Dong, the mayor of Zhangzhou City in Fujian, said that more than 400 years ago, Chinese commodities such as porcelain and tea, were shipped from Zhangzhou's Yue Port to the United States and Europe.Zhangzhou has increased its economic and trade cooperation and people-to-people exchanges with the US since the reform and opening-up. More than a decade ago, it established a sister city relationship with Honolulu, Hawaii. Approximately 30,000 people from Zhangzhou now reside in the US, where foods, home goods and guitars made in Zhangzhou are popular.Artists from Fujian and Zhangzhou City presented cultural performances on the embassy stage. The opening dance, Golden Drums, combined big drums and parasols; the glove puppetry performance, Daming Prefecture, featured an excerpt from Water Margin, one of China's most beloved classic novels; and Fujian folk songs included leaf-blowing and dance such as Catching Butterflies While Picking Tea Leaves.Performers concluded with A Land of Blessings, featuring folk music, dance and puppets.Three visitors and their families won the grand prize of an all-inclusive, five-day trip to Zhangzhou City.The guests in the VIP session included Scott Shaw, the deputy assistant secretary for China and Mongolia at the US Department of Commerce; Benjamin Sand, acting coordinator of the Office of China Coordination at the US State Department; Tyler Makepeace, deputy director of the Office of East Asia at the US Treasury Department; Zhang Wencai, managing director and World Bank Group chief administrative officer; Li Bo, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund; and Kimberly Bassett, secretary of the District of Columbia. At the Fujian-themed culture and tourism booths, the guests steeped and tasted tea, learned to write Chinese characters, and tried floral headdresses and hanfu to experience the beauty and happiness of the ladies in Jingpu.The guests also tasted refreshments from Fujian, such as maltose, mazao, red bean cakes and mung bean cakes and took photos with Wuyi Mountain as the background. Guests also were treated to lion dances and drum performances and took photos with giant panda puppets; visited a science and technology exhibition themed "45 Years of China-US Science and Technology Cooperation: Outcomes and Future Prospects", and watched the Tiangong space station through virtual reality.Visitors also viewed nearly 100 pieces of Chinese painting, calligraphy, Suzhou embroidery and porcelains. Some guests spent time in parent-child activities such as coloring and paper-cutting.Snacks included spicy beef slices, Sichuan cold noodles, spring rolls stuffed with three delicacies, and walnut cookies.Lola Tamar, a visitor and a volunteer for the Around the World Embassy Tour, told China Daily of the event: "I absolutely love it. From the welcoming ceremony with the dance of the dragons to seeing the pandas, as well as the different rooms that we had the opportunity to view, and all of the beautiful Chinese architecture."She also that she had learned some Chinese words, "Huanying lai Zhongguo (Welcome to China)".Mark O'Connor, 53, said that he had "a wonderful time. People were so friendly and so nice, and I've learned a lot. It's been very informative. It's my first time, and it's a beautiful embassy," he said."I just got my name in calligraphy and people here. I enjoyed the music and just having some jasmine tea," he said. "I would definitely recommend it. … I've been to some other embassies, but this is the best." TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance have filed a lawsuit challenging a new law that United States President Joe Biden signed last month to force the sale or ban of the popular video-sharing app in his country, saying the legislation violates the First Amendment rights of US citizens."For the first time in history, the Congress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than 1 billion people worldwide," TikTok and ByteDance said on Tuesday in a petition filed in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Banning TikTok is so "obviously unconstitutional", and the new law leaves TikTok with no choice but to shut down by Jan 19 as continuing to operate in the US wouldn't be commercially, technologically or legally possible, they said.It will silence the 170 million US people who use the platform to communicate in ways that cannot be replicated elsewhere, they said.The law, which was signed by Biden on April 24, requires ByteDance to divest TikTok within nine months or face a ban in the US, with a possible three-month extension if a sale is in progress.The companies said in their petition it's impossible to transfer the platform's "millions of lines" of code to a new owner, and that the app will not sell its recommendation algorithm.Declaratory judgmentThey argued that they should be protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of expression and are seeking a declaratory judgment that the law is unconstitutional.Moreover, Congress itself has offered nothing to suggest the Tik-Tok platform poses the types of risk to data security or the spread of foreign propaganda that could conceivably justify the law and has failed to prove the app poses any specific harm in these areas, they said.ByteDance has insisted it has no intention of selling TikTok. The White House has said it wants to see Chinese-based ownership ended on "national security grounds".Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said TikTok's challenge of the ban is important, expecting TikTok's lawsuit to succeed."The First Amendment means the government can't restrict Americans' access to ideas, information, or media from abroad without a very good reason for it — and no such reason exists here," Jaffer said in a statement."Anything that the US government does not like becomes a threat to national security. It's an overall excuse to cover everything. Simply by calling it a 'national security' issue, they feel that they can justify taking any action whatsoever," George Koo, a retired international business adviser in Silicon Valley, California, told China Daily."For TikTok to take on the US government at the US court system is very much the last measure and whether they will get a fair hearing and fair justice remains to be seen. But I wouldn't be surprised if TikTok fails in the lawsuit," he said."I think if TikTok is forced to divest the Chinese ownership, they (will have) to just leave the US altogether.… That will be a very unpopular move for the young people, for the 170 million fans of TikTok," Koo said.TikTok filed a lawsuit against Montana in May 2023 when it issued a similar ban. Last November, a federal judge ruled in favor of TikTok and blocked the law before it took effect.Lia Zhu in San Francisco contributed to this story.Contact the writers at fanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn.Liu Zhenmin, China's special envoy on climate change, will hold talks with John Podesta, senior adviser to United States president for international climate policy, in the US from Tuesday to May 16, according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.Under the guidance of a consensus reached by Chinese and US leaders, the two will exchange in-depth views over the Sunnylands Statement on Enhancing Cooperation to Address the Climate Crisis and other consensuses reached between the two countries and on promoting practical outcomes in China-US climate cooperation, the ministry noted in a media release.The Sunnylands statement was released after Xie Zhenhua, China's former special envoy for climate change, met his US counterpart John Kerry at Sunnylands, California, from Nov 4 to 7.According to the statement, both sides have agreed to restart the US-China Energy Efficiency Forum to deepen policy exchanges on energy-saving and carbon-reducing solutions in key areas such as industry, buildings, transportation and equipment.The two countries also intend to restart bilateral talks on energy policies and strategies, carry out exchanges on mutually agreed topics, and facilitate track II activities to enhance pragmatic cooperation, it noted.It said the two countries aim to advance at least five large-scale climate cooperation projects each by 2030, including from industrial and energy sources.The ministry said in the release that Liu will also hold talks concerning climate change with United Nations bodies, as well as other authorities and think tanks in the US during the visit.The Lang Lang International Music Foundation is donating 50 pianos used in the 101 Pianists concert at Cuyahoga Community College to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District as part of the Keys of Inspiration to support music education.The May 3 concert in Northeast Ohio featured international piano legend Lang Lang playing alongside 100 local students between the ages of 6 and 18.The performance took place at the college's Metropolitan Campus Auditorium and concluded with Lang Lang announcing the partnership between the Lang Lang Foundation and the Cleveland school district.The Roland FP-30X digital pianos played during that performance are valued at a total of $55,000. Roland and the foundation have worked together since 2011 supporting Keys of Inspiration programs both in the United States and internationally, providing hundreds of pianos to further music education.The Cleveland district is the first in Ohio to receive Keys of Inspiration."Our district's music programs are going to be transformed by this incredible gift from the Lang Lang International Music Foundation," said Jeffery Allen, director of arts education in the district. "Through this donation, we'll be able to enhance our music programs and ensure scholars have the best resources to explore and grow their musical talents."The CMSD community is thankful for this partnership, which promises to inspire countless young musicians to reach new levels of musical excellence," Allen said."We are thrilled to bring our flagship programs to Cleveland in a true celebration of music and music education," said Ariela Rossberg, director of education for the Lang Lang Foundation.She said, "101 Pianists is such an exciting community-focused event, and we know that the children involved, whether in the audience or on stage, will be inspired and energized by the concert."Through our new partnership with Cleveland Metropolitan School District, we're able to continue offering Cleveland's students the joy of music with our Keys of Inspiration program."Today's Roland pianos will be donated to three local elementary schools, implementing our groundbreaking music education initiative in CMSD," Rossberg said. "We're excited to continue working with the district to make a difference in their community."Roland said that through its ongoing work with the Lang Lang Foundation, it remains committed "to ensuring students around the world can experience the joy of learning and playing the piano on high-quality instruments featuring state-of-the-art technology".Lang Lang has performed 101 Pianists in 16 cities worldwide, with Roland providing the 50 pianos for students to play alongside him in concert.Cleveland is the sixth city or area in the US to host 101 Pianists, following Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington DC and Long Island.The 101 Pianists concert was the fourth and final performance in the 2023-24 season of Cuyahoga Community College's Classical Piano Series, which introduces emerging and established pianists to the Cleveland community."The sounds from 100 piano students playing with Lang Lang were beautiful to hear, and it's also heartwarming to know thousands more local students will play these pianos as they grow their love of music," said Emanuela Friscioni, the director of the college's Creative Arts Academy. "This is an exceptional way to support young piano students and celebrate music."Lang Lang founded his namesake foundation in 2008. The foundation "strives to educate, inspire and motivate the next generation of music lovers and performers".HOUSTON - Dozens of Chinese and US entrepreneurs gathered here at a forum on Sunday to foster future cooperation amid challenges in both traditional and new energy fields.Addressing the 10th China-US Energy Enterprise Cooperation Forum, US Congressman Al Green, who has represented Texas' 9th congressional district since 2005, welcomed Chinese energy entrepreneurs to visit Texas and the United States in his remarks."I believe that you are coming to a country traversing some great distance, (which) is going to make a difference," Green said. "Now, your reason for being here is exceedingly important because aside from the energy aspect of it, which is very important, there is another reason -- people-to-people relationships make great relationships for countries."The veteran lawmaker said the forum offers "an opportunity to build a bridge to span the chasms that can separate us so that we may have better opportunities to do business with each other."Zhang Guanjun, secretary-general of China Petroleum & Petrochemical Equipment Industry Association, said he hoped the forum would serve as a venue not only to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the energy industries, but also to strengthen cooperation between Chinese and US energy firms.As many as 108 entrepreneurs from 65 Chinese and American companies attended the half-day forum, according to the organizer.Any international rules on generative artificial intelligence must involve the United States and China and those countries' companies, participants in a recent panel discussion said."In terms of scale and number of companies, a number of researchers, a number of STEM researchers, it's really the US and China," said Paul Triolo, an associate partner for China and Technology Policy Lead at the Albright Stonebridge Group, a global strategic advisory and commercial diplomacy firm. "So, the consensus is that China and Chinese companies need to be part of a global dialogue."Triolo spoke in a panel discussion titled "The United States, China, and AI: What Does Cooperation Look Like?", hosted by the Institute for China-America Studies in Washington.In San Francisco in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden agreed to establish a government-to-government mechanism to discuss AI.In Bangkok in January, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and the US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan discussed holding a US-China AI dialogue this spring.Panelists at the event said US AI companies have engaged in discussions with Chinese AI experts, and leading scientists from both countries have jointly put out calls for tighter controls on technology.Triolo said that AI technology goes back "quite a ways", while ChatGPT came out in November 2022. ChatGPT, developed by Open-AI, is a chatbot that uses large language models, a type of AI that can, among other things, recognize and generate text."So now when we talk about AI, oftentimes people tend to mean generative AI and applications like ChatGPT," Triolo said.AI, as embodied particularly in its next-generation form of generative AI, is a technology of immense transformative potential, and could produce significant harm, be it in the sphere of disinformation, cybersecurity, or military applications, he said."Given this is such an important emerging technology now, whoever leads in this arena is going to have a major economic advantage. And so whichever countries … dominate, companies and countries dominate, will … have this leading economic growth."Although China and the US are willing to discuss or even work together on AI, the questions of what topics should be discussed and who should represent either side have yet to be decided.Denis Simon, a distinguished fellow at the Institute for China-America Studies, said there are "more questions than answers" about US-China potential cooperation in AI. "And I think both sides are trying to figure out where they're going to end up."I think the US perspective is somewhat different about this working group and what's going to happen. I think they really want to discuss more about the management of AI and more about, in fact, to be very honest, the control over AI. America has a certain perspective on the potential nefarious uses of AI."China is placing great importance on "new quality productive forces" and trying to get into "a whole new economic and technological posture by using this kind of model of AI-led transformation", Simon said.However, the US seeks no cooperation or exchanges on the underlying technological hardware that drives frontier AI models, he said, as the Biden administration has placed "onerous" export-control restrictions on leading-edge graphics processing units, aimed at preventing China from training its frontier models.yifanxu@chinadailyusa.comNearly 300 Chinese citizens in the United States have been subjected to unwarranted harassment and deportation over the past three years, according to Chinese Ambassador to the US Xie Feng, who added "McCarthyism" has interfered with normal US-China exchanges.The ambassador spoke on Saturday at the Safe Journey in the US consular event held at the Chinese embassy in Washington.The embassy released a brochure and animated video at the event, advising Chinese citizens how to protect themselves from potential risks while in the US."In response to the US' selective, discriminatory and political enforcement of the law, we have emphasized with the US side, argued with reason, and lodged solemn representations with the US Department of State, the National Security Council in the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and other departments," Xie said.The embassy has "made representations on every occasion, urging the US side to remove the 'stumbling blocks' that impede humanistic exchanges as soon as possible", he added.Representatives of Chinese students, overseas Chinese and Chinese organizations in the US participated in the event.The embassy's materials are geared toward helping Chinese people visiting or living in the US stay alert so they can travel safely, according to the ambassador.Xie said the world has entered a period of turbulence and change, with wars, terrorist attacks and frequent gun violence, and that instability, uncertainty and unpredictability have become the norm.He added that China's relationship with the world has entered a period of deep integration, with the number of people entering and exiting the country increasing from 5.6 million before reform and opening-up in 1978, to more than 420 million today. Chinese tourists and students also are traveling more around the globe."The demand for consular protection has also entered a period of rapid growth. Last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as embassies and consulates abroad handled more than 80,000 consular protection cases, with an average of one case every six minutes. The 12308 hotline received more than 500,000 calls for help, with an average of one call every minute," Xie said.China-US relations are still facing serious challenges, said Xie, highlighting racial discrimination against Asians, "hysterical McCarthyism" and the poisoning of public opinion that is interfering with normal people-to-people exchanges between the two countries."Being in a foreign country, we must always tighten the string of security and constantly improve security awareness and preventive capabilities," he said.Xie noted that the US has either placed on entity lists or sanctioned more than 1,500 Chinese companies."The embassy has continued to urge the US side to stop its economic, trade, scientific and technological suppression of China. And we demand that President Biden put into practice his statement that he does not seek to suppress and curb China's development."The ambassador said the embassy has always maintained the "true colors of people's diplomacy", and protected the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens in the US with "care, effort and affection, conveying the warmth of the motherland to every compatriot in the US".Several Chinese students in the US said the information provided by the embassy was a good guide for them to stay safe while living in the US, especially in an election year when tensions can rise."The safety information including the exchange of foreign currency, psychological issues and more was customized for us and made me feel very at ease. Today's event made me feel at home," said Qiang Lingyi, a law student at Georgetown University.yifanxu@chinadailyusa.comChina strongly deplores and firmly opposes the statement from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in which he said the United States encourages the World Health Organization (WHO) to invite Taiwan's presence as an observer at this year's World Health Assembly (WHA), a foreign ministry spokesperson said Thursday."The US statement seriously violates the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués. China strongly deplores and firmly opposes the statement," said the spokesperson. The spokesperson noted that there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. China's position on the Taiwan region's participation in the activities of international organizations, including the WHO, is consistent and clear, that is, this must be handled under the one-China principle, which is also a basic principle enshrined in the UNGA Resolution 2758 and WHA Resolution 25.1.The spokesperson added that the Democratic Progressive Party authorities have stubbornly stuck to the separatist position of "Taiwan independence," which means that the political foundation for Taiwan region's participation in the WHA no longer exists. The US statement presents this matter in a misleading way essentially to connive at and support "Taiwan independence" separatist activities. "The Taiwan question is at the core of China's core interests and the number one red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations," the spokesperson said."We once again urge the US to earnestly abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués, observe international law and the basic norms governing international relations, act on the US leader's commitment of not supporting 'Taiwan independence, ''two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan,' stop using the WHA to create confusion on Taiwan-related issues, and avoid sending wrong signals to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces," said the spokesperson."The one-China principle has the extensive support of the international community. It is where global opinion trends and where the arc of history bends. There's no denying or stopping of that trend. Any attempt to play the 'Taiwan card' and use Taiwan to contain China will meet the firm opposition of the international community and is doomed to failure," the spokesperson added.Beijing urged Washington on Monday not to implement the negative China-related content in a foreign aid package that was recently signed into law by United States President Joe Biden, and it vowed to take resolute and strong measures "if the US insists on going ahead with it".Speaking at a regular news briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said that China firmly rejects that content, which gravely infringes on China's sovereignty, and has lodged serious representations with the US side.On Wednesday, Biden signed the package that includes a large amount of "military aid" to China's Taiwan region, and a bill that stipulates that the social media platform TikTok must be divested from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or face a national ban.Lin said the package severely violates the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, and it sends a wrong signal to "Taiwan independence "separatist forces.It also undermines the principles of the market economy and fair competition by wantonly going after other countries' companies in the name of national security, he said."This has laid bare the hegemonic bullying nature of the US," Lin said, urging the US to respect China's core interests and major concerns.Lin also rebutted US paranoia about China after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused China in an interview on Monday of so-called attempts to "influence and arguably interfere" with the upcoming US presidential election.Lin said that noninterference in other countries' internal affairs is a basic principle of China's diplomacy, and China "never had any interest and will not interfere in any way" in the US presidential election, which is an internal affair of the US.Meanwhile, "we staunchly reject anyone making an issue of China and damaging China's interests for election purposes", he said."The US should pivot away from its paranoia and stop making unfounded allegations to smear China and deflect the blame," Lin said, adding that what the US needs to do are things that are conducive to the stability of bilateral ties and that benefit the two peoples.mojingxi@chinadaily.com.cnThe Chinese ambassador to the United States recently welcomed nearly 300 guests from all backgrounds to the Chinese embassy for the Experience Chinese Fashion and Arts event."The Chinese civilization has run uninterrupted for thousands of years, exploring new ground through reform and innovation and gaining fresh vigor through drawing on other cultures," said Ambassador Xie Feng. "China today is opening its arms wider to embrace the world and creating a better world with a more dynamic civilization."The event, jointly hosted by the Associates of the American Foreign Service Worldwide, immersed guests in the unique charm of Chinese culture through fashion shows, qipao dances and dressing up.More than 20 models presented over 200 sets of specially tailored qipao, made of exquisite fabrics, elegant colors and novel designs, transforming into artworks.The qipao fashion show was interspersed with Chinese dance performances, and the Washington Xuejuan Dance Ensemble presented the charm of the qipao with the dancers' delicate moves.Xie said that the qipao, representative of traditional Chinese dress, provides a window to understanding China.He said beauty is everywhere in the world."What is lacking is not beauty, but eyes to perceive her, and a big heart and an open mind to appreciate the beauty of all civilizations," he said. "China and the United States are different in history, culture, social system and development path. Nevertheless, these should not hamper our exchanges, but should encourage us to learn from each other," he said.Xie cited the idiom, "A single flower does not make a spring". He said there are over 200 countries and regions in this world, with more than 2,500 ethnic groups and multiple religions. "Each and every kind of attire, music and lifestyle is irreplaceable and is a shared treasure of mankind."This is why China has put forward the Global Civilization Initiative," the ambassador said. "We look forward to working with other countries to jointly advocate the respect for the diversity of civilizations, the common values of humanity, the inheritance and innovation of civilizations, and robust international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation."It is our hope that fashion and art will serve as bridges for China-US cultural exchanges and mutual learning and inject impetus into dialogue between and common progress of all civilizations," he added.During the event, the guests got to try on their favorite qipao, and stylists created exquisite Chinese makeup for the guests, allowing them to see a different version of themselves in the mirror.Guests wearing qipao took photos in front of the embassy's spiral staircase, flower windows and paintings. They also were invited to walk the catwalk, showing their elegance and confidence, expressing the beauty of civilizational exchanges and mutual understanding in the language of fashion, and winning constant applause from the audience.Among the attendees were Minister Jing Quan, Counselor Chen Chunmei, Secretary General of the OAS Luis Almagro and his wife, as well as envoys and wives of some other countries and representatives of international organizations.The event also featured the Ningbo Performing Arts Group, Ningbo Fenghua District Cultural Tourism Group and Zhejiang Chantel Gong Cultural Industry Development Co Ltd.Gong Hangyu, the founder and qipao designer for Chantel Palace, gave lectures on Chinese qipao culture and design at the George Washington University Museum and the Textile Museum, and the Chinese American Museum during her stay in Washington DC.yifanxu@chinadailyusa.comChina will send giant pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to the San Diego Zoo in the United States, heralding a new 10-year round of international conservation partnership.In line with an agreement for giant panda conservation signed earlier this month by the China Wildlife Conservation Association and the San Diego Zoo in California, both parties are making preparations for the pandas' journey, according to the association.China has selected Yun Chuan, a male, and Xin Bao, a female, from the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan province, and has arranged for experienced caretakers and veterinarians to accompany them to the US.The San Diego Zoo is renovating and upgrading the panda facilities to provide a larger and more comfortable living environment. Additionally, the zoo has assembled a professional team with expertise in panda care, daily nursing and related scientific research, acquired through study and exchange programs in China.To ensure the well-being of the giant pandas, experts from the China Wildlife Conservation Association traveled to the US in March for in-depth discussions and technical exchanges with the San Diego Zoo.Li Desheng, deputy director of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda, said: "Giant pandas are important envoys for peaceful and friendly exchanges. As far as I know, wherever the giant pandas go, they are especially loved by the local people. Giant pandas can greatly facilitate communication between peoples and let people around the world know China better. There is also much collaboration in the field of animal conservation."The cooperation between the China Wildlife Conservation Association and the zoo dates back to 1996, when Bai Yun and Shi Shi from the research center became the first pair of pandas to live in the zoo.Giant pandas Hua Mei, born in 1999, and Mei Sheng, born in 2003, who formerly lived at the San Diego Zoo, are not only the result of China-US giant panda research cooperation, but also are adorable ambassadors promoting friendly exchanges between the two countries, the conservation association said. They have also made a positive contribution to enhancing friendship between the peoples of China and the US, it added.Since the 1990s, China has collaborated on giant panda conservation with 26 institutions in 20 countries, including Spain, Japan and France.On Monday, giant pandas Jin Xi and Zhu Yu are scheduled to depart for the Madrid Zoo in Spain, beginning a 10-year stay."Scientific and educational outreach also serves as an important function of international giant panda exchanges, allowing more people to understand giant pandas," said Li, the deputy director of the conservation and research center.yandongjie@chinadaily.com.cnChina's ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Zeguang made an official visit to the University of Cambridge on Thursday, where he encouraged more academic exchanges between China and the UK.Zheng held discussions with Deborah Prentice, vice-chancellor of the university, and her team on how to grow educational exchanges and collaboration between Cambridge and Chinese universities.Zheng noted that China regards education, science and technology, and human resources as fundamental and strategic pillars for Chinese modernization, adding that the National Conference on Education held in Beijing earlier this month further clarified that China will continue to give high priority to education and support universities to actively participate in international exchanges.He stressed that China and the UK have respective strengths in education and China-UK cooperation benefits both countries.Prentice talked about Cambridge's pursuit of excellence and innovation, and about the prospect of continuing to develop mutually beneficial cooperation with Chinese universities.The university has long been engaging with its counterparts in China for research and education exchanges. In 2018, it chose Nanjing, the capital city of East China's Jiangsu province, to establish Cambridge University - Nanjing Centre of Technology and Innovation."I hope Cambridge continues to champion the idea of exchange. The exchange between universities and industries and the exchange between the UK and China are all very important," said Zheng. "I'd like to see more Chinese researchers work and share their expertise through the Nanjing center."Zheng also visited TusPark Cambridge within the Cambridge Science Park and the Maxwell Centre at the renowned Cavendish Laboratory, where he emphasized the importance of collaboration between research and industry.He encouraged the implementation of more R&D projects in China's vast market, highlighting that areas of Cambridge's expertise—such as new materials, life sciences, and renewable energy—align with China's development priorities, while emphasizing that such collaboration would also benefit the UK.At King's College Cambridge, Zheng met with Robin Osborne, vice-provost of the college, and Alan Macfarlane, emeritus professor of the college and a prolific author on China, among other fellows, to learn about their research and the college's Silk Roads Programme.The ambassador also met with 20 representatives from more than 2,000 Chinese students studying at Cambridge and listened to their experiences as international students.Ambassador Zheng briefed the students on the achievements of China’s development, inspired them to love the country, study hard, stay safe and support each other, and encouraged them to serve the country after graduation and become the pillar of building the country.China reiterated on Monday its position on the Kosovo issue, saying that Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected.It's reported the police of the temporary institutions in Pristina forcibly raided and controlled institutions of ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo. The Kosovo police arrested four Serbs and confiscated Serbian currency in the National Bank of Serbia located in northern Kosovo."On the Kosovo issue, China respects Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and believes that the security and lawful rights and interests of ethnic Serbs in the Kosovo region should be upheld," Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.As unilateral moves do not help address the issue and disrupt regional security and stability, the spokesperson called on relevant parties to continue practical and constructive dialogue, and actively look for a lasting solution to the Kosovo issue.In 1930, Albert Einstein delivered a keynote address at IFA or Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin (International Radio Exhibition Berlin). Nearly a century later, his likeness reappeared—this time as a hologram—delighting visitors at IFA Berlin's centennial celebration.

We are not a member of the European Union, so we don't have a common trade policy and will not impose sanctions unilaterally in this regard," he said.Norway is aiming to become the world's first country to end the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2025. The Norwegian market has seen a rapid increase in the number of Chinese EVs, which have made a notable contribution to the country's green efforts.According to the sales database of the Norwegian Road Federation, Chinese brands, including Volvo, increased their EV market share from 14 percent in 2023 to 23 percent in August this year.Green transition is an area in which both countries share a common interest. On Tuesday, Store first visited Beijing and signed a joint statement with Chinese Premier Li Qiang to establish a dialogue on green transition."My visit to Beijing confirmed with the Chinese leadership that Norway and China (as two nations), different in size and geographic locations, see strategic opportunities to work together in areas of common interest. We can do more in trade cooperation, especially in the maritime area," he said, noting he has seen China more "confident, relaxed and open" during this visit.China is a critical market for the Norwegian maritime industry, with about one-third of Norwegian companies present in China in the sector. China is also the world's largest shipbuilding country, where 55 ships are being built for Norway.Largest carrierEarlier on Wednesday, Store visited a shipyard in Nantong, Jiangsu province, where he attended the naming ceremony of one of the most environmentally friendly car carriers, which has been built jointly by Norway and China. Hoegh Borealis, which was delivered on the occasion, can carry 9,100 cars, and is the largest car carrier in the world.Tomra, a Norwegian recycling solutions provider, which has been present in China for 14 years, expressed optimism over the outlook of the country's circular economy as well as the prime minister's visit.Store's visit has been fruitful and sent positive signals, said Jet Chang, vice-president of public affairs at Tomra Asia."As Norway gains 15-day visa-free access to China, it would be much easier for senior business management to make a visit and communicate with the people here. The business section on both sides can expect positive and further bilateral cooperation," he said.Chang spoke highly of the two nations' joint statement on green transition, which highlighted the development of the circular economy."We have seen steady and continuous growth of our business in China with the nation's improving business environment and particularly its efforts in garbage classification in recent years. We are very pleased to see the joint statement, which would benefit us a lot," said Chang.Chang pointed out that developing a circular economy can better secure resources, reduce carbon emissions and environmental risks, as well as provide opportunities for investment and economic development.IFA Berlin, Europe's largest consumer electronics trade fair, was held from September 6-10 in Germany. This year, over 420 Chinese companies registered to showcase their latest innovations, accounting for nearly 25% of all the exhibitors. Let's take a look at some of the key highlights.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez led a delegation to Tongji University in Shanghai on Tuesday, learning about the school's cooperation and exchange with Spain, and talked with the students about their business plans.Yao Jing, Chinese ambassador to Spain; Marta Betanzos, Spanish ambassador to China; Fang Shou'en, Party secretary of Tongji; Zheng Qinghua, president of Tongji; and representatives from the Technical University of Madrid were present at the event.Sanchez first attended a meeting that reviewed the cooperation between Tongji and Spain and encouraged students with good entrepreneurial plans to innovate and start business.Fang and Zheng recalled the long-term partnership between Tongji and universities in Spain. They highlighted the university's commitment to pooling global education resources and expected further collaboration on fostering students' capabilities to innovate and start business.Representatives from Tongji University and the Technical University of Madrid briefed on the latest developments of the Sino-Spanish Campus at Tongji University in supporting the entrepreneurial programs of Spanish students in Shanghai. Three young entrepreneurs from China and Spain presented their startup projects.Sanchez said that he is proud that universities in Spain have carried out fruitful cooperation with their Chinese counterparts, including Tongji. He stressed that further efforts are needed to push forward collaboration and exchanges in the fields of education, technology, and culture between the two countries in the future.After the meeting, Sanchez visited an exhibition that showcased the fruitful results of cooperation between Tongji and the Spanish universities as well as the entrepreneurial projects of youths from the two countries.Also, Sanchez unveiled the nameplate of Xiji Incubator, a base for international entrepreneurs and innovators in China, together with Fang and Zheng. Established with joint efforts of the Sino-Spanish Campus and the Technical University of Madrid, the incubator aims to enrich Shanghai's entrepreneurial ecosystem and connect greentech startups."I visited something that gave me a particular sense of satisfaction and excitement, which was the Chinese-Spanish startup accelerator at Tongji University, where I saw young Spanish people working together with their Chinese counterparts," said the Spanish prime minister during a media briefing on Wednesday."In all these meetings, if there is one thing I have noted, it is the enormous growth potential of the relationship between Spain and China."Zhang Zile contributed to this story.Editor's note: As the People's Republic of China celebrates the 75th anniversary of its founding this year, China Daily asked prominent international figures to reflect on their relationship with the country and to talk of the direction in which they see it going.At 18, Dorien Emmers, a Belgian, faced a pivotal decision: which new language to pursue after already studying Greek and Latin. Intrigued by Chinese culture but aware of the language's complexity, she embraced the challenge."I like a good challenge," recalled Emmers, now an assistant professor at the Chinese Studies Group and the Department of Economics at KU Leuven, Belgium's oldest university, founded in 1425. She described the decision as being made "just out of curiosity and interest" and "without knowing a lot about China".The China study program at KU Leuven was so intensive that she quickly found herself lost and ended up forgoing a bachelor's degree in the subject.After finishing her undergraduate studies, Emmers received a scholarship from the China Scholarship Council to study at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu, Sichuan province, from 2012 to 2013."This was an amazing experience and actually had an impact on everything I did afterward," she told China Daily at her Brussels home.As a European, Emmers finds learning Chinese more challenging than studying ancient Greek, as the latter shares similarities in grammar and vocabulary, whereas Chinese belongs to a completely different language family. However, she had much fun learning Chinese idioms and colorful expressions that "we don't have in our languages"."That was also the beautiful thing about it," said Emmers, who now speaks fluent Chinese and is known to many by her Chinese name Du Yan.She also quickly fell in love with Chengdu and returned last summer, still enamored with the city."I still love the vibe there; Chengdu ren (people) are just great people," she said.Her language skills improved rapidly in Chengdu, an accomplishment that she said can only be achieved by "being there, studying the language all year round and practicing the language all day, in a fun way by interacting with people, or just by reading the signs next to the streets".It is also the case when it comes to learning about a culture and society, she said. "You can only learn it by being there."Emmers was fascinated by China's rapid urbanization and excited about learning new things, from singing karaoke to eating hot pot.She was overwhelmed by the hospitality received from the Chinese, who frequently invited her to dinner, so she was never alone during meals.Initially, she could not eat spicy food. During her first three months in Chengdu, she ate with tissues in hand, "sweating, crying and sneezing"."But I really like it now," she said. Shortly after returning to Belgium, she wanted to know where to find spicy food but failed."Chengdu people are very lucky to have so many good dishes," she said. "I want to meet local people and make local friends."Emmers, who holds a PhD in economics from KU Leuven, is a development economist with extensive experience in studying early childhood development in China.It goes back to her time in Chengdu, where she and several international students taught English to the kindergarten children in Ya'an, about 116 kilometers from Chengdu, after the area was struck by a major earthquake in spring 2013."It was a very beautiful region, but I also realized the English level of 12-year-olds in the boarding school was worse than that of 4-year-olds in Chengdu," Emmers said.Coming from the Belgian countryside herself, Emmers said she became interested in the subject because her mother and grandmother, unlike urban women, were not allowed to study in Belgium in the olden days.After returning from China, she wrote a thesis on this topic while pursuing a master's degree in Chinese studies and economics at KU Leuven.Her research revealed that educational inequalities begin very early in life, even in the first year of life. For example, if a 2-year-old struggles with language development, they will likely face difficulties keeping up with their peers by the time they start primary school at age six."Starting to help children catch up at age six is much more difficult, much more expensive than helping them when they are 1 or 2 years old," she said, adding that was true around the world.The lack of resources, from financial support to educational materials such as children's books, was a major problem in rural China, especially when grandparents, often the primary caregivers, mistakenly believed it makes no sense to talk to a child who could not yet speak."But actually, even for a child who can't talk, it's important for the language development … These are some small changes that can make (a big difference) for early child development," she said. "That's what we have been working on."Substantial improvementsHaving visited China about 20 times, Emmers has seen substantial improvements in early childhood development across Chinese cities as living standards have improved.She was impressed by an early childhood development center she visited in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, where she saw all kinds of specialized classrooms for dancing, singing and other activities."In urban China, amazing job …But in rural China, none of these of course," she said.Emmers is excited that going to China has become much easier now, with the Chinese government's visa-free policy for short-term visits by Belgian nationals.She has traveled across the country, from Yunnan province to Guilin and Yangshuo in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, to Shaolin in Henan province, the birthplace of Chinese kung fu, and Dunhuang in Gansu province, renowned for its caves with ancient murals.She said her perception of China has changed completely since her visit to China and she felt she did not know anything about China at the time."It has changed so much… I think most people don't realize how little they know about China," she said."People need to learn about China to actually understand it a little bit… It's incredible how quickly China develops and changes."She describes China today as "completely different" from 10 years ago and "a different country" if going back 20 years."I'm a development economist, that's why studying China is so interesting. You can learn so much from the Chinese experience," Emmers said."That's also such useful information for other countries which try to develop and grow ... Yes. China has done impressive things over the last 50 years."Emmers is worried about the declining enthusiasm among her students in studying in China because of the pandemic, and the global geopolitics that has triggered a lot of negative press in the West about China.However, she said students who have studied in China generally have very positive experiences."For most students, it's really a transformative experience," she said. "So it's very beautiful to see almost all of them are very positive. There are exceptions. There are people missing home."The cargo vessel Lisbon Maru was converted into a troop carrier by the Japanese army during World War II. In October 1942, while carrying about 1,800 British prisoners of war from Hong Kong to Japan, it was torpedoed by a United States submarine off the coast of East China's Zhejiang province.The POWs were locked in the holds and left to drown. Some of them managed to escape, but were fired upon by Japanese soldiers. Chinese fishermen heard the incident from the shore and rushed to save 384 British soldiers. The ship sank with the loss of 828 POWs who were either shot or drowned.Down went the ship, the prisoners and their stories for decades.In 2015, when President Xi Jinping was making a state visit to the United Kingdom, he made a speech at a state banquet in which he referred to the Chinese fishermen's rescue of the British POWs as an example of friendly ties that will never fade and an invaluable asset in relations between China and the UK.In recent years, there have been efforts to raise awareness about the rescue, including the documentary film The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru, which hit the big screen on Friday.Filmmaker Fang Li spent eight years making the film. With rare footage and historical archives, the documentary tells the heroic and tragic story of both the lost and the saved.Countries set up dialogue to facilitate joint efforts in pushing for transitionChina and Norway have agreed to establish a dialogue on the green transition, seeking to facilitate contacts and cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, preserve and restore biodiversity and create new green industries and jobs.A joint statement, signed on Tuesday by Premier Li Qiang and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, said a biennial meeting coordinated by the two countries' foreign ministers will summarize progress and set new targets for the dialogue.During the talks, Li said China is willing to work with Norway to promote green development and bolster cooperation in areas such as the green transformation of traditional industries and the cultivation of green emerging industries.He called for close international coordination between the two nations to promote global climate and environmental governance in a more equitable, reasonable, cooperative and win-win direction and facilitate the realization of the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.Li said China is willing to work with Norway to expand and improve economic and trade cooperation, further deepen cooperation in fields including culture, arts, education, tourism and sports, and facilitate personnel exchanges."China welcomes Norway to increase investment in the Chinese market and stands ready to work with Norway to create a more optimized business environment for enterprises from both countries to invest and operate," he said.Store, who is currently making an official visit to China upon the two countries' 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties, said the bilateral relations maintain a friendly and dynamic development momentum.Noting that he has visited China a number of times, the Norwegian prime minister said he has witnessed the remarkable development of the world's second-largest economy, and Norway is willing to be a reliable partner for China.Norway supports enhanced dialogue and cooperation between Europe and China, as it has always advocated free and fair trade and upheld the multilateral trading system, he said.Addressing a reception held by the Norwegian embassy in China on Monday, Store said that his visit to China is not about looking back at 70 years, but rather looking forward to the next 70 years."This is a vibrant relationship and I'm very happy that we are optimistic and pushing forward for what will follow in the years to come," he said.Store, who arrived in Beijing on Monday, said the three-day trip will also bring him to a shipyard in Nantong, Jiangsu province, where Norwegian and Chinese suppliers are building one of the most environmentally friendly ships to date."There are many areas of cooperation that we will explore during this visit," Store said.Regarding the Norway-China relationship, Store said he appreciated that the two countries have ambitions for future cooperation. He also said that dialogue could address difficult issues on which the two sides may have different opinions."But that is what the partnership is all about. We can be honest and open," he said.An exhibition celebrating UK-China digital creativity opened at London's historic Royal Mint Court on Sept 6.Organized by the Institute of Cultural and Creative Industries of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, The Future to See Future: UK-China Youth Digital Creation and Cultural Exchange Exhibition aims to showcase the digital creativity of young talents and promote cultural exchange and co-creation between China and the United Kingdom.The exhibition, which will end Sept 17, is a partner event of the London Design Festival.It features more than 30 works that explore the future, presenting perspectives and innovative expressions across a range of fields, including human interactions with nature, environmental protection, arts, education, music, and the age of artificial intelligence. All creators are young talents aged under 30, mostly from Generation Z, and have their own digital creative art institutions and technology companies.Liu Weidong, vice-president of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, delivered a speech at the launch ceremony, stating: "The Future to See Future project will continue to hold themed co-creation activities, international exhibitions, academic-industry discussions, and talent exchanges in London and Shanghai.Liu said the goal is to create a lasting platform for idea sharing, international co-creation, and cultural exchange between the two cities through digital creativity.Trevor Hoey, vice-chancellor of Brunel University London, speaking on behalf of all partners, highlighted the university's ongoing efforts in advancing UK-China collaboration in the creative industries through research initiatives.He noted that Brunel University has engaged in several collaborative projects with Shanghai Jiao Tong University in recent years, and he expressed the university's enthusiasm for participating in the exhibition, to showcase teaching achievements, foster innovation in education, and strengthen connections between academia, the public, and industry.Li Liyan, minister counselor for cultural affairs at China's embassy in the UK, said in his speech that China and the UK are both countries with a great wealth of history and cultural heritage. Digital creativity bridges arts and technology, and more importantly, brings together the younger generation of the two countries.He said he looks forward to seeing more opportunities like this, where friendship in the digital age is forged and innovative ideas exchanged.The exhibition's curator, Pearl Wang Haoqing, highlighted key features of the exhibition and the digital creators, including the diffusion and application of AI generation technologies, the deep integration of technology with culture and emotion, and the increased investment in preliminary research and future transformations of scientific achievements.The features are expected to have a significant impact on digital creative education at universities in both countries, she said.Professor William Dutton, founding director of the Oxford Internet Institute, said that both the internet and AI will provide greater creative opportunities for individuals working alone and in collaborations locally and globally.Guests from a wide range of academic institutions, cultural agencies, and the borough of Tower Hamlets attended the event, including representatives from Brunel Design School, the National Centre for Computer Animation, the Tate, UK Arts and Humanities Research Council, and the World Cultural City Forum.Together, they witnessed the launch of the UK-China youth cultural exchange and co-creation platform under The Future to See Future initiative. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, who is currently making an official visit to China upon the two countries' 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties, said on Monday that his trip is not about looking back at 70 years, but one that looks forward to the next 70 years."This is a vibrant relationship and I'm very happy that we are optimistic and pushing forward for what will follow in the years to come," Store said at a reception held by the Norwegian Embassy in China.Store, who arrived in Beijing on Monday, said that the green transition and cooperation in green technologies, maritime technologies and technologies of the future, have been on his agenda during the visit.As both Norway and China will attend the UN Climate Change Conference to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan in November, the Norwegian prime minister said the two sides are expected to make it a success on the road to cutting emissions in accordance with our obligations.Noting that China is the leader in the green transition with new technologies, Store said the three-day trip will also bring him to the shipyard in Nantong, Jiangsu province, where Norwegian and Chinese suppliers are building one of the most environmentally friendly ships of the time to date."There are many areas of cooperation that we explore during this visit," Store said, adding that Norway also received a signal from the Chinese side that there will be a 15-day visa-free policy for Norwegians traveling to China."That is a good sign for these relations," he said.Speaking of the Norway-China relationship, Store said he appreciated that the two countries can have ambitions for future cooperation while having a dialogue that can contain more difficult issues where the two sides may have different opinions."But that is what the partnership is all about. We can be honest and open in the respective manner," he said.At a high-end forum opened in Beijing on Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez sounded upbeat about more exchanges and greater collaboration between his country and China in the near future."There are many opportunities for both China and Spain, and the two countries should be brave enough to seize them," Sanchez, on an official visit to China from Sunday to Wednesday, told the opening ceremony of the 9th meeting of China-Spain Forum.In his speech, the Spanish leader invited various parties to strengthen cooperation and promote mutual understanding between the two countries through the high-end forum.Spain and China have had extensive exchanges, and last year the two countries jointly celebrated the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic relations.Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the nations' bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership, and Spain "will further strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various aspects", Sanchez said.Speaking about the exchange of visits between the two countries, he thanked China for granting Spanish citizens visa exemptions, which are under a pilot visa-free scheme that has been extended to the end of 2025. Spain has yet to grant visa exemptions to all Chinese citizens.He noted that tourism between the two countries fully recovered in the first half of this year and will exceed projected levels by the end of the year."Both sides should work together to enhance communication and work together to streamline the visa process," Sanchez said. "Our aim and vision is also to have more Chinese citizens visiting our country."At the forum, Vice-Premier Liu Guozhong noted that Spain, as a major country in Europe and a member of the European Union, plays an important role in regional and international affairs, adding that Spain is also "a trustworthy partner of China within the EU".Meanwhile, China will unswervingly improve its level of opening up to the outside world, he said."We welcome and look forward to Spain's in-depth involvement in China's high-level opening-up process, sharing the dividends of development and realizing mutual benefits," he said.The China-Spain Forum was established in 2003 and has served as an important mechanism for two-way exchange, dialogue and cooperation. Eight meetings were held prior to the Monday meeting.Francisco Riberas, president of the Spain-China Council Foundation, said Monday's meeting was "very special" for everyone present."Nine years have passed since the last meeting (of the forum in 2015)," he said, adding that "the recent years have been very difficult because we have also gone through the COVID-19 epidemic".He underlined the need to use such dialogues to "maintain the promotion of economic engagement between the two countries to deal with all these negative shocks that we have been faced with".The current period "is also a time of changes, and the whole international situation is very complex, but we are also more (deeply) interconnected than before", he added.Yang Wanming, president of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, said that in the new era, "bilateral cooperation has continued to go deeper and deeper and benefit the two peoples" because the two nations have upheld the spirit of paying mutual respect and treating each other as equals under the strategic guidance of the two countries' leaders."Today in China, the Spanish element is everywhere, thousands of Spanish companies have invested in China, and high-quality goods from various industries are very popular among Chinese customers," he said.He cited the packed audience seats at flamenco performances in China and Spain's leading in soccer teams, which "have gained countless Chinese fans".Meanwhile, a number of companies from China in areas such as finance, trade, construction and energy are deeply committed to Spain's market, and the Spanish translations of Chinese-language classics have helped more Spanish friends feel the charm of Chinese culture, he said.Speaking of bilateral cooperation, Yang suggested that both sides should focus more on hot spots and open up new channels through green development, and advance subnational collaboration between localities such as cities.zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com.cnA production fusing modern dance and ancient Chinese martial arts has been praised as a landmark that will inspire people for years to come as it ended a run of performances in London on Sept 7.Wing Chun, presented by the Shenzhen Opera and Dance Theater at the Sadler's Wells dance venue, tells the story of martial arts master Yip Man.The Seeing Dance website called it "a stunning evening … everything about Wing Chun exceeds expectations", while Everything Theatre described it as "a breathtaking show that will leave you with a feeling of awe and a newfound respect for martial arts and dance".In an end-of-run academic seminar, guests from the worlds of dance and theater production shared thoughts about the show and its impact.Christopher Bannerman, a visiting professor at the London Contemporary Dance School and founding director of the Cross-Art project at Beijing Dance Academy, said blending dance with what he called "the body culture of martial arts, handed down through thousands of years of Chinese history … has unlocked something — by cleverly channeling that energy, a new movement language has emerged"."I believe for the next 10 years, young choreographers in China will be inspired by this (show) and we will see a great flowering of Chinese creativity," he said.Glynis Hall, founder of Glynis Henderson Productions who has put on award-winning shows in the West End and on Broadway and who is deeply involved with Chinese productions, said she was delighted to see a show with such global appeal."In the past, I've seen so many Chinese artists who wanted us to take their work abroad but it was hard, because what they did was difficult to export, but what we have seen here is a million miles away from that," she said. "This is obviously the beginning of a very different future for Chinese work internationally. I congratulate you on crossing that bridge."Wang Yun, counselor of China's Embassy in the United Kingdom, praised the work of the show's creative team and said that one audience member, Josephine Chanter, deputy director of London's Design Museum, had commented how the performers "flew around the stage like birds" and said the performance had "opened a window to allow the audience to get into the spirit of wing chun and recognize Chinese culture".Wing Chun was first performed in China less than two years ago and made its overseas debut in Singapore 12 months ago. The show celebrated its 200th performance during the London run and will have a short run in Paris in October, with the producers keen to take it elsewhere.Hall said the fusion of dance and martial arts gave the show an obvious global audience appeal, and she hoped it could be the start of something bigger."Artists working together from different art forms is the chemistry that fires something brilliant, when they make each other better, and I think collaborations between China and the outside world are a larger form of that," she said. "The more we can find artists who want to connect and make work together, the more rich the world will be."BEIJING -- Chinese Premier Li Qiang held talks with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who is on an official visit to China, in Beijing on Monday.Noting that next year marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of China-Spain comprehensive strategic partnership, Li said China is ready to work with Spain to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, build political mutual trust, and jointly build bilateral relations with strategic focus.The two countries will focus on high-level alignment of development strategies and in-depth integration of growth drivers, and push for more tangible results of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries, Li added.Li said China is willing to expand two-way opening up with Spain, encourage the development of cross-border e-commerce and convenient logistics, and promote the optimization and development of bilateral trade and investment cooperation.China will provide more facilitation and support for Spanish and other foreign enterprises to invest in China, and hopes that Spain will provide a fair, safe, non-discriminatory and predictable business environment for Chinese enterprises keen to invest in Spain, Li said.He added that China is ready to work with Spain to focus on green development and innovation, and strengthen cooperation in new energy, energy conservation, environmental protection, the digital economy and space.Li said China stands ready to work with Spain to uphold openness and cooperation, safeguard the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core, maintain stability and unimpeded global industrial and supply chains, and jointly build an open world economy. It is hoped that Spain will play a constructive role in promoting China-EU cooperation, he said.Sanchez said that Spain attaches great importance to developing relations with China and looks forward to further enhancing bilateral exchanges at all levels, enriching bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership, and strengthening exchanges in culture, education, science and technology to deepen mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.The EU and China have broad space for cooperation, and Spain supports the EU and China in conducting balanced and mutually beneficial dialogue and cooperation, safeguarding the multilateral trading system and jointly addressing challenges, Sanchez stated.After the talks, the two leaders witnessed the signing of a number of bilateral cooperation documents in fields such as economy, culture, education, science and technology.Russian air and naval forces will participate in a Chinese military exercise later this month, China's Defense Ministry announced on Monday.The ministry said in a news release that, in line with an annual plan and bilateral agreements, Russian forces will join the "North·Joint-2024" exercise in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. The drills aim to deepen strategic collaboration between the two militaries and improve their ability to jointly address security threats, the statement said.In addition, naval vessels from both nations will conduct their fifth joint patrol in "relevant sea areas of the Pacific Ocean." China will also participate in Russia's "Ocean-2024" strategic exercise.The ministry did not provide specific dates for the exercises.There are many opportunities for both China and Spain, and the two countries "should be brave enough to seize them," said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.Sanchez, on an official visit to China from Sunday to Wednesday, made these remarks at the opening ceremony of the 9th China-Spain Forum held in Beijing on Monday morning.In his speech, the Spanish leader invited various parties to strengthen cooperation and promote mutual understanding between the two countries through this high-end forum.He added that Spain and China have close exchanges and last year the two countries jointly celebrated the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic relations.Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership, and Spain will further strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various aspects, he said."Although we still have differences on some issues between the two sides, there is a shared willingness to engage in further dialogue and consultation. We are committed to working together to find agreed solutions based on mutual benefits and win-win situations," he said.Speaking about the exchange of visits between the two countries, he thanked China for granting Spanish citizens visa exemptions."Our aim and vision is also to have more Chinese citizens visit our country," he said.He noted that tourism between the two countries has fully recovered in the first half of this year and will exceed projected levels by the end of the year.Chinese tech companies are making a strong impression at this year's IFA Berlin, Europe's largest consumer electronics trade show, with prominent exhibition spaces and ads from leading home appliance brands greeting attendees at the trade fair entrance.This year marks IFA Berlin's centennial celebration, featuring over 420 Chinese firms and underscoring China's vital role in the global consumer technology market. Among the 1,800 exhibitors, major Chinese brands such as Haier, Hisense, Midea, and TCL command some of the largest exhibit spaces, showcasing a wide range of smart home appliances. The event, expected to draw over 182,000 visitors from 139 countries, runs until Sept 10, with artificial intelligence being one of its key themes.Leif Lindner, CEO of IFA Berlin, emphasized the lasting appeal of the trade show, pointing to the strong demand from exhibitors. "IFA has always been, and will continue to be, at the forefront of change and disruption, showcasing real-world innovations, with consumers engaging with new technologies in real time," Lindner said.Haier, along with its subsidiary brands Candy, Hoover, and Casarte, continued to showcase their cutting-edge technology at the expo. "Haier not only demonstrated the technological leadership of Chinese companies through innovative solutions and scenarios but also illustrated the global rise of Chinese brands by achieving the fastest growth in the European market for eight consecutive years," said Neil Tunstall, CEO of Haier Europe.Midea, a leading Chinese air conditioner manufacturer, has made a significant investment at IFA Berlin this year, evident in its massive ad space at the trade show entrance. Zhu Zhou, the Europe sales director of Chinese electrical appliance manufacturer Midea, said: "We've recognized that single products alone can no longer meet the diverse and sophisticated demands of today's consumers. Therefore, we are focusing on a unified, scenario-based approach enhanced by AI technology to better address these varied needs."Hisense, a leading Chinese appliance and electronics manufacturer, unveiled its AI-driven applications, green intelligence solutions, and innovations in emerging industries, providing visitors with an immersive experience at their booth. Notably, the Hisense U7 TV was showcased alongside the game Black Myth: Wukong, demonstrating its user-centric technology and smooth performance, which significantly enhances the gaming experience.Honor introduced several new devices in the global markets, including the MagicBook Art 14 and the MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon PC.In addition to major Chinese industry names, the trade show has also attracted smaller Chinese companies. Liu Yuegui, sales director of Shenzhen-based Aukey Technology, a producer of consumer electronics, said: "We've been attending the fair for the past three years. After seeing the benefits of increased customer engagement last year, it made perfect sense for us to return to the expo this year."Jeffrey Towson, founder of TechMoat Consulting and an expert on Chinese tech companies, observed, "China's domestic market is highly competitive, so companies are already well-prepared before they go international. However, participating in exhibitions helps Chinese leaders better understand foreign markets and their customers."Lorenzo Coruzzi, director at Brand Finance, a London-based brand valuation consultancy, said: "Global trade show presence for Chinese companies is critical, not optional. IFA Berlin offers unparalleled exposure to European markets, media, and competitors. It's a vital platform for relationship-building, trend-spotting, and asserting market position."Louis Brennan, a professor of business studies at Trinity Business School in Ireland, said Chinese companies can significantly influence future trends in consumer electronics and home appliances."Chinese companies will reinforce existing trends such as intense price competition and the digitization of consumer electronics and home appliances. They have an opportunity to meet the consumer demand for ease and simplicity of use while providing excellent customer service," Brennan added.Six Serbian police officers have arrived in China to carry out a one-month joint patrol mission, marking the first time that China and Serbia have conducted joint patrols in China, the Ministry of Public Security announced on Saturday.This joint patrol will help Serbia gain a deeper understanding of Chinese public security work, further enhancing law enforcement cooperation between the two countries, and creating a safer environment to help forge people-to-people exchanges between the two nations, the MPS said.During the joint patrol, Serbian officers will wear Serbian police uniforms and patrol in mixed teams with Chinese police officers at tourist attractions in the provinces of Hainan, Zhejiang and other locations. Serbian officers will not carry any weapons or equipment but will provide policing advice to assist Chinese officers in addressing the safety concerns of Serbian citizens in China, thereby creating a safe tourism environment together, according to the MPS.In 2019 and 2023, in response to invitations from Serbia, the MPS dispatched teams to Serbia to carry out China-Serbia joint patrol missions twice.In a bid to enhance mutual understanding and cooperation between Europe and China, a dialogue was held during the 2024 Legislators Forum for Friendly Exchanges that commenced in Shanghai on Tuesday.The annual forum has brought together over 40 incumbent and former legislators from various countries, including 14 representatives from Europe, with 12 of them currently holding legislative positions. These European legislators hailed from countries such as Italy, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, and Cyprus, among others.The dialogue aims to foster friendly exchanges and promote mutual development among the parliaments of participating nations. Discussions centered around themes focused on fostering a correct perception between China and Europe, deepening cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and advancing practical cooperation between the two sides.Yang Wanming, the president of the event's host, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and a member of China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress, emphasized China's strategic and long-term view of its relationship with Europe. He highlighted Europe's significance as a crucial partner in China's modernization efforts but acknowledged the new challenges facing China-Europe relations amid evolving international dynamics."The European Union simultaneously positions China as a partner, competitor, and systemic rival. We believe that this positioning logic is illogical, even confusing and contradictory, bringing unnecessary interference and obstacles to the development of China-Europe relations," Yang said. "Between China and Europe, we believe there are no geopolitical conflicts, no fundamental conflicts of interest. Just because of the differences in political systems, it does not mean that we are opponents of each other. Competition should not reduce cooperation, and differences should not lead to confrontation."Esther Gil, third deputy speaker of the House of Representatives of Spain, stressed the importance of closer collaboration between the European Union and China in addressing global and regional challenges.Roberto Speranza, a deputy of the Democratic Party and former Health Minister of Italy, emphasized the need to build strong bridges of mutual understanding despite cultural differences. He highlighted the importance of "respect and study" as fundamental pillars for developing a robust cooperation framework between China and Europe."In spite of cultural differences, we must work together step by step to build strong bridges of mutual understanding," Speranza said. "Respect is the first fundamental condition. Differences should never be considered as barriers. Study is the other key word. Every year, more European students decide to learn Chinese language and culture. In the meantime, many Chinese students learn European languages and cultures. This is the right direction we should follow. We should all remember that knowledge is the opposite of prejudice, the more we learn about the other the better it is for mutual understandings."Spyridon Kyriakis from Greece underscored the necessity of strengthening global partnerships for sustainable and inclusive growth in light of the unprecedented challenges faced by the world in recent years.Harald Troch from Austria emphasized the close economic ties between China and Europe as "an asset in our good and prolific relation"."We should follow a way of cooperation because the economic ties between China and Europe are already so close that we need the cooperation," Troch said. "There is no alternative to cooperation."BERLIN - Meng Meng, an 11-year-old female giant panda at Zoo Berlin, has given birth to twins, zoo authorities announced on Friday."The eagerly awaited second offspring of Meng Meng was born at 13:03 and 14:19 on Thursday in Zoo Berlin's Panda Garden," said the zoo in a press release.Both cubs are doing well and are lovingly cared for by their mum and the experienced panda team around the clock. The cubs weigh 169 g and 136 g and are about 14 cm long."Like other giant bears, giant pandas are born almost naked, deaf, blind and pink. The typical black and white panda markings only develop later. The sexes have not yet been determined with certainty," it said.As giant pandas usually only raise one cub when they give birth to twins, Zoo Berlin has decided to actively assist Meng Meng in raising her cubs in close cooperation with the experts at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding."We are delighted to have two experienced colleagues from the Chengdu Panda Base at our side to look after the cubs. With around 20 births a year, they have much more experience and are better able to assess the cubs' development," said biologist and panda curator Florian Sicks.Meng Meng arrived from China in 2017. In August 2019, she gave birth to the first-ever twin panda cubs, Meng Xiang and Meng Yuan, in Germany. The twins were sent back to China last December.Meng Meng was artificially inseminated on March 26 following intensive observation and careful preparation by an international team of experts.The first signs of a successful pregnancy emerged on Aug 11 when an ultrasound detected two heartbeats. Just 11 days later, the twins were born, following a gestation period of 149 days.The zoo said the now-experienced mother knew what to do immediately after the birth. "I am relieved that the two were born healthy. The little ones seem lively and mum Meng Meng takes great care of her offspring," said Zoo and Tierpark Director Andreas Knieriem.Premier Li Qiang said on Thursday that China is ready to continuously deepen political mutual trust and advance mutually beneficial cooperation with Belarus to promote the high-level development of their all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership.When meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko during his official visit to the Eastern European country, Li said that China-Belarus relations have remained vibrant for the past 32 years despite the changing international landscape, and practical cooperation between the two countries has yielded fruitful results benefiting their peoples.Belarus was among the first group of countries that responded to the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and participated in cooperation projects under the framework, which yielded benefits in various fields. With bilateral trade exceeding $8.4 billion last year, China is the second-largest trading partner of Belarus and its largest trading partner in Asia.Li said that China is willing to better align its development strategies with Belarus, advance cooperation in all fields with solid efforts, and steadily expand the volume of bilateral trade.The premier also called on the two sides to make greater efforts to implement projects such as the China-Belarus Industrial Park, a landmark cooperation project within the Belt and Road framework.Before the meeting, Li visited the Victory Monument in Minsk and laid a wreath.Lukashenko hailed the strong momentum in the bilateral relationship, saying that it is at its highest level in history.Belarus sincerely appreciates China's long-term and selfless support for the country's economic and social development, Lukashenko said, adding that Belarus is ready to deepen practical cooperation with China in areas such as trade, agriculture and science and technology.Li arrived in Belarus on Thursday morning after wrapping up his first visit to Russia as Chinese premier, a trip observers said further consolidated the foundation of practical cooperation and demonstrated the maturity of China-Russia relations despite external disturbances.In Moscow, Li co-chaired the 29th regular meeting between Chinese and Russian heads of government with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, and also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin.He told Putin that the steady development of bilateral ties not only meets the fundamental interests of both sides, but also contributes to regional and global peace, stability and prosperity.At a time when the world is going through rapid changes unseen in a century, Li said that China will work with Russia to further strengthen multilateral coordination, and keep consolidating mutual trust and cooperation with developing countries.Russia will work with China to further strengthen cooperation that benefits both sides, expand people-to-people exchanges, and carry out close collaboration within multilateral mechanisms, such as BRICS, in order to push for the greater development of bilateral ties, Putin said.According to a communique jointly issued after the meeting between Li and Mishustin, China and Russia will fully tap the potential of bilateral ties and deepen and expand cooperation in key areas for the common benefits of both sides.Li Yonghui, a researcher of Russian studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that China and Russia are expected to further strengthen cooperation in trade and the economy, particularly by promoting investment, and enhance people-to-people exchanges."Li's visit has not only reflected close collaboration between the two countries amid the current international landscape, but also consolidated the foundation for future cooperation, demonstrating their willingness and determination to carry out mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields," she added.Qian Feng, an expert at Tsinghua University's National Strategy Institute and a senior research fellow at Beijing-based think tank Taihe Institute, said the premier's visit once again shows the international community that consolidating China-Russia relations is a strategic choice made by the two nations based on their fundamental interests.The European Commission's decision to impose punitive duties on the imports of battery electric vehicles from China has drawn criticism from experts who worry about a potential trade war and a slowdown in the European Union's net-zero ambition.The commission disclosed on Tuesday to interested parties the draft decision to impose definitive countervailing duties on imports of EVs from China, with a slight adjustment from the provisional duties announced earlier.The latest duties range from 36.3 percent for SAIC, 19.3 percent for Geely, 17 percent for BYD and 9 percent for Tesla, which accounts for more than one-third of the EU's EV imports from China. The decision will not retroactively collect countervailing duties.Ding Chun, director of the Center for European Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the commission's decision is "extremely regrettable".Neither China nor the EU should necessarily aim to achieve the most optimum outcome for themselves, but the second-best outcome through coordination, Ding said."They should be rational and practical and handle the dispute cautiously to avoid a trade war, which will be a lose-lose outcome for both sides."The dispute should be resolved through healthy competition and cooperation to promote new energy vehicle industries, he said. "Protectionism won't help speed up technological advancement and industrial upgrade, or win competition and market or satisfy customers."Chris Aylett, a research associate at the Environment and Society Centre at Chatham House, a think tank in London, voiced concerns that the EU tariffs will slow down the bloc's green transition.Decarbonization technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines and EVs share a characteristic that sets them apart from other traded goods, Aylett wrote on the Chatham House website."When swapped for fossil fuel alternatives, they reduce the quantity of planet-warming gases being pumped into the atmosphere. They are needed in vast quantities, and in very short order, to give any chance of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change."He argued that the EU's ambitious goal of net zero by 2050, along with an intermediate target of at least a 55 percent reduction by 2030, "implies deploying mass-market clean technology products like solar panels and electric vehicles in very large numbers".World leader"When it comes to cheap, clean technology, China is the undisputed world leader. Two decades of consistent and targeted industrial policy, combined with the benefits of a huge domestic market, mean that China today produces extremely competitively priced, high-quality, low-carbon goods," he said, citing examples that the cheapest EVs in France were priced between $24,000 and $32,500 last year, while in China, more than 50 models were retailing locally for less than $15,000."All else being equal, anything which stems the flow of the cheapest low-carbon products will increase the cost of the transition and slow it down, increasing the risk of the EU missing its emission reduction targets," he said.He also cautioned that if the EU keeps the cost of consumer goods such as EVs high, it will strengthen the perception of clean energy as something for the rich, and of concern for the climate as an elite preoccupation."It is not hard to see how these issues could be exploited for political gain, posing further risks to a successful transition," Aylett said.Uri Dadush and Conor McCaffrey, two researchers at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, said the punitive tariffs "represent a formidable barrier in an industry where average profit margins are typically in the range of 4 percent to 8 percent".The biggest effects of tariffs are the rise in consumer prices and, over time, the diversion of imports to more expensive third-party suppliers, they wrote in a joint analysis."In this case, high prices for EVs will cause additional damage by directly slowing the green transition and by garbling the commission's message about its urgency and overwhelming importance," they said. "Low-income EU consumers who need a car and are already struggling with high prices will be especially affected."China has established a clear technological lead across the EV value chain, one that may no longer depend on subsidies, they added.They suggest that Chinese OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) may respond to the duties by establishing production in the EU, but that option will also entail higher costs and prices, and in any event will only be open to the biggest producers."Some Chinese producers of EVs and batteries may prefer instead to establish their largest facilities in lower-cost locations with access to the EU market, as is already happening in Morocco and Turkiye," the analysis said."Within the EU, Hungary, which maintains close relations with China, may turn out to be the preferred EU location for Chinese OEM investment."China will take all necessary measures to defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, said the Ministry of Commerce, right after the EU's latest tarriff desicion late on Tuesday.The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, said on Tuesday that it plans to impose import tariffs of up to 36.3 percent on Chinese EVs for potentially five years.This decision is based on facts unilaterally determined by the EU, rather than mutually recognized facts. China firmly opposes it and is deeply concerned about the move, a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said in an online statement late on Tuesday.Since the end of June, China and the EU have conducted more than ten rounds of technical consultations on this issue, based on facts and rules, according to the ministry.The spokesperson said that China hopes the EU will genuinely cooperate with the Chinese side in a rational and pragmatic manner, working together to seek effective solutions and taking concrete steps to prevent an escalation of trade tensions.The European Union's latest decision to impose modified tariffs on imports of electric vehicles from China brings nothing but "deep disappointment" and will lead to a lose-lose situation for both sides, said a leading industry analyst on Tuesday."The EU has generally upheld the original proposed import duties for Chinese automakers, despite all the efforts made by the Chinese government, industry associations and enterprises to communicate and coordinate since early July, which is a disadvantageous option for both China and the EU," said Sun Xiaohong, secretary-general of the automotive branch of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products, in an exclusive interview with China Daily.Sun's comments came as the EU disclosed on Tuesday its draft decision to slightly reduce planned import duties on Chinese electric vehicle firms including BYD (from the original 17.4 percent to 17 percent), Geely (from 19.9 percent to 19.3 percent) and SAIC (from 37.6 percent to 36.3 percent), while new reduced rate for Tesla stands at 9 percent, lower than the 20.8 percent it had signposted in July.The fact that Tesla gets to be exempt from the same tariff level as its Chinese counterparts is a glaring practice of double standards, Sun stressed."The EU has identified 18 ways in which China allegedly subsidizes electric vehicles, which is ridiculous," he said, adding that China hopes the WTO can finally come up with a fair result on the issue, after China filed an appeal with the global body earlier this month and challenged the imposition of provisional additional tariffs on imports of Chinese EVs.Chinese EV companies are also closely monitoring the progress and outcomes of the EU's anti-subsidy investigation, in order to assess the risks of investing in the region and make investment decisions accordingly, said the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products in its latest statement on Tuesday.lijiaying@chinadaily.com.cnThe Dali 120th Anniversary World Tour China Beijing Station kicked off at China World Mall on Friday to commemorate one of the most influential surrealist artist of the 20th century.Salvador Dali was a Spanish surrealist artist renowned for his technical skill, precise draftsmanship, and the striking and bizarre images in his work. His creativity in Tianma Starry Sky blends his unique interpretation of the world into sculpture, installation, jewelry art, and even images, forming Dali's artistic philosophy.The exhibition in Beijing features a total of 142 exhibits, including 23 sculptures, 95 Illustration book prints, 6 installation art pieces, 9 jewelry artworks, and 9 fashion artworks created by globally designers to pay tribute to Dali. The total value of the exhibits exceeded 100 million yuan.With visual and audio background, the audience can enjoy a dreamlike world. Dali's classic artistic images such as "Eternal Memory" and "Space Elephant" are presented in the form of sculptures, intertwined with Dali's most common image symbols such as melting clocks, canes, snails, angels, butterflies, etc., forming a wonderful artistic maze.China and Ireland expect to see stronger ties in agricultural research, education and transnational cooperation, according to experts from both countries.A stepped-up partnership can promote global agricultural advancements as the two nations commemorate their 45th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year, said Ann Derwin, Irish ambassador to China.She made the remarks at the World Agrifood Innovation Conference 2024 Summit Dialogue, which was held at China Agricultural University in Beijing late July.Derwin, highlighting bilateral technical exchanges, joint research and development efforts, and the promotion of modern agricultural technologies, said this expansion of cooperation areas signifies robust growth and potential.Sun Qixin, president of China Agricultural University, said at the conference that the university has always been committed to deepening international cooperation and exchanges, and has established close partnerships with top global institutions such as National University of Ireland and University College Dublin to promote global agricultural prosperity and development.At the same time, the university is making efforts to develop the World Agrifood Innovation Conference into an international, regular and high-standard platform for the exchange and cooperation of agricultural science and technology innovation, to contribute to the advancement of global agricultural technology, he said.Drawing on Ireland's historical struggles with famine, Derwin said that food and nutrition security is important for national and global stability and development.She said Ireland has bolstered collaboration with the World Food Program, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and African nations, particularly focusing on supporting underdeveloped countries through targeted food programs.She also expressed her hope for Ireland to play a more substantial role in international agricultural exchanges.On July 4, the British public voted overwhelmingly to reject the Conservative government of Rishi Sunak and deliver the Labour Party's Keir Starmer to office, thus bringing Labour to power for the first time since 2010. After years of political instability, controversy and chaos that have beset the United Kingdom, as well as economic stagnation and decline, it is hoped that the new government will offer a spell of stability, sensibility and pragmatism in its policies both at home and abroad. With Starmer commanding a massive majority, he is sure to forge his own vision for the country.It is hoped that the UK will be able to earnestly and productively reengage with one of its key economic partners — China. The previous government is guilty of destroying the bilateral relationship with Beijing due to its mismanagement of Britain's foreign policy as a whole.It pursued a highly ideological path with Brexit, paid excessive subservience to the United States, and deliberately whipped up anti-China sentiment domestically to distract attention from its failures. Then there was opposition from certain parliamentary members' groups which were subject to the influence of foreign organizations.The new government, therefore, offers an opportunity for Britain to reset its relations with the world on more sensible terms. Although we should not expect geopolitical realities to change, and while Starmer is by no means a radical, having purged the "anti-war Left "from his party while in opposition, what we can realistically expect is a foreign policy based more on pragmatism, national interests and sensibility, as opposed to one premised on ideology, identity and short-termism.For example, the previous Conservative government was obsessed with pursuing a bilateral trade agreement with the US on the sole premise of Anglophone exceptionalism, as opposed to actual benefits.Even as a protectionist, Washington showed no interest in such a deal, and Downing Street happily sacrificed its other interests on a whim, especially those concerning China. Its routine weaponization of anti-China sentiment for short-term political gain also made it impossible to engage with Beijing even as Sunak professed that he wished to do so in certain areas, becoming a victim of internal party conflict.As a result, what we are likely to see from a Labour government is not a drastic change in policy, but certainly a rebalancing that will make it possible for London to have an amicable relationship with Beijing again and to compartmentalize disagreements and areas of cooperation. Already, Starmer's government is pursuing a "reset" with the European Union that has been described as an "end to the Brexit era"; in other words, an end to the theatrical nationalism and imperial-era nostalgia of the Conservatives and a return of cooperation-focused policies. When the time is right, we are likely to see this happen with China too.While the previous government was subjected to backbench rebellions frequently led by highly ideological anti-China members of Parliament, Starmer's large-scale majority and emphasis on party discipline will mean his agenda will not be disrupted, and therefore, backbench MPs cannot impose "costs" on the government for engaging with Beijing. For example, owing to factional conflict within the Conservative Party, individuals such as Iain Duncan Smith and Liz Truss held disproportionate influence over the government's positions on China and threatened rebellion constantly, which is what produced such jarring inconsistencies.However, Beijing should nonetheless be aware that US-funded groups and organizations, as well as the Taiwan region, will continue to press for influence among the new batch of MPs, as well as a hostile mainstream media, and thus the so-called "golden era" will not return. This, however, is preferable to the Cold War-style conflict that was actively sought by some in the previous administration. Ultimately, the UK continues to have significant interests in a cooperative, open and mature relationship with China, one which can be made to work despite ideological and geopolitical differences. As Britain enters a new era, it is time for a mature "reset "based on national interests.The author is a British political and international-relations analyst. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.China's Ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Zeguang made a visit to Aberdeen, Scotland, on Friday and Saturday, where he called for stronger China-UK mutually beneficial cooperation, as China deepens reform to advance modernization.During his meeting on Friday with the Depute Provost of Aberdeen Steve Delaney and co-leaders of Aberdeen City Council Christian Allard and Ian Yuill, Zheng said China will continue to bring fresh opportunities to countries worldwide, including the UK.As the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China concluded in July, Zheng highlighted that the resolution adopted of more than 300 reform measures will further invigorate society, promote high-quality development, and expand high-standard opening-up, thus benefiting the world.Zheng pointed out that China and Aberdeen have broad cooperation potential and prospects in areas including energy transition, low-carbon development, economy and trade, education, tourism, and more.Aberdeen, which is located in northeast Scotland, is the third most populous Scottish city. The discovery of North Sea oil spurred the development of the oil industry, making it a major component of the city's economy, alongside shipping, deep-sea fishing, agriculture, and other sectors.Businesses in the United Kingdom expect more engagement, trade and collaboration with their counterparts in China, said leaders of several British business communities after learning about the outcome of the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.The resolution adopted at the plenum, which concluded in Beijing in mid-July, comprises more than 300 important reform measures, with many addressing concerns of foreign businesses about accessing China's market and getting equal treatment."For the business community, you may want to pay special attention to reforms in the following areas: market economy, innovation, green development and opening-up," said Zheng Zeguang, China's ambassador to the UK, at a reception held in London on July 30 by the China-Britain Business Council and the China Chamber of Commerce in the UK.Zheng briefed an audience of over 150 officials, scholars and business representatives about the plenum and updated them on the latest progress of the Chinese economy. "Our cooperation can help grow our respective economies, bring down the cost of living, raise productivity and accelerate the green transition," he said. "The Chinese market will always be open to British businesses."Peter Burnett, chief executive of the China-Britain Business Council, said he was encouraged after listening to the speech by the ambassador. "It's very clear that the reform and opening-up program continues," he said. "There are many measures that have been announced in the outcomes of the third plenum, and there are lots for us to do, and that is good."Burnett said he thinks the new UK government is going to engage more with China because China plays an important role in global supply chains. "I think they will be spending more time on the subject and engaging positively," he said."On the whole, the UK business community is optimistic about the Chinese economy and Chinese market. … They look at China and they see an affluent middle class who want to buy British brands, British goods, British-produced commodities," added Burnett.Fang Wenjian, chairman of the China Chamber of Commerce in the UK, said the resolution from the plenum is reassuring as the emphasis on reform and opening-up reinforces the certainty and consistency of China's government policies."Certainty and consistency of policies are so important for business. With great confidence, we can continue to implement our business strategies both in the UK and in China," he said, adding that the reform measures mentioned in the resolution of the plenum highlight the vast opportunities for trade and economic cooperation between the two countries."In the finance area where I'm working, there will be a continuous focus on tech finance, green finance, inclusive finance, pension finance and digital finance," he said. "And the deepening of the capital market reform will create more opportunities for UK investors and financial institutions, including asset managers or insurance firms."Rhys Whalley, executive director of the Manchester China Forum, which focuses on building Greater Manchester's long-term commercial links with China, said the plenum "is a very strong message of commitment to welcoming foreign investors, encouraging more to come in and the continued relaxation of that environment for foreign businesses to operate."Whalley highlighted the green and low-carbon economy as an important area for future collaboration. "We all can recognize the challenges that climate change is presenting, and the critical importance of both sides coming together to work on those areas, and China is already a global leader in that area," he said, adding that a China-UK hydrogen energy cooperation forum will take place in Manchester later this year.John McLean, chairman of China UK Business Development Centre, said he thinks the resolution from the plenum has recognized the challenges that China has to face and what has to be done to fix them, and the encouragement and support for small and medium-sized enterprises will inject dynamism into the Chinese economy."I sense there is a tonal change and it makes people far more open and confident. And we know confidence breeds opportunity," he said, adding that the center is planning to open offices in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, and Chongqing later this year, and will organize a delegation of British technology companies to visit China in September."This is people-to-people exchanges. It's you come to see me, I come to see you, and then we agree on what we can do," he said. "We've got to keep this engagement going."The Chinese comedy blockbuster Successor held a special premiere in London on Friday.Starring the renowned comedic duo Shen Teng and Ma Li and directed by Yan Fei and Peng Damo, Successor tells the story of a wealthy couple, Ma Chenggang and Chunlan, who decide to design a life of poverty for their little son to teach him the values Ma Chenggang learned during his own tough upbringing.The family embarks on a hilarious journey, living in a dilapidated yard and working as donkey drivers in their contrived impoverished existence.Despite the hardships, their son Ma Jiye is their only hope. Ma Jiye excels academically and is determined, but as he grows older, he starts noticing the increasingly strange behavior of those around him.The film, which officially premiered on July 16 in China, has grossed over 2.7 billion yuan ($380million) as of August 5, ranking it in the top three of the 2024 box office charts in China, according to the Chinese entertainment service platform Maoyan.This movie marks another successful collaboration between Shen Teng, Ma Li, Yan Fei, and Peng Damo, following their previous hits like "Goodbye Mr. Loser" (2015).Audience members at the London premiere were thrilled with the film's humor and touching moments. "Successor not only entertains but also offers a deep reflection on values and concepts of education," said one attendee.Rights to the film have been picked up by CMC Pictures, the Chinese studio behind "The Meg" monster shark franchise. The international release of the film, including in North America, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Benelux, began on Thursday.hexiating@chinadaily.com.cnAudiences were treated to a rich display of Yunnan's culture with an array of meticulously curated events in London, featuring art, music, dance, cuisine, and handicrafts that highlighted the region's glamour.Situated in southwest China, Yunnan province is renowned for its stunning natural landscapes, home to five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and its rich tapestry of 27 ethnic groups, each contributing its unique cultures and customs to the region.The activities marked the debut of the first-ever Yunnan Cultural Festival on Saturday, which was initiated to showcase Yunnan's deep cultural roots and celebrate its rich tradition within the UK society.The festival kicked off with an ethnic costume fashion show, where models donned the traditional attire of the southwestern ethnic minorities, predominantly living in Yunnan province. The intricate designs and distinctive ethnic features of the clothing fascinated the audience.The event attracted hundreds of attendees. Zhang Jie, co-founder of the festival, said: "The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Seeing so many people from different backgrounds come together to learn about and celebrate Yunnan culture has been incredibly rewarding."The event reached its climax with the Torch Festival, also known as the Fire Festival, one of the grandest events for the Yi community. People sang and danced around the torches, celebrating the festive vibe.Arianna Lucente, who has lived in Yunnan for two years since 2007, told China Daily that the minority culture and food at the event were really dear to her and brought back her memories of living there."Sometimes I'm a bit nostalgic about Yunnan, and about China. So whenever there's an event going on about it, I'm really happy to participate," she said."I think there's not so much knowledge about China yet in London. So I'm really happy that there was a chance to shed light on a different part of China that many people don't know much about that, bring people together and make them more curious about it," she added.The audience was also delighted by the featured workshop on traditional handicrafts, such as "Jia Ma" woodblock printing. This ancient practice, incorporating motifs of gods, birds, beasts, mountains and vegetation, is believed to ward off misfortune and promote well-being."The festival gives insights into who these people are, what they do, and how they live," said Mark Shaw, another member of the audience at the event. "It opens more people to different cultures, in a way so that we understand how different cultures interact."Zhu Yirui, another co-founder of the festival said that this festival enriched London’s cultural landscape and gave local people a chance to understand and appreciate Yunnan’s unique heritage.Jiang Duo contributed to this story.Shanghai Opera House, the Royal Opera House and Shanghai Grand Theatre jointly present Giacomo Puccini's masterpiece, Madama Butterfly from Aug 9 to Aug 11 at the Shanghai Grand Theatre, commemorating the 120th anniversary of the premiere. #RoyalOperaHouse #classicopera #ShanghaiSummerChina and Switzerland have reaffirmed their commitment to keep making positive contributions to promoting peace and stability in the Middle East, an official said on Monday.In a recent phone conversation, Special Envoy of the Chinese government on the Middle East issue Zhai Jun discussed with the Swiss Envoy to the Middle East, Wolfgang Amadeus Brülhart.He briefed Brülhart about the recent reconciliation talks among Palestinian factions in Beijing from July 21 to 23 and expressed China's sincere hope for the establishment of an independent State of Palestine and the realization of national unity based on the internal reconciliation of Palestinian factions.Zhai praised Switzerland's active efforts in advancing the two-state solution.Brülhart commended China for successfully mediating reconciliation talks among 14 Palestinian factions that jointly signed the Beijing Declaration on Ending Division and Strengthening Palestinian National Unity.He emphasized that Switzerland shared the same position with China on the issue of Palestinian internal reconciliation, believing a unified stance among Palestinian factions that speak with one voice is a prerequisite for achieving the two-state solution and resolving the Palestinian issue.Switzerland is willing to maintain communication with China on the issue, he added.Organized by the British Chambers of Commerce in China, the British Business Awards 2024 was launched at the office of the British Chamber of Commerce Shanghai, with the aim to recognize and promote excellence in innovation, enterprise and endeavor in both the British and Chinese business communities.This year, the Awards are supported by the Department for Business and Trade, the British Council, the China-Britain Business Council, the Confederation of British Industry, Scottish Development International, Invest Northern Ireland and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the UK."In the four quarters to the end of Q4 2023, China was the UK's 5th largest trading partner, accounting for 5.1 percent of total UK trade. We are investing and cooperating in many business sectors of the future: green energy, the digital economy and healthcare, to name just three," said British Deputy Trade Commissioner for China, Sohail Shaikh. "Building on these foundations and capitalizing where our respective strengths complement each other will require innovation, enterprise and endeavour."Chairwoman of the British Business Awards 2024, Kirsten Johnston, introduced this year's Awards. "The 10th edition of the British Business Awards recognizes excellence in leadership, partnership, innovation, education, social impact, sustainability, and commercial endeavors. We welcome and encourage entries from companies across China."She also introduced the new brand for the 2024 Awards. "This year, we have launched a brand identity inspired by the auspicious Chinese Knot, a symbol of friendship and a fruitful, long-lasting relationship that represents the trade relations between the UK and China. The new logo serves as a Mark of Unity and features the energetic and ever-changing colors of the Aurora Borealis."With a new government and Cabinet in place in Britain, a reset of relations between China and the United Kingdom is likely, experts said, while calling upon Downing Street to take a pragmatic and realistic approach toward mending ties with Beijing.The UK elected Keir Starmer as prime minister in early July, ending 14 years of Conservative rule.The Labour government outlined its China policy in its election manifesto before the country went to polls on July 4. "After 14 years of damaging Conservative inconsistency over China, Labour will bring a long-term and strategic approach to managing our relations," the manifesto said."We will cooperate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must," it added.Starmer has promised a "full audit" of the UK's relationship with China within 100 days of assuming office. It could take as much as a year to carry out the audit, an article in Politico said.The Labour government will largely follow the China policy of the last administration, but is "likely to see minor adjustments in fields such as economy and trade", Jian Junbo, deputy director of the Center for China-Europe Relations at Fudan University's Institute of International Studies, told China Daily. "The Labour government might adopt a more pragmatic approach toward China. Cooperation in climate change and investment could see potential growth."China is the UK's largest trading partner in Asia and the UK is China's third-largest trading partner in Europe, official data show.Former UK prime minister David Cameron sought to create a "golden era" of engagement with China in 2015, but relations swung to overt hostility under Liz Truss and to confused ambiguity under Rishi Sunak, the newly appointed UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy wrote in an article, titled The Case for Progressive Realism, that was published in Foreign Affairs in April.The UK must "adopt a more consistent strategy" that would recognize that Beijing "poses a systemic challenge for British interests" and recognize China's importance to the British economy and the need to work with China on matters of global concern, Lammy wrote.Zheng Zeguang, China's ambassador to the UK, said it is a critical time now for China-UK relations, with both new opportunities and new challenges.Fifty-two years of diplomatic relations between China and the UK have proved that cooperation serves both sides and the world, Zheng said at an event organized for the British business community on July 30.Wang Zikui, an assistant researcher of UK politics at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of International Relations, told China Daily, "A pragmatic and realistic approach is expected from the Starmer government.""China and the UK can see the possibility of cooperation on issues that do not involve security or sensitive topics. Clean energy, artificial intelligence and education could be areas of shared interest," Wang said. "Cultural and people-to-people exchanges should be further enhanced to bolster ties."Noting the "special relationship "between the UK and the United States, Wang said the UK will enhance its role as a "knot" in strengthening the bond between the US and the European Union.The UK will keep close ties with the US and the EU while exploring relations with China, Wang said."The upcoming US election could further complicate Britain's China policy as the UK is a core part of the US alliance system," Wang said. "Whoever ascends to the White House will align Britain in consistency with its geostrategic goals."Jian, of Fudan University's Institute of International Studies, said, "Global geopolitical shifts, as well as the US-UK and EU-UK relations, will influence the trajectory of China-UK relations."Starmer assumed office as the country grappled with a series of economic and societal challenges.The UK's GDP fell for two quarters in a row in the second half of 2023. Overcrowded prisons are close to running out of space and the National Health Service has been beset by strikes.UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said at the end of July that public finances face a projected overspend of 22 billion pounds ($28 billion) inherited from the previous administration and warned of "difficult decisions "ahead.The Labour government has laid out five priority missions that include kick-starting economic growth, developing green development and modernizing the NHS.The United Kingdom's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, or RPO, has announced it is to embark on its first tour of China since 2017 next week."It's a tremendous honor for the RPO to be returning to China after quite a long absence, and it's particularly exciting," Huw Davies, the orchestra's acting managing director, said at a media briefing in London on Friday.Davies said that the tour hoped to bring the joy of orchestral music to a much wider audience and rekindle those friendships and relationships with China.Since making its debut in China in the early 1970s, the London-based RPO has performed regularly in the country. The RPO's last tour in China was in 2017.This year's 11-day, seven-city tour will commence in Beijing and also include performances in Shanghai, Wuhan and Nanjing. There will be nine concerts in total.During the tour, 94 musicians will perform a specially-curated repertoire, including pieces from two renowned Chinese composers, the Crouching Tiger Cello Concerto by Tan Dun and Mulan Psalm: Potpourri by Guan Xia.The program also features masterpieces such as Benjamin Britten's Four Sea Interludes, Shostakovich's Symphony No.5, and Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade.Vasily Petrenko, the RPO's music director, expressed his hope to showcase connections and interchange between different music genres and cultures through this tour."It's very important to bring cultures together and let us know more about Chinese culture, and the Chinese know more about British classical music culture," Petrenko said, adding that understanding each other's cultures and values will help nations work and live better together."The world is in a very turbulent situation, and we still hope that culture can serve as one of the tools to unite the world, to calm connections, and to harmonize the way humanity lives," he said.Jiang Duo contributed to this story.The surge in Chinese electric vehicle sales across Europe in June was mainly driven by looming tariff threats, newly released data reveal.According to analytics company Dataforce, Chinese carmakers captured a record 11 percent of the European EV market in June. The figures, which include the United Kingdom, show that about 23,000 EVs were registered in June, marking a 72 percent increase from the previous month as consumers raced to beat anticipated price hikes within the European Union.In early July, the EU announced plans to impose extra duties of up to 37.6 percent on Chinese EV imports because of what it called "unfair" state subsidies benefiting manufacturers in a keenly contested market.Data from Dataforce further highlight that 40 percent of the surge in imports came from dealers, rather than consumers, stocking up on vehicles ahead of the tariff implementation.Chinese state-owned SAIC experienced the greatest uptick in sales, shifting just under 13,400 units in June, as opposed to rival BYD's sales of just under 4,000.SAIC vehicles are subject to the harshest tariff of 38 percent, compared with the 17 percent on BYD.Chinese EV imports to the United States have been subject to 100 percent tariffs since the start of the year, killing sales there, but there is still huge demand in the UK, which took 12 percent of vehicles, and the EU, with 36 percent, according to Chinese trade specialist website Soapbox.Surging pricesThe Guardian cited research by Spanish bank BBVA showing that a Chinese car in Europe was up to twice as costly as in the domestic market, with some vehicles, such as BYD's Dolphin, selling for almost three times the price.In Italy, sales incentives in June to increase EV purchases were all snapped up in less than 9 hours, the Italian government said, with most interest coming from individual buyers.One consequence of the tariff standoff could be an increase in investment by Chinese EV makers in Europe, as a way round the additional fees.The BBC reports that BYD's first European factory is already being built in Hungary and production could start before the end of next year, SAIC is reportedly looking at sites, and another manufacturer, Chery, has signed a partnership contract to start manufacturing vehicles in Spain."It's a well-architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China," said Bill Russo, CEO of strategy and investment organization Automobility in Shanghai."The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU."China's ambitions of achieving low-carbon development as mentioned by the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have won applause from international climate and clean energy experts.Belinda Schaepe, China policy analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, which is based in Helsinki, Finland, said the third plenum has sent out a powerful message on climate and energy, underscoring China's commitment to green and low-carbon development.China will make concerted efforts to cut carbon emissions, reduce pollution, pursue green development, and actively respond to climate change, said the communique of the third plenum."This elevates China's commitment to reducing emissions and tackling climate change to a new level and could pave the way for ambitious targets in China's upcoming Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change," she said, referring to China's efforts to reduce national emissions as a key part of the Paris Agreement. The contributions are commitments that countries make to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions as part of climate change mitigation.Schaepe said the third plenum confirms the recent policy transition from focus on energy intensity to carbon reduction."This is a positive direction and indicates that China is moving closer to post-peak carbon reduction," she said.She said the main focus of the plenum was new quality productive forces as a guiding force of China's economic growth going forward with particular emphasis on new energy industries.She said the government aims to implement fiscal, tax, financial, investment and pricing policies and standards to support low-carbon development."This continued industrial policy support will further strengthen China's clean energy sector and potentially accelerate the domestic transition," she said.She noted that the Chinese government has proposed to improve measures for green government procurement and refining a green taxation system."If implemented well, these policies could be transformative for high-emission sectors such as steel to accelerate heavy industry decarbonization," she said, adding that the steel sector may have reached a turning point with no new permits given for coal-based steel plants in the first half of 2024, indicating progress on the path to decarbonization.She also applauded China's ambitions to improve the carbon accounting system and certification systems."The anticipated expansion of the national carbon market to include the aluminum, cement and steel sectors provides opportunities for faster emission reductions in these sectors," she said.Paul Dorfman, a visiting fellow of Science Policy Research Unit of Sussex Energy Group, University of Sussex in the United Kingdom, praised China's achievements in the renewable sector."It is now clear that renewables will do the heavy lifting for the net-zero energy. This is good news for China, as it cements its position as the global leader in renewables development — with twice as much solar and wind power capacity under construction as the rest of the world combined," he said.Dorfman said China installed more solar power units in the past year than it had in the previous three years combined.With 180 gigawatts of utility-scale solar and 159 GW of wind power already under construction, China has installed more than 100 GW of solar power capacity in just the first half of 2024.He said if their collective planned utility-scale solar and wind projects come online, China could easily reach 1,200 GW of installed wind and solar capacity by the beginning of 2025 — driven by improved system integration, lower curtailment rates, and enhanced solar and wind competitiveness.China's embassy in the United Kingdom held a reception in London on Thursday to celebrate the 97th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, or PLA, which falls on Aug 1.Zheng Zeguang, China's ambassador to the UK, said as he addressed around 200 guests, including officials from the UK government and Parliament, diplomats, and defense attaches, that the PLA had fought heroically for the liberation and freedom of the Chinese people and for the security and development of the country, and that it had made indelible contributions to world peace and stability."China is ready to work with all countries to implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, and build a community with a shared future for mankind," said Zheng. "It is hoped that the militaries of the two countries will increase dialogue and exchanges, enhance mutual understanding, avoid misjudgment, and always be a stabilizing factor in the overall China-UK relationship."Mick Smeath, the UK's air vice-marshal, who attended the reception, echoed that the military relationship is an important part of the China-UK overall relationship, and that the UK and China will enhance defense dialogue and communication, and work together to promote regional and global peace and stability.Major General Feng Min, a defense attache at China's embassy in the UK, said China has sent more than 50,000 personnel on nearly 30 United Nations peacekeeping missions since 1990, and that China's hospital ship, Peace Ark, has offered free medical treatment to more than 250,000 people across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.A photo exhibition of the PLA's peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations was displayed in the embassy during the reception.China's latest policy declaration of fostering technological innovation and expanding international cooperation in science and technology has brought encouragement for the sector, and the industry is eager for more detailed plans, experts in the United Kingdom say.Their comments came after the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China earlier this month. The resolution from the plenum stated: "We will expand international science and technology exchanges and cooperation, encourage the establishment of international science and technology organizations in China, and improve the management mechanisms whereby China's universities, research institutes, and science and technology-related social groups engage in specialized exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts."Russ Shaw, founder of Global Tech Advocates, a network connecting 30,000 technology experts, startups and angel investors across the world, said he is glad to see the resolution encourage bigger presence of international science and technology organizations."I think China, like many other countries, is looking at how technology can drive the productive forces in its economy, and the resolution from this plenary session will reinforce that," Shaw said, adding that he is going to China later this year and will probably attend the opening of a subgroup of the network in Chongqing."I support what the government is saying and focusing on, as part of the new quality productive forces, but the question is what is in the detail that sits behind it and how will that actually work in terms of supporting the technology sector," Shaw said.He admitted that geopolitics brings some difficulties in international collaboration, but in areas, such as energy transition, climate technology and healthcare, there can be ways for cross-border collaboration and opportunities for scaling businesses to grow and thrive.Kevin Lin, president of TusPark UK, the UK branch of a global science park network, said the encouragement for international cooperation in science and technology is good, and will show the right direction for the market and private capital firms to participate."The traditional industries, such as the development of real estate property, are not in line with the long-term development and modernization of the country anymore, and we are eager to see more step-by-step guidance and policies in promoting tech cooperation and innovation," Lin said.Adapting to overseas rulesChinese companies going global often face different market environments, cultural backgrounds and social systems, Lin said, suggesting that more support be given to Chinese entrepreneurs to help them adapt to the rules and regulations in the overseas market.Kerry Brown, director of Lau China Institute at King's College London, said Chinese universities are already ranked very high in the world, and Chinese government's investment in science and technology has produced a lot of innovations in areas such as quantum computing, new energy and artificial intelligence."We have collaborated with China for many years and there were a lot of technology transfers from Europe to China," he said. "It would be good if we have a relationship where some of the new technologies will be transferred from China to Europe."Premier Li Qiang called on Sunday for China and Italy to work together to strengthen dialogue at various levels and promote optimized and balanced bilateral trade, in an effort to foster a more mature and stable relationship.The two countries should enhance cooperation in areas such as shipbuilding, aerospace, new energy and artificial intelligence as well as boost mutually beneficial cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises, Li said during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.On Saturday, Meloni kicked off her first visit to China since assuming office in October 2022, aiming to stabilize Italy's relationship with its strong economic partner.Her five-day visit comes months after Italy pulled out of the Belt and Road Initiative at the end of last year. It was the only Group of Seven member to sign a BRI cooperation document with China.After their talks on Sunday, Li and Meloni witnessed the signing of a series of cooperation agreements in areas including industry, education and environmental protection.Italy is China's fourth-largest trading partner in the European Union, while China is Italy's largest trading partner in Asia.Li said that China supports its enterprises to carry out cooperation in the European country and hopes that Italy will provide a fair, safe and nondiscriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises.He called on the two sides to advance people-to-people exchanges, especially make efforts to jointly host a series of activities to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the death of Marco Polo, a legendary Italian explorer who is viewed as a symbol of the historical ties between the two nations.Li also expressed the hope that the EU will view China's development in a rational manner, see Beijing as a partner, and promote dialogue and cooperation.China and the EU have been embroiled in trade friction since the group's decision earlier this month to impose provisional tariffs of up to 37.6 percent on electric vehicles imported from China.Meloni said that Italy is willing to play a positive role in helping stabilize EU-China relations. Rome is committed to developing a long-term, stable and sound relationship with Beijing, and is ready to explore new forms of cooperation, she said.On Sunday, Li and Meloni also attended the opening ceremony of the seventh meeting of the China-Italy entrepreneurs committee.The meeting was attended by over 150 entrepreneurs from both sides, including Italian tire maker Pirelli, energy company ENI and defense group Leonardo, as well as wine producers and luxury fashion enterprises.Li told the business leaders that the sustained development of Sino-Italian comprehensive strategic partnership will bring more stable expectations, broader opportunities and more abundant resources to bilateral trade cooperation.He called for the two sides to support their enterprises in tapping into the potential of cooperation in smart manufacturing, new energy and biomedicine.Li emphasized that China's doors will always remain open to businesses from all countries, and it is committed to creating an institutional environment that is transparent, stable and predictable.Beijing will further ease market access and guarantee equal treatment for foreign and domestic enterprises, in order to provide more support and convenience for foreign businesses investing and operating in China, he said.Li expressed the hope that Chinese and Italian entrepreneurs will expand shared interests and strengthen the friendly cooperation between the two countries.On Sunday, Li also met with visiting President of Timor-Leste Jose Ramos-Horta.Li said that China would like to strengthen cooperation with the island nation on infrastructure, connectivity under the BRI framework and expand cooperation in a wider range of areas including agriculture, fisheries, poverty reduction and tourism.zhoujin@chinadaily.com.cnBEIJING -- Chinese Premier Li Qiang attended the opening ceremony of the seventh meeting of the China-Italy entrepreneurs committee with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Beijing on Sunday, calling for enhanced economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.Addressing the opening ceremony, Li said since the establishment of the entrepreneurs committee 10 years ago, it has played a positive role in promoting economic and trade cooperation as well as bilateral relations.Against the backdrop of a sluggish global economic recovery, China and Italy should strengthen economic and trade cooperation to inject more impetus into the development of the two countries, Li said.He called on the two countries to vigorously promote and practice the Silk Road spirit of peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit, adhere to the principle of mutual benefit, support each other's development and work together to achieve common prosperity.Li noted that the continuous and in-depth development of the China-Italy comprehensive strategic partnership will create more stable expectations for economic and trade cooperation for the two sides and bring broader opportunities.China is advancing Chinese modernization on all fronts through high-quality development, and the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made systematic arrangements for further deepening reform and promoting Chinese modernization, Li said.This will not only promote the rapid growth of China's economy but also promote economic optimization and upgrading, unleash huge development potential and provide broad space for cooperation between enterprises of the two countries, he added.Li called on China and Italy to tap new opportunities for cooperation in line with the general trend and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation."We should support enterprises of both sides in tapping the potential of cooperation in smart manufacturing, new energy, biomedicine and other fields, and continue to expand and deepen cooperation," Li said.He emphasized that China will open its door even wider to companies from Italy and other countries, create a transparent, stable and predictable institutional environment, further relax market access, guarantee national treatment for foreign companies, and provide more support and convenience for foreign companies to invest and do business in China.It is hoped that Chinese and Italian entrepreneurs will seize the opportunity and move forward side by side to achieve greater development for their own enterprises, make the "cake of common interests of the two countries bigger" and promote friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, Li said.Meloni said Italy and China should strengthen comprehensive strategic partnership, give full play to complementary advantages and strengthen economic and trade cooperation.She added that Italy is willing to expand practical cooperation with China on economy, trade, investment and artificial intelligence on the basis of mutual respect and trust, fairness and mutual benefit, innovate cooperation models, enhance the competitiveness of enterprises and jointly address global challenges.It is hoped that the economic and trade cooperation between Italy and China will produce more results and add new impetus to the development of bilateral relations, Meloni said.More than 150 entrepreneurs from China and Italy attended the event.Join us as we return to France in episode three of "Paris Olympics (by the Chinese)" to explore the deep-rooted cultural connections between China and Paris in the lead-up to the 2024 Olympic Games.BEIJING -- At the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will pay an official visit to China from July 27 to 31, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning announced on Thursday.China will not stop its reforms in advancing Chinese modernization, and the door to the country will only open wider and never close, the spokesman for China's embassy in the United Kingdom said on Tuesday.Minister Counselor Bi Haibo made the remarks during a briefing for journalists on the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China that concluded last week in Beijing.Responding to the question of whether China's reform has stalled, Bi said the plenum concluded that to deal with complex developments both at home and abroad, and adapt to the new round of scientific and technological revolution, it is vital that China continues to advance reform."Following the overall objectives and roadmap, we will further deepen reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization. This is the road that we will not turn back," said Bi, referring to the resolution adopted at the third plenum. "The resolution put forward over 300 important reform measures, all of which pertain to systems and mechanisms that will unleash the internal driving forces and creativity of the whole country."Since China adopted reform and opening-up as its basic national policy in 1978, foreign companies have contributed to the process and shared the benefits of China's development.The third plenum has made further arrangements to promote China's high-standard opening-up, including further relaxing access to the country's goods, services, and capital markets, and ensuring foreign companies' rights are protected and that they are treated the same as indigenous enterprises.An influential competition for young minds in global governance, the "Rong Chang Cup" Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance (YICGG), kicked off in Budapest, Hungary on Monday. More than 100 guests and participants from over 30 countries gathered to tackle the theme "Shaping Smart Societies: AI for Good, People-Oriented, and Sustainable Development", aiming to contribute youthful ingenuity to the global AI governance landscape at the event jointly hosted by Fudan University and Shanghai Rong Chang Public Welfare Foundation.This marks the competition's return to Europe after eight years since a previous event in Milan. Two Hungarian universities - John von Neumann University and Budapest Metropolitan University - joined the competition's core network as partner institutions of higher education, further cementing educational ties between China and Hungary. From a pool of more than 400 competitors, 81 finalists from 38 countries advanced to the finals, representing diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Participants will be divided into nine world teams to encourage cross-disciplinary dialogue and innovative solutions to AI governance challenges.The event coincides with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Hungary. At the opening ceremony, Fudan University signed memorandum of understanding with several counterparts in Hungary to foster stronger academic exchanges.Initiated by students at Fudan University in 2007, the competition has evolved into a leading platform for international youth engagement in global governance issues. This year, the competition introduces the "Best Governance Case Award" to recognize outstanding contributions to global governance, aiming to inspire and empower young leaders to shape a more equitable and sustainable future for all.Wang Biye contributed to this story.MOSCOW -- Energy cooperation between Russia and China has recently become more intense and productive, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday at the sixth China-Russia Energy Business Forum."Bilateral cooperation in the oil and gas, coal and electricity sectors is systematically expanding," Putin said, adding that the country's supplies of energy resources to China are reaching record volumes.Putin said that relations between Russia and China have been dynamically evolving in line with a comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation, and "one of the most significant components of these relations has traditionally been energy cooperation."The president noted that experts from both countries are working together to develop technologies for the extraction, processing, and transportation of raw materials, with a focus on improving environmental safety.Direct flights between northwest China's Xi'an in Shaanxi province and Milan in Italy will be launched by China Eastern Airlines starting September, the Shanghai-based carrier said on Monday.The Xi'an-Milan flight will be operated every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday between Xi'an Xianyang International Airport and Milan Malpensa Airport, with one-way trip to Milan taking about 10 hours and 50 minutes, said China Eastern.The new flight will be the third route launched by China Eastern between Xi'an and European cities. Tickets are available for purchase at the official website of China Eastern as well as via the app of the airliner.Milan, a world famous city for its history, culture, fashion and art, is one of the four major economic centers of Europe, as well as the second-biggest city of Italy. While Xi'an, the ancient capital of 13 Chinese dynasties, is known for both its rich history and unique culture of nowadays.The year of 2024 marks the 20th anniversary of China and Italy establishing comprehensive strategic partnership. China announced to waive visa requirements for Italian visitors, and the visa-free policy to Italy will be effective until December 31, 2025. Ordinary passport holders from the country can enjoy visa-free travel to China for 15 days.China Eastern will operate four routes between China and Italy by the end of September, namely Shanghai-Rome, Wenzhou (in Zhejiang province)-Rome, Shanghai Venice and Xi'an-Milan, according to the carrier.On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France, Fujian Chunlun Group Co, a tea enterprise based in Fuzhou, Fujian province, inked an agreement in early July to deepen its cooperation with renowned French dining brand Mavrommatis."Currently, French tea lovers drink black tea, green tea, floral tea and compressed tea the most," said Fu Xiaoping, vice-president of Chunlun Group.She said that since establishing its French branch in 2016, Chunlun Group has promoted Fuzhou jasmine tea in prominent French dining establishments, chain supermarkets and other consumer markets."We hope that tea culture can become as popular as coffee culture and be embraced by the younger generation," she said.As a province renowned for its tea production, Fujian boasts a wide array of famous teas, including Dahongpao tea, a rock tea from the Wuyi Mountains, Anxi Tieguanyin tea, a premium oolong tea, and Fuding white tea.In recent years, Fujian tea enterprises have participated in overseas exhibitions and trade and cultural exchange activities to accelerate their expansion into international markets.China's battery electric vehicle (BEV) industry has asked the European Commission to correct its mistakes in its investigations into Chinese BEVs, according to an industrial body representing the Chinese BEV makers.Shi Yonghong, vice-president of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCME), which represents 12 Chinese BEV makers, was in Brussels last week to engage with the European Commission on the issue."The commission made many unlawful findings in the preliminary determination, incompatible with WTO and EU rules," Shi told a news conference in Brussels on Friday."Trade defense measures will harm all sides involved. The strength and growth of EU and Chinese BEV industries lie in collaboration, not conflict."The European Commission initiated anti-subsidy probe into Chinese BEVs on October 4. On July 4, it published its preliminary determination and imposed provisional countervailing duties from 17.4 percent to 37.6 percent on Chinese BEVs for four months until the final determination concludes on Nov 2.Shi reiterated that the investigation was initiated by the commission in the absence of a complaint from the EU industry. The commission has confirmed that the EU industry is not currently in an injurious state, but subject to threat of injury in an imminent future.Shi described such EU practice as "rare, especially in the EU".He cited the facts that many EU member states, the German Association of Automotive Industry (VDA) and several EU BEV producers such as Volkswagen and BMW have voiced their opposition to the preliminary determination.In a nonbinding vote last week on the punitive tariffs on Chinese BEVs, 12 of the 27 EU member states voted in favor, four opposed while 11 states abstained.Shi expressed that the Chinese side is still open to and hopeful of a balanced solution to this investigation, adding that the chamber has been actively cooperating with the commission since the start of the investigation.The chamber presented its views on the preliminary determination in a commission hearing on July 18.Shi said the chamber will continue to defend the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese BEV industry in the investigation and also calls on the Chinese government to take necessary measures to do so.In a news conference on July 16, Olof Gill, the European Commission spokesman for trade and agriculture, said EU member states will have an opportunity to vote on any proposal the commission comes forward to make the provisional duties definitive and such a vote must take place before November 2."In the meantime, the EU continues to consult with China in an attempt to find mutually acceptable solutions," he said."Any negotiated outcome must be effective in addressing the injuries of subsidization that was identified in the context of our investigation."In an op-ed on July 17, Irakli Machaidze, a Vienna-based fellow with Young Voices Europe, said the EU's aim for a greener future and support for local manufacturers is clear."However, making affordable EVs pricier with tariffs will not be an effective solution," he said of the commission's investigation into Chinese BEVs."These new measures risk slowing down progress and hiking costs in our journey to electric mobility," he wrote.Zhang Xingran and Zou Jiyu contributed to the story.Join us in Episode 2 of "Paris Olympics (by the Chinese)", as we travel to Zhejiang province, China, to uncover the innovation driving the upcoming Games.

So I knew that my presence at the forum would be a great opportunity to enrich my inclination in this aspect. But I must say that the reality far exceeded my expectations.The three days at the Nishan forum were very intense, and every moment was rich in insights and inspiration. Registration for the event started on July 9. After the welcome dinner, guests were first treated to fantastic light and water displays, along with grandiose fireworks, and immediately afterwards to the fabulous Jinsheng Yuzhen theater performance. The performance masterfully recounted, along with rituals and music, the figure of Confucius as a teacher and educator (and the long journey of a child to become a wise elder), combining traditional classical Chinese art forms such as poetry, music, and dance with modern arts and cutting-edge theatrical technology, such as the moving stage, holographic displays, and dancers floating in the air. Truly a marvel for the eyes and the spirit.But what I would like to emphasize most in this article are the days of July 10 and 11, when the speakers' contributions brought us to the heart of the festival and best represented the spirit and meaning of the entire forum. The common themes of the speeches were memories of the past and inclusiveness. One is the essence of the other: there can be no inclusive society if it has no memory of its past. It was pointed out that these words already bring us back to the model of the teacher/educator that Confucius himself had described, namely the one who reviews the past to form those who will build the future. And from here we can connect to the fundamental role that education plays, so yesterday as well as today, that was often mentioned in the guests' speeches.Reviewing and teaching one's own past, and one's own history, is the best way (if we don't want to say the only way) to understand histories and cultures different from our own, always with a great attitude of openness and mutual learning, always striving for unity and not division, to build a network of common values, learning from each other, appreciating each other, and promoting all forms of exchange. These values were mentioned many times at the forum, and I feel as close to this vision as one could possibly feel. A vision that defines the concept of national identity as something inclusive, and not, as I am unfortunately often used to hearing, as something divisive. True inclusiveness is one that celebrates differences rather than nullifying them, to create a truly more inclusive society, one that wants to respect the other rather than dominate, with a view to social stability that was already a fundamental principle in the teachings of Confucius. Just as fundamental was the idea and the culture of the family, which according to the great philosopher is the very root of civilization.This is an era of great challenges, a complicated time when serious international tensions are undermining the balance without any signs of stopping, and this is very worrying. Never before has the concept of dialogue, ever present at this year's Nishan forum, been more important, and once again we should learn from our past and what our ancient civilizations have taught us. Even the place where the forum was held, a few kilometers from Qufu, the hometown of Confucius, is itself a symbol of brotherhood: Confucianism is a universal philosophy, a universal language of peace, in which ethics, morality, and social harmony are pursued. And we can say that Shandong is one of the cradles of world civilization, a place that sees its present rooted in a glorious history that goes back millennia.On the role of our roots and cultures, both Western and Eastern, I have already had the opportunity to mention this in the paper I wrote for the forum, titled "The cultural and philosophical roots of Italy and China as the foundation for friendship and cooperation". I have tried in this paper to celebrate the cultures of our two great countries, and to emphasize how from the time of the Roman Empire, through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and to the modern age, they have often been intertwined: this should always be remembered as an impetus for the perpetual strengthening of our friendship and cooperation, especially in a year as important as this one, where we celebrate the 700th anniversary of Marco Polo's death, and the 20th anniversary of the bilateral strategic partnership between Italy and China.The multipolar world that I have had the pleasure of seeing promoted here in Nishan forum and with whose idea I am totally in tune is just that: friendship, cooperation, respect, fostering modernization without ever losing focus on human values. This means combining tradition and modernity: it is the past that serves the present. It is the union of culture and civilization: two elements that are indispensable, and that interpenetrate each other.Italy and China are fathers of two cultures (the Greco-Roman and the Eastern) that we can proudly call classical. And on what classicism is, I would like to conclude by echoing the words of our Ambassador Massimo Ambrosetti in his July 11 speech at the parallel forum "Dialogue on Chinese and Italian Classical Civilizations", in which he defined classical as "everything that has become a model, and that constitutes something universal".And on these universal models, my hope is that the civilizations of the present will always fight for dialogue and inclusiveness, and always work to build a better world.The United Kingdom has no plans to follow the European Union's lead and impose tariffs on imports of China-made electric vehicles, or EVs, the nation's new business minister said.UK's Secretary of State for Business and Trade Jonathan Reynolds, who started overseeing the country's trade policy after the Labour Party's July 4 landslide election win, said at a meeting of G7 fellow ministers in Italy on Tuesday that he had discussed the EU's planned tariffs with his European counterparts, and that the idea did not appeal to him."I am not ruling anything out but, if you have a very much export-orientated industry, the decision you take (must be) the right one for that sector," the Financial Times quoted him as saying.The EU announced in June plans to introduce tariffs of up to 37.6 percent on Chinese EVs, to counter what it said were unfair state subsidies in China.But Reynolds said he is not interested in introducing similar tariffs in the UK, or in launching a formal investigation into Chinese EV imports.The paper said the UK car sector has not called on the government's Trade Remedies Authority to launch such an investigation, something that would be needed before tariffs could be contemplated.Electric vehicles made in China have been popular with UK drivers, with EVs produced by Western companies, including Tesla and BMW, common on British roads alongside China-owned brands, such as MG.And some of the leaders of the EU's 27 member nations are now known to share Reynolds' lack of enthusiasm for tariffs on Chinamade EVs, Reuters reported.It said a nonbinding but influential vote on Tuesday showed EU governments are divided on the issue, something that was laid bare after the European Commission canvassed opinion from EU member nations through the so-called advisory vote.The poll found 12 EU member nations were supportive of the tariffs, four were against them and 11 abstained. Reuters said a large number of abstentions "reflects wavering among many EU members".The European Commission is set to make a final decision on its tariffs in October, following the completion of an investigation into China-made EVs.If the bloc's executive decides to push ahead with the tariffs, they will be the subject of a binding vote, in which a qualified majority of 15 member countries representing 65 percent of the EU's population could block them.The tariffs seem to be losing favor because nations are eager to avoid a trade war with China. Additionally, they have been opposed by German carmakers that sell extensively in China.There has been opposition from major Western automakers that manufacture electric vehicles in China that would also be subject to the EU's proposed tariffs.BRUSSELS -- Collaborating with Europe on the development of electric heavy trucks yields mutually beneficial outcomes in both economic and environmental spheres, Han Wen, founder and CEO of Windrose Technology, told Xinhua in a recent interview.Windrose Technology, a Chinese electric long-haul truck start-up, has been ramping up its presence in Europe to seek fresh investment and meet the growing demand for greener heavy trucks in the region.The electric truck manufacturer has announced plans to establish its European headquarters and its first European factory in Belgium, which will create around 3,000 local jobs. Its assembly plant in Antwerp is expected to produce 10,000 electric trucks annually by 2027."We chose Antwerp as our European center for several reasons," Han noted. "Antwerp is one of Europe's largest logistics hubs, with its pivotal role in land, rail, and road transport, making it an ideal location for our operations."He also highlighted the proximity of Antwerp to key customers.With the European Union (EU) focusing heavily on expanding electric transportation, as it aims to become climate-neutral by 2050, Han believes Europe represents a significant market for electric heavy trucks."Heavy trucks are significant contributors to global carbon dioxide emissions ... addressing their emissions through electrification in Europe is crucial," Han said.Data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association suggest that more than 400,000 zero-emission trucks will have to be on the roads by 2030 to achieve a 45 percent carbon dioxide reduction.Han said the company is considering further localizing its supply chain in Europe and leveraging local production capabilities for the next step, with plans also underway to construct a battery factory.The company's electric heavy truck completed a 3,100-km single-trip road test in May across Europe, spanning from Antwerp in Belgium to Warsaw in Poland.As Europe is willing to provide an entry, "in return, we will introduce advanced Chinese electric heavy truck manufacturing technologies here," Han noted. "It is a win-win cooperation."On 10 July, the Great Britain-China Centre held a reception to celebrate its 50th anniversary at the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. H.E. Ambassador Zheng Zeguang attended the reception at invitation and delivered an address titled "Building More Bridges of Communication and Cooperation". The full text of the address is as follows:Minister West,Sir David,Sir Martin,Distinguished guests,Ladies and gentlemen,Thank you for the kind invitation to this celebration. Congratulations on the 50th anniversary of the Great Britain-China Centre (GBCC).Over the past five decades, GBCC has served as an important bridge between our two countries, working tirelessly to bring the peoples of China and the UK together and promote cooperation between the two governments.On behalf of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, I would like to extend a deep appreciation for your enormous work. I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to friends from various sectors who have given care and support to the development of China-UK relations.The past 50 years has witnessed phenomenal changes in our respective societies and around the world. This provides a lot of food for thought as we reflect on good diplomacy, and China-UK relations.Good diplomacy is all about connecting people and promoting friendship.I am pleased to have hosted around 80 Chinese delegations here in London since last year, many of whom from provinces and cities, and also from universities and businesses.And I am especially delighted to note that the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and the London Symphony Orchestra are visiting China soon. I wish them great success there. I also know that more and more UK businesses are returning to China.Despite that, in the past few years, engagement and communication between our governments were far from enough, and this has to be rectified as a matter of urgency.We welcome more engagement and interactions at the governmental level. We also hope to see more UK tourists and students in China. Engagement and communication will lead to better understanding and can reduce misunderstanding and misjudgment.Good diplomacy is also about managing difficult issues and creating opportunities to work together.Both China and the UK are proud of our respective histories, and are steadfast in safeguarding our respective national interests. But we should never shut down or restrict the channels of communication, and still less, allow our relations to be dictated or hijacked by any third country.As we have learned in the past over half a century, the right way to deal with any differences is to respect each other's core interests, and through dialogue and consultation, minimize the disturbance they bring to the overall relationship.Both China and the UK face important tasks in growing the economy and improving people's lives.Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has been committed to advancing Chinese modernization through high-quality development.China will continue to roll out major measures to expand comprehensive reform and high-level opening up, and in this process, we are ready to broaden mutually beneficial cooperation with the UK and countries around the world.Be it on trade and investment, financial services, renewable energy and green technology, or infrastructure, scientific innovation, cultural and creative industries and healthcare, there is ample space for cooperation between China and the UK.Be it on combating cross-border crimes, the governance of AI safety, addressing climate change, or the settlement of regional  and international hotspot issues, China and the UK should enhance communication and coordination.We all know from facts that our cooperation can help both countries grow our respective economies, bring down the cost of living, raise productivity and accelerate the green transition.Our collaboration on international issues will also help to reduce misjudgment on certain issues, ease tensions, and give diplomacy a better chance. That is also the responsibility we should carry as permanent members of the UN Security Council.In his recent congratulatory letter to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Premier Li Qiang stressed that China places high importance on its relations with the UK, and stands ready to work with the new British government to consolidate political mutual trust, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and intensify people-to-people exchanges, in an effort to drive economic and social development in our respective countries, and promote world peace, stability, and prosperity.Foreign Minister Wang Yi also expressed similar wishes in his letter to Foreign Secretary David Lammy.The Chinese side stands ready to explore the path forward in enhancing communication and collaboration with UK colleagues.Now more than ever, we need GBCC and organizations like yours to help build more bridges of communication and cooperation.And we are ready to work with people like you and friends from all walks of life in the UK, to make unremitting efforts to deepen the mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of our two countries and bring China-UK relations onto the track of steady development.Congratulations again, and thank you.In the premiere episode of "Paris Olympics (by the Chinese)", we explore the significant involvement of the Chinese community in the upcoming 2024 Paris Olympics.Our journey begins with Zheng Jiaxin, a dedicated volunteer who shares her passion for giving back to the community.

The essence of Eastern fashion was revealed through ancient totems, auspicious knot buttons, and delicate embroideries of pavilions and birds, with swirling motifs celebrating life.Bosideng's "Fusion" collection attempts to blend traditional Chinese craftsmanship with modern design. The line features elements inspired by China's cultural heritage, reimagined for contemporary fashion."Fusion" exemplifies a responsible approach to sustainable development, showcased through the use of natural fibers like mulberry silk and traditional vegetable dyes, according to the press release.The event showcased the unique charm of the Bosideng brand and conveyed its determination to remain open and inclusive while continuing its development in the international market.Founded in 1976, Bosideng Group specializes in down apparel R&D, design, and manufacturing, dedicating itself to making down apparel more technologically sophisticated and fashionable, beyond just functional apparel. The Group's down apparel brands include Bosideng, Snow Flying, and Bengen.The group has gained popularity among consumers both in China and overseas.

The Group said it will maintain its focus on its core down apparel business and aims to become one of the most respected fashionable and functional apparel groups in the world.The Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris unveiled a new exhibition on Saturday: "Reviving Craft: Chinese Handicrafts and Contemporary Design".The opening ceremony drew more than 70 distinguished guests from China and France, representing diverse fields including culture, media, art, and diplomacy.Running until July 19, the exhibition features more than 100 works from 40 renowned artists and designers, and more than 20 participating brands and institutions.Included in the framework of the Sino-French Year of Cultural Tourism in 2024 by the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the exhibition celebrates the unique blend of Chinese intangible cultural heritage craftsmanship -- including wood and bamboo weaving, tea making and ceramics -- and contemporary design.Visitors can enjoy an immersive and interactive experience through advanced technologies such as video, multimedia and artificial intelligence, thanks to the exclusive display technology from BOE Technology and the AI support from Future Intelligence."The beauty of life lies in creation. Intangible cultural heritage embodies human creative labor, representing sustainable production and ways of life. In the era of artificial intelligence, let us rediscover together the beauty of craftsmanship and the wisdom it entails," said Sun Media Group Chairperson Yang Lan in her opening speech.Yang is the co-curator of the event with Su Dan, deputy director of the China National Arts and Crafts Museum. The exhibition results from a collaboration between Sun Media Group and China National Brand Network, with support from TopBrand Union. Yang added: "With 43 elements inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list, China ranks first in the world."Wang Yin, cultural counselor of the Chinese Embassy in France, said in her speech that as one of the earliest countries to join UNESCO's Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, China places great importance on the protection and transmission of intangible cultural heritage."Artisans who have ancestral gestures that they know how to transmit, allow us to think about the future simply because ultimately these gestures become eternal. And this notion of time which means that we are in memory, in vision, allows us to create something common together; and it is because we create something common that we will have lasting relationships, with your culture, a culture over 5,000 years old, and French culture or European culture," said Anne-Marie Sargueil, president of the French Institute of Design.Wang Chenhua, vice-president of Chinese fashion giant Bosideng Group, said that culture plays a crucial role in shaping a clothing brand's identity.Wang said: "Bosideng has consistently been committed to promoting outstanding traditional Chinese culture, as well as innovative development and creative transformation in down jacket design."The unity of heaven and humanity is a Chinese philosophy. The exhibition is organized around spaces dedicated to each of the five traditional Chinese elements --- metal, wood, water, fire and earth -- showcasing their mutual generation and inhibition, as well as transformation and integration. Each element is represented through various crafts and technologies.For example, earth symbolizes balance and stability in Chinese culture. The "Earth" space highlights weaving and embroidery works, including the famous embroidered version of the Mona Lisa by Chinese arts and crafts master Yao Jianping, who uses delicate techniques and a rich color palette to bring an oriental touch to this icon of the Italian Renaissance.Fire, a symbol of warmth and passion, is beautifully represented in the ceramics space, particularly through He Qin's work. Inspired by the "Orchid Pavilion Preface" by Wang Xizhi, He skillfully combines Xuan paper, mud, and glaze, offering a new dimension to ceramic art.Other impressive works include wood crafts, ranging from delicate mortise and tenon structures to complex wood carvings; the modern replica of Emperor Wanli's crown, made of gold wire by Cheng Shumei, illustrating innovative metalworking techniques; and tea and wine culture and traditions, reflected in Fan Yi's "Orchid Pavilion Repair Map" and "Tang Dynasty Music Image".In parallel with the exhibition, various supporting activities were planned, including a Bosideng fashion show, tea tastings by Fuding White Tea, and intercultural events such as the "Chinese and French Cultural Light Dinner".When asked about the initial motivation for curating the exhibition, Yang said: "In the past, some people had biases against 'Made in China,' for example, thinking it involved cheap and inferior products or lacked originality by copying designs from others, etc. Actually, I want to say that Chinese people have always been highly creative."Cambridge Mechatronics Ltd, or CML, a British technology company based in Cambridge, is looking to further tap into the Chinese market, according to a senior executive of the company.In an exclusive interview with China Daily, Ben Brown, chief technology officer at CML, said the company sees its China business doubling in value over the next three to five years, despite facing uncertainties in the fast-changing global geopolitical landscape and business environment."China continues to be an absolute key market for us. China is almost our home territory, and this is what we are used to," he said. "We don't know where things will go in the future, so we always need to make sure whatever plans we put in place are robust to whatever may happen in the future. But on the Chinese side, one of the things we're doing is increasingly putting more of our technology into China."CML specializes in mechanical, optical, electrical, software, and controller silicon design using its patented shape memory alloy technology, or SMA, which uses special metals that can remember and return to a specific shape when heated.The technology, commonly applied in smartphone cameras, allows for autofocus and optical image stabilization by enabling precise control of the lens position. The SMA actuator, heated by electricity, can move the lens or image sensor back and forth to adjust the focus.Operating in China since 2013, CML has established partnerships with major Chinese phone brands, including Huawei, Honor, Xiaomi, and others, integrating its products into their well-known series.According to Brown, the company has launched a total of 51 products, with 46 designed specifically for Chinese customers. To date, CML has shipped over 75 million units, the vast majority of which were manufactured in China.When asked about the reasons for further investing in the Chinese market, Brown emphasized that the opportunities presented by its expansive and dynamic environment benefit CML in maintaining steady development."The Chinese companies are very happy to experiment with new technologies. It's much more likely that they will try our products like variable aperture or module tilt on their handsets. I think it is also part of the Chinese culture to push the edges of technology and see what's possible. So, from that point of view, it's really good for us," he said.BERLIN -- A team from China's Nanjing University held a memorial event by John Rabe's tombstone in Berlin on Saturday to remember the German's heroic action of protecting hundreds of thousands of Chinese in Nanjing during World War II.Christoph Reinhardt, great-grandson of Rabe, joined the event organized by the "Diaries of John Rabe and the City of Peace" scientific investigation team from Nanjing University.Reinhardt said: "To forget history is to risk its repetition while commemorating allows us to remember the past and build a peaceful future together." He stressed that the China-Japan relationship must be based on honesty, and the diary of Rabe is one of the most authentic records of the Nanjing Massacre.After the Japanese Imperial Army captured Nanjing in eastern China on Dec. 13, 1937, the Japanese invaders brutally killed approximately 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers in over six weeks. Later known as the Nanjing Massacre, this episode of history was one of the most barbaric atrocities during World War II.Rabe, then working as a representative of Siemens during the Japanese occupation of the city, set up an international safety zone with other foreigners and protected civilians from Japanese invaders. That zone saved the lives of around 250,000 Chinese people between 1937 and 1938, and Rabe was dubbed the "Oskar Schindler of China."During his time in China, Rabe recorded written entries and photographs in his diary, which has become an indispensable source of historical evidence for studying the Nanjing Massacre."By making these records public, the truth of history can be recognized by the world," Reinhardt said, adding that "Memory cannot be altered by voting; history is what truly happened, and we must face and remember it."During the event, Reinhardt and the Chinese students and teachers laid flowers at Rabe's tombstone, paying tribute to this great humanitarian.Chang Xuan, a team member and teacher at the School of Foreign Studies in Nanjing University, highlighted the significance of jointly memorizing the history with Rabe's descendants on-site."Every generation has the responsibility to pass on history and memory to prevent repeating past mistakes," Chang said, adding that "Rabe's spirit of great love and pursuit of peace is a valuable legacy for every generation to learn from.""Being able to come to Berlin today to pay respects to Rabe has fulfilled a long-held wish for me and our team. This is not only a tribute to history but also a commitment to peace," said Lei Qianhao, an undergraduate from the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing University."Rabe's story also echoes the Chinese traditional cultural spirit of mutual support and is a vivid practice of building a community with a shared future. In the face of the current complex international situation, we should revive this belief and contribute the strength of youth to peace," Lei stressed.The Diaries of John Rabe and the City of Peace scientific investigation team was established in 2021 and has been dedicated to uncovering the historical details of the Nanjing Massacre while actively promoting peace.The premiere of the documentary In the footsteps of Marco Polo was held in London on Wednesday. The documentary is a co-production between China and United Kingdom media, featuring a travel story hosted by British Stanley Johnson and his youngest son, Max Johnson.At the premiere, the Johnsons shared their joy with China Daily and thanked the Chinese Embassy in the UK for their strong support. Video: Hang JingReporter: Xing Yi10 paintings featuring the centuries-old science of Tibetan medicine were unveiled in London on Tuesday.The pieces are all in the art of thangka, which refers to Tibetan Buddhist scroll paintings on cotton or silk, created with mineral and organic pigments. This art form, dating back to the 10th century, has been designated as a national intangible cultural heritage in China.The displayed medical thangkas are part of a larger collection of 80 paintings, all created to illustrate a classic book of traditional Tibetan medicine named The Four Treatises, which was compiled between the 8th and 12th centuries, according to Tsering, director of the Xizang Medicine Hospital in the Xizang autonomous region.Thangkas are now primarily used to promote education, research, and the protection of Tibetan medicine, said Tsering. President Xi Jinping and Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev attended on Wednesday the opening ceremony for the China-Europe Trans-Caspian Express, a major international connectivity project that spans the Eurasian region.The ceremony marked the official completion of a multidimensional connectivity network integrating highways, railways, airlines and pipelines, in order to better link Asia with Europe via the Caspian Sea, which is the world's largest inland body of water.With its combined highway-sea transportation channel, the express route allows trucks carrying consignments to traverse the Eurasian region aboard cargo vessels.The opening ceremony was held via video link at the presidential palace in the Kazakh capital, Astana, where Xi and Tokayev sat next to each other watching the event unfold on a big screen.The two heads of state first watched a video about the building of the China-Europe trans-Caspian route. The project head on the Kazakh side briefed them on the preparations made, and then the project head on the Chinese side invited the leaders to declare the route open.The trans-Caspian route was formally opened to operations as Xi and Tokayev jointly gave the command, "Start the shipment!"Cargo trucks bearing China's vehicle registration plates and featuring the sign "China-Europe Trans-Caspian Express" gathered on Wednesday at the port of Kuryk in Kazakhstan, waiting to board cargo vessels.Xi and Tokayev watched in real time as the trucks boarded a ship, and consignment containers were unloaded. The ceremonial start triggered a round of warm applause at the presidential palace.The Caspian Sea is bordered in the northeast by Kazakhstan, in the southeast by Turkmenistan, in the south by Iran, in the southwest by Azerbaijan, and in the northwest by Russia. The port of Kuryk is located on the eastern coast of the sea in a natural bay, which facilitates transshipment, loading and unloading operations. This is the first time that shipment-use vehicles from China arrived at a Caspian Sea port using a highway link.Among the Chinese vehicles, there were seven from Central China's Henan province, according to the Henan Daily newspaper. They are loaded with commodities such as Chinese-made tractors, fireproof materials, and science and technology products, the newspaper said.Last month, the trucks departed from Henan and left China through the Horgos land port in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. They are scheduled to cross the Caspian Sea via Kazakhstan, and are bound for countries such as Azerbaijan and Georgia.In a signed article published in Kazakh media on Tuesday, Xi highlighted the need to deepen bilateral cooperation in traditional sectors and enhance the efficiency of customs clearance at border ports."We need to ensure the high-quality operation of the China-Europe Railway Express, advance the construction of the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, and make the network connecting our two countries more multidimensional, diverse and efficient," Xi wrote.zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com.cnDirect flights between Shanghai and Marseille of France officially launched on Tuesday (July 2) by China Eastern Air Holding Co Ltd's Shanghai Airlines, which will become the first carrier to operate regular air routes between the two cities, according to the Shanghai-based carrier."Adding the new direct flight, China Eastern will operate a total of 244 flights between China and 19 destinations in Europe every week," said Wang Zhiqing, chairman of China Eastern Air Holding Co Ltd.According to Wang, as the second largest city in France, Marseille is the largest port in southern Europe, and it is an important shipping and trade center in the Mediterranean. Shanghai and Marseille became sister cities in 1987."We believe that the new direct flight will contribute to building closer ties in tourism, economy and cultural communications between China and France," said Wang."The direct flight will end the history of no direct flights from Shanghai to South France by China Eastern," said Wang Liangyu, general manager of Shanghai Airlines' planning and development department.The Shanghai-Marseille flights will be operated every Tuesday, Friday and Sunday, and the return flights will be on the same date local time. Further adjustments may come in accordance to the market feedback on the new flight, Wang said.This year marks the 60th anniversary of China and France establishing bilateral diplomatic relations, and the two nations are celebrating the China-France Year of Culture and Tourism as well.China waived visa requirements for French visitors in May, and the visa-free policy to France will be effective until December 31, 2025, under which ordinary passport holders from the country can enjoy visa-free travel to China for up to 15 days.China Eastern also announced on Monday it is going to operate 3,213 passenger flights per day in the summer season, up 13 percent in comparison with that of 2019.Nearly 800 aircraft, including the six C919s will be put into 1,002 passenger routes during the 62-day summer season, reaching 249 destinations home and abroad.As China and Switzerland celebrate the 10th anniversary of their free trade agreement, officials from both nations lauded their economic collaboration and announced plans to begin talks on upgrading the deal to further enhance bilateral trade.Chinese Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao said that under the strategic guidance of both nations' leaders and active business participation, Sino-Swiss economic and trade cooperation has flourished, resulting in impressive growth in bilateral trade despite the global trends.According to Wang, China remains Switzerland's third-largest trading partner, while Switzerland is China's sixth-largest in Europe. Despite challenges like weak global trade growth and strained international supply chains, Sino-Swiss trade volume grew by 4.4 percent in 2023, reaching $59.5 billion—a truly encouraging figure, as he told the eighth Sino-Swiss Economic Forum in Beijing on July 1.The forum, co-hosted by the Swiss Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the embassy of Switzerland in China, offered a platform for officials and senior business representatives from China and Switzerland to discuss future cooperation.During the forum, Wang emphasized the significant potential for further economic and trade cooperation, citing the strong and complementary economic ties between China and Switzerland. "Next year marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two nations, presenting a historic opportunity to advance our bilateral economic and trade relations," he said.Wang announced on the forum that a memorandum has been signed by the two nations to launch negotiations on enhancing the free trade agreement soon.Swiss Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin, head of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research, also highlighted on the forum the ever-growing bilateral relations between China and Switzerland.He praised the increasing exchanges in education and research and underscored the strong connections between Swiss businesses and the Chinese market.Parmelin noted that the large delegation of representatives from both the Swiss business and scientific communities visiting China demonstrates the high level of interest in China. LONDON -- David Lammy, shadow foreign secretary of the UK's Labour Party, said on Monday that the United Kingdom (UK) must consistently approach and engage with a country as important as China if Labour is elected on July 4.At a briefing organized by the Foreign Press Association in London, Lammy told Xinhua reporter that Labour outlined "three Cs (Cooperate, Compete, and Challenge)" in its manifesto published last month."What sets Labour apart from the current government's policy towards China is its commitment to a consistent approach, despite areas where the UK must compete and face challenges, particularly related to national security," said Lammy.Lammy also said that Labour would begin an audit of UK-China relations and seek more engagement with China at all levels of government, given the current government's lack of engagement with Chinese officials.A London audience enjoyed a night of Chinese and Western music in the United Kingdom capital's Duke's Hall on June 30.The concert started with the violin solo Laughing in Vernal Breeze, which was followed by Amanisa, a symphonic poem performed on the erhu, a two-string Chinese instrument.Nine Horses, a work by the prominent Chinese composer Ye Xiaogang, was next, inspired by Peking Opera and the folk music of Vietnam and Indonesia and offering a fusion of Eastern lyricism and Western modernism.The post-intermission portion of the concert was dedicated to a chamber music version of Austro-Bohemian romantic composer Gustav Mahler's Symphony No 4, as rearranged by Austrian musician Erwin Stein in 1921.As the night, presented by the Wuxi Symphony Orchestra from East China's Jiangsu province, came to an end, the audience rewarded performers with rapturous applause.Mick Davies, president of the Royal Society of British Artists, described the performances as "absolutely fantastic"."It's incredible. It's worth skipping the football match," he said after the concert, which happened on the same night as an important soccer game between England and Slovakia.The event was part of the China-UK Cultural Exchange Concert, which was organized by the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and China Musicians Association, with support from China's Embassy in the UK. The June 30 concert was co-organized by the UK branch of the European Times. The Chinese musicians' visit was aimed at fostering mutual learning between China and UK.Ye, the composer who is also chairman of the China Musicians Association, said the association was very pleased to have been able to take musical troupes from different Chinese provinces and cities on overseas visits to promote Chinese culture.The association has been dedicated to enhancing global cultural exchange through music and promoting China's musical heritage since its establishment, Ye said."I hope we can better promote China's contemporary music to the world," Ye added.He explained that, at the June 30 concert, Chinese performances represent music from different regions and works by artists of different ages, expressing various aspects of China.Ye described the presentation of Mahler's Symphony No 4 as "very emotional" and said the audience was clearly "touched"."They are all well-chosen and well-performed," Ye said of the works presented. "It's important to tell China's story in ways that are familiar with Western audiences in cultural exchanges."With regards to interpretations of Western classic music, we need to put Chinese understanding in it. When we present Chinese music to foreign audiences, we don't imitate the Western way, but we need to have some Western techniques in presenting it."We employ Chinese music to express the common vision of humankind, which would be understood and touch the heart of a global audience." Changning district, which hosts a third of Shanghai's foreign consulates and almost 6,500 foreign enterprises, including Unilever and Bosch, is inviting more businesses from the United Kingdom to invest in it, its officials told an audience in London.Wang Youxiao, deputy head of the organization department of the Changning district committee, said: "Changning has been a pioneer in Shanghai's reform and opening-up. In 1986, the Shanghai Hongqiao Economic and Technological Development Zone established in Changning was the first national-level development zone focused on the service sector and hosting foreign consulates."We are also cultivating new industries, such as artificial intelligence, low-carbon industry, and digital trade."Wang highlighted prominent internet companies such as e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, online travel service provider Trip.com, and entertainment service iQIYI as examples of enterprises located there.Luo Le, director of the Changning District Commission of Commerce, said the district has initiated a series of innovative policies that include a dedicated international internet data channel and free trade accounts, to elevate the business environment.Wang and other officials, business people spoke at a promotional conference last week that was part of the "Invest in Shanghai" series events.Located in the western part of Shanghai, Changning is close to the Hongqiao Comprehensive Transport Hub, which includes a major international airport and a high-speed railway station with frequent services to cities in the Yangtze River Delta.In 2023, Changning's local GDP broke a record 200 billion yuan ($27.56 billion), which was up 13 percent year-on-year.Informa, an FTSE 100 company in the UK that specializes in events and exhibitions, was among those that opened offices in Shanghai in the early 2000s.Andrew Galloway, a regional director of Informa Markets, said Shanghai has become their fastest-growing segment in the past 20 years."We've had an opportunity to bring lots of events and suppliers to Shanghai, and we've also created a platform for domestic clients within China to do business together and ... to take business elsewhere around the world," he said. "We look forward to exploring ways to expand our presence and anticipate a bright future."Wu Lin, secretary-general of the China Chamber of Commerce in the UK, reviewed previous cooperation between Changning and the UK during the conference, saying: "I am pleased to see the in-depth cooperation with UK enterprises that has already been established. I firmly believe there is great potential for collaboration in many more sectors in the future, such as IT services, the industrial internet, and digital medical services." Jiang Duo contributed to the story.For Alessandra Lavagnino, director of the Confucius Institute at the University of Milan, those years in Shanghai during the 1970s shaped her career of devotion to China studies.She first arrived in China in 1974, when she was selected as an exchange teacher to teach Italian at the Shanghai Foreign Language Institute, later renamed Shanghai International Studies University. She was also the first Italian foreign teacher the institute had ever received.Her love affair with China was influenced by her father who visited the country in 1957 to film a documentary. At the age of 8, her curiosity and imagination were sparked, resulting in what she described as a "dream come true" moment.Her father's fascination with China's architecture, art, sounds and people appealed to the entire family. "So, it was quite natural for me to choose to study Chinese when I went to the university in Italy because I had so many insights to discover," she said.From February 1974 until the end of 1975, the Italian in her mid-20s taught her first group of 18 students, who were roughly the same age as her, and sharing countless sweet, sour and bitter experiences of youth drew them closer and closer."I remembered living with four girls in a peasant's home for one month, where we shared simple and strict daily routines in the countryside. We did farm work every day, and we had Italian classes in the afternoon. I told them about Italy, its beauty, my family's stories, and my learning experiences. They shared with me their family stories, their dreams, and their past," she recalled."We still message each other almost every day. They ask me about the situation in Italy, and I send them my articles about China. We share both friendship and academic exchanges," she said."Saying that we are friends is not enough. We are family."The first term of office provided Lavagnino with valuable friendships, while the second term, in the same position at the same institute from 1977 to 1979, enhanced her academic life by allowing her to focus more on research in classical Chinese texts.It was during that period that she began studying and translating Wenxin Diaolong, or The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons, a book on Chinese literary aesthetics by Liu Xie, a literary critic who lived during the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-581).Scholarly careerWenxin Diaolong was a constant presence in Lavagnino's scholarly career, and it took her 16 years to translate this classical Chinese work — which she considered similar to Aristotle's Poetics — into Italian."My years in Shanghai contributed very much to my life, my understanding of China, and my belief in the importance of understanding other cultures and recognizing that my civilization is not the only right one in the world," Lavagnino said.China's global influence continued to grow following the reform and opening-up, and in this context, the vibrancy and openness of Milan were notably apparent, Lavagnino said.In 1979, Milan and Shanghai established a sister-city friendship. In 1985, Milan opened the first Chinese consulate in Italy. During the 1980s, the University of Milan introduced Chinese language courses, pioneering the initiative in the Lombardy region.The Confucius Institute at the University of Milan also continues to play a pivotal role in facilitating exchanges between Shanghai and Milan, as well as between China and Italy.Milan, one of the most developed and lively cities in Italy, needs to have a Confucius Institute, she said."In this complex period, we must manage to keep all possible channels open to build a concrete intercultural dialogue. We must learn to know each other, without prejudice or preconceptions, and this means accepting differences, recognizing different roots, and realizing that there may be another way of doing things," she said."My experiences enable me to build a bridge, and this bridge must be built. Otherwise, we will have no future. We have to find a common path forward."Italian businesses have been keen to seek entry to and expand in the Chinese market through the China International Import Expo, which takes place in November every year in Shanghai since 2018.Raffaele Cattaneo, undersecretary with responsibility for international and European relations in Italy's Lombardy region, where Milan is located, emphasized the mutual benefits of the import expo. He noted that China has increasingly grown into an important destination market for Italian exports.The presence of a growing middle-income group in China "desires quality products and designs that embody a sense of style and beauty, which is influencing tastes in Italy as well. This is something that we Italians don't often talk about", he said. "We are interested in, and we rely on initiatives like the CIIE."Cattaneo also mentioned the sister-city relationship between Shanghai and Milan and described the partnership as "important and strategic". The two cities joined hands in 1979 to become sister cities. Later, Shanghai also established friendly exchanges with Lombardy.Based on many similarities in the economic needs of both sides, cooperation can be strengthened in the areas of fashion, food, furniture, technology and more, he said.Guido D'Amico, president of the Confimprese Italia federation representing Italian micro, small and medium-sized businesses, said the expo can provide "revolutionary" opportunities, given the scale of the expo and the size of the Chinese market.The federation and two Italian firms signed contracts or memorandums of cooperation with the CIIE Bureau, the expo's organizer, confirming their participation in this year's seventh CIIE at a promotional conference, which was held in Milan on April 19 and attracted representatives from nearly 150 Italian businesses and institutions.At the event, Sun Chenghai, deputy director-general of the CIIE Bureau, said Italy, as a longtime friend of the CIIE, has participated for six consecutive years.Noting that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Italy, Sun expressed hope that the CIIE could contribute to consolidating and promoting Sino-Italian economic and trade relations.Gong Lifeng, co-founder of Vetiver, is a Shanghainese dedicated to bringing in Italian jewelry to the Chinese market.Back in 2018, Gong had the opportunity to attend the expo and made an attempt to sell some German and Italian products, most of which were quickly sold out.This initial success gave Gong lots of confidence.In the hope of organizing more Italian exhibitors to attend the second CIIE in 2019, Gong flew to Milan and collaborated with Confindustria Federorafi, Italy's national federation of goldsmiths, silversmiths and jewelry manufacturers.Eyeing opportunitiesEyeing huge opportunities in the Chinese market, the federation also helped Gong obtain The Extraordinary Italian Jewelry authorization, a tribute to the excellence of Italian craftsmanship.Gong, together with the Italian jewelry exhibitors, made a huge success at the second CIIE. Again, almost all of their products were sold out during the six-day expo."We were all so excited, as we have been billing (at the second CIIE) — almost nonstop … We ranked first and were the most popular exhibitors in the jewelry sector that year," Gong recalled."The CIIE provides a premier platform to test out Chinese consumers' tastes and demands …Luckily, we have seized the national level opportunity."With remarkable outcomes on both sides, Gong's partnership with Italian jewelry businesses has even expanded. Gong has accumulated a customer base of over 40,000 and saw the import value of Italian jewelry exceed 1 million euros ($1.08 million) per year.Bearing fruitful results from six editions of the CIIE and steady partnerships with Italian businesses, Gong is eyeing bolder goals."We have signed up for this year's CIIE, and will double our booth size compared with last year," he said. "In addition to bringing in more new brands and products to the expo, we are also preparing for the opening of our new store at The Bund in September, to introduce more Italian products, craftsmanship and businesses to customers."Editor's note: Amity between the people holds the key to sound state-to-state relations. China Daily will come out with a series of stories highlighting Chinese cities' special connections with sister cities, mutual understanding, trust and friendship between peoples of different countries and cultural backgrounds, and shining light on "city diplomacy".Shanghai native Shi Yue, a junior art director at McCann Worldgroup Italy who has been living in Milan for 10 years, is always amazed by the similarities shared between her hometown and the Italian city.Open, inclusive, developed, international, and trendy are the words she used to describe the two cities, both serving as global hubs for many industries, in particular, fashion and design."The two cities are alike," Shi exclaimed.BEIJING -- Chinese President Xi Jinping announced here on Monday that China has decided to implement a 15-day unilateral visa-free policy for Polish citizens.Xi made the announcement while holding talks with Polish President Andrzej Duda, who is on a state visit to China, at the Great Hall of the People.The China-France Economic and Trade Cooperation Forum and the Promotion Conference of the 2nd Edition of the China International Supply Chain Expo, or CISCE, convened at the Maison de la Mutualite in Paris on June 21.The forum served as a precursor to the upcoming CISCE in Beijing, and French companies are welcomed to take part in that gathering.The event was attended by 100 representatives from French institutions and companies, a 70-member delegation from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, or CCPIT, and 30 representatives from Chinese firms across France and Europe.In his opening speech, CCPIT Chairman Ren Hongbin emphasized: "This event enriches bilateral cooperation between our nations. On behalf of CCPIT, I stress that China and France are genuine friends and mutually beneficial partners."He went on to propose three key areas to enhance Sino-French relations."We should expand trade cooperation, increase investment collaboration, and advance cooperation in supply chains, fostering mutual benefits," he said."China contributes 30 percent to global economic growth, " he continued."We are committed to providing more opportunities for international businesses, including those from France."CISCE President Lin Shunjie highlighted the significance of the upcoming second edition of the expo, stating, "We are currently experiencing a period of global advancements in new technologies. The participation of Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the next edition further underscores its importance."He also noted : "Last year, 515 companies attended the first CISCE expo. For the second edition, we have already confirmed the participation of over 400 companies."Former prime minister of France and president of the Prospective Innovation Foundation Jean Pierre Raffarin remarked : "We are delighted to have you here in France, bringing extensive expertise on various issues. In today's increasingly perilous world, tensions are evident. Despite this, France and China are advocating for peace, bolstered by strong economic, social and cultural ties that promote cooperation and future prospects.""Our strategy prioritises peace. While agreements and competition are natural, our focus remains on cooperation rather than rivalry," he said.At the forum, representatives from companies, including Andreas Wlasak from Forvia Design Group, Frederic Lajoux from electricity utility Enedis Group, and Norbert Ducrot, founder and president of Middl.AI, shared their insights.Caroline Penard, director of the France-China International Chamber of Commerce, noted : "We mark the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and France. The CISCE forum serves as a crucial opportunity to uphold global supply chains."She added : "The international exhibition in Beijing is essential for shaping our future, focusing on cooperation and innovation."Xiao Liang, head of the Bank of China Paris branch and chairman of the China Chamber of International Commerce in France, or CCICF, highlighted the milestone in Sino-French relations, noting France's position as China's third-largest trading partner within the European Union, and China is France’s leading partner in Asia.She emphasised their successful collaboration, which has bolstered trust and fostered growth in Sino-French trade.Yan Yun, director-general of the CCPIT Trade Promotion and Exchange Center, highlighted the ongoing expansion and strengthening of cooperation between China and France. In this new context, there is a clear emphasis on industrial investment as a global priority, with the CCPIT playing a crucial role in advancing global economic governance, Yan said.During the forum, a signing ceremony took place where the International Chamber of Commerce for the Silk Road, or ICCS, and the French-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, or CCIFC, signed a letter of intent to participate in the second edition of CISCE.Additionally, the China International Exhibition Center Group Corporation and French company Cenponts also signed a letter of intent to participate, and CCPIT entered into a cooperation agreement with the CMS law firm.PARIS -- China's launch of the Space-based Multi-band Variable Object Monitor (SVOM) developed in cooperation with France has garnered widespread attention from local media which hail Sino-French space cooperation.The launch on Saturday of the astronomical satellite, the result of nearly 20 years of hard work between Chinese and French scientists, aims to capture gamma-ray bursts which flicker like fireworks in the farthest reaches of the universe.The regional daily Sud Ouest said on Saturday that, developed by engineers from the two countries, the SVOM mission is a "symbol" of France-China space cooperation.It also recalled that in 2018 China launched the China-France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSat), an ocean-observing satellite, noting that European countries are now also participating in China's Chang'e lunar exploration program.Quoted Saturday by Le Monde, Francois Gonzalez, a project manager at the National Centre for Space Studies of France, described SVOM as "a lookout waiting for a random phenomenon that we know neither where nor when it will occur."On average, SVOM should detect around 100 bursts per year. To fulfill its mission, the satellite is equipped with a quartet of instruments, two French and two Chinese, according to the same media report."A new chapter in France-China space cooperation. The Asian giant launched on Saturday June 22 a satellite tasked with tracking 'gamma-ray bursts', veritable luminous fossils that should provide further information on the history of the Universe," local channel France 24 reported.PARIS -- Some 300 representatives of French and Chinese companies on Friday attended a roadshow of the upcoming China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) in Paris.Many French entrepreneurs at the roadshow said they expect to deepen cooperation with their Chinese partners, particularly in emerging technologies.Caroline Penard, director of the France-China International Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than 2,100 French companies implanted in China, invited her compatriots to take full advantage of the expo to expand cooperation, particularly in innovative technologies, in China."More than ever, it is crucial to promote economic and commercial exchanges based on mutual trust and innovation. The supply chain exhibition is a key step in this direction," she said.Citing surveys carried out by her organization, Penard noted that 60 percent of French companies were confident that their respective sectors would grow in China over the next three years while 62 percent expected their profits to increase in 2024, compared to the year prior.Addressing the roadshow, former French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin noted that France and China have had close exchanges and cooperation since the establishment of diplomatic relations 60 years ago. There are many French companies in China, setting numerous examples of bilateral economic and commercial cooperation.Though there are differences between French and Chinese cultures, the two countries still can greatly contribute to the development of the global economy by constantly improving mutual understanding and trust, he stressed."The interests of China and France are closely linked and their benefits complement each other. The successes of supply chain partnerships, such as the joint operation of the Kribi deepwater port in Cameroon by Chinese and French companies, or the jointly developed electric vehicle and electric battery products that have conquered global markets, are shining examples," said Ren Hongbin, chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), which is the organizer of the annual supply chain gala.The CISCE is the world's first national-scale exhibition dedicated to supply chains. The second edition scheduled on Nov. 26-30 in Beijing will focus on advanced manufacturing, clean energy, smart vehicles, digital technology, the health industry and green agriculture. BRUSSELS -- Leading Chinese car maker SAIC Motor Europe will honor its commitment to European consumers despite the European Union's (EU) recent decision to raise temporary tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), the company's vice president Yuan Yingchen told Xinhua.The European Commission on June 12 unveiled provisional tariffs ranging from 17.4 percent to 38.1 percent for Chinese EV makers despite widespread market concerns and China's objections. It accused China of "unfair subsidization" in its EV value chain, but did not provide further information to explain the factual or legal bases for its tariff plan."It is unfair to Chinese car manufacturers, to the EU's principles of free trade, and to European consumers," Yuan told Xinhua in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the Europe-China CEO Roundtable Panel held Wednesday in Brussels.A report titled "Greening Europe -- Report on the Development of Chinese NEV Manufacturers in Europe" was launched on the same day.Yuan voiced his confidence in SAIC's robust technology and high-quality products. Although the EU tariff plan presents a temporary challenge, SAIC is committed to overcoming these difficulties, he said."For us, who adhere to the long-term approach, these are just small hurdles, small ripples in the course of long-term development," Yuan said.SAIC is determined to defend its legitimate rights through all necessary legal and commercial means while continuing to strengthen its presence on the European market, he said.According to Yuan, the company is working on establishing an engineering research and development center in Frankfurt to promote adaptive customization, and on the plan to build a factory in Europe.Site selection for the new factory has been progressing rapidly, and establishing a factory in Europe will bring a highly competitive supply chain to the region, said Yuan, who has visited several countries to communicate with local authorities for this purpose.This year marks the 100th anniversary of the MG brand, currently owned by SAIC. Marc Hecht, public relations director of SAIC Motor Germany, told Xinhua that the company plans to open more stores in Europe."Unlike Chinese consumers who prioritize software, connectivity, and comfort, European consumers focus more on driving performance," Hecht said, noting that SAIC has adjusted its designs to meet European consumers' preferences. LUXEMBOURG -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang and Luxembourg's Deputy Prime Minister Xavier Bettel have agreed that their two countries should work together to enhance cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).The two leaders made the remarks when attending the second Zhengzhou-Luxembourg "Air Silk Road" Forum for International Cooperation on Thursday.Ding, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, recalled that in June 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed supporting the construction of the "Air Silk Road" between the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou and Luxembourg. The chair's statement of the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in October 2023 announced that the second Zhengzhou-Luxembourg "Air Silk Road" International Cooperation Forum would be held.The forum here is a practical action to implement the consensus reached by leaders of the two countries to deepen the Belt and Road cooperation, holding significant importance, Ding noted.Ding also said that over the years, both countries have upheld the Silk Road spirit and achieved remarkable results in the construction of the "Air Silk Road," establishing an aerial bridge of connectivity and making it a landmark project of the Belt and Road cooperation.Looking to the future, China stands ready to work with Luxembourg to build a more efficient aviation transportation system, forge closer economic and trade cooperation, and develop diverse and interactive cultural exchanges to boost the high-quality development of the "Air Silk Road," Ding added.Noting that China is further deepening reform comprehensively and promoting high-quality development through high-level opening-up, Ding stressed that China's door to the world will only open wider, offering broader market opportunities for all countries and bringing more chances for win-win cooperation."We welcome the active participation of all countries, including Luxembourg, in the Chinese modernization process, sharing the fruits of China's reform and development to achieve common development and prosperity," he said.For his part, Bettel said that the "Air Silk Road" between Luxembourg and Zhengzhou has become an important link in strengthening bilateral relations.Highlighting that during the COVID-19 pandemic, this route transported a large amount of Chinese medical supplies, strongly supporting Luxembourg and other European countries in overcoming the pandemic, Bettel said Luxembourg is ready to take this forum as an opportunity to closely cooperate with China in various fields under the BRI framework.After the forum, Ding and Bettel jointly visited the achievements exhibition of the "Air Silk Road."Boasting the home of leading unicorns in the fast-growing digital industry, such as Xiaohongshu and Bilibili, Shanghai's Yangpu district is hoping to attract innovative companies from the United Kingdom, the mayor of the district told an audience in London on Tuesday.Speaking at a promotional conference held at China Exchange, Zhou Haiying, mayor of Yangpu district, said: "Yangpu had a long history of business cooperation with British companies back in the 19th century and later became the cradle of New China's domestic industry, and now we come abroad to showcase our transformation and invite British companies to come to develop in Yangpu."Located in the northeastern part of Shanghai, Yangpu has a rich industrial heritage, such as old factories and warehouses on the 15.5-kilometer riverfront along the city's Huangpu River.In 1883, a British company opened Yangshupu Waterworks on the riverfront, which became the first water supply plant in China and was, at the time, the largest of its kind in East Asia. Later, various factories were built in the area.Though the water plant is still in use after several rounds of upgrades, many of the factories have been deserted, and in recent years the district has tried to transform its industrial legacy into workplaces and parks.The urban renovation included three of China's major unicorn companies building their headquarters in the riverside area.The office buildings for Douyin, a short video platform with more than 600 million daily active users, Meituan, the country's largest provider of on-demand food and retail delivery service, and Bilibili, China's equivalent of YouTube, are expected to be completed by 2026.In addition, some 7,000 companies in the digital economy sector and more than 3,600 companies in the creative and design industry have already set foot in Yangpu, according to Zhou.One of the reasons for companies choosing Yangpu is the district's high-caliber human resources – it is home to 10 universities where 180,000 college students graduate every year."The fresh graduates have injected vitality and dynamics in the district and provide companies with continuous momentum of development," said Zhou, adding that those higher education institutes provide cutting-edge research for local companies in areas such as artificial intelligence, green technologies, and biopharma.Bao Ling, minister of China's embassy in the UK, and Daniel Brennan, a member of the House of Lords legislative chamber, attended the event along with dozens of business representatives from both China and the UK.China will take all necessary measures to firmly defend the legitimate rights of its companies, said the Ministry of Commerce on Thursday, in the wake of the European Union's unfounded actions to slap hefty tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars.Brussels' protectionist actions are in utter disregard for the cooperation of Chinese firms extended during the probe, and discourage governments and industries of EU member states, besides straining ties between the bloc and the world's second-largest economy, officials and executives said.The European Commission has demanded a substantial amount of information regarding development plans, technological processes and product formulations of Chinese EV and battery companies, said He Yadong, a spokesman for the ministry, at a news conference.The scope, scale and quantity of information requested by the EC are unprecedented and far exceed the requirements of an antisubsidy investigation, He said.Despite that, consequent to Brussels' decision to launch the probe, the Chinese government has engaged in extensive communications with the EU and its member states, including Germany and France, in multiple forms, like face-to-face meetings, official talks and written correspondences over 80 times, the ministry said.Beijing has actively sought avenues for open communication and constructive engagement with Brussels, fully demonstrating its sincerity and willingness to seek win-win solutions, said Xu Hongcai, deputy director of the China Association of Policy Science's Economic Policy Committee.Though Chinese enterprises cooperated with the EU's probe to the extent possible and provided information as required, Brussels still decided to impose punitive tariffs, He said.From next month, the EU will impose additional tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, ranging from 17.4 percent for BYD to 38.1 percent for SAIC, on top of the standard 10 percent car duty, unless Beijing agrees to an effective solution to so-called subsidies that the EU claims are distorting its markets.The EU's move to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese EVs is a blatant protectionist measure and a politically motivated decision, said Jian Junbo, deputy director of the Center for China-Europe Relations at Fudan University's Institute of International Studies.The basis and procedures for this decision do not align with the World Trade Organization's rules, and its consequences could prove detrimental to the stable and healthy development of China-EU relations, Jian said, adding that the EU's protectionist measures run counter to the global trend of globalization and ultimately hinder the innovation and global competitiveness of European EV manufacturers.The European automobile industry, however, has not submitted any applications to the European Commission requesting the investigations. On the contrary, European car manufacturers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen have expressed their opposition to Brussels' actions.Oliver Zipse, CEO of BMW, said in a statement that the adoption of protectionist measures like tariffs could trigger a cycle of retaliation, leading to a breakdown of cooperative trade relations.On Monday, Beijing opened an antidumping investigation into pork imports from the EU and is also reviewing applications seeking an antisubsidy probe into the bloc's dairy products.In addition, an antidumping investigation launched in January into brandy imported from the EU is moving forward.Governments of various EU member states also voiced their concerns that protectionist moves of the EC may cripple fair global competition."The European Commission's punitive tariffs hit German companies and their top products," German Transport Minister Volker Wissing said on the social media platform X. "Cars must become cheaper through more competition, open markets and significantly better business conditions in the EU, not through trade war and market isolation."Hungarian Minister for National Economy Marton Nagy condemned the move as overly protectionist in a statement. "We do not agree with the brutal European punitive tariffs on Chinese electric car manufacturers; excessive protectionism is not the solution."The commission's decision would unfairly discriminate against Chinese manufacturers and disrupt market competition, which had been vital for the European Union, Nagy said.In addition to the probe into Chinese electric cars, Brussels has resorted to a series of trade and investment restrictions on China since October last year. In all, 41 measures have been taken, with an estimated combined value of $28.4 billion, according to China's Commerce Ministry.These measures have been accompanied by intense investigations under the pretext of the Foreign Subsidy Regulation and International Procurement Instrument, severely affecting Chinese companies' economic activities in Europe and undermining China-EU economic cooperation.Contact the writers at wangkeju@chinadaily.com.cnLONDON -- A roadshow for the 7th China International Import Expo (CIIE) was held here on Thursday, attended by over 100 representatives from British and Chinese business associations, enterprises and media organizations.The CIIE is a major event organized by China to support trade liberalization and economic globalization, showing China's commitment to opening its market to the world, said Bao Ling, minister for economic and commercial Affairs at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom (UK), during the event.The economies of China and the UK are highly complementary and there is a huge potential for closer cooperation, said Bao, calling on UK businesses to seize the opportunities at the 7th CIIE to sell to China.Aiming to transform China's vast market into global development opportunities, the previous six CIIEs have attracted participants from more than 180 countries, regions, and international organizations, said Ning Feng, president of the National Exhibition and Convention Center (Shanghai).British enterprises have always been keen participants in the CIIE. Nearly 50 UK companies, including HSBC, Burberry, Rio Tinto and Jaguar Land Rover join the expo each year, according to Ning.On the sidelines of the promotion event, Lise Bertelsen, executive director of the China-Britain Business Council, said that boosting economic development is at the top of the agenda for both Britain and China, and it is imperative that the world's second and sixth largest economies continue to work together."Activities such as the CIIE are an excellent opportunity for UK businesses - both those already active in China- as well as those who are new to the market," said Bertelsen.The 7th CIIE is scheduled to be held in Shanghai, China, between Nov 5 and Nov. 10 this year.Direct flights between eastern China's Shanghai and Brussels, Belgium was resumed by Hainan Airlines starting Tuesday, becoming the first direct flight between the two countries after China waived visa requirements for Belgian visitors, CCTV reported.The Shanghai-Brussels flight will be conducted four times every week. Including the new direct flight, a total of three direct flights are now operated between Brussels and the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in Guangdong province.China granted a visa-free policy to Belgium, effective from March 14, 2024 to December 31, 2025, according to which, ordinary passport holders from the country can enjoy visa-free travel to China for up to 15 days.The visa-free policy has greatly simplified the travel process for tourists to visit China. The proportion of foreign passengers in flights from Belgium is approaching 60 percent currently, up from about 20 percent a year ago, according to industry insiders.wang_ying@chinadaily.com.cnA promotional event introducing investment opportunities and benefits in Xianyang, in Northwest China's Shaanxi province, was held in London on Monday.The gathering, which was hosted by the Xianyang committee of the Communist Party of China and the Xianyang Municipal People's Government and organized by the investment promotion bureau of Xianyang, attracted nearly 70 attendees from various sectors of the Chinese and United Kingdom business communities.Two memoranda of cooperation were signed at the event. One was between the investment promotion bureau of Xianyang and the China Chamber of Commerce in the UK. The other was between Wugong county in Xianyang and the European Ecentime Group, a shopping advisory platform headquartered in Paris and London.Addressing attendees, Xia Xiaozhong, secretary of the CPC Xianyang committee, outlined the investment environment and development priorities of the city.Xia said Xianyang enjoys a superior geographical location, being at the geometric center of China's territory and serving as a pivot of connectivity in Northwest China.Notably, Xianyang is home to the Xi'an Xianyang International Airport, the largest airport in Northwest China, which offers 228 domestic and international destinations with 383 routes, Xia said.Once the capital of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC), China's first empire, Xia highlighted the fact that Xianyang had evolved from an ancient city into a modern, vibrant place, with new electronic displays, high-end equipment manufacturing, biopharmaceuticals, and synthetic materials as its key development sectors."In recent years, Xianyang has adhered to high-level opening-up, to shape new momentum for high-quality development," Xia said. "In 2023, we discussed foreign investment projects worth 907 million yuan ($125 million), and the total value of foreign trade imports and exports reached 13.5 billion yuan."With a long history of educational exchanges between China and France, cooperation in the education sector is expected to play an increasing role in promoting the development of Sino-French relations, an official with the Ministry of Education stated.Yang Dan, director of the Ministry's Department of International Cooperation and Exchanges, recently mentioned that China will continue to support Sino-French educational and cultural collaborations and will take steps to encourage, particularly by creating a better environment for more French students and scholars to come to China.France was one of the first Western countries to engage in educational exchanges with China. In 1877, the Foochow Shipbuilding Institution in Fujian province sent the first batch of government-sponsored students to European countries, including France, to study advanced technology and enhance their skills in shipbuilding and navigation.During the early exchanges between China and France, French missionaries translated and introduced Chinese books, as well as established French language schools to bridge the cultural gap through language learning.France was the first European country to establish a chair for Chinese language studies and later included Sinology as a university discipline.From March 1919 to the end of 1920, nearly 1,800 young students went to France in 20 batches, working while studying to seek ways of transforming China. Among them were Chinese revolutionary pioneers including Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yi.Currently, over 46,000 Chinese students are pursuing studies in France, while more than 1,500 French students are enrolled in Chinese institutions, according to China's Ministry of Education.In 2018, the ministry officially included French as a subject in high school education and as an optional subject for the college entrance exams, or gaokao.Chinese universities have established 148 undergraduate, 34 master's degree and 10 doctoral teaching sites for French language and literature, while 18 Confucius Institutes and a Confucius Classroom have been set up in France.Meanwhile, the Alliance Française has established French language training centers in 14 cities across China, the ministry said.In 1921, China established the Lyon Sino-French Institute, initiating a chapter of the Sino-French cooperative education programs.Currently, there are 69 collaborative academic initiatives among higher education institutes of the two countries, involving 54 Chinese and 67 French universities.For instance, the Sino-French Engineer School of Beihang University and ParisTech Elite Institute of Technology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have joint programs that emphasize the cultivation of talent with both general and specialized knowledge.Today, Chinese courses are offered from primary school to university-level higher education in France. Meanwhile, French language learning is taught at different educational levels in China and covers various educational stages, although the number of students learning French at primary schools is relatively low, according to the ministry.The latest move to further promote educational collaboration between the two nations is the Sino-French Education Development Forum, which begins on Friday, in Paris.At the event, top education officials and higher education representatives from both countries will discuss topics such as the two-way flow of students and sign new cooperative agreements among universities on both sides. BEIJING -- At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Polish President Andrzej Duda will pay a state visit to China from June 22 to 26, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Thursday.During the visit, President Xi will hold talks with President Duda to map out the future development of China-Poland relations, have an in-depth exchange of views on issues of common concern and jointly attend the signing ceremony of cooperation documents, Lin Jian, another foreign ministry spokesperson told a regular press briefing.Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Zhao Leji, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, will meet with Duda respectively, Lin added.Poland is among the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Poland, and bilateral relations have developed smoothly with fruitful practical cooperation in recent years, Lin noted.China is ready to work with Poland to take this visit as an opportunity to deepen political mutual trust, expand exchanges and cooperation in various fields, jointly lead high-quality cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative and China's cooperation with Central and Eastern European countries, and continuously enrich the connotation of China-Poland comprehensive strategic partnership, Lin said.Dance lovers in the United Kingdom will have the chance to see an imaginative take on a familiar favorite later this month when the 100-strong cast of the Xi'an Acrobatic Troupe brings its production of The Acrobatic Swan Lake to the Sadler's Wells dance theater in London.The production, which first visited the country in 2008, has previously been played at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, central London, and the London Coliseum — the largest venue in the capital's West End.It blends the beloved classical ballet with the spectacular skills of Chinese acrobatics and has already been enjoyed by millions of spectators all over the world, most recently at the Esplanade art center in Singapore and the Royal Opera House in Muscat, Oman.Now it is London's turn again, with a 13-performance run, from June 21 to 29 at Sadler's Wells, directed by Yan Hongxia and choreographed by Zhang Yuan and Liu Xin.Show producer Zhang Quan said it was a great honor to make Chinese acrobatics appear in the world's capital of performing arts once again and to help promote China's excellent traditional culture overseas."Acrobatics going overseas has always been the most important part of our cultural exchanges," he said. "So, every time the team walks out of the country, with professionals around the world and face-to-face communication with the audience, (it) is a kind of learning and inspiration."For some ballet purists, the mixture of dance and acrobatics, particularly such routines as the lead ballerina standing on her partner's shoulders, might seem strange, but Zhang Quan said the combination worked well to produce something distinctive and exciting to watch."There are many art forms today that use fusion and innovation," he explained."Acrobatics and dance are both technical skills that can be choreographed according to the requirements of the story, but also can be used to tell the story and express emotions. The development of modern 'new circus' techniques, such as the ballet on the shoulders, is a good example of this."This fusion requires constant exploration and practice to create a unique artistic effect, and only by skillfully combining the essence of the two art forms can we create works of real artistic value and appreciation."The dancers trusted with performing this perilous set-piece routine are male lead Zhou Jie and ballerina Sun Yina, who joined the Liaoning Ballet Theater at the age of 11 and three years later began training with the Guangdong Acrobatic Troupe before making her stage debut aged 17."I think of myself as an acrobatic ballet performer," Sun said. "Acrobatics is an excellent traditional Chinese culture and one of the oldest performing arts in the world, while acrobatic ballet is an art form formed by Chinese acrobatic artists who try to combine the romance of Western ballet with the thrill of Oriental acrobatics."I am privileged to be able to carry this artistic inheritance and help develop the art form on stage."In their own right, ballet and acrobatics are both extremely demanding, so blending the two requires a special type of physical and mental strength."The combination has higher physical requirements from performers," Sun said. "And switching smoothly between the two disciplines during the performance also requires more energy and attention."She said acrobatic ballet takes a lot of ballet movements on the ground onto the very small space of the male dancer's shoulders to make them into acrobatic movements, so there is greater risk for injury.But once audiences adapt to the combined art forms, people from South America to southern Australia have been enthusiastic and appreciative."Acrobatic ballet shows artistic charm crosses national boundaries," Sun added. "Audiences from all kinds of different cultural backgrounds all over the world have really enjoyed the performances."Reaching global audienceOverseeing the production's third London visit in its 20-year history, Jurek Zhang, chairman of Beijing Joyway Culture Media, said he has taken many popular Western shows, including Riverdance, to audiences in China, but is now genuinely excited to be taking one of China's showcase pieces to a global audience."China has been facing the world with an open mind to learn, so there's been a lot of interest in all kinds of Western cultures, and that's kind of the basis of the business," he explained."It's like cinema. In the beginning, foreign blockbusters basically ruled the box office, but as China develops and we become familiar with the way this business works, we can also create very international marketable productions, like The Acrobatic Swan Lake. So I'm very happy to make it my first production in London."Changes within the company personnel mean that the production has been out of the global spotlight for some time, but Jurek Zhang said he hopes such a high-profile run as the one in London will "reopen the space for this work in the world performance market", and might even open a door for other Chinese performance companies to take their shows to a wider audience."In recent years, many excellent theater pieces have emerged in China, including The Journey of a Legendary Landscape Painting, Wing Chun (which is also on at Sadler's Wells at the end of August), Dream of the Red Chamber and so on, which are in our operation plan," he said."We should participate in world cultural exchanges with our best artworks."Last year, extensive regions of southern Europe endured prolonged periods of extreme heat, with temperatures soaring to 48 C. In China, a relentless heat wave persisted for 22 days, sweeping across vast swaths of northern China and the Yellow River-Huaihe River area, and setting regional records for the longest hot spell since 1961.This year, an extraordinary flood besieged the Beijiang River in South China on April 22, two months before deluges of similar intensity usually occur. Meanwhile, meteorologists have issued warnings that Europe, recognized as the world's fastest-warming continent, is bracing for another scorching summer.In the aftermath of these catastrophic events and in preparation for future challenges, a shared realization has emerged that climate change has no borders.The 5th China-European Union High-Level Environment and Climate Dialogue, a vice-prime ministerial-level meeting, is being held this week at the EU's headquarters in Brussels. In exclusive interviews with China Daily, officials and experts expressed great anticipation that the dialogue will further enhance climate cooperation between China and the EU, with both being major global economies and carbon emitters.On the substantial strides achieved in Sino-EU climate and environment cooperation, they highlighted the immense potential of both sides to spearhead the global transition toward a low-carbon future.'Ballast' for multilateralism"Environment and climate have always been a key focus and highlight of China-EU cooperation, being one of the earliest areas included in government collaboration between the two sides and a topic of significant consensus in high-level exchanges between China and the EU," said Zhou Guomei, director-general of the Department of International Cooperation of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.In addition to the vice-prime ministerial-level mechanism, which was established in 2020, China and the EU also have separate ministerial dialogues on environmental policy and climate change, she said.Xia Yingxian, director of the ministry's climate change department, said the China and EU are "ballast" that help stabilize the world's multilateral climate process, especially after the United States announced in 2017 its withdrawal from the landmark Paris Agreement.That year, China, the EU, and Canada collectively launched the Ministerial Meetings on Climate Action, as part of joint efforts to promote exchanges of views on key issues in the multilateral climate process, build momentum and find solutions to advance global climate governance, Xia said.Held for seven consecutive years, the event sends positive signals in upholding multilateralism, implementing the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, and promoting climate action and international cooperation. "Currently, the geopolitical situation is intricate, and international relations face numerous uncertainties, inevitably impacting the climate multilateral process," he said.Both China and the EU are significant participants in international climate negotiations. Regardless of how the external environment changes, tackling climate change remains one of the areas of cooperation with the most consensus between the two sides, Xia said.Dirk Messner, president of the German Environment Agency, also stressed the importance of China and the EU, including Germany, in safeguarding global climate multilateralism."We all know that we are living in a world where multilateralism is eroding," he said."We talk about climate change. It is about the fragility of the planetary system itself. This is a global problem … and we need to restabilize multilateralism to manage this kind of problems, because we cannot solve them individually as nations."From a German perspective, Messner said, cooperating with China in the field of climate is absolutely key as the two countries are in the G20, whose members contribute 80 percent of global carbon emissions."We, as the G20 countries, are producing the problem, which we now have to solve," Messner said.Marco Lambertini, convener of the Nature Positive Initiative, said cooperation between China and the EU is essential, especially against the backdrop of an interconnected world, where impacts on climate and nature transcend borders."Natural ecosystems store immense amounts of carbon and every year, about half of human carbon dioxide emissions are neutralized by forests, wetlands and marine habitats," he said. "Similar to the carbon-neutral transition, it is urgent that we also embrace the nature-positive goal so as to build a sustainable future for all."The EU and China have been aligned in tackling the challenge of building a net-zero emissions and nature-positive world, Lambertini noted.They have both developed and enacted comprehensive and innovative domestic legislation with similar objectives and connotations, he said. The EU's Natura 2000 protected areas network and China's ecological red lines, for example, both prioritize nature conservation and sustainable development.Remarkable progressHu Jun, director of the Policy Research Center for Environment and Economy affiliated with the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said China and the EU have carried out pragmatic cooperation in quite a few sectors, including pollution control, biodiversity conservation, carbon trading markets and renewable energy.To date, over 200 cooperation projects in the environmental and climate sectors have been implemented between China and the EU, as well as its member states such as Germany, France and Italy. Hu cited China-EU cooperation on the environment and green economy project as an example.Two phases of cooperation have been completed under the project, with the first one spanning 2018 to 2021, and the second 2021 to 2024.The two sides, for example, have organized seminars on a range of topics, including green transformation, climate transition strategies, biodiversity policy and legislation, Hu said. Research on innovative green finance policies, which "have provided crucial decision-making support for policymakers", has also been undertaken.Joint research has been conducted on synergizing pollution control and carbon-emissions reduction in the transportation sector as well as the role of green finance in supporting emission reductions, offering robust support for China's environmental protection efforts, Hu said.Messner said Germany and China have had active interaction on climate and energy, much of which has happened via the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development. Established in 1992, the council is a high-level, international think tank that reports to the Chinese government. It is currently chaired by Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang."As a member of the council, I'm also chair of a task force which is working on digitalization and artificial intelligence for sustainability goals," Messner said. "We published the first study on this issue last year, and we are preparing a second one on smart and sustainable cities in Europe and China at the end of the year."Messner underscored the importance of the two communication channels, which feature experts interacting with political decision-makers, and help the two sides understand and learn from each other.Working togetherTian Chengchuan, director of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment's Foreign Environmental Cooperation Center, highlighted a range of collaborative projects between Chinese and European companies aimed at advancing green and low-carbon development.An intelligent water supply management system developed by the Shanghai Pudong Veolia Water Corporation Ltd, a subsidiary of French environmental solutions provider Veolia Group, for example, is projected to significantly reduce carbon emissions associated with water supplies for 3.8 million users in Pudong, Shanghai, over a 10-year period from its launch in 2019, he said.The system is expected to help reduce carbon emissions by almost 4,758 million metric tons annually, Tian said.With an independently developed cooling technology, China's Lenovo Group Ltd now helps remove approximately 90 percent of the heat generated by the computing systems at the Leibniz Supercomputing Center in Germany, he said, adding the technology has increased cooling efficiency 4,000 fold.Hot water generated in the cooling process is used to provide heating for buildings in the center complex, resulting in annual savings of $1.25 million, he said.In a move to further ramp up cooperation between Chinese and European companies, Tian said his center is making efforts to establish a China-Europe environmental and climate cooperation network involving various stakeholders such as think tanks, businesses and regional authorities.The network aims to facilitate the sharing of best practices and technological solutions in promoting green and low-carbon transformations, enhance the understanding of green transformation policies in China and Europe within the business community, and support Chinese and European enterprises in engaging in collaborative exchanges related to green transformations, he said.Hu, from the Policy Research Center for Environment and Economy, said China and the EU will also strive to deepen regional-level cooperation.Initial focus will be on promoting the establishment of a China-Europe regional green and low-carbon cooperation platform, he said.He outlined a long list of sectors with potential for China and the EU to further enhance cooperation through joint programs and policy dialogue, as well as seminars and training on issues such as clean energy, green transportation, green buildings, and the circular economy.He said there was significant potential for the two sides to promote climate cooperation programs in third-party regions, including Southeast Asia and Africa.The two sides can provide training, organize seminars and carry out demonstration projects in these regions under the frameworks of South-South climate cooperation and the green Belt and Road Initiative, he said."Overall, there are bright prospects and immense opportunities for pragmatic cooperation between China and the EU," he said.Beijing opposes using human rights as a pretext to interfere in China's internal affairs, while it hopes to strengthen communication and cooperation with the European Union on the issue to strengthen mutual understanding as well as resolve differences, Assistant Foreign Minister Miao Deyu said on Monday.In a meeting in Beijing with Paola Pampaloni, deputy director-general for Asia and the Pacific of the European External Action Service, Miao said that China opposes politicizing the human rights issue and applying double standards, as well as engaging in "microphone diplomacy" at multilateral platforms.He said he hopes that the EU will work with China in the same direction and carry out dialogue and cooperation instead of confrontation and oppression.An EU delegation led by Pampaloni visited Xizang autonomous region from Thursday to Saturday, and attended the 39th session of the joint Human Rights Dialogue in Chongqing on Sunday.The dialogue was co-chaired by Shen Bo, director-general of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, and Pampaloni.Shen elaborated on China's human rights development path, philosophy and achievements as well as the country's position on global human rights governance, according to a readout released by the foreign ministry.He lodged solemn representations with the EU over the China-related content in its annual report on global human rights and democracy, emphasizing that affairs of Xinjiang, Xizang and Hong Kong and judicial cases are purely China's internal affairs, which brook no external interference.Shen refuted the EU's groundless accusations about China's judicial procedures, the death penalty, labor rights, as well as ethnic and religious issues.He also raised the human rights issues in EU countries including racism, violation of the rights of refugees and migrants, and violence against women, and asked the bloc to earnestly resolve these issues.China and the EU agreed that the dialogue was candid, in-depth and conducive to enhancing mutual understanding, according to the readout.The two sides are willing to explore cooperation in multilateral fields regarding economic, social and cultural rights, and rights of women, children and persons with disabilities.We are pleased to announce the upcoming World Dialogue on China Studies · Belgium Forum, set to take place on June 20 in Brussels, Belgium. This significant academic event is an extension of the biannual World Conference on China Studies, typically held in Shanghai, and aims to foster a deeper understanding of China through international dialogue.Event Details:The World Conference on China Studies, jointly organized by China's Information Office of the State Council and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, convenes biannually in Shanghai. The inaugural World Conference on China Studies·Shanghai Forum was held on November 24, 2023, under the themed "Chinese Civilization and the China's Path - A Global Perspective". The event was co-organized by China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences (SASS). President Xi Jinping extended his congratulations to the forum, underscoring its global significance.The World Dialogue on China Studies serves as a critical platform for academic exchange within the framework of the World Conference on China Studies. Held outside of China biennially when the main conference is not in session, this year's forum in Brussels commemorates the 210th anniversary of the establishment of professional sinology in Europe. The forum is co-organized by the Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences (SASS), the European Institute for Asian Studies (EIAS) and Cátedra China, with the China Cultural Center in Brussels supporting related activities.Nearly 60 experts from China and Europe will engage in in-depth discussions around the central theme. The forum will feature three parallel panels, each focusing on critical aspects of China-Europe relations:1. Europe-China People-to-People Exchange and Dialogue - Mechanisms and Pathways2. Europe-China Economic and Trade Cooperation - Resilience and Potential3. European China Studies - Status quo and Prospects for the FutureWe look forward to welcoming participants to this pivotal event, fostering robust dialogue and enhancing mutual understanding between China and Europe.China's top two cities, Beijing and Shanghai, held promotional conferences in the City of London this week, with delegations presenting investment and business opportunities to companies in the United Kingdom.The event showcasing the business environment of the country's capital city was held on Tuesday by Beijing Investment Promotion Service Center, together with officials from four districts of the capital city.Zhu Sheng, deputy director of the center, said Beijing's regional GDP reached 4.4 trillion yuan ($618.26 billion) in 2023, up 5.2 percent year-on-year, and welcomed the establishment of 1,729 foreign-funded enterprises last year.Beijing has been committed to high-quality opening up, and last month, a new regulation was passed to optimize the foreign investment environment, Zhu said.He added that the capital is the only city in China designated as both the national comprehensive demonstration zone for expanding openness in the service sector and the national free trade pilot zone.Invest Shanghai, the municipal government's overseas investment development agency, held another promotional event for the coastal city on Thursday.Zhang Guohua, deputy director of the Shanghai Commission of Commerce, said that by the end of last year, Shanghai was home to 956 regional headquarters of multinational corporations and 561 foreign-funded R&D centers.He also emphasized the city's commitment to building a market-oriented and law-based business environment.The conference featured businesspeople sharing their first-hand experiences in Shanghai.Jack Perry Jr, chairman of the 48 Group Club, recalled his experience doing business in Shanghai nearly twenty years ago. He said: "Why invest in Shanghai? Simply put, the city is a great gateway to China's vast market, a test bed for innovation and a hub for international finance. The business opportunities are endless, from technology and healthcare to renewable energy and consumer goods."Moreover, the local government is incredibly supportive for foreign investments, offering incentives and streamlining processes for setting up businesses like we did back in 2006."Rachel Evans, representative for GINA Shoes, said the luxury designer footwear brand opened its first store in Shanghai last year. By leveraging the power of online influencers, the brand's social media posts featuring its signature Barbie shoes gained millions of views and engagements."It definitely proves that Shanghai is an excellent stepping stone to open the door into the Chinese market. So we hope to see you in Shanghai, and we aim to work with everyone to further establish the brand in China through Shanghai," said Evans.The two conferences were hosted at the London office of Dentons law firm. Representatives from the China-Britain Business Council, and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade also participated in the event.China, in response to the European Union's decision to impose additional tariffs on Chinese-made battery electric vehicles, will take all necessary actions to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese companies, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday, which has led analysts to say retaliatory measures are possible.Beijing may choose to impose retaliatory duties targeting EU-produced large-engine vehicles, brandy and dairy products, they said. Additionally, there is a possibility of further tariff increases on EVs imported by China from the EU, they said, adding that any countermeasures would aim to send a clear message and urge the EU to reconsider its decision regarding Chinese EVs.Less than a month after Washington announced plans to quadruple the duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would also impose additional tariffs on such products, ranging from 17.4 percent for BYD to 38.1 percent for SAIC, on top of the standard 10 percent car duty.That takes the highest overall rate to nearly 50 percent. The ruling will take effect on July 4, unless Beijing agrees to "an effective solution" to so-called subsidies that the EU claims are distorting its markets.He Yadong, a spokesman for the Commerce Ministry, said on Thursday at a news conference that the EU's recent actions are a breach of World Trade Organization rules and blatant examples of trade protectionism, and China will reserve the right to seek recourse through the WTO.Meanwhile, China has urged the EU to promptly rectify its erroneous practices, the spokesman said, emphasizing the importance of dialogue and negotiations to effectively address trade disputes, expand cooperation and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.According to the German think tank Kiel Institute, while the decrease in imports could be partially mitigated by increased production within the EU, it would likely result in higher prices for consumers. This is because production within the EU is significantly more expensive than in China due to higher energy and material prices, and labor costs are much higher.In addition, of all the electric cars built in China and sold across the EU last year, half came from Western carmakers. The United States EV maker Tesla accounted for 28 percent of all Chinese-made EVs imported by Europe, while French carmaker Renault's Dacia Spring added an additional 20 percent, according to a study in late March by European think tank Transport and Environment.All other companies producing in China that had cooperated with the commission's probe but were not sampled, including Renault, would face an average duty of 21 percent, while Tesla could face an individually calculated duty rate.Oliver Zipse, CEO of BMW, which established a production base in Northeast China's Liaoning province, said in a statement on Wednesday that the additional tariffs imposed by the EU could hinder the development of European automotive companies and ultimately harm Europe's own interests.The adoption of protectionist measures, such as tariffs, could trigger a cycle of retaliation, leading to a breakdown of cooperative trade relations, he added.Liu Chunsheng, an associate professor at Central University of Finance and Economics, said that the increased tariffs on Chinese-produced EVs entering the EU are expected to translate into higher production costs and affect their pricing, ultimately pointing to reduced competitiveness and market share.However, Europe's plan to phase out Chinese EVs might not be an easy feat. BYD, for instance, has ample space to adjust pricing due to its relatively high EU premium, according to a report by New York-based Rhodium Group.Nonetheless, the economic losses faced by Chinese enterprises without justifiable cause mean that China will by no means make concessions that could compromise the interests of its companies, Liu added.Relevant authorities, in accordance with WTO rules and Chinese regulations, will initiate investigations to address concerns of Chinese industries related to subsidies or dumping practices of EU dairy products and pork to safeguard fair market competition and protect the Chinese industries' legitimate rights, said Ministry of Commerce spokesman He.Meanwhile, the products targeted for possible retaliatory tariffs, such as EU-produced large-engine vehicles and brandy, might be chosen to exert pressure on sectors that could significantly affect the EU's economy, said Xu Hongcai, deputy director of the China Association of Policy Science's Economic Policy Committee.Moreover, China now imposes a 15 percent tariff on EVs imported from the EU and has not ruled out the possibility of further increasing the tariffs, should the situation escalate, Xu said, adding that China leans more toward dialogue and negotiations with the EU to prevent a scenario in which both parties suffer adverse consequences.wangkeju@chinadaily.com.cn The European Commission announced on Wednesday that Chinese-made battery electric vehicles will soon be subjected to punitive countervailing tariffs following its anti-subsidy investigation launched in October.The commission said it "has provisionally concluded that the BEVs (battery electric vehicles) value chain in China benefits from unfair subsidization, which is causing a threat of economic injury to EU BEV producers".The commission said the countervailing duties will vary depending on the brand, including 38.1 percent tariffs on SAIC, 20 percent on Geely and 17.4 percent on BYD, and the new tariffs will come on top of the existing 10 percent import tariffs.China has expressed grave concern and strong dissatisfaction following the European Commission's decision, the Ministry of Commerce said on Wednesday.It has also called on the European Union to immediately rectify its wrongful actions and seek dialogue and negotiations to effectively address the ongoing trade friction between the two sides, a spokesperson said in a statement released on the ministry's website.The decision, which disregards factual evidence and World Trade Organization rules, has been made despite China's repeated strong objections, and it ignores the appeals and warnings from several EU member states' governments and industry sectors, the spokesperson said.The ruling also fails to recognize that China's competitive advantage in the electric car industry is a result of fair and open competition, and the decision is a violation of WTO rules and a failure to acknowledge the comprehensive cooperation of Chinese companies during the investigation, the spokesperson added.Furthermore, it is a blatant act of protectionism that will escalate trade friction and undermine fair competition under the guise of "maintaining fair competition", which will not only jeopardize the legitimate rights and interests of China's electric car industry, but also disrupt the global automotive supply chain, the spokesperson said.The actions taken by the European Commission not only harm the interests of European consumers, but also jeopardize the EU's own goals of green transition and collaboration in addressing climate change on a global scale, according to the spokesperson.China will keep abreast of the developments on the EU side and is prepared to take necessary measures to firmly protect the rights of the Chinese companies involved, the spokesperson added.Also on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry urged the EU to honor its commitment to support free trade and reject protectionism.Lin Jian, a ministry spokesman, said at a daily news briefing that the anti-subsidy investigation is a typical act of protectionism.Lin said that using the investigation as a pretext, the EU plans to impose tariffs on EVs imported from China, which violates the principles of the market economy and international trade rules.The move will also damage China-EU economic and trade cooperation as well as the stability of global automotive supply chains, ultimately harming Europe's own interests, he said.Misguided approachThe spokesman added that political figures from several European countries and representatives from the European auto industry have recently expressed opposition to the anti-subsidy investigation, saying that they believe imposing additional tariffs on Chinese EVs to protect the EU industry is a misguided approach."Protectionism is not the way forward, while openness and cooperation are the right path," Lin said.He urged the EU to work together with China to uphold the overall situation of China-EU economic and trade cooperation. China will take all necessary measures to firmly defend its legitimate rights and interests, he added.The European Commission said it has reached out to Chinese authorities to discuss the findings and explore possible ways to resolve the issues in a WTO-compatible manner."Should discussions with Chinese authorities not lead to an effective solution, these provisional countervailing duties would be introduced from July 4," the commission said.In a statement on Wednesday, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU expressed "its shock, grave disappointment and deep dissatisfaction with the protectionist trade measure" by the European Commission."The CCCEU believes these measure will seriously impair the legitimate rights and interests of BEV companies and exert negative impacts on China-EU trade and cooperation in the automotive sector," it said.According to a recent CCCEU survey within the Chinese BEV industry, imposition of a 10 percent additional levy would already carry significant implications for most Chinese car manufacturers, resulting in a substantial negative impact on their exports to Europe.The rates ranging from 17.4 percent to 38.1 percent will pose a serious market barrier, the CCCEU said.Despite China's strength in the global BEV production and sales market, exports of BEVs to the EU accounted for only about 5 percent of China's BEV production in 2023. The market share of China's BEV brands in the European market has consistently remained lower than that of local European companies, according to the CCCEU.The CCCEU also said that the EU's investigation into China's BEVs was politically motivated, driven by protectionism, and lacked substantive complaints from its own industry."In contrast, numerous European industry representatives have voiced concerns regarding the investigation, citing potential negative impacts on Chinese and European BEV supply chains, innovation and market cooperation," the CCCEU said, adding that the chamber and the Chinese car industry also share these concerns.Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former Swedish prime minister, said on social media on Wednesday that he's "not too worried by what is said to be Chinese EV subsidies — if they want to subsidize the EU green transition, which really needs to speed up, then it's OK with me."David Henig, director of the United Kingdom Trade Policy Project at the Brussels-based European Centre for International Political Economy, wrote on social media: "In essence, the real purpose of EU tariffs is giving the domestic industry a few years to become closer to competitive as the Chinese industry or to receive investment from them. Yes there are subsidies, but so there are everywhere. China started on EV way earlier."Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao, on a recent trip to Europe, dismissed accusations of "unfair competition" made by the EU and the United States, calling them groundless. He said some countries are implementing high tariffs, discriminatory subsidies, investment restrictions and unilateral sanctions that contravene WTO rules, with the aim of excluding Chinese companies from their markets."This is not fair competition at all," Wang said.Zhao Jia in Beijing contributed to this story.The European Commission announced on Wednesday that Chinese-made battery electric vehicles, or BEVs, will soon be subjected to punitive countervailing tariffs, after the conclusion of the bloc's anti-subsidy investigation launched in October.The commission said it "has provisionally concluded that the BEVs value chain in China benefits from unfair subsidization, which is causing a threat of economic injury to EU BEV producers"."The investigation also examined the likely consequences and impact of measures on importers, users and consumers of BEVs in the EU," the commission said in its announcement.According to the commission, countervailing duties vary depending on the brands. The first provisional decision includes a 17.4 percent tariff on BYD, 20 percent on Geely, and 38.1 percent on SAIC.The new tariffs will come on top of the existing 10 percent import tariffs faced by all non-EU BEV makers.The commission said it had reached out to Chinese authorities to discuss its findings and explore possible ways to resolve the issues identified in a WTO-compatible manner."Should discussions with Chinese authorities not lead to an effective solution, these provisional countervailing duties would be introduced from July 4," the commission said.In a statement on Wednesday, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU, or CCCEU, expressed "its shock, grave disappointment and deep dissatisfaction with the protectionist trade measure" by the European Commission."Regarding the provisional countervailing duty rate of up to 38.1 percent to be imposed by the EU, the CCCEU believes these measures will seriously impair the legitimate rights and interests of BEV companies and exert negative impacts on China-EU trade and cooperation in the automotive sector," it said. "Furthermore, the chamber expresses serious concern and apprehension that the spillover effect will present challenges to China-EU economic and trade relations, as well as bilateral relations."According to a recent survey of the Chinese BEV industry conducted by the CCCEU, the imposition of a 10 percent additional levy would already carry significant implications for most Chinese car manufacturers, resulting in a substantial negative impact on their exports to Europe.The rates spanning from 17.4 percent to 38.1 percent will pose a serious market barrier, the CCCEU said.Despite China's dominance in the global BEV production and sales market, exports of BEVs to the EU accounted for only about 5 percent of China's BEV production in 2023. And the exports primarily comprised European and United States brands that manufacture in China. The market share of China's own BEV brands in the European market has consistently remained lower than that of local European companies, according to the CCCEU.The organization said the EU's self-initiated investigation into China's BEV industry was politically motivated and driven by protectionism, lacking substantive and substantial complaints from its domestic industry."In contrast, numerous European industry representatives have voiced concerns regarding the investigation, citing potential negative impacts on Chinese and European BEV supply chains, innovation, and market cooperation," the CCCEU said. "The chamber, along with the Chinese car industry, resonates with these serious concerns."Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former Swedish prime minister, said on X on Wednesday: "I'm not too worried by what is said to be Chinese EV subsidies – if they want to subsidize the EU green transition, which really needs to speed up, then it's okay with me."David Henig, UK director of the Brussels-based European Center for International Political Economy, said, also on X, that the tariffs seemed to be aimed at helping the EU's manufacturers catch up."In essence, the real purpose of EU tariffs is giving the domestic industry a few years to become closer to competitive as the Chinese industry or to receive investment from them. Yes there are subsidies, but so there are everywhere. China started on EV way earlier," he wrote.China's Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao refuted the "unfair competition" accusation made by the EU and the US and called it groundless during a recent trip to Europe. He said some countries are implementing high tariffs, discriminatory subsidies, investment restrictions and unilateral sanctions that contravene World Trade Organization rules with the aim of excluding Chinese companies from their markets."This is not fair competition at all," Wang said.Several German ministers have also voiced concerns about the European Commission's move.Germany's Federal Minister for Digital and Transport Volker Wissing said imposing tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to protect the European industry would be the "wrong approach" to promoting international competition.And Germany's Minister of Economy Robert Habeck, also a vice-chancellor of the nation, warned of damage to the EU's interests through tough tariffs against China.Germany's car industry association VDA has in the past months warned the European Commission of a Chinese backlash over the tariffs. The VDA has criticized the European Commission for failing to coordinate sufficiently with the German government.Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, told China Daily a month ago that VDA does not support the European Commission's anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EV companies and that the EU's punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs would not solve the challenges facing the European automotive industry."What is needed instead is an active industrial strategy, including an active trade policy," she said.Erik Solheim, a Norwegian politician and former executive director of the UN Environment Programme, told China Daily last week that the world needs more green products that are affordable and reliable."China is doing that. Everyone should compliment China," he said, adding that "it's fantastic news for the world".He said Europe and the United States should embrace the competition by welcoming Chinese companies to invest there, so they can learn from superior Chinese technology.chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cnChinese companies have expressed deep concerns over rising protectionism in the European Union, as the bloc ramps up its anti-subsidy probes targeting Chinese companies, especially those making clean energy products.News site Politico reported that the European Commission is expected to inform Chinese EV makers of the duties they would face by the end of next week. The commission launched investigations last October into the "suspected unfair state subsidies" of Chinese EVs.The China Chamber of Commerce to the EU, or CCCEU, said on Thursday that more than 40 Chinese companies operating across Europe have voiced grave concerns about the EU's escalating protectionism.These companies have called on the Chinese government to address urgent issues, including the EU's anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese-made electric vehicles and Brussels' use of unilateral tools such as the Foreign Subsidies Regulation that specifically targets Chinese enterprises.Chinese Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao and other senior officials heard their complaints during their recent visits to Spain, Portugal and Poland.Speaking at a roundtable in Lisbon on Tuesday, Wang acknowledged the rising risks for Chinese companies in Europe. He called on the EU to commit to cooperating with China and ensuring a fair competitive environment for Chinese companies, according to CCCEU representatives who attended the meeting.Chinese representatives from sectors such as finance, green energy, transportation, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and construction discussed the EU's growing protectionist measures at the meeting.CCCEU Chairman Xu Chen said the chamber's survey last year showed a continued decline in Chinese companies' overall assessment of the EU business environment, with 43 percent of respondents reporting a worsening situation over the previous year.Chinese companies stressed that the EU's market environment has further deteriorated in recent months, marked by escalating trade protectionist measures.While the EU claims these actions are necessary to address China's "unfair competition", Chinese companies argue that these swift measures have caused significant market barriers and impediments, and they urge the Chinese government to take effective steps to safeguard their legitimate interests, according to the CCCEU.Wang refuted the "unfair competition" accusation and called it groundless. He said some countries are implementing high tariffs, discriminatory subsidies, investment restrictions and unilateral sanctions that contravene World Trade Organization rules, with the aim of excluding Chinese companies from their markets. "This is not fair competition at all," Wang was quoted by the CCCEU as saying.Malicious attempts"We embrace healthy competition, but stand firmly against any malicious attempts for suppression."Erik Solheim, a Norwegian politician and former executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said the world needs more green products that are affordable and reliable."China is doing that. Everyone should compliment China," he said, adding that "it's a fantastic news for the world".He said Europe and the United States should embrace the competition by welcoming Chinese companies to invest there so they can learn from superior Chinese technology.In an article on the Forbes news site on Thursday, Neil Winton, a former European automotive correspondent for Reuters, warned that "cutting China's EV sales in Europe would undermine important EU plans to end the sale of new gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2035".Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kaellenius voiced his stance against restrictions during an industry conference on Thursday in Bochum, Germany. He noted that the WTO rules are not keeping some countries from supporting their national producers."It is better to counter that with trade stimulus than with protectionism, especially for Germany, which has a strongly export-oriented economy," he was quoted by Reuters as saying.chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cnEditor's note: As the People's Republic of China celebrates the 75th anniversary of its founding this year, China Daily asked prominent international figures to reflect on their relationship with the country and to talk of the direction in which they see it going.Since the late 1970s, British historian, author and broadcaster Michael Wood has been traveling the world, sharing his passion for history and the stories of civilizations and kingdoms across the globe in a string of hugely successful series.He has written more than 120 documentaries, which have been shown in 140 countries and territories, covering topics including Alexander the Great, the conquistadors, India and the life of William Shakespeare, but one of his most enduring fascinations, both professionally and personally, is with China.In 2016, Wood presented a series called The Story of China, and just before the novel coronavirus pandemic, he made a film about the man who first inspired his love of the country, the 8th-century poet Du Fu.The film, Du Fu: China's Greatest Poet, has now inspired a book, In the Footsteps of Du Fu, recounting Wood's travels while making it. He said it was a journey he was more than happy to retrace with viewers and readers, to enlighten them about his passion for Chinese culture."We know so little in general in our culture about China — it's not the only knowledge gap, but it's a particularly obvious one, and that's a real loss," he said. "The great sinologist Simon Leys wrote a fantastic passage that I often come back to, saying that China is the other pole of the human mind — until you know something about China, your knowledge of humanity is skewed — you won't be able to tell me what are our universal values and what are just Western idiosyncrasies."For Wood, his portal to a lifelong love of things Chinese was a paperback book."In 1960s Manchester, China seemed distant and exotic, but my first serious encounter with Chinese culture was the New Penguin translation of Poems of the Late Tang by Arthur Graham. It was a brilliant book, I was captivated by it," he said.Later, when he was doing his postgraduate studies at the University of Oxford, Wood shared a house with a sinologist who used to put books his way, which gave him a wider conversance with Chinese literature.Once Wood talked to a house guest and asked him what he did. It turned out he was David Hawkes, who had been a professor of Chinese at Oxford but gave it up to translate what he called the novel of the millennium — The Dream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin."He'd also produced a book called A Little Primer of Du Fu, which contained about 30 poems that you first saw in Chinese, then in transliteration, then literal translation, then a literary one, with an analysis of each, which was amazing."We all have encounters with books that open a window onto a world you never dreamed of, and that was one for me. I used to carry it around on foreign trips, and later I gave copies to other friends. It was a book I treasured."Vital translationWood's passion for Chinese poetry does not stretch as far as being able to speak or read the language, but, now more than ever, he said, translators are essential."Of course, translation is an approximation of language — most of us receive foreign literature through translation, so it is vital and a central aspect to dialogue between cultures," he said. "Translation is not only completely justifiable, but it's essential. If you look at the times we live in and the difficulties we have in the world, one of the biggest is the difficulty of understanding other cultures."There's a terrible danger with Chinese literature and culture that we think it's inaccessible to all but experts, because of the script and the language barrier. We need dialogue, which comes through translation, so I'm a firm believer in translations, in the same way a filmmaker should make popularizing films to help make one culture accessible to another."In his Du Fu documentary, Wood said: "For the Chinese people, poets have been the ones who most truly express the feelings of the people."China has the longest tradition of poetic writing in the world, with a timeline dating back before ancient Greek writers like Homer, and Wood said that it is this continuity and reverence that has helped keep the works of Du Fu, written 1,300 years ago, so relevant and so admired in the 21st century."All literate and educated Chinese people have a deep sense of the importance of that poetic tradition, and also a deep sense that historically, the poets are the truth speakers to power — they frame the great issues of the day for the ordinary people," he said. "Du Fu curated his own work carefully. Virtually nothing survives from before he was in his 30s, so you get the feeling that the works we have are what he would have wanted us to read."The majority of his work is from the period after the An Lushan Rebellion (755), which caused devastation when he was forced to take to the road with his family."The eight-year turmoil during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) saw millions of people displaced or killed, and one of Du Fu's own children starved to death in an experience that Wood thinks left an imprint on his later works that these days would be called post-traumatic stress."He's not the only poet to live through catastrophes and write about them, but he's the first to become the voice of his time," he said. "He talks about surviving natural disaster and war, and what it's like to be a refugee. He was writing about the sort of scenes we still see all around the world in the modern day because he'd lived them himself. He took the part of the ordinary people, that's a huge part of his story."Honoring the memoryIn the film, Wood visits the Thatched Cottage Museum on the outskirts of Chengdu, Sichuan province, where devotees honor the memory of Du Fu, and he speaks to many people to find out what it is about Du Fu's work that still has such an emotional pull."Lots of people go there, and talking to them you get a sense of how traditional Chinese people still value him hugely. They all say there are a great many qualities to his poetry, but his great strength is that it's with the ordinary people that he really endures."Wood's films have been screened in China, where he said audiences were intrigued and very receptive to see his outsider's view of their own culture and history."I'm trying to extend knowledge of China in a sympathetic way, so when we sat down to start planning The Story of China, I said to the team that the key thing was that there should be empathy — I wanted viewers all over the world to think that they would like to be there with us. That's the most important thing, everything else will just follow," he said."When it was shown in China, people were really happy that they were being shown so honestly because they're so used to China-bashing."I did a series of films for the 40th anniversary of the opening-up and managed to get some incredible interviews with people who had lived through it. In the first 24 hours on the Tencent website, just the promo for that series got 100 million hits. People really warmed to the fact that we were formally addressing what happened as a great event in world history."The Du Fu film was a co-production with Chinese broadcaster CCTV, and Wood admitted it "must have been slightly weird to have a Westerner telling you the story of your greatest poet", but once again, the response was appreciative."We made comparisons that wouldn't have occurred to them, like with the World War I poets writing about the shattering of Western ideals and values in war, which was a new angle for the Chinese audience, and they really liked it," he said."Sometimes, with some of the comparisons, I had to check with people that I wasn't stretching them too far, but no, they understood that the films were made in a spirit of loving Chinese culture, and empathy for the Chinese people."Future dreamsThere was also one unexpected bonus reaction to the sight and sound of acclaimed English actor Ian McKellen reading Du Fu's poems."We were slightly worried about whether it was appropriate having an English person reading a great Chinese poet, but not only did viewers think he was great, they also thought he looked just right for Du Fu," he said.The book of Wood's pre-pandemic Du Fu journey has only been written in retrospect, and he said, had he planned it at the time, he would have kept a more detailed diary, rather than just travel notes, but he still has many China-related projects he would like to explore further."From a British point of view, I'd love to do something about Lord Macartney opening the first British embassy in China in 1793. It's such an incredible meeting of civilizations, with so much mutual misunderstanding out of which so many things that have shaped our modern world sprung, it would be fascinating," he said.Wood added that the Story of China series only briefly touched on the 20th century, so he would also love to do something about the history of modern China."I've done literary festivals where I've spoken about Du Fu to rooms full of people who had never heard of him before, which is a great pleasure, and it's the same with filmmaking. It's a privilege to be invited in to do any kind of filming in any foreign culture, but there's always a special intrigue to filming about China."julian@mail.chinadailyuk.comTraveling pioneering path laid by Silk Road, 'steel caravan' records major milestoneThe China-Europe freight rail service achieved a remarkable milestone on May 25 by completing its 90,000th journey — an outstanding achievement that underscores the success of the Belt and Road Initiative and its deep roots in history.The service, which facilitates the movement of goods between China and European nations, has also bolstered infrastructure connectivity, streamlined cargo transportation, and enriched trade and communication channels.Since it began in 2011, the service has transported more than 8.7 million containers carrying goods valued in excess of $380 billion, according to the China State Railway Group, the operator of the service.The China-Europe freight train, often referred to as a "steel camel caravan", has made these remarkable achievements in just 13 years.Ironically, the first camel caravan to travel from China to Europe — and reportedly led by the Chinese imperial envoy Zhang Qian — took 13 years to make that singular, historic trip.Over 2,000 years ago, Zhang Qian departed on his expedition from Chang'an, now Xi'an in Northwest China's Shaanxi province. He traveled thousands of kilometers westward, traversing what is today the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and various nations in Central Asia. That expedition laid the foundation for the Silk Road, heralding the dawn of links between the East and West.Zhang's first expedition earned him widespread acclaim as a national hero and the trailblazer of the Silk Road.Numerous merchants, travelers, and their camel caravans subsequently followed in his footsteps, facilitating trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe and playing a pivotal role in advancing human civilization.Inspired by Zhang Qian's historic journey and the monumental success of the Silk Road, China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013 — a modern iteration of the Silk Road aimed at fostering enhanced communication between the East and West. Over the past 11 years, this initiative has garnered widespread acceptance and proven its importance and efficiency on a global scale.One of the prominent achievements underscoring the success of this initiative has been the China-Europe freight train service.BEIJING - China hopes that the European Union (EU) will honor its commitment to upholding free trade and opposing protectionism, and work together with China to maintain the overall interest of China-EU economic and trade cooperation, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.Spokesperson Mao Ning made the remarks at a regular press briefing when responding to a question on relevant remarks by an EU official.Mao said that China will continue to promote high-level opening-up and provide an open, inclusive and transparent business environment for enterprises from all countries.BEIJING -- Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng met with Türkiye's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Beijing on Tuesday.Friendly exchanges and practical cooperation in various fields between China and Türkiye have continued to deepen, Han said, noting that as major developing countries and important emerging markets, the two countries share extensive common interests and huge potential for cooperation.China is willing to work with Türkiye to fully implement the important consensus reached by the heads of state of the two countries, enhance political mutual trust, strengthen the synergy of development strategies, promote the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and provide staunch support to each other in safeguarding their respective core interests to propel the strategic cooperation between the two sides to a new height, Han said.Fidan said Türkiye adheres to the one-China principle and brooks no activities sabotaging China's territorial integrity, adding that Türkiye is ready to strengthen high-level exchanges with China and enhance practical cooperation in various fields.The echoes of China's Huaiju Opera, a tradition spanning more than two centuries, recently graced the stages in Croatia and the Netherlands, where the convergence of Eastern and Western arts unfolds a unique cultural dialogue and fosters a bridge of cultural exchange and friendship.A delegation from Yancheng, a coastal city in Jiangsu province, attended the "City Day" celebration in Cakovec, Croatia, where Croatian leaders, including President Zoran Milanovic, witnessed the debut performance of Huaiju Opera actresses Xia Rong and Xia Shiya on Wednesday.The performance was well received. Spectators captured the highlights with their phones and cameras. Afterward, the audience members approached the performers for interactions and photos.The performance marked Huaiju Opera's debut in Croatia, following the establishment of sister-city relations between Yancheng and Cakovec in 2022. Interactions and exchanges between the two cities have been frequent, leading to cooperation in economy, trade and culture.Friendly exchangesChen Weihong, director of the publicity department of Yancheng, shared stories of friendly exchanges between Yancheng and the Netherlands with Dutch guests while introducing Yancheng's cultural and tourism resources at the Yancheng (Netherlands) Cultural Tourism Exchange Conference on Friday.Guests were treated to on-site presentations detailing Yancheng's ecological wetland culture, sea salt culture, vast marine resources and vibrant modern trends. One popular presentation highlighted the spoon-billed sandpiper, a bird with a beak shaped like a small spoon living in Yancheng.Chinese Ambassador to the Netherlands Tan Jian said the Dafeng Holland Flower Sea in Yancheng has become a tourist attraction, drawing thousands of Chinese tourists who wish to visit the Netherlands, and helping promote the sales of Dutch tulips in China."Welcome everyone to visit Yancheng, welcome to China," Tan said. "No visa is required."China has extended the visa exemption policy for citizens of 12 countries, 11 of them in Europe, including the Netherlands.The policy, which applies to those visiting China for short periods, will last until the end of next year.Air China, the country's flag-carrier airline, resumed its daily service between London Gatwick Airport and Beijing on Saturday.The first flight departing from London's second-busiest airport carried more than 240 passengers, achieving an attendance rate of more than 90 percent, according to the airline's London office.The new route takes Air China's number of weekly non-stop flights between China and the United Kingdom to 62."We are tremendously excited to welcome the service to Beijing," said Jonathan Pollard, chief commercial officer at London Gatwick Airport. "Beijing is certainly a key target for us to provide those really important travel and trade links between the UK and China."Pollard noted that the airport is also targeting secondary and tertiary cities in China, where there is significant demand for flights linking to the UK.Norway expects more economic and trade collaboration with China in various areas as the two countries strive to achieve common goals on environmental issues and with regards to healthy food, a Norwegian official says.Over the 70 years since China-Norway diplomatic relations were established, there has been "great collaboration, and we are cooperating in a lot of ways", said Tore Sandvik, state secretary to the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries. He sees enormous potential for closer collaboration in the years to come, he said.Norway, with 5.5 million people, has one of the longest coastlines in the world and is the second-biggest exporter of seafood after China."China is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world, and this creates opportunities for Norwegian maritime and shipping companies," Sandvik said. "Norwegian companies are leaders in developing innovative technologies, particularly in sectors such as renewable energy and electric transportation. Thus we see much in common and possible collaboration with China."More than 160 Norwegian companies have a presence in China, according to a report published by the Norwegian consulate general in Shanghai. Most of the respondents cited in the report said they were optimistic about the business outlook for their industries over the coming three years.Among the industries that Norwegian businesses are involved in in China, maritime and shipping, consumer, machinery, seafood, green technology and renewable energy are the most prominent, the report said.As China strives to cut carbon emissions, Norway is doing the same, and consciousness of environmental issues is particularly acute in industries such as maritime, renewable energy and electric vehicles."Norway and China have a lot in common and share the goal to become renewable in energy and more and more an electric country," Sandvik said. "Hydrogen and ammonia, battery technology, offshore wind and low-emissions shipping are among the areas that Norway currently focuses on. We think we have broad space for cooperation in green transformation."In the Norwegian market, Chinese EVs are making a notable contribution to the country's efforts to protect the environment.About 25 percent of all cars in Norway are electric, Sandvik said, and nearly 90 percent of new car market sales are electric vehicles."I can see a lot more Chinese EV brands on Norwegian roads now. The Chinese EV market is rapidly increasing, and it is a fair competition in Norway. ... Norway is aiming to become the world's first nation to end the sale of gasoline and diesel cars by 2025, so Chinese EV brands have opportunities to compete well in the Norwegian market."Another highlight of bilateral economic ties is the seafood industry. Led by salmon, Norwegian seafood exports to China reached 158,909 metric tons last year, with exports worth $804 million, 18 percent more than in 2022 and accounting for 23 percent of the total value of its exports last year, the Norwegian Seafood Council says.Christian Chramer, chief executive of the council, said that despite increasing competition from countries such as Chile and New Zealand, Norway has enjoyed steady growth in China based on the long-term relationship with Chinese retailers, importers, restaurants and hotels.Norwegian businesses nurse strong ambitions to do well in China, he said, and more is being done to cater to the shopping preferences of Chinese, including their demand for healthy products.China was the sixth-largest growth market for seafood from Norway last year, he said. "We see that the local consumers are young and very digital online shoppers. They are trendy, and they inspire each other."Being amazed at China's rapid and huge development, journalists from Central and Eastern European countries hailed the Communist Party of China for leading Chinese people in achieving social stability and economic prosperity after they concluded a 15-day visit to China.The trip, starting from May 16, took nearly 30 journalists from 14 CEE countries to places including Beijing and Guangdong, where the delegation explored opportunities emerging from China's growth."It is obvious that with the leadership of the Party, Chinese people have accomplished all these achievements. The Party has shown it has the capability to make the country stable and prosperous," said Executive Manager of Radio Television Herceg Novi in Montenegro Gligo Tomanovic after touring the memorial of the first National Congress of the CPC in Shanghai."I have experienced the real development that the country has accomplished. From industrial and digital companies to the media, there are a lot of things that the whole world could learn from China, especially Europe," he said.He said the Chinese government details development plans according to capabilities of various parts of the country, which he believed was one of secrets behind China's success.He also praised Chinese people's devotion to national policies and strategies, saying they have one mind and interest in developing their own country for a better future.He pledged to present the true picture of China's modernization to the people of Montenegro through media channels so as to step up cooperation and communication between the two countries.Leszek Slazyk, founder and editor-in-chief of Poland's chiny24 website, lauded the Party and the government for adopting forward-thinking and planning for the big picture."This is, from my point of view, why China is so successful," he said.Having set foot in the country in 1994, Slazyk said great changes have taken place over the past three decades and he has witnessed China's huge development in fields such as economy, science and technology.Speaking of Chinese modernization, the China observer said the concept was not something new and it manifested from the consistency of China's policies.As early as the 1960s, the Party set the goal of achieving the Four Modernizations -industry, agriculture, national defense, and science and technology - to meet the goal of moderate prosperity, he said."Some details of policies and strategies may change but what remains unchanged is that the Party and the government have been adjusting tools or methods for the realization of the plans to achieve their goals," he added.Sasa Barbulovic, an editor-in-chief of television Morning program and Belgrade Chronicles at Radio Television of Serbia, said China has "put on a new suit" under the leadership of the Party and the government.He appreciated China for sharing its successes with the world, saying this mindset and behavior enable the country to develop faster.People in London share their opinions on such Chinese products as consumer electronics, electric cars, and e-commerce platforms in May 2024.Reporter Xing YiVideo by Brian ChangJiang Duo contributed to the interview.Business leaders and government officials attending the 3rd UK-China Business Leaders Summit in London on Tuesday said economic and trade cooperation between China and the United Kingdom should be expanded amidst global turbulence and changes.In his keynote speech, Zheng Zeguang, China's ambassador to the UK, said Sino-British cooperation is mutually beneficial and aligns with the fundamental interests of the people of both countries, emphasizing that it should not be disturbed by the so-called "peak China" theory or "overcapacity" narratives."We should not be caught up in those remarks made by some of the Western politicians," he said. "We must adhere to the overall direction of dialogue and cooperation, and continue to explore new opportunities for win-win cooperation."Zheng highlighted that British investment in China increased last year despite volatile times, while Chinese companies also show a proactive attitude towards expanding investment in the UK.According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, British investment in China jumped by 81 percent year-on-year in 2023."Regardless of any changes in the political landscape of the UK, we will work together with wise individuals from all sectors of the UK to advance Sino-British relations based on mutual respect, mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit," he said.A series of Chinese folk events have been held in Paris, showcasing traditional instrumental music alongside an art exhibition.The "Chanson of Silk and Bamboo—Wuxi Week of Chinese Folk Music" event, held at the China Cultural Center in Paris, featured the traditional folk music of the city of Wuxi in East China's Jiangsu province.The Wuxi Chinese Orchestra launched the series with a performance of "The Beautiful Taihu Lake" on May 21. The week of events was co-organized by the China Cultural Center in Paris, with China's Network of International Culturalink Entities and the Wuxi municipal government.Speaking at the opening ceremony, Li Qiufeng, director of Wuxi's publicity department, described Wuxi as "the hometown of Chinese folk music".As the birthplace of Wu culture, Wuxi has a strong musical tradition. Notable masters like Liu Tianhua, a pioneer of modern Chinese folk music, and the famous piece The Moon Reflected on Second Spring exemplify the richness of Wuxi's musical heritage.Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Kimmo Mattila, secretary-general of the International Confederation of Accordionists, said that the accordion instrument holds a unique position in the musical culture of Wuxi and within the traditional music of the Jiangnan region, which refers to the vast area south of the Yangtze River.Mattila, a native of Finland, highlighted Wuxi's beautiful natural scenery and deep cultural heritage. Remy Aron, president of the French Association of Plastic Arts, recalled his experiences collaborating with Chinese artists in Wuxi, creating and exhibiting works together, and praised Wuxi's innovative use of oil painting as a medium for urban promotion.Cooperation is essential for fostering robust China-UK business relations in the face of an increasingly complex and rapidly evolving international landscape, senior officials and executives said at the 2024 UK-China Business Forum in Lancaster, England on Thursday.The forum, which was organized by the Lancaster University Confucius Institute, drew around 100 Chinese and British participants.The overwhelming majority of the international community has expressed their opposition to the Taiwan region's participation in the upcoming World Health Assembly (WHA), the highest decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), said a Chinese representative on Saturday.China has decided not to approve the Taiwan region's participation in this year's WHA, which is set to be held in Geneva from May 27 to June 1, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on May 13.After coming into power in 2016, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of the Taiwan region has refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus and been hellbent on the separatist stance of "Taiwan independence," said the ministry. "As a result, the political foundation for the Taiwan region to participate in the WHA no longer exists."Yang Zhilun, minister-counsellor of China's Permanent Mission to the United Nations (UN) Office in Geneva, said at a briefing on Saturday that the vast majority of countries have reaffirmed to China their commitment to UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and their firm support for the one-China principle.More than 100 countries wrote to the WHO director-general or expressed via other means their support for China's position, said Yang.This shows where global opinion trends and the arc of history bends, said Yang.He slammed a Taiwan-related proposal, put forward by a small number of countries in the run-up to the WHA, as one out of political manipulation.The DPP authority has instigated the very small number of countries to once again come up with the highly confrontational proposal, said Yang."This is very inappropriate and unrealistic," he said. "The only prospect for the proposal is to be defeated."A tea culture salon may be the best way to experience China's tea ceremonies and culture in overseas locations."Tea for Harmony" cultural salon in Bath, England on Friday was aimed at celebrating International Tea Day, which fell on May 21 and also offering participants an opportunity to experience teas and culture from Central China's Hubei province.The delegation from the Hubei Tea Association brought three types of tea from the province to be enjoyed at the salon: Enshi Yulu, which is green tea, Yihong Black Tea, and Qingzhuan Tea, which is a dark tea.The history of the teas on offer dates back more than 1,000 years, and the crafting techniques of Enshi Yulu and Qingzhuan Tea have become national intangible cultural heritages, according to Li Xuechuan, who led the delegation.Journalists from Central and Eastern European countries have expressed their willingness to serve as a bridge to foster mutual understanding and win-win cooperation between China and CEE countries.Speaking at a roundtable held in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, CEE journalists said they saw a modernized China with booming opportunities, pledging to present a true and panoramic view of the country with professional and objective reports.Andrei Stoian, a producer and host of Canal 33, which is a Romanian television channel, expressed the belief that journalists between China and CEE countries would build a bridge of knowledge and friendship that benefits the regions and beyond."Misunderstanding and skepticism can arise, particularly in a world where media narratives often shape public perceptions," he said, adding that journalists must ensure their reports are fair, balanced and inclusive."By promoting transparency and bolstering open communication to build trust and mitigate concerns, collaborations between China and CEE countries would be perceived as mutually beneficial rather than one-sided," he added.He called for journalists between the two sides to step up collaboration to offer comprehensive and in-depth coverage and enhance the quality and reach of the report to contribute to more global audiences.Dragan Nikolic, a Croatian senior international reporter, urged journalists to make efforts to bridge the trust gap between China and Europe, which was caused by various reasons, including geopolitical ones.Journalists should promote mutual understanding and objectively present China's real condition to ensure stable ties between the two sides, he said."When it comes to China, I would say it is opening up, which the world, including Europe, needs to learn much more about," he added.Maria Sarafoglou, an anchor of Antenna Television in Greece, called on journalists to provide balanced coverage to contribute to stable ties between China and Greece and the stability of the regions and the world at large.She hailed bilateral ties as "a unique example of how countries with different cultures and backgrounds can really come around and benefit mutually in a radically changing world."Having noticed the enormous progress China has made, especially in economic and technological sectors, she said the two countries have huge potential for cooperation.It's hoped journalists will nurture closer ties to share their perspectives and jointly combat false information, she added."What I can see in China is incredible in what it can be in the fields of economy, science and industry," said Ales Kovacic, a journalist of Slovenia's Bloomberg Adriatic News Agency .He said the delegation during the visit witnessed that China is a leading power in many areas, such as AI and cyber-security.He said China's economic approach is thoughtful, and he expressed confidence in the country's ability to overcome possible challenges that emerged during its growth.The delegation of CEE journalists kicked off the China trip in mid-May, which has taken them to various places such as natural attractions, cultural venues and high-tech enterprises.Andrei Stoian, a producer and host of a Romanian mainstream media outlet, said on Tuesday that Huawei Songshan Lake Campus was a place where East meets West, and it reflects Chinese respect for Western culture.He made the comments after visiting the company in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong province.Noting the campus was a good mix of East and West, Stoian said he was very impressed to see European styles of architecture in the campus."I feel like I am in Europe but I'm still in China," he added.He said the respect for different cultures also manifested the China-proposed Global Civilization Initiative.He highlighted the importance of culture in promoting people-to-people exchanges and exchanges among civilizations."If we want to know each other better and exchange ideas, we have to know first our cultures."Stoian is a member of a visiting delegation of journalists from Central and Eastern European Countries. The delegation on Tuesday wrapped up their three-day visit to Guangdong province, during which they also came to Guangzhou and Zhuhai. The next leg of the trip is south China's Zhejiang province.Sasa Barbulovic, an editor-in-chief at Radio Television of Serbia, on Tuesday visited BYD, a nation's leading electric vehicle manufacturer in Shenzhen, Guangdong province.He was impressed with the huge scale of operation and innovation of the enterprise."I am confident that BYD can be a major player on the global scene with their products," he said.He hoped Serbia and China would carry out cooperation in the sector and believed more EVs from China would "drive through Serbian roads."Impressed with China's vast and burgeoning development of new-energy vehicles, journalists from Central and Eastern European Countries on Tuesday expressed hope for their countries to carry out cooperation with China on the sector.They made the remarks when visiting BYD, the nation's leading electric vehicle manufacture in Shenzhen, Guangdong province.Sasa Barbulovic, an editor-in-chief at Radio Television of Serbia, said he was impressed with the huge scale of operation of the innovative enterprise.The Shenzhen-based auto company became the world's leading seller of pure electric vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2023, marking another landmark moment in China's fast-growing NEV sector."I am confident that BYD can be a major player on the global scene with their products," he said.Barbulovic also said he had more confidence in the success of the Chinese economy and looked forward to seeing more NEVs in his country."China is investing in automobile production in Hungary, which is a neighboring country to Serbia," he said.Noting China and Serbia are good friends and partners, he believed more EVs from China would "drive through Serbian roads"."It is really amazing to see that BYD has such a huge industry of EV," said Tibor Eliot Rostas, who is a Slovak editor and also a member of the delegation.According to BYD, the company has a global presence of NEVs in 88 countries and regions.Saying that China has a long history of sharing its successes with others, he expected that Slovakia and China could cooperate on EVs, which he said represented the future of the automobile industry.Andrei Stoian, a Romanian host and producer, highlighted the significance of NEVs in promoting green and low-carbon development.Given gasoline-powered vehicles would inevitably bring about air pollution, the NEVs help reduce pollution and energy consumption, which are more environmentally friendly, he said.The journalists from CEEC, who are visiting China from May 16th, on Tuesday wrapped up a three-day tour in Guangdong province, during which they also visited Guangzhou and Zhuhai. They will now head to east China's Zhejiang province as the next leg of the trip to explore a multifaceted country.Yunlong town in Ningbo, Zhejiang province became the vibrant stage for an international dragon boat exchange on May 19, as 12 Bulgarian paddlers joined local teams for a spirited competition, infusing the event with a sense of international camaraderie.Yunlong town in the city's Yinzhou district, renowned as the "Birthplace of Chinese Dragon Boat Culture", has a rich tradition of dragon boat racing, a practice dating back over 2000 years. Over the past 15 years, the town has consistently hosted Dragon Boat Festival events, making it a vital custodian of Chinese dragon boat heritage.The genesis of this cross-cultural exchange can be traced back to a cultural promotion event held last February in Sofia, Bulgaria, where Yinzhou district showcased its dragon boat culture. Inspired by this display, Bulgaria decided to host its own Dragon Boat Culture Festival, albeit with only six dragon boats. Through collaboration facilitated by officials of the Chinese Embassy in Bulgaria, Yinzhou district and Bulgaria embarked on an interactive cultural exchange centered around dragon boat culture.Last April, four dragon boats, donated by Yinzhou district, along with accompanying equipment, were shipped to Bulgaria. These boats swiftly became part of Bulgaria's preparations for their own Dragon Boat Culture Festival, an integral component of their "Chinese Culture Season".Ruse, the fifth largest city in Bulgaria, plans to host the Dragon Boat World Championships in 2025. To prepare the competition, officials from the city, representatives of the Bulgarian Dragon Boat Association, and dragon boat athletes recently visited Yunlong town and participated in a dragon boat race with locals.During the competition, 21 dragon boat teams hit the water. Among them were 12 Bulgarian rowers, joining local teams to create an unforgettable moment of friendship and cultural exchange."The competition was exhilarating. I loved chanting and paddling rhythmically with local rowers," said Bulgarian participant Victor Stoyanov Stoyanov.Encho Iliev Enchev, deputy mayor of Ruse, noted that the trip to Yinzhou signifies a fresh beginning for cultural exchange and collaboration between Yinzhou and Ruse, with dragon boat culture serving as an important means to foster mutual understanding and cooperation between China and countries in Central and Eastern Europe.Russia's Graduate School of Management of St. Petersburg University (SPbU), China's School of Management at the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) and the Export School of the Russian Export Center (REC) will launch a joint in-depth course on transnational business between Russia and China. A cooperation agreement was signed between the two universities during the Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China last week.Russia's VTB Bank and the REC will partner in initiating the development of the supplementary education programs on the Russian side.The organizers plan to train the first two groups of corporate clients from Russia and China in 2024. The training program will incorporate online and in-person business trip modules, which will provide a theoretical understanding of doing business with new foreign partners, as well as a solid foundation for building quality partnerships during business trips."Cooperation between Russia and China is reaching a new level. To take this mutually beneficial partnership even further, we need a deeper immersion in the culture and the specific aspects of doing business in our countries. The Graduate School of Management of St. Petersburg University, as a leading business school, is joining forces with VTB, a leader of the financial sector, and the REC, which supports the non-commodity exports sector on the state level. Together, we are ready to share our knowledge and practical expertise with Russian companies that want to do business with China, and Chinese partners that want to build business ties with Russia," said Olga Dergunova, deputy president and chair of the VTB management board and director of the school.As part of the new joint educational programs, VTB will share its expertise, including cross-border settlements, enabling participants to expand their business development opportunities internationally."Last year, the Export School took a first step toward implementing joint the initiatives at the international level by organizing a business negotiations competition between Russian and Chinese universities, which was joined by students of the Harbin Polytechnic University. Today, we are excited to officially cooperate in the development and implementation of an international educational program for businesses. We are happy to have on board such powerful partners as the School of Management of Harbin Polytechnic University. There is no doubt that this cooperation could be a great example of two countries bringing their efforts and expertise together to develop business education", said Alisia Nikitina, director general of the REC Export School.On April 7 2023, whilst in Guangzhou in Guangdong province during his visit to China, French President Emmanuel Macron shared tea with his host, Chinese President Xi Jinping. The sharing of tea between the two world leaders was a symbol of the exchanges between civilizations and the values of harmony, respect and friendship that this social ritual implies. This seemingly simple act of sharing tea is something that takes place millions of times every day throughout the world. Tea, after all, is the world's most popular beverage after water. Tea also originated in China and is one of its most significant contributions to human civilization. The tea and context of the setting where the two leaders took their refreshment also celebrated Chinese civilization through music, art and aesthetics. Thus rather than a "clash of civilizations," the act of sharing tea can pave the way for a "confluence of civilizations".It doesn't matter if we are state leaders or ordinary folk, when we share tea we are opening ourselves up to the possibility of meaningful dialogue and exchange. This "civility" is indeed one of the hallmarks of "civilization".The Global Civilization Initiative was proposed by President Xi in March 2023. Through this initiative, and the related Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, China is outlining a plan for harmony and cooperation between civilizations. The Global Civilization Initiative advocates respect for the diversity of civilizations, the common values of humanity, the importance of inheritance and innovation of civilizations, and robust international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation.Tea is a part of the story of exchanges between civilizations. May 21 is marked by the United Nations as International Tea Day. This is a day set aside to celebrate the tea plant — Camellia sinensis — and the people whose livelihoods depend upon it and for everyone else who enjoys this most intoxicating elixir. It is, therefore, very appropriate that we take some time to consider the relationship between tea and civilization.With regards to art, literature and philosophy, tea has been a major inspiration for many artists in China and beyond. Lu Yu, a Chinese writer and tea master, completed the Classic of Tea during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Lu Yu's work is considered one of the earliest guides to tea cultivation, preparation and appreciation in Chinese history. The Classic of Tea is the beginning of what we might call a specific "tea civilization".Later this body of work and the refined practice of tea drinking became the famous Tea Ceremony or chanoyu of Japan. Tea also provided the fuel for creativity of many a great intellect beyond China. For example, Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) is an English writer best known for his influential literary works and his role in compiling one of the most comprehensive dictionaries of the English language. It is well known that Johnson was a ravenous imbiber of tea. Johnson's fondness for tea is evident in his writings, where he sometimes humorously remarked on the pleasures of tea drinking and the social atmosphere it fostered. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) is widely considered one of the most important figures in modern philosophy. He also made important contributions to what would become International Relations theory. His breakfast is recorded as consisting of "a cup of tea and a pipe of tobacco". As a mild stimulant and refreshing beverage, tea has played a positive role in shaping civilizational development and facilitating the exchanges between civilizations.Tea and humanity are also entangled in what we can refer to as an ecological civilization. The concept of ecological civilization, also a crucial component of the Global Civilization Initiative, reflects China's commitment to achieving sustainable development while preserving environmental quality and ensuring the well-being of present and future generations in China and beyond. In this regard, the World Heritage listed tea gardens of Jingmaishan in Southwest China's Yunnan province, represent valuable contributions to "tea civilization". Part of the value of these groves of ancient tea trees lies in the lessons they can share with the tea industry as it seeks ways to encourage resilient and sustainable tea cultivation practices that will help mitigate the challenge of climate change. These tea gardens represent a form of sustainable tea agroforestry that is the embodiment of the Chinese civilizational ideals of "harmony between nature and humanity" (tian ren he yi).Thus no matter how we define "civilization", either as the development of sophisticated knowledge, technology, art and literature, or more inclusively as those knowledge and practices that contribute to a sensitive and sustainable relationship between humanity and nature, we can see that tea has played a significant role. The Global Civilization Initiative advocates for the equal respect of all human civilizations. Tea as a form of ritualized shared experience is an excellent way for us to find the time to celebrate what we have in common and what makes us distinct. This is, in my view, precisely what President Xi and President Macron experienced when they took tea in Guangzhou in April 2023.As we celebrate International Tea Day in 2024, let's take the time express our gratitude for the tea plant and all those who work tirelessly to bring us the daily beverage that is the hallmark of a "tea civilization". Tea means "peace" and "harmony" between humanity and nature and between the diversity of human civilizations and cultures. Think about that when you next hold your cup of tea. Think about the breadth of human experience through tea. Like a tea seed that gives life to a tea tree, from little things big things grow.The writer is a professor of human geography in the Faculty of Geographical Science at Beijing Normal University.Patrick de Bana, a German choreographer, recently collaborated with Liaoning Ballet to present the neoclassical ballet Notre-Dame de Paris in Shenyang, Liaoning province."The art of ballet originated in the West and has a history of more than 300 years," said Qu Zijiao, artistic director and president of Liaoning Ballet. "Although the history of ballet in China is relatively short, this does not prevent our culture from spreading to the world. For example, in 2019, we brought Mulan to the international stage, and the response was enthusiastic and significant. In the same way, our Eight Women Cast into the River was praised in Russia."According to Qu, the artist's mission and responsibility are important, as they want to share China's stories with the world.The neoclassical ballet Notre-Dame de Paris is based on French writer Victor Hugo's novel of the same name. It has many derivatives, such as movies and musicals, which make it extremely difficult for latecomers to create their own version, Qu said."We invited Patrick to come to China to direct two plays. In terms of repertoire creation, performance market and talent training, we are all working on a dual track: while introducing world classics, we are also committed to originality," Qu said."I choreograph for two reasons. First, in order to chase and realize my personal dreams, I place my own visions and fantasies in my creations. The second is to open the door to the dream for the audience and stimulate their imagination," said Patrick de Bana.He added that Chinese culture is an indispensable source of inspiration for his creations, as it has accumulated a rich cultural heritage of 5,000 years."Five thousand years – the number itself is awe-inspiring, and the profound charm of Chinese culture is breathtaking. What I particularly appreciate is the elegant way of thinking that is embedded in Chinese culture. When I looked at calligraphy, I almost burst into tears, and I fell in love with the unique beauty of Chinese culture. It has unwavering strength, as sharp as a sword and as delicate as a feather. In my eyes, Chinese culture is poetic and very beautiful."Ballet has become a bridge between the hearts and minds of the Chinese and German peoples, a testimony of friendship."I think the future of the world lies in connecting, connecting through love, blending through beauty, communicating through art," Bana said.Ye Xinnan contributed to this story.China will have no choice but to take retaliatory measures against the European Union if the bloc continues its anti-subsidy investigations targeting Chinese companies, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU says.The CCCEU, which represents thousands of Chinese companies in the bloc, said on Saturday that China has "sufficient countermeasures at its disposal", citing insider sources on the issue.The message came after several Chinese companies withdrew from public procurement bids in the EU because of what are said to be unfairly targeted investigations under the EU's Foreign Subsidies Regulation, which took effect last year.The EU is investigating Chinese companies involved in wind turbines and has conducted unannounced raids against those in the security equipment sector. At the same time, an anti-subsidy investigation relating to Chinese-made electric vehicles is awaiting preliminary results in the coming weeks, the CCCEU said.The CCCEU quoted a blog article on Saturday by Yuyuan Tantian, which is run by the China Media Group, as saying, "The Chinese side has prepared ample countermeasures."The article said that given substantial subsidies in EU agriculture, European wine and dairy products may find themselves caught in the crossfire.The CCCEU said it considers the message "significant" and "feels compelled to share it with the press"."We urge the EU to refrain from implementing discriminatory measures in subsidy-related probes and to ensure that Chinese enterprises are provided with a fair business environment."Ding Chun, director of the Center for European Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said accusations by the EU against China of overcapacity are "unjust and unfair", and that demand for new energy vehicles in China and the world is growing rapidly.Call for solution"The two sides could find a reasonable solution to the issue in order to avoid a lose-lose scenario, such as a trade war, even though that solution may not seem optimal."On X, formerly Twitter, nuanced.nl, an account that focuses on China-EU related news, described the Chinese message as a "smart move and timing", given that EU elections are being held next month.Last week two companies investigated by the European Commission under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation withdrew from public bidding for the construction of a solar farm in Romania.One of the companies is a consortium between Enevo Group of Romania and Longi Solar Technologie GmbH, a German subsidiary of the Chinese solar panel maker Longi Green Energy Technology Co Ltd, and the other is composed of two subsidiaries of Shanghai Electric Group Co Ltd.The European Commission said last week that it took note of the withdrawal of the two companies and would close its in-depth investigation as a result.China's Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao said in Paris last month that China will support its EV makers in defending their rights and interests, adding that China's EV industry has helped greatly in global efforts to tackle climate change and the transition to a green and low-carbon world.Shi Yonghong, vice-president of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products, visited Brussels and other European capitals last month on behalf of Chinese EV makers.He said the European Commission's anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EV makers is "unfair, amounts to double standards and violates World Trade Organization rules".China's embassy in the United Kingdom reiterated Beijing's position ahead of an "inauguration" on Monday in the Taiwan region, and urged the British side to uphold the one-China principle."We urge the UK government to abide by the one-China principle, not to send anyone to Taiwan for the so-called inauguration ceremony, not to allow relevant personnel from Taiwan to visit the UK, and not to have any official contact with Taiwan in any way," Minister Yang Xiaoguang said at a news briefing at the embassy in London on Friday.Yang briefed members of the Chinese and UK media, including journalists from The Guardian and Sky News, on the one-China principle, which was affirmed in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971 and that states that there is but one China in the world. Taiwan is part of China. And the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China.Yang told members of the media that, despite Taiwan having being lost and regained twice in history, first to colonization by the Netherlands in the 17th century and then to occupation by the Japanese during World War II, the island has been an inalienable part of China's territory since ancient times."Since 1949, due to the continued civil war in China and the meddling of external forces, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have fallen into a protracted political confrontation. However, China's sovereignty and territory have never and can never be divided," Yang said.The 1972 joint communique between China and the UK recognized that Taiwan is a province within the People's Republic of China, and recognized the government of the PRC as the sole legal government of China."This part of history should never be forgotten. The Taiwan question is a major matter of principle. The UK must uphold the principle and abide by its own commitment," said Yang, who added that the purpose of the "inauguration" is to sabotage relations between relevant countries and China, expand Taiwan's so-called international space, and advance Taiwan independence separatist activities.Noting that UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron congratulated Lai Ching-te in January following what was called his victory in leadership elections in Taiwan, Yang said: "We firmly oppose the wrong remarks and actions by British politicians. We must point out that the Taiwan issue is purely China's internal affair … We think that, no matter which party is in a governing position in Taiwan, it has to abide by the 1992 Consensus and oppose Taiwan independence … And we think that compatriots from both sides should join hands together to promote the reunification of the country and to achieve national rejuvenation." BAKU - Shen Yueyue, vice chairperson of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, met with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev during a friendly visit to the country from Tuesday to Thursday.During her talks with Aliyev, Shen, who is also chairperson of the Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation Commission of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), noted that under the strategic leadership of the presidents of the two countries, the friendly and cooperative partnership between China and Azerbaijan continues to thrive with fruitful outcomes.China is ready to implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state, enhance the alignment of high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative with Azerbaijan's Revival of the Silk Road national development strategy, expand cooperation in various fields, increase people-to-people exchanges, and elevate bilateral relations to new heights, said Shen, who was leading a Chinese delegation to visit Azerbaijan at the invitation of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan.For his part, Aliyev said that the Azerbaijan-China relationship is progressively advancing. Azerbaijan abides by the one-China principle, supports China in safeguarding its territorial integrity, and is ready to strengthen cooperation with China on the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, green development, and SCO civil exchanges.During the visit, Shen also held talks with Ali Huseynli, first deputy chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. HARBIN -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday visited Harbin Institute of Technology in northeast China's Heilongjiang province and met with students and faculty at the university.Harbin Institute of Technology carries out extensive scientific and educational cooperation with well-known Russian universities.Putin said in his speech that the cooperation between Russian and Chinese universities provides excellent learning opportunities for young people in both countries, and also deepens mutual understanding between the two peoples.Russia is willing to continue strengthening cooperation with China to provide more platforms for exchanges and mutual learning for young people in both countries, he added.Putin added that as the fields of cooperation between Russia and China become wider, more and more talents who understand both languages and are proficient in professional fields are needed.HARBIN -- Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the opening ceremony of the 8th China-Russia Expo in Harbin, Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, on Friday.Han also read out Chinese President Xi Jinping's congratulatory letter to the expo and made a speech at the opening ceremony.Han said that President Xi and President Putin met in Beijing on Thursday and jointly drew a new vision and blueprint for the development of China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era.This year marks the 75th anniversary of China-Russia diplomatic relations, Han said, noting that China and Russia have deepened political mutual trust and achieved fruitful economic and trade cooperation.In 2023, the trade volume between China and Russia reached a record $240.1 billion, and China has been Russia's largest trading partner for 14 consecutive years. The scale of two-way investment continues to grow, and cooperation on major projects in energy, chemical industry, aerospace and connectivity has made steady progress, said Han.Two dancers from Liaoning Ballet, Zhang Haidong and Sun Huixin, along with the Chinese ballet company's president and artistic director Qu Zijiao, will travel to Moscow, Russia, from June 23 to 27 and attend the award ceremony of Benois de la Danse, a prestigious international ballet prize also known as the "Ballet Oscars"."It's a great honor to attend the event, and we will bring one of our best ballet pieces to the audiences in Moscow," said Qu, who will serve as one of the jury members this year."We have built up a long friendship with Russian artists and audiences with a number of cultural exchange programs and performances. This upcoming event will bring Chinese dancers to Russia, showcasing one of our ballet pieces," she added.Zhang, a principal dancer of Liaoning Ballet, and Sun, a ballerina of the company, will perform at Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre an excerpt from the neoclassical ballet piece, Notre Dame de Paris, which is choreographed by German-Nigerian choreographer Patrick de Bana.The ballet piece, based on Victor Hugo's novel of the same title and commissioned by Liaoning Ballet, premiered at the Liaoning Grand Theater in October.Liaoning Ballet, one of the best-known ballet companies in China, which was founded in 1980, has frequently performed in Russia and gained a wide fan base, according to Qu.From Feb 20 to 25, it presented two of its productions — Sundial, choreographed by Ao Dingwen, a principal dancer of Liaoning Ballet, and Notre Dame de Parisin Vladivostok, a seaport in southeastern Russia."Tickets for our five shows in Russia (in February) sold out fast. We not only staged a piece by a Western choreographer but also an original Chinese ballet work, and both received warm feedback from the audiences," Qu said."We want to have more opportunities to showcase Chinese ballet in Russia," she added.The Benois de la Danse prizes are awarded annually for the most prominent accomplishments in the ballet world during the previous year. The competition was launched in 1991 in Moscow by the International Dance Association — now called the International Choreography Union — and the awards were presented for the first time the same year on the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre.Every year, the event gathers an international jury comprising prominent choreographers, heads of the largest ballet companies, outstanding dancers and famous ballet teachers. The jury members make nominations and, after conducting assessments through the year, determine the winners.Last year, Qiu Yunting, one of the principal dancers of the National Ballet of China, won the Best Female Dancer award at the Benois de la Danse.Wu Yong in Shenyang contributed to this story.chennan@chinadaily.com.cnRussian President Vladimir Putin's decision to choose China as the destination of his first overseas visit after beginning his new term of office 10 days ago shows the strength of Sino-Russian ties as well as his close personal relations with the Chinese leadership, Russian experts have said.Upon the Kremlin's declaration of Putin's state visit to China, a diverse array of reasons were cited by Russian observers.China is Russia's most important strategic partner, and their relations are evolving dynamically and across multiple layers encompassing the political, economic and cultural domains, said Sergey Suverov, an associate professor at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation.In 2023, trade between the two neighboring countries surged 26.3 percent, hitting a record high of $240.1 billion, Suverov said, adding that energy ties between the two nations are rapidly advancing, with Russia serving as a key provider of energy resources to China, alongside a reciprocal exchange of technology between the two sides."Putin's visit will give further impetus to relations, particularly in energy and finance, resolve cooperation issues and establish new cooperation frameworks," Suverov said.Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that Putin's visit to China was a clear and logical decision, because China has emerged as Russia's paramount partner.Gabuev said that the Chinese yuan has surpassed the US dollar and the euro as the primary currency for trade between the two neighbors, solidifying its position as the most exchanged currency on the Moscow stock exchange and the preferred choice for savings.Furthermore, he highlighted the cooperation between Russian scientists and Chinese enterprises, particularly in areas such as space exploration, artificial intelligence and biotechnology.Oleg Timofeev, an associate professor at Russia's RUDN University, said that Russian-Chinese economic ties have reached a record high, referring to the most recent data indicating that bilateral trade increased by almost 5 percent year-on-year in the first four months of 2024.According to Timofeev, talks on economic, energy and innovation collaboration will take place during Putin's visit, since the Russian delegation comprises five deputy prime ministers, the foreign and defense ministers and heads of economic departments, as well as the CEOs of Russian state corporations from the nuclear, aeronautics, railway, nanotechnology and oil and gas sectors.The comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, established in 2019, elevated the relationship between the two nations to the pinnacle of bilateral ties, experts said.Timofeev said that "strategic coordination" shows that the two countries intend to assume a greater and more important historical responsibility for the future of the world.Experts also pointed out that the enduring personal friendship between President Xi Jinping and Putin over many years can often result in various symbolic gestures that hold significant diplomatic importance.The two presidents have met on over 40 occasions in the past 10 years, both in person and virtually, surpassing all other leaders in frequency. They exchange birthday wishes and affectionately address each other as "old" or "dear" friends.Timofeev recalled that over a decade ago, in 2013, President Xi chose Russia as the destination for his first state visit as China's head of state, a choice he repeated in March last year.Putin's prompt visit to China, 10 days after his inauguration, appears to be a reciprocal gesture for one of his best friends among world leaders, Timofeev added.Every Sunday, Chinese-language tutor Kirill Burobin starts work early in the morning and remains busy until midnight.Burobin said the number of his students has tripled over the past year."Sunday is the busiest," said the 20-year-old, who added that he makes a good living teaching online lessons. "I have 16 hours of virtual classes without a break."The surge in demand for Chinese lessons in Russia reflects the nation's shift toward the East as tensions escalate between Moscow and the West.And with President Vladimir Putin's two-day visit to China, which began on Thursday and is his first trip abroad during his new term of office, Russia also aims to elevate the two countries' comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, experts said.Amid multiple rounds of Western sanctions, Russia seeks to strengthen ties with China for its economic and technological development, they said.Natalia Danina, a manager at HeadHunter, Russia's leading online recruitment company, said there were almost 11,000 job openings last year requiring proficiency in Chinese, a 44 percent increase from 2021.Over the same period, the number of jobs for Chinese speakers in Russia has doubled in the areas of sales, transportation and logistics, she said, noting an "accelerated transition" to Chinese-made equipment and spare parts.Furthermore, the need for Chinese speakers in energy-related positions has tripled, Danina said.Cao Shihai, minister-counselor of education at the Chinese embassy in Russia, said that educational and cultural exchanges have emerged as a crucial component of bilateral relations, playing an irreplaceable role in fostering mutual trust and friendship among the people of both countries.Universities and other educational institutions in China and Russia have entered into over 3,000 agreements and formed 13 university alliances, encompassing more than 800 universities, he said.With the rising popularity of language learning, approximately 120,000 Chinese students are studying Russian, while the number of Russian students learning Chinese has reached 113,000. Moreover, 150 universities and nearly 200 high schools have introduced Chinese-language classes, Cao added.Burobin, who is also studying Eastern civilizations at a top Moscow university, said he was happy to help his students learn more about "a whole new world"."Russians are taking up Chinese because Beijing has been our main partner for decades," he said. "And this is just the beginning."Alina Khamlova, 26, who teaches English and Chinese, said she had only three English-language students this year, compared with 12 who are learning Chinese.One of her students is Maria, a 22-year-old designer who dreams of traveling to China to make clothes because it would be "cheaper than in Russia".Khamlova also said many young people in Russia hope to study at Chinese universities.Meanwhile, the Russian-Chinese International School is set to launch in Moscow in the fall. The school is now recruiting and has received numerous inquiries from Russian parents eager for their children to master the Chinese language.Wu Hao, headmaster of the school, said: "With Putin's visit to China underway, the demand for Russian professionals proficient in Chinese is expected to rise. Learning Chinese has become a strong trend among youngsters in Russia."Together with nearly 1,000 audience members from both countries, President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin enjoyed a concert in Beijing on Thursday afternoon, marking a high point of the first day of Putin's two-day state visit to China.The concert, presented by Chinese and Russian musicians with instruments such as China's erhu, a two-stringed, bowed instrument, and Russia's bayan, a button accordion, was also the opening ceremony for the 2024-25 China-Russia Years of Culture.Speaking at the opening ceremony, Xi said it has been a good tradition for China and Russia to designate national theme years in each other's countries for people-to-people exchanges. As a highlight in the history of developing bilateral relations, the theme year is widely welcomed by the people of both countries, he said.Xi also said the variety of events and programs will help further unleash the potential for cultural cooperation between the two countries and create a new future for their cultural exchanges."It is believed that the China-Russia Years of Culture will inject new momentum for carrying forward the China-Russia friendship and bringing the two peoples closer with mutual understanding," he said.Putin, who delivered a large part of his speech with no pause for translation, said he felt so at ease in China that he forgot that not everyone present understood Russian.He said that in his country, the interest in Chinese culture is growing stronger.This is reflected not only by the fact that more people prefer to decorate in Chinese style, but also in their strong desire to learn about Chinese architectural design, their enthusiasm for learning Chinese language, studying Chinese tea culture and learning Chinese porcelain-making techniques, and their starting to practice martial arts, he said."I deeply believe that the two countries will, in the spirit of brotherhood, work together to strive for solid progress in deepening our partnership," Putin said.Fedor Guryev, a senior student majoring in flight vehicle design and engineering at Beihang University in Beijing, said in fluent Chinese that he was excited during the concert to hear the artists skillfully blending the Russian song Moscow Nights with China's Song of Horse Herding."It was so interesting," said Guryev, who is also the head of an association of Russian students in China.During the 2024-25 China-Russia Years of Culture, residents in 51 Chinese cities and 38 Russian cities will be able to appreciate more than 230 art events, such as film festivals and exhibitions, at their doorsteps.mojingxi@chinadaily.com.cnChinese President Xi Jinping's visit to France is of immense significance in strengthening the "special relationship" between China and France, positioning Sino-French relations as a leading force in Beijing's engagement with Western nations, according to experts.Former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin underscored the profound importance of Xi's visit to France, particularly in the context of the uncertain global geopolitical landscape."I think that France is the No 1 country in Europe that tries to understand what the Chinese strategy is," he said. "It's very clear that this visit is a reason of proudness for us, because we are probably the country who has the best discussions with China."Raffarin said: "While it is true that we may have differences, our aim is to engage in discussions that revolve around common topics and allow us to choose between confrontation and cooperation. As friends, we choose cooperation. In Europe, I believe that France is one of the countries that maintain a close relationship with China, despite having different perspectives. However, we also share a common vision for a reasonable and multilateral world."Li Zhipeng, a researcher at the University of Poitiers and the National Center for Scientific Research in France, said: "President Xi's visit to France is of great significance in strengthening and consolidating the 'special relationship' between China and France and leading Sino-French relations to the forefront of China's relations with Western countries."Commemorating the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties, Li emphasized that the visit would not only enhance political mutual trust between China and France but also promote all-round exchanges and cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, culture and education between the two countries, which will generate tremendous energy for China and France and influence the direction of world civilization.Special invitationDuring Xi's three-day visit, he received a special invitation from French President Emmanuel Macron to visit the Tourmalet — a pass in the Pyrenees mountains that is dear to Macron as he enjoyed visiting his grandmother there when he was a child."Such a family-like invitation is only extended to special friends. President Xi is the only foreign head of state who has received such special treatment from President Macron in France," Li said. "Therefore, we have reason to believe that the Sino-French relationship under the new era is like this special relationship, and will develop toward a more intimate and long-term stable relationship."Mario Cavolo, a longtime China observer and nonresident senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, noted that Xi's visit to Europe after a five-year interval sends a clear message to the world. "It demonstrates China's commitment to continued engagement and its vision of a peaceful multipolar world," he said.President Xi Jinping will roll out the red carpet for Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, as the latter is set to arrive in Beijing for a state visit to China amid high expectations that the two countries will renew their cooperation and coordination for economic growth and global stability.Ahead of the two-day visit, Putin highlighted the sound development of Russia-China relations in a written interview with Xinhua News Agency, saying, "Russia-China relations have reached the highest level ever, and despite the difficult global situation, continue to get stronger."The relationship "has always relied on the principles of equality and trust, mutual respect for the sovereignty and consideration of each other's interests", he said.Putin recalled his interactions with President Xi in the past decade or so, during which, they have met more than 40 times in various bilateral and multilateral settings."President Xi maintains a respectful, friendly, open and at the same time business-like style of communication. Our every meeting is not just a dialogue between old friends, which is important, too, just like for everyone, but also a fruitful exchange of views on the most topical issues on the bilateral and international agenda," he said.The Russian president emphasized that Russia-China ties are free from the influence of either ideology or political trends. Their multidimensional development is an informed strategic choice based on the wide convergence of core national interests, profound mutual trust, strong public support and the genuine friendship between the peoples of the two countries, he said.In the past five years, trade between the two countries has doubled, he noted, saying that China has been Russia's largest trading partner for 13 consecutive years, and in 2023, Russia ranked fourth among China's trading partners."We are working to contribute to the development and prosperity of Russia and China by enhancing equal, mutually beneficial economic and humanitarian cooperation, and strengthen foreign policy coordination in the interests of building a just multipolar world order," he added.Putin's visit, his first foreign trip since he was sworn in for a fifth term as Russian president on May 7, mirrors Xi's state visit to Russia in March 2023, when Xi chose Russia for his first visit to a foreign country after being elected as Chinese president at the first session of the 14th National People's Congress.Putin's visit also comes against the backdrop of the protracted Ukraine crisis. During the interview, he said that Russia is seeking a comprehensive, sustainable and just settlement of this conflict through peaceful means.Putin commended China's proposals to resolve the crisis, and said that Beijing proposes practicable and constructive steps to achieve peace by refraining from pursuing vested interests and constant escalation of tensions, and minimizing the negative impact of the conflict on the global economy and the stability of global value chains."They could therefore lay the groundwork for a political and diplomatic process that would take into account Russia's security concerns and contribute to achieving a long-term and sustainable peace," he said. "Unfortunately, neither Ukraine nor its Western patrons support these initiatives."caodesheng@chinadaily.com.cnRussian President Vladimir Putin will pay a state visit to China from Thursday to Friday, the first foreign trip since he was sworn in for his fifth term as Russian president on May 7.During the upcoming visit, President Xi Jinping will exchange views with Putin on bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields as well as on international and regional issues of common interest in the context of the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and Russia, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday.The Kremlin press service said in a statement on Tuesday that the two presidents will outline priorities for further practical cooperation between the two countries and have an in-depth exchange of views on the most pressing international and regional issues.Following their talks, the two presidents are expected to sign a joint statement and several bilateral documents, the statement said.Xi and Putin will attend a gala event marking 75 years of diplomatic relations and the opening of the 2024-25 Russia-China Years of Culture, it said.The statement also said that the programme of Putin's visit includes a meeting with Premier Li Qiang, during which both sides will discuss bilateral cooperation in trade, the economy and humanitarian affairs.Putin is also expected to visit Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, where he will attend the opening of the 8th China-Russia Expo and the 4th China-Russia Forum on Interregional Cooperation, it said, adding that Putin will also meet with the students and faculty of Harbin Institute of Technology.The visit comes as both China and Russia have committed to enhance bilateral ties, which have been guided by head-of-state diplomacy.Zhang Hanhui, Chinese ambassador to Russia, said that head-of-state diplomacy is the fundamental guarantee for China-Russia relations to move forward smoothly and steadily.The leaders of the two countries have agreed to continue to maintain close communication, engaging in in-depth exchanges on China-Russia relations and strategic issues of mutual concern, Zhang said in an interview with Russia's RT News.He described Putin as "an old friend" of Xi and the Chinese people, saying that China welcomed the Russian president to pay a state visit to China after assuming office.In March last year, Xi, after being elected as Chinese president at the first session of the 14th National People's Congress, chose Russia as his first visit to a foreign country, which the ambassador said fully demonstrated the high level and special nature of the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination between China and Russia for the new era.As permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, China and Russia closely coordinate on the international stage and jointly uphold true multilateralism, which is beneficial for safeguarding security in the Eurasian region and global strategic stability, Zhang said.China-Russia economic and trade cooperation made a historic breakthrough in 2023 amid the slow global recovery. Bilateral trade reached a record $240 billion in 2023, achieving the established trade target of $200 billion ahead of schedule.In the first quarter of this year, bilateral trade between China and Russia reached $56.8 billion, a year-on-year increase of 5.2 percent, according to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce. The trade structure continues to improve, with strong cooperation trends in emerging areas such as service trade and cross-border e-commerce. Key projects, including the China-Russia crude oil pipeline, are making steady progress.Speaking at a news conference on May 7, Liu Xuesong, director of the Department of Eurasia Affairs at the Ministry of Commerce, said that efforts will be made to further enhance China-Russia trade and investment cooperation, bolster the resilience of industrial and supply chains, and foster a favorable environment for expanding bilateral trade.BEIJING -- At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin will pay a state visit to China from May 16 to 17, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Tuesday.This is Putin's first state visit after he was sworn in as Russian president for a new term, Wang Wenbin, another foreign ministry spokesperson, told a regular press briefing.As this year marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, during the visit, Xi and Putin will exchange views on bilateral relations, cooperation in various fields, and international and regional issues of common concern, Wang said.He added that China will release relevant information on this visit in a timely manner.BRUSSELS -- An exhibition on a collection of Chinese traditional Qipao dress and Shanghai culture will be open to the public from May 14 to Sept 5 in Brussels.The "Elegance and Style: Qipao and Shanghai Culture" exhibition launched at the China Cultural Center in Brussels will showcase more than 30 Qipao styles from the collection of the Shanghai City History Museum."By displaying different kinds of Qipao as well as photos and other exhibits, the exhibition presents the latest achievements in the protection, inheritance and innovative development of China's intangible cultural heritage represented by Shanghai-style Qipao, the perfect fusion of the classic and fashion along the course of time, and the unique charm of the city of Shanghai," Wu Gang, charge d'affaires a.i. of the Embassy of China in Belgium, said at the opening ceremony Monday.Organized by the Shanghai City History Museum, the exhibition demonstrates the evolution of the iconic traditional Chinese dress and its importance in Chinese culture.Zhou Qunhua, director of the Shanghai History Museum, said he hopes the exhibition will help strengthen friendship and cooperation between China and Belgium.More than 100 guests, including Belgian residents and visitors from other countries, attended the opening ceremony. Several guests told Xinhua they were impressed by the finesse of the embroidery and patterns decorating the Qipao, and the way these dresses highlight the grace and femininity of women.The Qipao, also known as the cheongsam, is a fitted silk or satin dress, often slit on the sides and featuring a mandarin collar.China decided last week to extend the short-stay visa-exemption policy for citizens of 12 countries, of which 11 are European nations, to the end of 2025. This extension underscores the prospects of China-Europe engagement in the years ahead and will bring a fresh wave of European tourists to China, analysts said.The nation announced a visa-free policy for five European countries-France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain — from Dec 1 of last year to Nov 30 this year, with people from these countries allowed to stay on the mainland for up to 15 days for business, tourism, family trips or transit without a visa.The visa-free policy was then extended to another six European countries: Switzerland, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg, from March 14 to Nov 30 to further boost inbound tourism.During his visit to France last week, President Xi Jinping said that China welcomes visits by more people from France, and will extend the short-stay visa-exemption policy for citizens from 12 countries, including France, to the end of 2025."The recent extension of both the time limit and the list of countries brings a positive outlook for the long run. It alleviates concerns among European stakeholders regarding the policy's duration," said Peng Han, chief analyst for tourism media company Travel Daily.Travel Daily data shows that the total number of inbound tourists from visa-exempt countries in Southeast Asia such as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand increased by about 2.5-fold year-on-year during the Labor Day holiday. In contrast, inbound tourism from Europe as of this year stood at only 30 percent of 2019 figures.According to Peng, European operators typically formulate outbound tourism plans for the following year in June and July, and decisions on whether to engage with Chinese products hinge on whether they receive a clear answer in time."Will China's visa-free policy for European countries continue next year, or will it be discontinued? The industry has been keeping an eye on long-term China-Europe relations and the continuity of the visa policy," he said.He added that now that China has given a clear answer on opening its door to Europe through successive policies, it signals to the world the promise of a prosperous future.Although there has not been a sharp rise in the number of European tour groups coming to China till now, the number of independent travelers indicates the upside of the visa-free policy.Ctrip data said that on March 14 alone, when the visa-free rules took effect, the number of inbound tourism orders from the six newly-added countries more than doubled compared with last year. The number of orders from Belgium, Hungary and Switzerland tripled.According to data from tour operator Tongcheng Travel, flight bookings to China from European countries on the first visa-exemption list have shown remarkable growth. Since April, there has been a year-on-year increase of over 150 percent in bookings from France, a 110 percent increase from Germany, and nearly double the growth from Italy.According to the National Immigration Administration, more than 170,000 international visitors entered China visa-free through Shanghai Pudong International Airport in the first quarter of this year, showing an increase of 23.6 percent year-on-year.Shanghai, one of the top destinations for European tourists, has prepared itself for a surge in inbound tourism."The resumption of international flights, the visa-free policy, and the full recovery of business at Shanghai International Cruise Home Port will contribute to the number of inbound tourists arriving in Shanghai, especially free independent travelers," said Zhou Weihong, deputy general manager of Spring Tour, a travel company in Shanghai.To accommodate the sudden increase of independent tourists after the implementation of the visa-free policy, tour agencies have designed personalized mini-tour products and city walks in Shanghai. They have also established tourism itineraries covering Shanghai, the Yangtze River Delta and other cities, Zhou said.Voices from visitorsDavid Huang, a French national who studied at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, and who now works for a French chocolate company in Beijing, said that he has applied for both student and work visas in the past."The student visa requires at least two months of preparations, including submitting various documents. I also spent more than two months preparing for my work visa after graduating from UIBE.My French friends have heard about the visa-free access, and it is indeed a positive change," he said.Young French travelers avoid countries that have lengthy visa application procedures, he said, adding that being on a limited budget, paying for airfare only to have a visa application rejected makes little financial sense for them."My colleagues in global companies find it much simpler to travel. When organizing events that require inviting foreign guests, we shouldn't have to worry about visa processing time. Two-week visa-free access allows people to explore business opportunities in China."Laura Carbonell, a sales manager in Toledo, which is about 75 kilometers away from the Spanish capital Madrid, said she visited China in November before the visa-free policy was introduced. Even something like how far away an embassy or consulate is from a potential visa applicant's home can influence their travel decisions, she said."I really wanted to visit China to enjoy its culture and scenery. However, Spain has only two diplomatic missions, the embassy in Madrid and a consulate in Barcelona. People like me who reside in other cities are forced to travel long distances to apply for a visa."For European countries not on the visa-free list, the application procedures have been streamlined. China has been simplifying its entry visa procedures worldwide, including canceling appointment requirements and fingerprints for qualified applicants temporarily. Visa fees for travel to China before December from all countries have also been cut by 25 percent, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The Chinese embassy in Washington announced the simplification of the tourist visa application process for United States citizens starting from January 1 this year. US citizens can now enter China for tourism purpose without providing roundtrip air tickets, hotel reservations, itineraries and an invitation letter."From the implementation of the visa-free policy for six European countries to recent high-level meetings on optimizing inbound tourism payment services, the future looks promising," Peng of Travel Daily said. "The revival of inbound tourism to its previous peak may simply be a matter of time."While China is sending clear signals of openness, political factors in the West are casting a shadow over cross-border travel. In March the US said it is "taking steps to impose new visa restrictions on multiple Hong Kong officials", without elaborating on the visa measures or the officials targeted.Last July the US issued a travel warning against China, advising US citizens to "reconsider" whether to travel to the country for "the risk of wrongful detention". Furthermore, the US has long restricted visa applications for Chinese students for "national security" reasons.The US narrative has had a significant impact on biased perceptions about China in Europe, the US and other countries, said tourism analysts."Our travel agencies agree that a trip to China is the best remedy. When European tourists actually visit China, most of them will revise their preconceptions," Peng said."With China opening its door, a firsthand experience will expose the falsehoods spread by some Western media."Kuang Hanying contributed to this story.President Xi Jinping's six-day trip to Europe has opened new chapters of relationships with China's key partners, and the visit heralds a new era of ties with Europe through enhanced solidarity, mutual trust and confidence, according to senior diplomats and analysts.Xi's recently concluded tour of France, Serbia and Hungary, which included over 30 diplomatic engagements with leaders of the three countries between May 5 and 10, was a resounding success, with implications and significance far beyond the bilateral level, they said.In France, the president's visit set the stage for reaffirming a longstanding partnership.Beijing and Paris signed 18 bilateral cooperation documents in areas such as green development, aviation, agrifood, commerce and people-to-people exchanges.In an interview with reporters after the visit concluded, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that Xi and French President Emmanuel Macron had reached a host of key consensuses on developing bilateral relations, while agreeing to consolidate the strategic stability of bilateral ties and tap the broad potential of mutually beneficial cooperation.Interactions between the two heads of state at Tourmalet — a pass in the Pyrenees mountains that is dear to President Macron because he enjoyed visiting his grandmother there when he was a child — marked a major highlight of Xi's France trip.Wang said the extended talks in the Pyrenees added another memorable chapter to the exchanges between the leaders of China and France.The Chinese president's trip to Serbian capital Belgrade and Hungarian capital Budapest cemented the elevation of ties with two of China's key European partners. This was underpinned by a host of bilateral agreements to build up economic, trade and people-to-people exchanges.In Belgrade, Xi and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic signed a joint statement on building a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, while China unveiled six major steps to support the move, including a free trade agreement and the opening of more direct flights.A landmark moment of the trip was the gathering of around 20,000 people in front of the Palace of Serbia to greet the Chinese president, with the crowds waving the flags of the two nations and cheering for China.The moment "evoked a keen feeling on the genuine sentiment of the Serbian people toward the Chinese people and their profound respect for President Xi", Wang said.In Budapest, the traditional friendship was harnessed as the two nations pledged to build an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership for the new era.Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the visit as "a milestone in bilateral relations", saying that the elevation of bilateral ties reflected the rightfulness of the nation's China policy."We are very happy with the Chinese investments in Hungary. We encourage more to come because they're modern, state-of-the-art investments which create a lot of jobs. This is good for our national economy, good for our people and our families," he said.Szijjarto said that Hungary, which will hold the rotating presidency of the European Union starting on July 1, rejects the approach of "de-risking" or decoupling."We do not consider China as a threat. We don't want the world to be divided into two blocs again. We want connectivity to come," he said, adding that his country will advocate basing EU-China relations on mutual respect."Hungary is the best example showing what kind of benefits you can get out of respectful cooperation with China," he said."If we had not encouraged these Chinese companies to (come to) Hungary, and if we had represented these decoupling types of approach, we would have tens of thousands fewer jobs," he said.Wang and analysts have also stressed the significance of the trip for China-EU relations, as Xi has appealed to the EU for collective efforts in adhering to dialogue and cooperation, deepening strategic communication and enhancing strategic mutual trust. He also rejected rhetoric about China's "overcapacity", using facts and numbers.Feng Zhongping, director of the Institute of European Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that Xi's trip to Europe has strengthened expectations for the stability of China-EU relations."The enhancing of pragmatic cooperation between China and the three countries showcased the potential for stronger trade and economic ties with other European nations," he said.Feng described the joint statement between China and France on the situation in the Middle East as another highlight, adding that the two nations have demonstrated solidarity in their shared appeals for the cessation of hostilities during the upcoming Paris Olympics.Jack Midgley, principal of the global consultancy Midgley & Co, said that agreements on the Belt and Road Initiative and electric vehicles, including France indicating that it would welcome China's EV giant BYD, were among the most important outcomes of Xi's trip.Midgley, who is also an adjunct associate professor in the security studies program at Georgetown University in Washington, said all these results were achieved in "a bilateral way" rather than through the bureaucracy of the EU."This is the way to do constructive relationships," he said. "You do them bilaterally, on the basis of shared interest."Yifan Xu in Washington contributed to this story.BEIJING -- Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Sunday congratulated his Russian counterpart, Mikhail Mishustin, on reassuming office as prime minister.In his message, Li said that under the strategic guidance of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era has maintained healthy and stable development.Political mutual trust between the two countries has continuously deepened, mutually beneficial cooperation has advanced in an orderly manner, and people-to-people exchanges have become increasingly frequent, which has brought tangible benefits to the two countries and their people, Li said.Li said he is ready to continue to work with Prime Minister Mishustin to make new contributions to enriching the connotation of China-Russia relations and strengthening practical cooperation between the two countries.After spending several days training with elite soccer coaches from Serbia, 13-year-old sixth-grader Zhao Chenqi can dream of becoming the next Lionel Messi or Christiano Ronaldo.Eight coaches from Serbia's Red Star Belgrade soccer club arrived recently in Shenyang, Liaoning province, to begin a yearlong effort to help improve the technical ability and competitiveness of young soccer players in the city."The coaches from Red Star bring advanced concepts and professional training methods," said Zhao, who attends Northeast Yucai School in Shenyang. "I believe the training will greatly improve my soccer skills."Zhao began playing soccer at age 5. He has won several championships at different levels of competition and was chosen to participate in the Red Star training courses through a rigorous selection process."The foreign coaches are very strict in the details of the training, but they constantly encourage every athlete to improve," he said. "I hope I get a chance to participate in the World Cup someday and win glory for my country."Djordje Cirkovic, the club's head coach, was deeply impressed by the city when he attended the 2023 Shenyang Peace Cup International Juvenile Soccer Tournament in August."The charm of this beautiful city left a deep impression on me, and my team and I are very willing to work here," he said."During the tournament, I also gained a more direct understanding of the level of youth soccer in Shenyang. This time, I hope to bring the advanced training philosophy of our club to help improve the skills of Shenyang's youth."To promote the development of soccer in Shenyang, the city's sports bureau formed a special team that conducted research in Serbia last year. It gained a detailed understanding of the Serbian development process, training methods and sports culture and had in-depth discussions about cooperation with Red Star Belgrade. The club appointed eight coaches with rich teaching experience and unique insights for cultivating young players.In the coming year, the coaching team will settle in at Shenyang Sports School and select key schools to conduct daily youth soccer training. The coaches will be mainly responsible for organizing boys' soccer teams in Shenyang in various age groups — under 17, under 15, under 13, under 11 and under 9. They will develop training plans for each group and participate in various competitions.They will also train local soccer coaches.Song Li, director of Shenyang Sports Bureau, said the Serbian coaches will introduce advanced soccer training concepts that will improve the youth training system."Over the coming year, the foreign coaches will work closely with Chinese coaches," she said. "We are looking forward to using soccer as a bridge and bond for strengthening international sports exchanges through high-quality international events that will enhance the city's image and influence."The Serbian coaches are expected to attract more young soccer enthusiasts in the city. More than 300 will receive professional training.Chinese and Hungarian media organizations held an event on Wednesday in Budapest to further consolidate people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.The event was jointly hosted by China Media Group and the Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund of Hungary to celebrate the 75th anniversary of China-Hungary diplomatic ties, the China Global Television Network reported.Several projects, including the broadcasting of CMG's programs in Hungary, the co-production of documentaries and CMG's cooperation with the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music, were launched at the event, according to the report.Participants praised the outcomes of the bilateral cultural exchanges.Former Hungarian president Pal Schmitt said China and Hungary have trusted and supported each other over the past 75 years.Schmitt, a Hungarian member of the International Olympic Committee and a former Olympic champion, said he is pleased to see that China is becoming more and more influential in the field of sports.The former president said he looks forward to CMG contributing more to the friendly ties between the two countries and bringing the two peoples closer to each other.Former Hungarian prime minister Peter Medgyessy, who delivered a video speech at the event, said the traditional friendship between China and Hungary has become ever stronger with the passage of time.The bilateral ties have seen unprecedented development in recent years, Medgyessy said, adding that he believes that media cooperation between the two countries will promote mutual understanding and affinity between their peoples.Shen Haixiong, vice-minister of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and president of CMG, said Hungary is China's good friend and an old friend in Europe.CMG has conducted extensive and in-depth cooperation with the Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund of Hungary, as well as with Hungarian media, Shen said.An agreement to promote friendly cooperation between China's Giant Panda National Park and the Pyrenees National Park in France was recently reached by the National Forestry and Grassland Administration and the French Biodiversity Agency, the administration has announced.The two countries will carry out practical cooperation in the fields of biodiversity monitoring, flagship species protection and population recovery, community co-management, science popularization and education, personnel training and other areas, the administration, which is also the National Park Administration, said in a news release on Wednesday.The news was announced after President Xi Jinping concluded his visit to France. Four statements, including one on strengthening biodiversity and ocean cooperation between China and France, were released during the visit.The National Forestry and Grassland Administration said that in recent years, China and France have conducted close exchanges and cooperation in the field of nature conservation, especially in the construction of national park systems.In June last year, the two countries jointly held a "China-France national park system dialogue" activity in Wuyishan National Park, which spans Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, to explore and improve the management models and operation methods of national parks in both countries.Last month, the administration and the French Biodiversity Agency held an online meeting to promote the work of pairing up between the Giant Panda National Park and the Pyrenees National Park.The administration said the Giant Panda National Park, which spans Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, connects 13 ecological corridors of the giant panda population, protects over 70 percent of wild giant pandas, and has global conservation significance and research value.The region where the park is located is also a hot spot for global biodiversity, with nationally protected wildlife such as snow leopards and Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkeys, as well as redwood and ginkgo trees, the administration said.The Pyrenees National Park in France was established in 1967 and is the third national park in the country. The park stretches 100 kilometers along the border between France and Spain, serving as a climatic barrier between the Pyrenees Mountains and the Mediterranean.The park is home to around 2,500 species of plants, accounting for more than 40 percent of the native plant species in France.yandongjie@chinadaily.com.cn China's electric vehicle battery maker CATL's massive investment project is forging ahead on schedule, according to the company's executives in Budapest.CATL, or Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd, announced its 7.6-billion-euro ($8.2 billion) investment in Hungary in August 2022 to build a 100 gigawatt-hour battery plant in Debrecen, the second largest city in Hungary.The project, located in the city's Southern Industrial Park, will supply battery cells and modules to European EV makers. It will be CATL's second battery factory in Europe after the one in the German city Erfurt in Thuringia that went into production in December 2022.Noemi Sidlo, communications manager for CATL Hungary, said the main structure of the factory has been built."Everything is on schedule and production is scheduled to start in 2025," she said, adding that the factory will be equipped with CATL's cutting-edge technology.CATL started its recruitment campaign in February with a focus on local hires. Of the more than 100 employees recruited so far, about 80 percent are local employees.CATL is expected to become one of the biggest employers in the region once in full production. It is expected to hire 3,000 people by 2026 as the first phase of the project, but total employment could reach 8,000 or even 9,000 when all the three phases are completed, according to Balazs Szilagyi, public affairs manager of CATL Hungary. He added that this will be a gradual process according to market demand.Sidlo said the recruitment is also a brand building campaign for CATL, as the company is integrating itself into the local community, such as by participating in local events.She said that the cooperation between CATL and the local Hungarian government has been very good."Within the company, we are learning from each other. It's a good process… and it's positive," she said, adding that it is still in the process of building a corporate culture and it will take time."And we believe it's going to be a success story in the long term in Hungary," she said.Sidlo said that local employees are quite good at helping the company tackle the strict rules and regulations in Hungary.The factory in Hungary is part of CATL's bid to build its global network since German car companies such as Mercedes Benz and BMW, which have a long presence in Hungary, are switching to EV production and are going to be among major clients for CATL.Sidlo said it is also important from the perspective of Hungary because CATL will be a big revenue source and job creator, as well as introduce its latest technology and expertise to Hungary."At the moment, we have started the localization of our supply chains," Szilagyi said.Jason Chen, CEO of CATL Europe, said at the Hungarian Battery Day event in October that CATL aims to build a complete European battery manufacturing value chain with a focus on sustainability.He said CATL is proud to have achieved carbon neutrality at four of its battery plants and that will also be the goal for the Debrecen factory."Our plant in Hungary will enable us to efficiently serve the needs of the European market, develop our manufacturing network, and contribute to the uptake of electric transport in Europe and the successful realization of the energy transition," he said.In January, the Hungarian government announced a 700 billion forint ($2 billion) infrastructure development project in Debrecen to help transform the city into one of Europe's biggest EV battery production hubs.chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn A freight train loaded with containers of goods departed from Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, to Belgrade, Serbia, in late March, marking the first direct rail line connecting the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region with Serbia.The China-Europe Express Rail transport service has witnessed tremendous expansion since its launch in 2011 and has provided transport and logistics support for Belt and Road cooperation over the years.The China-Europe Express Rail served as a safe and reliable rail line linking Asia and Europe, transporting over 50,000 types of goods, including automobiles, spare parts, clothing, cereals, wine, coffee beans and timber.According to China State Railway Group, by the end of February 2024, the railway service connects 120 Chinese cities with 219 cities across 25 European countries, making it one of the main transport arteries between China and Europe.The service has expanded steadily in the first two months of this year, with the number of trains reaching 2,928 in January and February, a year-on-year increase of 9 percent.During the COVID-19 pandemic, the China-Europe Railway Express has proven itself to be a more secure and stable means of transporting cargo as it was less affected than other transportation modes like ships and planes.Businesses have preferred to choose the railway to transport large quantities of goods and cross-border e-commerce parcels.Metrans, a major logistics company in Europe, launched its first China-Europe train service in 2017. It now has 20 container terminals across Europe.The China-Europe Express Rail is also less vulnerable to extreme weather or geopolitical tensions, ensuring the unimpeded flow of international industrial and supply chains."The railway to Europe is a viable alternative and we are seeing increased demand for that route," Marco Forgione, director general at the Institute of Export and International Trade, told South China Morning Post.Michael Aldwell, head of sea logistics at Kuehne and Nagel, told the Financial Times in March that there was "more demand" to move goods from Asia to Europe by rail under current circumstances, adding that "high-value cargo has always been popular on that route."In recent years, the China-Europe Express Rail service has continued to be more efficient. Today, it takes only about 10 days for a train to travel from Xi'an, Shaanxi province, to Duisburg, Germany, two days less than it took in 2023.Julija Sciglaite, RailGate Europe's chief business development officer, told CNBC in February that the company uses the China-Europe Express Rail to transport its products as the time of the journey is "significantly better" than the sea route.The China-Europe Express Rail service is also developing beyond rail, with the introduction of integrated sea-rail transport routes.A shipment of electric water heaters was delivered from Thailand to Germany about a month ago through multiple transport solutions, passing through Laos, Vietnam and China.The Belt and Road Initiative, of which the China-Europe Express Rail is a flagship project, is a blueprint that every nation needs in an age of "uncertainty and disruption," said an article published in January in the US magazine Foreign Policy, adding that the BRI represents what all countries should do in their own national interest.Xinhua  Gyorgy Matolcsy, governor of Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB), the national bank of Hungary, hoped that President Xi Jinping's state visit to Hungary will take bilateral relations to new heights of economic and cultural exchanges.The Hungarian politician and economist served as Minister of National Economy during the first two terms of Prime Minister Viktor Orban."I would like to underscore that cooperation is a win-win-win game for both Europe and Asia, and together we can win the future," said the 69-year-old, who has visited China many times."President Xi Jinping strives for establishing win-win partnerships, which is the only viable way for the international community to thrive in the long run."Matolcsy described China as "a distinguished partner country" to Hungary and the MNB, adding that 75 years of diplomatic ties between the countries have built the groundwork for an enduring friendship, mutual understanding and trust, as well as diplomatic exchanges.In his view, cooperation with China is essential for Hungary's competitiveness since China is already at the forefront of many critical technologies."This is also crucial for the green transition," he said. Many Chinese high-tech companies in the green sectors are making investments in Hungary.Matolcsy believes Hungary and its capital, Budapest, are ideally positioned to serve as a hub, a connecting point between East and West.He said that thanks to the Hungarian government's Eastern Opening policy in the past decade, a policy that the MNB firmly supports, Hungary has emerged as one of the few international centers of the Central and Eastern European region that could serve as an intellectual hub facilitating the exchange of expertise, ideas and breakthrough technologies."We welcome investments from China, which are becoming a more and more important part of the Hungarian economy," he said.Chinese investments bring new technology and knowledge, help drive innovation, create jobs and can open doors to new supply chain opportunities and provide a large market for small and medium-sized Hungarian enterprises, enhancing their capabilities and competitiveness, according to Matolcsy, citing examples of Chinese battery maker CATL and car manufacturer BYD, both of which are making huge investments in Hungary.He said the financial sector is one of the pivotal points of their relations, exemplified by the presence in Hungary of two of the four major Chinese commercial banks." (It) shows our country's growing significance in the global financial and economic landscape, and the flourishing ties between our great nations," he said.Matolcsy said he is proud that MNB's relationship with the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, is thriving, especially in the fields of green sustainability and financial innovation.The two central banks also regularly hold online talks on green finance initiatives and central bank digital currencies.Matolcsy was pleased that he participated and delivered his thoughts at major forums in China, such as the Boao Forum for Asia, the Shanghai Forum and the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.He said that knowledge in itself is not the key to the 21st century, sharing this knowledge is.He emphasized that it is only "joint thinking" and international cooperation that can solve the most pressing issues of today's turbulent times.He believes that the 21st century is the beginning of the age of Eurasia, in which the world's economic center of gravity is returning to the heart of the Eurasian supercontinent, due to the emergence of Asian economies."In the face of China, we can recognize a wise country, a 5,000-year-old civilization, and a forward-looking great nation," he said.chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn  Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO is committed to achieving the green transformation of Hungary and the rest of Europe by relying heavily on the local workforce.NIO opened its first factory outside China in September 2022 in Biatorbagy, a town about 20 kilometers from the Budapest city center. The NIO Power Europe Plant manufactures battery swapping stations for the European market.Zhang Hui, vice-president of NIO Europe, said the plant is serving as the manufacturing, service and research and development center for charging products on the continent."This factory has a long-term and great significance for NIO's overall overseas production layout, helping to cultivate talent and accumulate experience abroad," Zhang said.He said the operation of the plant greatly enhances NIO's energy deployment and service efficiency in Europe, and improves user experience for European customers.Dozens of battery swapping stations assembled by the plant are currently operational in Europe.Meanwhile, a European Business Service Center of NIO has been set up in Budapest to provide technical support, along with employee training and other services, to the carmaker's European customer base.NIO has 2,400 battery swapping stations in the world, where customers can get a fully charged battery for their EVs in less than four minutes in a container-sized unit.Zhang said he believes that NIO's innovative energy solutions will play an active role in low-carbon economic development and environmental protection through its battery swapping stations made at the Hungarian plant.These stations have "a long-term and positive impact on the green transformation of Hungary and Europe as a whole, especially in the current tight energy supply situation in Europe", he said, referring to the energy crisis in Europe following the Russia-Ukraine conflict."The application of these technologies helps to accelerate electrification and smart transformation in these regions, thereby achieving green development goals," he said.Zhang said that NIO's development in Hungary and Europe has always followed the core principle of localization, and its key management team in Hungary primarily comprises Hungarian professionals.Lajos Kecskemeti, senior manager of human resources at the NIO European Business Service Center, said he became NIO's first employee in Budapest about three years ago. While he had worked with Chinese companies before, it was the first time he started working for one."It's very interesting to work for a Chinese company. We have a lot of things in common, but also learn a lot from each other," he said, adding that he learned more about China and Chinese culture after joining NIO."In Hungary, Chinese companies have a good reputation," Kecskemeti said, noting how proud he felt driving his NIO electric car in Budapest, "as it always draws a lot of attention".Istvan Rohoska, who works in the financial department of the service center, said he was attracted by NIO's innovative products and was really happy to join NIO at an early stage.He said he felt no "culture shock" working for a Chinese company. "It was like joining another European company, pretty much similar to my previous experiences."In 2023, the NIO Power Europe Plant won the 2022 Innovative Product Investment Award from the Hungarian Investment Promotion Agency for its innovative battery swapping solution. Its business service center in Budapest was recognized this year as the "most promising emerging business service center in Central and Eastern Europe".Zhang, the vice-president, said that Hungary is an important part of NIO's globalization journey."Through our investment and presence in Hungary, we aim to bring advanced Chinese technology and innovation concepts to the electrification and smart transformation of the Hungarian automotive industry," he added.  BUDAPEST -- Peng Liyuan, wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, accompanied by Aniko Levai, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's wife, visited the Hungarian-Chinese bilingual school in Budapest on Thursday afternoon.Upon arrival, Peng was warmly greeted by Levai and the school principal. The students held the national flags of China and Hungary along the road to welcome her.With great interest, Peng and Levai watched classes on Chinese language and traditional Chinese culture such as paper cutting and calligraphy, and had cordial exchanges with the students.Peng said that the Hungarian-Chinese bilingual school is a symbol of the friendship between China and Hungary, and that she is glad to see that the students speak Chinese very well.She expressed hope that the students will work hard to learn the Chinese language and Chinese culture, have the opportunity to visit or study in China, and actively contribute to the inheritance and promotion of the China-Hungary friendship.Peng and Levai watched a video of the school's 20-year development history and the students' talent shows such as dance, poetry recitation and chorus, and took photos with the students.Before leaving, Peng presented a batch of books on Chinese culture to the school.Established in 2004, the Hungarian-Chinese bilingual school is a 12-year all-through public school that teaches in both Chinese and Hungarian.BUDAPEST -- China and Hungary agreed on Thursday to establish an inter-governmental cooperation mechanism on the China-Europe Railway Express, a joint statement said on Thursday.The two sides spoke highly of the development of the China-Europe Railway Express between China and Hungary, according to the joint statement between China and Hungary issued during the state visit to Hungary by Chinese President Xi Jinping.China and Hungary also agreed to promote infrastructure connectivity, and jointly take practical measures to ensure the security of the transport routes and improve the quality and efficiency of the China-Europe Railway Express, so as to provide important support for deepening economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, said the statement.BUDAPEST -- China and Hungary are willing to actively promote the construction of the Hungarian section of the Hungary-Serbia Railway, and jointly promote high-level connectivity in Central and Eastern Europe, a joint statement said on Thursday.The Hungary-Serbia Railway is a landmark project under Belt and Road cooperation, and also a flagship project of cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European countries, said the joint statement between China and Hungary issued during the state visit to Hungary by Chinese President Xi Jinping.BUDAPEST -- Peng Liyuan, wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on invitation visited the Buda Castle and had tea with Zsuzsanna Nagy, wife of Hungarian President Tamas Sulyok, here on Thursday.The two first ladies appreciated the exhibition of Hungarian Herend porcelain and traditional embroidery craftsmanship.Peng said she is impressed by the exquisite Hungarian porcelain and superb embroidery craftsmanship.Porcelain and embroidery are common symbols of the civilizations of China and Hungary, Peng said, adding it is hoped that artists from both countries strengthen exchanges and mutual learning, and promote cultural integration.The two first ladies listened to a briefing on the restoration of the Szent Istvan Hall of the Buda Castle.Appreciating the exquisite restoration skills of Hungarian experts, Peng raised her hope that the two sides would strengthen cooperation in the protection and restoration of cultural relics, so that historical legacies could be better passed on.Hungary is a beautiful country and its people are hospitable, Peng said during her friendly and cordial chat over tea with Nagy.There are many similarities between the cultures of China and Hungary, and the two peoples share a deep sense of affinity, Peng said.The friendship between the two countries has a solid foundation, she said, adding she hopes that the friendship between the two countries will be passed on from generation to generation and grow stronger over time.XI'AN - The Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum in northwestern China announced on Wednesday that it will collaborate with its French counterpart on the restoration of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris and the protection of the Terracotta Warriors.The collaborative research conducted with France's Fondation des Sciences du Patrimoine primarily focuses on the protection of wooden remains and earthen archaeological sites, according to the museum located in Northwest China's Shaanxi province.Specifically, the research on protecting wooden remains will involve joint efforts to preserve and restore the fire-damaged wood from Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Mausoleum of Emperor Qinshihuang. Moreover, joint efforts will be made to conduct studies on their historical significance.The research will also include wood species identification, preservation status assessment, degradation mechanisms and protection techniques and methods.In the future, the two parties will explore the material properties and historical value of wooden remains and archaeological earth sites of the two UNESCO World Heritage sites together.Meanwhile, this Sino-French cooperation also touches on developing practical conservation technologies and method systems for cultural relics and jointly cultivating young talents in the field of cultural heritage protection.Peng Liyuan, wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited the National Museum of Serbia with Tamara Vucic, wife of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, in Belgrade on Wednesday.Video from CCTV.Chinese Ambassador to Hungary Gong Tao gave credit for the good relations between China and Hungary to guidance by the top leadership, growing political mutual trust and increasing strategic alignment.He noted that President Xi Jinping and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have held face-to-face meetings and phone talks several times and established a close working relationship and personal friendship."They have kept a firm grasp on the direction forward for China-Hungary relations and made a top-level design for the bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields," said Gong, who took the post in September.He was involved in preparing for and receiving Orban's visit to China in October to attend the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and other activities in China."I felt strongly the high degree of political mutual trust and deep friendship between the leaders of the two countries," he said.During that visit, the two countries agreed to better align the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and Hungary's Eastern Opening national strategy, a policy to increase Hungary's cooperation with countries in the East, including China. Orban and Premier Li Qiang also witnessed the signing of 10 documents on bilateral cooperation at that time.In 2015, Hungary was the first European country to sign a BRI cooperation document with China.Gong described the bilateral relationship as a role model for a new type of international relations."China has always regarded Hungary as a good friend and a good partner, with mutual trust and seeking win-win cooperation," he said.He added that both countries support building connectivity and promoting an equal, orderly multipolar world and inclusive economic globalization, and both are unequivocally against decoupling or bloc confrontation."The fruitful achievements of China and Hungary's mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields have not only benefited the people of the two countries, they have also shown that China is an opportunity for Europe and not a challenge, and China is a partner and not a rival," Gong said.In 2023, bilateral trade between China and Hungary exceeded $13 billion, and Chinese foreign direct investment in Hungary reached 7.6 billion euros ($8.17 billion), accounting for 58 percent of the foreign direct investment in Hungary and creating more than 10,000 jobs.Hungary has for years been the top destination of Chinese FDI in Central and Eastern Europe. China is Hungary's largest trading partner outside the European Union.Chinese companies such as electric vehicle battery maker CATL and electric vehicle maker BYD are racing ahead with investment projects in Hungary, while a solar power plant funded and built by China National Machinery Import &Export Corp in Kaposvar in southwestern Hungary has begun operations.Gong said that more Chinese companies in the fields of electric vehicles, lithium batteries and solar energy have made Hungary a "bridgehead" into the EU market."They have not only contributed to the Hungarian economy and job creation, but also helped upgrade Hungary's manufacturing sector to make Hungary more competitive in the international marketplace," he said.Gong emphasized the importance of people-to-people exchanges, citing a long list of activities that have brought the two peoples closer together to lay a solid foundation for bilateral cooperation. Hungary is host to five Confucius Institutes and a Hungarian-Chinese bilingual school."President Xi's upcoming state visit to Hungary, the first by China's head of state in 20 years and Xi's first visit to Hungary as Chinese president, will become a milestone of great significance for the bilateral relationship," Gong said. Xi also visited Hungary in 2009 when he was Chinese vice-president.Balazs Orban, political director of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, said that relations between Hungary and China are "very good "and "the two countries are getting closer and closer".On his visit to China in October, the Hungarian prime minister was accompanied by the political director. The two Orbans are not related.China and Hungary are marking the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties this year."We think that it has a culture of a people-to-people basis. Our countries have been working together for 75 years and it has always been the case," Balazs Orban told China Daily in an interview at Mathias Corvinus Collegium, a large private education institution in Budapest where he is the chairman of the board of trustees.Balazs Orban said that Hungary sees China as an emerging power that is getting stronger and stronger. During the October visit, he was amazed by China's achievements in technology, economic development and efforts to preserve cultural heritage.He described the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative put forward by President Xi Jinping a decade ago as a very attractive idea for Hungary from the beginning, because Hungary also believes in building connectivity and seeking practical cooperation.Prime Minister Orban introduced the Eastern Opening strategy in 2010 to expand economic and trade ties with the East.Balazs Orban said that there is a lot of potential for mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Hungary. He was happy to see the two leaders have "very good personal connections" and he hopes such personal ties will help further strengthen Hungarian-Chinese relations.Under the leadership of President Xi and Prime Minister Orban, the political director said that Chinese-Hungarian relations are "flourishing" based on pragmatic and win-win cooperation.He said that Hungarians are "very honored and delighted" that Xi is visiting the country. "So we hope that this visit will be a perfect opportunity to finalize new projects where we can mutually benefit," he said.Balazs Orban said he believes the European Union should also work like this with the rest of the world to boost mutual trust and seek practical economic cooperation, clearly referring to the growing tensions in EU-China relations.The political director said that during his latest visit, he was impressed that Hungary and China have a very similar mindset regarding the changing world order and how international relations should be based on national interest, mutual trust, respect and economic connectivity.He said he was puzzled why some in the West want to cut ties, form political blocs and prefer a new kind of Cold War."This is all against the interest of Europe and definitely against the interest of Hungary," he added.Unlike some EU politicians, Balazs Orban said that Hungary does not see China as a competitor or political enemy. "We try to do everything to convince our European partners that if Europe wants to play an important role in the 21st century, we have to find a way based on mutual respect with the rest of the world, including China," said Balazs Orban, who is also a member of the National Assembly, the Hungarian parliament.Zhou Baoyu still remembers the first time she was captivated by the melodic vocal performances of choral singing, when the big loudspeaker of the broadcast station in her village played In the Field of Hope, a joyful song composed by 20th century Chinese songwriter Shi Guangnan.As someone who was born and brought up in a small village in Anhua county, Hunan province, Zhou had never heard choral singing before and was intrigued.In 1995, she left her native village and went to high school in the town, where she saw a piano for the first time. On hearing Zhou's beautiful voice one day, her music teacher encouraged her to overcome her natural shyness and become the lead vocalist of the school's choir.That planted the seed of music in Zhou's heart, and she went on to become a music teacher in a primary school in Anhua in 2014.She founded a choir in the school, which however was put on pause in 2017. As she recalls, though the children loved choral singing, the level and method of teaching choral singing were not up to the mark in the small village.In 2019, Zhou was able to relaunch the choir in the school thanks to Edit Lanczky, a music teacher associated with the Beijing Hungarian Cultural Institute, who came to the school along with her Hungarian colleagues not only to teach the children how to sing, but also to train the local music teachers to make choral singing a part of the school's music education programs.The technique that Lanczky used to teach choral singing is known as the Kodaly method, a pioneering music education approach based on the work of Hungarian composer Zoltan Kodaly (1882-1967).The method, which embraces the key principle of learning by singing with the human voice as the fundamental instrument, was inscribed on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2016. It also involves hand signs, rhythmic proficiency, creative collaborations and cultural connections.According to Lanczky, in Kodaly's time, pianos were not commonly available to Hungarian families. Consequently, the style of singing without instrumental accompaniment, known as a cappella, was utilized. Many ancient Hungarian ballads were passed down through generations, unaccompanied by music."For children, the vocalized sound is natural, but using musical instruments isn't," she told China Daily during an interview in 2020. "That's why the Kodaly method isn't restricted by spaces and conditions."Zhou, the Anhua music teacher, said that for children in rural areas, it is a luxury to learn music, as musical instruments are expensive and the level of music education is not as high as that of big cities."Singing is the simplest and most direct way for children to learn and enjoy music," she said, adding that Lanczky and her colleagues used several engaging techniques such as role-playing games to make learning music fun for the students."For local music teachers like me, we learned from them how to train the children to sing in a choir using hand signs," said Zhou, 44.Chen Chenxi, a music teacher from Hunan's Anren county, also received training in the Kodaly method."Children make friends when they sing in choirs. They do rehearsals every week. It inspires them to do better in other classes," said Chen, 32, who was introduced to choral singing in university and fell in love with the art form.The Hungarian music teachers, led by Lanczky, were invited to China by the Beijing Deqing Foundation, a charity devoted to improving education in the country's rural areas.Nearly 2,000 Chinese music teachers and students attended the classes held by Lanczky and her colleagues both online and in-person during the past five years, said Li Kemei, founder of the charity, who met Lanczky in 2018 and initiated the idea of inviting her and the others to offer music lessons to Chinese teachers and children in rural areas."We believe that music should be accessible to everyone. I feel very touched and proud when I see the smiles on children's faces, when they sing in a choir. In fact, singing in a choir is beyond music itself. The children become more confident and sociable," Li said.chennan@chinadaily.com.cnPresident Xi Jinping has commended the staunch ties between China and Hungary over the past 75 years, and called on the two countries to carry on their friendship by enhancing cooperation in various fields.In a signed article published on Wednesday in the Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet, Xi said that China's relationship with Hungary "is at its best in history, and has embarked on a golden voyage".Xi's visit to Hungary is his second trip to the Central European country in 15 years."Over the past 15 years, I have met with visiting Hungarian leaders on many occasions. We have forged a deep friendship," Xi said. "I very much look forward to returning to your country to renew our friendship and work with my friends on a new blueprint for China-Hungary relations and cooperation in the new era."Noting that this year marks the 75th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations, Xi said the relationship has since been developing and growing steadily and soundly, with tangible results achieved in all fields."We see each other as a priority partner of cooperation. We have gone through hardships together and defied power politics together amid volatile international situations," Xi said.The two countries have supported each other on issues that bear on their respective core interests and are of major concern to them, Xi said, adding that they have enjoyed a high degree of political mutual trust.China and Hungary established diplomatic relations on Oct 6, 1949, days after the People's Republic of China was founded. The two countries signed an intergovernmental Belt and Road cooperation document in 2015, making Hungary the first European country to have signed such an agreement with China.Hungary is China's top investment destination in Central and Eastern Europe, while China is Hungary's largest trading partner outside Europe.Calling bilateral cooperation "strong, fruitful, and dynamic", Xi said the two countries need to strengthen the political foundations of their ties."Stronger political mutual trust is the cornerstone of rapid and steady development of China-Hungary relations," he said, adding that the two countries should continue to firmly support each other on issues that involve their core interests.Xi also encouraged the two countries to enhance communication on international affairs and work together to address global challenges."It is important that we stay committed to solidarity and collaboration, champion humanity's common values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, and practice true multilateralism," he said.Speaking of practical cooperation, Xi said that China will work with Hungary to forge greater synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative and Hungary's Eastern Opening strategy, and accelerate the construction of the Budapest-Belgrade railway link.China will also strengthen cooperation with the Central European country in clean energy, artificial intelligence, the digital economy, green development and other emerging areas, Xi said.Hungary is a member of a mechanism of cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European countries, which was launched in 2012.Xi said the cooperation is "an important complement to the overall China-Europe relationship", and that China stands ready to work with Hungary to deepen it.Xi also called for China and Hungary to expand exchanges and cooperation in education, culture, tourism, sports, youth and the media, as well as at the subnational level.China will continue to work with Hungary to upgrade mutual visa facilitation, expand direct flights, and facilitate people-to-people exchanges, he said.wangqingyun@chinadaily.com.cnMay 2024 is set to be an important month for Chinese diplomacy. This month, President Xi Jinping is visiting three European nations. These high-level interactions are likely to attract critical comments from some Western countries.President Xi's European tour, which began in France, marks his first state visit to Europe in five years, following the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. His itinerary also includes stops in Belgrade and Budapest. The choice of these particular European destinations is quite indicative. It probably reflects China's strategic priorities in Europe with regard to political and economic relations. France, Serbia and Hungary, while differing in their geopolitical positions and perspectives within Europe, share a common pragmatic attitude toward China.France, alongside Germany, stands as one of the European Union's most influential member states and boasts an extensively cooperative relationship with China. This year marks the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries, which is supported by a comprehensive strategic partnership. Additionally, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, France holds a significant position on the global stage. French President Emmanuel Macron advocates the concept of strategic autonomy for Europe, focusing on sovereignty and reducing reliance on American influence.Hungary, another EU member state, is often seen as the most influenced by China within the EU bloc. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban pursues a multi-vector foreign policy, fostering strong ties with Russia and China, which sometimes deviates from EU norms and faces indignation from some other EU nations and officials. This year, as China and Hungary celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations, President Xi's visit is anticipated to strengthen Sino-European relations, injecting stability and positive dynamics into the complex global scene. Furthermore, Hungary is involved in building Europe's longest high-speed rail line, which extends approximately 1,500 km from Budapest to Athens. Hungary has also attracted substantial investments from major Chinese firms like BYD, a leading electric vehicle manufacturer that is setting up a plant there, and CATL, a key battery producer.Serbia, an EU candidate and a small country strategically located at the crossroads of Central and Southeastern Europe, has become an important partner in China's Belt and Road Initiative. Its geostrategic position makes Serbia a gateway to Europe, particularly through the land route that seeks to connect Greece to the heart of Europe. This strategic importance is the primary reason for several major infrastructure projects in Serbia, such as the construction of the Belgrade-Budapest high-speed railway, a flagship project of the BRI. Predominantly financed and constructed by Chinese companies, this railway is designed to improve the transportation of goods from Serbia to broader European markets.This year marks the 15th anniversary of bilateral relations between China and Serbia, highlighted by the signing of a comprehensive strategic partnership eight years ago during President Xi's visit to Belgrade. The collaboration between the two nations is based on mutual respect and benefit, fostering prosperity and significantly contributing to Serbia's development and revitalization. The partnership is multidimensional and mutually advantageous, encompassing all key areas of cooperation.As global dynamics shift, the strategic partnership between Serbia and China continues to strengthen, creating significant implications for regional politics and economic development. This relationship, however, is unfolding against the backdrop of increased scrutiny from the European Union, particularly following its recent anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles. This investigation reflects broader concerns about fair competition and market practices, placing Serbia in a unique position as it balances its national interests with its aspirations toward EU integration.Despite the critics and lack of understanding from Brussels, Serbia is China's first comprehensive strategic partner in Central and Eastern Europe, and the two countries share a deep and steadfast friendship. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when the absence of substantial international solidarity was often present, China and Serbia collaborated closely to save lives.The visit of President Xi to Belgrade further reinforces the long-standing bond between the two nations. Often described as "steel friends," this term reflects not only their robust cooperation in the steel sector, highlighted by the major Chinese investment in Hesteel Smederevo, but also their resilient traditional friendship that has overcome various challenges over time.There is significant potential for developing a deeper and comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Serbia in many areas such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, healthcare, and information technologies. The future of Sino-Serbian cooperation could see a significant focus on technological advancement and green energy, which would not only benefit both countries but also align with global sustainability goals. Moreover, after the signing of free trade agreement, new opportunities for strengthening their ironclad friendship will appear.The current EU anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EVs presents both a challenge and an opportunity for Serbia. The challenge lies in navigating the EU's concerns about so-called market distortion potentially caused by Chinese subsidies, which could affect Serbia's own market as it integrates more closely with the EU. Conversely, Serbia has the opportunity to promote fair competition and transparent economic practices, potentially alleviating EU concerns and enhancing cooperation between China and the EU. Serbia's relationship with China can serve as a bridge in fostering better understanding and cooperation between China and the European Union.The author is a researcher at the Faculty of Political Sciences at University of Belgrade, Serbia. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.Peng Liyuan, wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, also a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) special envoy for the advancement of girls' and women's education, visited the UNESCO headquarters on invitation, and met with UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay, in Paris on Monday.Video from People's DailyPeng Liyuan, wife of President Xi Jinping, visited the Orsay Museum with Brigitte Macron, wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, in Paris, France, on Monday afternoon. Video from CCTV.Former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has highlighted the profound significance of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to France, particularly amid the current turbulent geopolitical landscape and global uncertainties, saying it is not only timely but also essential for fostering deeper mutual understanding and strengthening collaborative efforts between the two nations."The visit of President Xi Jinping to France marks a pivotal moment, especially when the world faces such perilous challenges," Raffarin told China Daily in an interview. "We cannot envision the world's future without considering China, and, likewise, it is not in China's interest to disregard Europe."He emphasized the necessity of continuous dialogue with China. "We need to have a very regular dialogue with China. I think that Emmanuel Macron is the leader of the West who best understands President Xi Jinping's thinking, having spent many hours discussing with the Chinese president," Raffarin said.The discussions between Xi and Macron covered urgent global issues, including climate change and strategic geopolitical questions.Raffarin expressed his satisfaction with the focus of the talks, recognizing their importance not just for France or China, but for the entire world. "These discussions are vital, as the world navigates through a dangerous period."Raffarin, who served as prime minister from 2002 to 2005, asserted that France holds a unique position in Europe, having established a model for engaging in meaningful discussions with China, choosing cooperation over confrontation."France probably has the closest relationship with China within Europe, despite differing viewpoints. We share a vision of a multilateral world," he said.Raffarin laid out what he sees as key areas for enhancing cooperation between France and China, emphasizing cultural exchange, environmental preservation and the establishment of new multilateral regulations as foundational elements of the partnership. "We need to focus on cultural questions to understand the societies between France and China better. Furthermore, protecting our planet for future generations is now a priority, necessitating a global consensus, particularly among the young people."He also touched upon the need for common regulations in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, suggesting they could form the basis for the reform of global multilateralism.Addressing strategic misalignments in global politics, particularly regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the 75-year-old emphasized that a strong and balanced Europe is beneficial for China.Looking ahead, Raffarin voiced his concern about the current direction of global politics, advocating for cooperation over confrontation."In a world leaning toward confrontation, we need to steer back toward cooperation," he said. "This is the only way forward for a stable and prosperous global community."He added that he views Xi's visit as a cornerstone for not only reinforcing the China-France relationship, but also setting a precedent for how major global powers should interact in an increasingly multipolar world.As tensions continue to rise on various fronts, the collaboration between China and France could play a crucial role in navigating the complex web of international relations, he said.Raffarin welcomed Xi's commitment to expanding access and welcoming French companies and investment into China, underscoring the need for reciprocal relations between China and Europe."What we seek is reciprocity," he said. "The rules that apply to Chinese companies in Europe should similarly apply to European companies in China."Serbia's economy and people have enjoyed "multiple" outcomes from its cooperation in the Belt and Road Initiative, Serbian Ambassador to China Maja Stefanovic said, expressing her confidence that her country will continue to benefit from these projects.Serbia is one of the first countries to have joined the BRI, and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has attended all three Belt and Road Forums for International Cooperation that have been held.Following President Xi Jinping's meeting with Vucic, who traveled to China to attend the third BRF in October, the leaders of the two countries witnessed the signing of multiple cooperation documents, including a mid-term action plan for Belt and Road cooperation.Stefanovic told China Daily the plan has "set a blueprint of our future cooperation within the BRI".The plan covers various sectors, such as bilateral cooperation in transportation, infrastructure, trade, investment and education, Stefanovic said.The objective of the plan, she said, is "realizing mutual benefit, win-win outcomes and common development" through the implementation of relevant cooperation projects.One of the best-known Belt and Road cooperation projects in Serbia is the upgrade of the railway connecting Serbia and Hungary, which is being undertaken by Chinese companies.The railway section connecting Belgrade and the Serbian city of Novi Sad opened in March 2022, shortening travel time between the cities from 90 minutes to about 30 minutes.Stefanovic said the construction of the section has "more than fulfilled the expectations of our citizens"."In the two years since the start of operation, there were almost 41,000 departures. And almost 7 million passengers traveled more than 3 million kilometers in both directions," she said.Besides transport infrastructure, Chinese companies have been engaged in other fields in Serbia, including the steel, automobile and energy industries.One of the examples is the Smederevo steel mill, which was purchased by HBIS Group, based in Hebei province, in 2016.The mill had suffered losses for years, but managed to turn around shortly after the purchase.In a meeting with Xi in Beijing in 2018, Vucic said the revival of the steel mill is a successful example showing that the BRI has boosted employment and economic growth in Serbia.So far, the plant is one of the largest exporters in Serbia, and is "well known in Southeast Europe for its high quality products", Stefanovic said.In recent years, some people in Western countries have expressed their skepticism of Chinese investments and trade with China. Over the past year, some have advocated "de-risking" from China, citing what they call "national security concerns".Stefanovic, however, said Serbia is "very satisfied" with investments from China."The Government of Serbia does not see any risk or 'national security concerns' coming from its cooperation with China," she said. "On the contrary, cooperation with China...has given a strong boost to the development of Serbia."The ambassador said that Chinese investments have created almost 30,000 job opportunities in Serbia.Looking into the future, Stefanovic said her country is ready to explore cooperation with China in cutting-edge areas such as artificial intelligence, information technology and green development.For the ambassador, the "strong ties of mutual understanding, respect and support" between China and Serbia underlie sound cooperation in various fields.Both countries have chosen a path of peaceful development, Stefanovic said. Also, they "share the same values" when it comes to international relations. "This further strengthens our overall relations and makes our friendship sustainable and resilient to all changes on a global level," she said.Before the start of his state visit to Serbia, the second leg of his current three-nation European tour, President Xi Jinping said he looks forward to meeting Serbian leaders and friends to renew the friendship between the two countries and explore ways of cooperation."This will be my second visit to your country, a land of beauty and legends, as President of the People's Republic of China. The sweet scenes that prevailed during my last visit eight years ago remain very much alive in my mind," Xi wrote in a signed article published in the Serbian newspaper Politika on Tuesday.Xi said he will work with his Serbian friends during his visit to "bring out the best in our ironclad friendship and take real efforts to deliver more benefits to our two peoples, advance world peace and development, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind".He said the long-lasting friendship and win-win cooperation between China and Serbia make it clear that a stronger bilateral relationship conforms with the trend of history and serves the best interests of the two peoples.Last year, China was Serbia's largest source of foreign investment and its second-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade volume registering at $4.35 billion.In 2016, a century-old Serbian steel mill that was about to slide into bankruptcy made a remarkable comeback after receiving Chinese investment through the deepening high-quality Belt and Road cooperation between China and Serbia. The mill has now become one of the three biggest export companies in Serbia.Xi said the thriving cooperation between the two countries in trade and economic relations, industrial chain and infrastructure development gives a great boost to their respective process of modernization."On the new journey of the new era, the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership has more potential for further growth," he wrote, calling on the two countries to always be good friends and good partners.The Chinese and Serbian peoples, though far apart geographically, have forged a strong friendship during the bitter Anti-Fascist War and their respective nation-building in the last century."Amid the ongoing transformations unseen in a century in the world, our mutual support remains as strong as ever, our cooperation is closer, and our exchanges and mutual learning more substantive," Xi wrote.Xi called on China and Serbia, which hold similar positions on many major international and regional issues, to play an exemplary role in promoting fairness and justice.Multilateralism stressed"Facing a fluid and turbulent world, … we should practice true multilateralism, and endeavor to maintain world peace and stability and safeguard international fairness and justice," he wrote.The Chinese president also stressed the need to promote multidimensional people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and diversify subnational cooperation between the two countries for their friendship to shine even brighter."We should create more opportunities for our youth so that the China-Serbia friendship will be carried forward from generation to generation," he wrote.As this year marks the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of the former Chinese embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999 which killed three Chinese journalists, Xi said Chinese people cherish peace, and will never allow such tragic history to repeat."The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides," he wrote.Just like flowers in spring will turn into fruit in autumn, Xi said the tree of the China-Serbia friendship will grow tall and sturdy and bear more fruit for the two peoples."This is what we expect and what we hope to witness together," he wrote.European countries are becoming popular destinations for Chinese students seeking further education overseas, especially in recent years thanks to economic-friendly tuition fees and a steady social environment.Although the United Kingdom and the United States remained the top two countries for Chinese students intending to pursue postgraduate studies last year, their popularity had decreased compared to previous years, according to the 2023 Report on Chinese Student Overseas.The report, released by New Oriental in May last year, shows that 44 percent of Chinese students chose the UK because of factors such as high university rankings, favorable language environment, and preferential visa and employment policies.Meanwhile, Germany and France are among the top 10 destinations for Chinese students intending to study abroad, both accounting for 9 percent of the total, according to the report.As Chinese families began to consider more affordable options for their children's education, the free tuition fee of higher education in Germany has attracted those focusing on the costs and value of studying abroad.About 35.3 percent of international students who intended to study in Germany did so due to its tuition-free higher education, according to EDUBAO, a service provider for studying in Germany.Apart from a few private and art universities, public universities in Germany generally do not charge tuition fees, which is a competitive advantage compared with countries like the UK and the US, it said.Guo Dongxin is now studying computer sciences in Germany for master's degree. "The tuition fees and living costs are relatively low," Guo said.Over half of Chinese students chose to study engineering-related courses, the traditional strong discipline in the country, in 2022, according to New Oriental's report.For Guo, who enjoys attending opera and symphony performances, Germany's musical tradition is another reason to study in the country."Not only is it the hometown of many great composers, but its concert halls and opera houses are also world-class, which is easier to pursue these hobbies and further develop them," he said.Compared with other countries, Germany has a friendlier employment policy for students overseas, granting an 18-month Job-Seeker Visa. More than 90 percent of students with master's degrees opted to get employment either in Germany or in China.The higher education institutions in Germany particularly emphasize the integration of theory and practice, so the courses are highly practical, Guo said.The neighboring country of France saw a 2 percentage point increase of intentions in 2023 as it has highlighted the internationalization of higher education and has introduced many English-taught programs.Additionally, as one of the cradles of world higher education, France boasts a leading position in science and education, which has attracted a considerable number of Chinese students to study there, the report said.As this year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France, and the hosting of the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, the country is expected to attract more Chinese students, said Wu Dan from another overseas education consultancy EIC Education Group.More Chinese students intend to study business, science and engineering in France. The proportion of applications for business majors increased from 64.7 percent in 2019 to 76 percent in 2023, EIC's report shows.Engineering and business school graduates found it easier to land a job. These schools' emphasis on practical education provided students opportunities to engage with industry elites and expand their professional networks, the report said.In the Netherlands, from 2021 to 2022, China has become the only non-European country among its top ten sources for international students. In the 2022-23 academic year, the number of students from China reached 5,610, showing a 5.3 percent increase year-on-year.The percentage of overseas transactions by Chinese students studying in the Netherlands and Ireland in 2022 has seen an increase for four consecutive years, indicating that Chinese students are returning to schools after the pandemic, the report of New Oriental said.Law student Li Xuehua plans to continue further education in the Netherlands in September because the law school in Leiden University attracted her with its curriculum when she participated in a six-month exchange program during undergraduate studies in China. "I had the opportunity to delve into courses related to EU technology law, economic law and other relevant courses, which inspired me to further my studies in the Netherlands," the 22-year-old said.The annual cost of a Master of Laws program in the Netherlands is approximately around 250,000 yuan ($34,504), which is cheaper than some other regions, she said."Moreover, the country's law schools provide numerous English-taught courses, particularly renowned for their prestige and academic rankings across the European continent," Li said, adding that there are plenty of options available when applying to an LLM program in the Netherlands.Currently, international students graduating in the Netherlands are eligible to apply for a one-year Search Year visa, which allows them to seek employment after graduation. Li said many alumni have successfully sought desirable jobs during that year."I think the overall return on investment for studying in Europe is high, with less financial burden of studying abroad, and almost every European country implemented employment policies to support international students," she said.On the situation in the Middle East, the two heads of state:- Stressed the urgency of an immediate and sustainable cease-fire in Gaza, called for the immediate release of all hostages, and urged the immediate and effective implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions.- Called for effective opening of all necessary passages and border crossings for the speedy, safe, sustainable and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip.- Advocated the concrete implementation of the two-state solution.- Emphasized the importance of safeguarding freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, and called for an immediate cessation of attacks on civilian vessels.- Called for a global truce during the Olympic Games in Paris this summer.On strengthening biodiversity and ocean cooperation, China and France:- Plan to take actions in accordance with the international conventions already ratified by both countries.- Are committed to contributing to the early implementation of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction, and encourage all countries to take similar actions.- Are willing to strengthen cooperation between their national institutions responsible for the conservation, protection and restoration of marine and coastal biodiversity.- Are committed to combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and advocating for this approach in relevant international organizations.- Pledged to prevent and reduce pollutants — chemical, plastic or others — and address the associated risks they pose to biodiversity.On artificial intelligence and global governance, the two countries:- Agreed on the importance of promoting the development and security of AI and promoting appropriate international governance.- Agreed that global governance of AI should allow for flexibility to facilitate the development of a constantly and rapidly evolving technology.- Are fully committed to promoting safe, reliable and trustworthy AI systems, adhering to the purpose of "AI for good", and exploring the potential of AI and reducing its risks.- Recognized that the opportunities, risks and challenges associated with AI are global in nature, underlining the importance of strengthening international cooperation to ensure international security, stability and respect for sovereignty and fundamental rights.- Emphasized the importance of bridging the digital divide and improving the AI capabilities of developing countries.On agricultural exchanges and cooperation, the two sides:- Reaffirmed the crucial role of agriculture in China and France and in bilateral relations.- Supported deepening cooperation in agriculture and agreed to explore ways to enhance technological cooperation in areas of mutual concern, such as crops.- Are willing to continue exploring the potential for cooperation in rural development and construction.- Welcomed the strengthening of cooperation through the signing of the administrative agreement on grape planting and wine production. France supports China's accession to the International Organization of Vine and Wine in 2024.- Are committed to actively exploring the complete lifting of the ban on bovine spongiform encephalopathy-free beef products. China is willing to work with UNESCO to encourage increased global investment in girls' and women's education and help more women obtain equal access to education rights, said Peng Liyuan, wife of President Xi Jinping.Peng, who is also a UNESCO special envoy for the advancement of girls' and women's education, made the remark on Monday when meeting with UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay as she visited the organization's headquarters in Paris, France.She briefed Azoulay on China's latest progress in promoting girls' and women's education, especially the achievements of the Spring Bud Project, a nationwide campaign to help dropout girls return to school and improve teaching conditions in impoverished areas.She also presented UNESCO with a tapestry titled Blooming Spring Bud, co-created by beneficiaries of the project.Peng said that while serving as UNESCO's special envoy for the advancement of girls' and women's education in the past decade, she has visited many schools in various countries, and is delighted to see more and more women being able to live a better life thanks to education.Promoting girls' and women's education is a great cause that is closely related to social progress and the shared future for humanity, she added.Azoulay praised Peng's work and contributions as a special envoy, and presented her with a 10-year service honor certificate.They visited an exhibition on the 10-year achievements of cooperation between China and UNESCO, at which Azoulay spoke highly of China's contribution to the development of girls' and women's education around the world.She also expressed UNESCO's willingness to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with China to promote new developments in global girls' and women's education.Also on Monday, Peng visited the Orsay Museum in Paris, together with Brigitte Macron, French President Emmanuel Macron's wife, to appreciate the Paris 1874 Inventing Impressionism exhibition and the museum's masterpiece oil paintings.The paintings include classic works by impressionist and post-impressionist artists such as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Vincent van Gogh.Noting that both Chinese and French people love paintings, Peng expressed the hope that the two sides could carry out more exchanges to allow the two peoples to feel the charm of each other's culture and deepen mutual understanding.In the hall of the museum, Peng and Brigitte Macron also had cordial exchanges with French students who were visiting and studying there.Peng said she hopes that the students will become little envoys of China-France friendship and build a bridge of communication between the two peoples, so that China-France friendship will be passed on from generation to generation.China Daily - Xinhua  President Xi Jinping said on Monday that entrepreneurs in France are welcome to participate in China's modernization efforts, and to seize opportunities arising from China's development as the country mulls significant moves to further deepen reform across various sectors.Xi made the remarks when attending the closing ceremony of the sixth meeting of the China-France Business Council together with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Theatre Marigny in Paris.Xi told delegates to the meeting that China is working to steadily expand institutional opening-up, ease market access and shorten the negative list for foreign investment. This will help provide a broader market and more win-win cooperation opportunities for countries including France, he said.Since China and France established diplomatic ties 60 years ago, the two countries have developed a closely intertwined relationship between their economies, with bilateral trade increasing 800-fold to reach $78.9 billion last year.Based on past and present experiences, Xi emphasized that there are no justifiable reasons for failures in maximizing the potential of the China-France relationship, and vowed to further enhance its productivity."China will continue to make full use of the 'French farm to Chinese dining table' whole-chain rapid coordination mechanism, and bring more cheese, ham, wine and other quality agricultural products from France to the dining tables of Chinese families," he said.Xi also announced that China will extend visa exemption entry for citizens from France and another 11 countries on short-term visits to China until the end of 2025."Deeper friendship calls for frequent exchanges and closer cooperation. We always view France as a priority and trustworthy partner of cooperation," he said.China and France, with long, pragmatic and fruitful climate cooperation, have great potential for jointly improving climate governance and promoting green transition in other countries, experts said.Wang Binbin, associate research professor at the Institute of Carbon Neutrality, Peking University, noted a solid foundation for Sino-French climate cooperation.As early as November 2007, the two countries had issued a joint statement on addressing climate change, said Wang, a Yale World Fellow. The joint statement is the first of its kind issued between China and another country.To strengthen climate cooperation, they decided to establish a partnership under the framework of the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership, taking a series of initiatives thereafter, she said.Sino-French climate cooperation involves areas related to climate change, such as biodiversity conservation and desertification control, and they also make efforts to jointly promote technological development and innovative collaboration, she said.It is evident they have designed their cooperative efforts within the framework of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, Wang said, adding there is enormous potential for expanding the scope of cooperation."China and France have always worked hand in hand, sending positive signals to the international community on climate governance, providing rare constants in a changing world, and encouraging the willingness and actions of other countries to actively respond," she stated.Hu Bin, director of research on global climate governance at the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development of Tsinghua University, said that as upholders of climate multilateralism and long-term partners in addressing climate change, China and France have played important roles in the establishment of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.During the crucial countdown period of the COP21 United Nations climate change conference in Paris, during which the treaty was adopted, China and France issued a joint presidential statement on climate change in November 2015.In the statement, the two sides established a common ground on all major issues related to the negotiation of the treaty, including the principle of common responsibilities and the long-term goals, he said.Hu highlighted the special contribution of the two countries in coming up with a mechanism for the long-term, sustainable implementation of the climate treaty, which allows countries to set their contribution targets.For over a year leading up to the Paris UN climate gathering, Xie Zhenhua, who then steered China's climate diplomacy, held more than 20 rounds of consultations with COP21 president Laurent Fabius, Hu said.Close communicationDuring the Paris conference, they maintained close communication, he said. The duo met almost every day to discuss the differences that emerged during negotiations and strive to maximize convergence among countries."They played crucial roles in landing consensus on the final negotiation text," he said.Li Zheng, president of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University, said that through positive dialogue and cooperation, China and France made great contributions to addressing difficulties emerging in implementing the Paris Agreement.Since 2018, China and France have issued "three joint declarations and one initiative", all of which have emphasized cooperation in addressing climate change, he said. These documents have provided guidance for the continuous advancement of Sino-French and Sino-European climate cooperation, as well as global climate governance.Noting significant complementarity in technology and markets between the two countries, Li said the two countries can further enhance policy dialogue and pragmatic cooperation in many sectors, including carbon markets and circular economy.He said the two countries can also help accelerate the world's green, low-carbon transition and innovation by rolling out cooperation programs in other countries.Fang Li, country director of the World Resources Institute China, said all the joint statements China and France have issued have consistently emphasized the importance of cooperation in addressing climate change."The proportion of environmental content, such as climate change and biodiversity conservation, in these documents has been steadily increasing," she said. "In the joint statement of 2018, environmental content accounted for 5 out of the 27 items, which is less than 20 percent in proportion, while in 2019 and 2023, the proportion exceeded 40 percent."She said the two countries can potentially make even greater contributions to global sustainable development by joining hands to upgrade climate governance mechanisms in the post-Paris Agreement era and promote green financing.Deepening tourism cooperation between China and Europe will help vitalize the continent's economy, as tourism is one of its pillar industries.Figures from travel agencies show that tour products to Europe have become hot sellers since early 2023 after China loosened outbound travel restrictions following the pandemic.Traditionally popular European destinations such as France, Spain and Greece remain top choices for Chinese travelers, while "niche "destinations like Serbia and Montenegro have also become trendy."Some European destinations including Athens, Berlin, Milan and Zurich have seen an upsurge in searches on our platform recently," said online travel agency Qunar.For example, from April 22 to 28, searches for tour products to Athens nearly tripled, while searches for Berlin-related products almost quadrupled compared with the previous week.Qi Chunguang, vice-president of Tuniu, said that destinations in Central and Eastern Europe have also lured more Chinese travelers because of lower costs and more friendly visa policies."A continuous trip to Austria, Czech Republic and Hungary usually costs 25,000 yuan ($3,500) to 30,000 yuan per person during summer time, while a trip to the United Kingdom and Ireland costs nearly 40,000 yuan per person over the summer," he said. "Also, adding direct flights from China to destinations in Eastern Europe and more convenient visa application procedures make Central and Eastern Europe more attractive."Tourism industry insiders said that Europe delights in seeing more Chinese travelers, who will inject life into the continent's economy and help boost tourism-related employment.Data analysis company Statista — founded in Hamburg, Germany — said the total contribution of travel and tourism to Europe's GDP was around $2.1 trillion in 2019, the year before the pandemic hit, while that dropped to around $1.9 trillion in 2022.Travel and tourism account for a great share of some economies in Europe — for example, 24.8 percent of Croatia's GDP came from travel and tourism in 2019, according to Statista.Sandra Carvao, chief of tourism market intelligence and competitiveness at the World Tourism Organization, told People's Daily in a recent interview that China is one of the world's largest sources of travelers, so the recovery of China's tourism market is key to Europe's tourism industry development.Eduardo Santander, executive director of the European Travel Commission, told People's Daily that destinations in Europe have made great efforts to attract Chinese travelers, such as deepening cooperation with China's airline companies and organizing tourism exhibitions in China.He said China had been the second largest source of travelers to Europe before the pandemic, and he hopes to see a growing number of Chinese travelers come to the continent this year.There is significant potential for Sino-French environmental and climate cooperation, and such cooperation can generate synergy that leads to more effective and innovative solutions to global environmental challenges, according to a senior French executive.Christophe Maquet, senior executive vice-president of French environmental solutions provider Veolia Group, made the remarks in an exclusive interview with China Daily in the lead-up to President Xi Jinping's visit to France, Serbia and Hungary from May 5 to 10.Maquet, who is also director of Veolia's Asia-Pacific Zone and CEO of Veolia China, noted that the company has been a significant participant in China's environmental sector since the early 1990s.From urban water and waste services, Veolia quickly expanded its scope in the country to include all its business sectors — water, waste, renewable energy and energy management, he said.With over 11,000 employees in China, Veolia offers comprehensive environmental services across more than 100 sites in over 40 cities for municipal and industrial clients on the Chinese mainland, he said.In China last year, Veolia provided 15 million people with drinking water, recycled 46,095 metric tons of plastics and treated 55 million tons of industrial wastewater, he said. Through its expertise in water, waste and energy, Veolia avoided carbon emissions in China to the tune of more than 880,000 tons.Last year, the company signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Center for International Economic and Technological Cooperation, an affiliate of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.The agreement aims to deepen the collaboration between the two entities to accelerate green industry transformation. A key focus of it is to promote industrial green low-carbon transformation, Maquet said. This involves sharing and implementing best practices, technologies and solutions that enhance energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in industrial processes."The strategic cooperation agreement represents a significant step in leveraging Veolia's global expertise and the Chinese government's commitment to sustainable and green initiatives," he said.Veolia is also cooperating with Xinhui Industrial Park in Jiangmen, Guangdong province. In March, CIETC supported Veolia and its partners in holding a forum on plastic recycling, sharing their experience in building a green supply chain.Maquet believes President Xi's visit to France will provide new opportunities for Sino-French cooperation in environmental protection and addressing climate change."I am convinced so, especially considering that climate and environment protection have been a priority for both China and France," he noted.Based on the experience and insights from Veolia's operations in China, he noted several areas that hold significant potential for environmental and climate cooperation between the two countries, including resource recycling and circular economy, carbon reduction and energy.The two countries' cooperation on resource recycling and the circular economy can include initiatives such as establishing recycling centers and promoting a circular economy, which aligns with both French and Chinese objectives to reduce pollution and increase resource efficiency, he said.Decarbonization is an important area for both France and China, he continued. This involves deploying innovative technologies and solutions such as CCUS (carbon capture, use and storage) to reduce carbon footprints, aligning with China's climate targets for peaking carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060."In terms of energy, both countries are expected to cooperate further to accelerate the transition toward renewable energy, including biomass, wind power, solar energy, hydrogen, geothermal, etc., to fulfill their promises of carbon neutrality," he said."Both China and France are influential global players. Their cooperation on environmental issues can set an example for other nations, particularly in policymaking, technological innovation and commitment to international agreements like the Paris Agreement," Maquet said.Sino-French cooperation can facilitate green technology exchanges and promote economic growth in the green sector, he said, adding that cooperation can generate synergy that leads to more effective and innovative solutions to global environmental challenges."Cooperation between China and France benefits the two nations and contributes to global efforts to combat climate change and protect the environment for future generations," he said."The anniversary will strengthen our bonds in our shared history," said Eric Alauzet in a recent interview with Xinhua News Agency, referring to the 60th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations.As president of the France-China Friendship Group of the French National Assembly, and as a practitioner of acupuncture, his personal experiences reflect the history of mutual understanding and cooperation between France and China.His passion for Chinese culture began with traditional Chinese medicine, particularly acupuncture. At the end of his medical studies in Paris, his university started offering a course called "alternative medicine" that included acupuncture."I immediately had a very strong interest in acupuncture. Why? Because I had this sensitivity to consider health from a holistic point of view, meaning our health should not only take into account psychological and physical dimensions, but also the influence of the environment," he said.He highlighted that unlike the rigid duality of the West, Chinese philosophy sees an interplay and transformation between yin and yang, creating a harmonious balance through their dynamic relationship.After 35 years of study and passion for Chinese culture, Alauzet visited China in April 2023 for the first time, accompanying French President Emmanuel Macron during his state visit.Six months later, he returned to China as the president of the France-China Friendship Group of the French National Assembly. The group focuses on parliamentary diplomacy, distinct from official trips, aiming to enhance mutual understanding and build on dialogues between presidents and ministers."We do not engage in formal commitments. Instead, our discussions aim to foster better understanding and to potentially build upon the dialogues initiated between our presidents and ministers," he said.For Alauzet, this year holds significance for both France and China. "Sixty is an incredibly important milestone in China — it marks the conclusion of one cycle and the commencement of a new era," he said.He said former French president Charles de Gaulle was a visionary who not only foresaw China's awakening and progress, but also anticipated China's role on the global stage. "Today, China is a heavyweight," he said.France, for its part as a heavyweight in Europe, can extend its global influence through collaboration with China, Alauzet noted. In a multipolar world, the dominance of a singular Western model is unlikely, he said.He highlighted that 60 years of ties are an achievement, and the shared festivities offer an opportunity to forge stronger connections. "It enables us to meet more, fostering new friendships," he said."I'm optimistic about our success, as it will bolster culture and human relations — the foundation of all relationships, including diplomatic and strategic ones," he added.Editor's note: China Daily presents the series Friends Afar to tell the stories of people-to-people exchanges between China and other countries. Through the vivid narration of the people in the stories, readers can get a better understanding of a country that is boosting openness.In 1994, when Loredana Cursano first set foot in China, she was immediately captivated by the country's charm. The journey marked the beginning of a 30-year relationship with China and sparked her desire to act as a bridge between the two cultures."Exploring cities like Xi'an, Lhasa, and Guilin exposed me to the profound history and diverse cultures of China," Cursano reminisced.She was equally astounded by the skyscrapers and modern urban landscapes of Beijing, Shanghai and other metropolises."Three decades ago, as China's economy began to soar, I foresaw its potential to lead global development," she said.Initially, she worked for a telecommunications company in Italy. However, upon retiring, she dedicated herself to fostering cultural exchange between Italy and China.In 2008, her family relocated to Via Paolo Sarpi Street in Milan for work, situated at the heart of the largest and oldest Chinatown in Italy."Unlike other areas filled with 'Made in Italy' goods, our neighborhood exudes Chinese cultural richness, with neon-lit Chinese language signs adorning grocery stores, restaurants, and supermarkets, alongside vibrant red lanterns," Cursano said.Gradually, she befriended Chinese families who had immigrated to Italy in the past century, actively engaging in community activities and learning about their journeys. Her bond with the Chinese community deepened over time.Last year, Cursano joined the Orient Bridge Association, a nonprofit organization dedicated to strengthening cultural ties between China and Italy."I plan to organize cultural exchanges to facilitate better integration of the Chinese community into local society. For instance, culinary events will be held where Chinese and Italian women can share parenting insights and collaborate on building a cohesive neighborhood," she said.A year after moving to Chinatown, Cursano gave birth to her daughter, Clotilde Russo, now 15 years old. At the age of 6, Clotilde began learning Chinese at her mother's encouragement."China's global significance and vast market offer immense opportunities. Learning the Chinese language allows my daughter to appreciate the profound Chinese civilization and tap into these opportunities," Cursano said.Clotilde started attending Chinese language classes in Milan at weekends, with additional sessions during school breaks with Chinese students at their homes."At the language school, I've delved into Chinese history and culture and forged many friendships," Clotilde said.Looking ahead, she aspires to study at a Chinese university. "China feels like a second home I've yet to explore," she said.Cursano fully supports her daughter's aspirations, expressing her willingness to accompany Clotilde to China if she decides to study there. "My daughter is like a half-Chinese now, and I'm delighted she maintains her connection with China," she affirmed.Over the past 30 years, the Italian kept catching up with the latest news in China. "Western media often portray China negatively, but it's far from the truth. In the face of misinformation, we must remain levelheaded and discern fake news," she said."China and Italy share more similarities than differences. … As the saying goes in Italy, Tutto il mondo e' un paese (it's the same all the world over)," Cursano said.Contact the writers at liujianqiao@chinadaily.com.cn.The China Cultural Center in the heart of Paris epitomizes the thriving relationship between China and France, driving a significant wave of cultural exchanges that have engaged audiences and enriched communities worldwide.Liu Hongge, the center's director, said that France provides the optimal environment for cultural exchanges, and the interactions between Beijing and Paris not only spearhead developments in relations between China and Western countries, but also advance ties with other nations."The compatibility, significance and effectiveness of these exchanges are unmatched. These interactions are uniquely distinctive and exceptionally prominent," he said.Sino-French cultural exchanges have progressed to a new level since 2002, marked by significant and expansive interactions between the two countries. The China-France mutual cultural years from 2003 to 2005 emerged as milestones, followed by France's establishment of cultural centers across China.The China Cultural Center in Paris, also founded in 2002, has played a vital role in this cultural resurgence. It has been instrumental in coordinating a broad spectrum of activities that showcase the richness and diversity of Chinese culture, continually enhancing the cultural connection between France and China.Liu said the center organizes about 130 to 140 cultural activities annually, which encompass exhibition openings, diverse performances, salons and daily educational sessions.Central to the center's mission are the monthly lectures and cultural exchanges that provide in-depth insights into Chinese history, art and society."These events act as a bridge between our two cultures, enhancing mutual understanding and friendship," Liu said. "It's about sharing stories and experiences that transcend borders and language barriers."The center also offers a comprehensive curriculum of Chinese language courses, calligraphy workshops and music lessons, cultivating a deep appreciation for Chinese culture among French people. "Our aim is to create enduring connections and foster a genuine appreciation for Chinese culture," the director said.Another key highlight in the cultural exchanges between the two countries is the expanding Chinese Film Festival. Originally spanning seven cities, this year's festival will reach 10 cities, broadening the exposure of French audiences to Chinese film culture through screenings.This year also marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France, and the center has significantly influenced France's cultural landscape.A key event of the year was the collaboration with Berck-sur-Mer International Kite Festival, where China was honored as the guest nation, a vital part of the 2024 China-France Cultural Tourism Year.The integration of Chinese cultural elements into the festival's vibrant atmosphere attracted over 300,000 participants in April, marking a significant milestone in cultural exchanges. "It was a celebration of tradition and innovation, bringing together people from various backgrounds to experience the beauty of Chinese culture," Liu said.Contact the writers at wangmingjie@mail.chinadailyuk.com China and France are poised to enter a new era of energy cooperation, with a focus on the nuclear and offshore wind sectors, as both countries actively seek ways to enhance energy security and mitigate climate change, said industry experts.With China's ambitious targets for carbon neutrality and France's expertise in renewable energy and nuclear power, the partnership between the two nations is poised to catalyze innovation and propel sustainable development initiatives, said Luo Zuoxian, head of intelligence and research at the Sinopec Economics and Development Research Institute.In recent years, bilateral energy agreements between the two nations have gained momentum, spanning areas such as renewable energy investment, nuclear technology exchanges and joint research initiatives. This deepening cooperation underscores the shared commitment to address global energy challenges and the transition toward a low-carbon future, said Luo.As geopolitical dynamics evolve and climate imperatives intensify, the China-France energy partnership has emerged as a beacon of cooperation in addressing pressing global challenges and redefining the landscape of international energy cooperation, he said.Energy cooperation between China and France dates back to the establishment of the Daya Bay nuclear power plant project in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, in the 1980s.The nuclear power industry in France, one of the first major Western countries to recognize the People's Republic of China, had been enjoying a golden age since the 1970s.China entrusted France with the responsibility for building the plant and Electricite De France, or EDF, France's state-owned power utility company, undertook to ensure that the plant would be built, Herve Machenaud, former technical director of EDF from 1984 to 1989 on the construction of China's first nuclear power plant, was quoted as saying by Xinhua News Agency."EDF put its trust in China, and China put its trust in EDF, a contract of trust that has kept the parties together for 40 years," he said.The Daya Bay nuclear power plant went into commercial operation in 1995. EDF and its Chinese partner, China General Nuclear Power Group, then launched another project nearby, the Ling Ao nuclear power plant, which began commercial operations in 2002.In 2008, the two partners set up a joint venture to construct and operate two nuclear reactors based on European Pressurized Reactor technology in Taishan, Guangdong.Currently, energy cooperation between China and France not only encompasses traditional fields such as oil and gas, but also extends to emerging areas including nuclear and renewable energy, energy storage and electric vehicles.China Energy Investment Corp signed an agreement with EDF last year to construct an offshore green hydrogen facility for energy storage in Jiangsu province, which will have a total installed capacity of 1.5 gigawatts. The two parties will also expand their cooperation to cover an offshore wind, solar power, hydrogen and energy storage pilot project in the province.An analyst said the cooperation, holding immense potential not only for expanding renewable energy capacity but also for fostering technological exchanges and driving down costs, will ultimately benefit both nations and the broader international community while furthering EDF's lower carbon energy initiatives in China.Cooperation between China and France in offshore wind projects signifies a strategic convergence of expertise and resources, with both nations poised to leverage their respective strengths in technology and investment to drive sustainable energy development.Zhu Yicong, senior analyst in the fields of renewables and power research with global consultancy Rystad Energy, said, "China has been quite cautious in selecting foreign developers for offshore wind projects, due to the consideration of energy security as well as oceanic data security.""French power company EDF was the first foreign entity to co-invest in offshore wind projects in China and the cooperation, which expanded in scale last year, has proven successful," she said."The cooperation between China Energy and EDF further strengthened the two giants' advantages in the offshore wind market, and has also increased the potential for exploring other markets outside China."Zhu said that offshore wind development plays a crucial role in China's energy transition, as it has the advantages of higher resource availability and higher generation efficiency, and remains closer to the coastal area power demand centers compared to large-scale onshore wind and solar projects. "Offshore wind projects also have the potential to reduce carbon emissions for other oceanic operations, such as providing green power for offshore oil and gas exploration and production, and we have already seen such projects operating in China," she said.The former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has highlighted the profound significance of President Xi Jinping's three-day visit to France, particularly amid the current turbulent geopolitical landscape and global uncertainties, saying it is not only timely but essential for fostering a deeper mutual understanding and strengthening collaborative efforts between the two nations."The visit of President Xi Jinping to France marks a pivotal moment, especially when the world faces such perilous challenges," Raffarin said in an exclusive interview with China Daily. "We cannot envision the world's future without considering China, and, likewise, it is not in China's interest to disregard Europe."He emphasized the necessity of continuous dialogue with China, stating: "We need to have a very regular dialogue with China. I think that Emmanuel Macron is the leader of the West who best understands Xi Jinping's thinking, having spent many hours discussing with the Chinese president."The latest discussions between Xi and Macron are expected to cover urgent global issues, including climate change and strategic geopolitical questions.Raffarin expressed his satisfaction with the focus of the talks, recognizing their importance not just for France or China, but for the entire world."These discussions are vital, as the world navigates through a dangerous period," he said.Raffarin, who served as prime minister from 2002 to 2005, asserted that France holds a unique position in Europe, having established a model for engaging in meaningful discussions with China, choosing cooperation over confrontation."France probably has the closest relationship with China within Europe, despite differing viewpoints. We share a vision of a multilateral world," he explained.During the interview, Raffarin laid out what he sees as the key areas for enhancing cooperation between France and China, emphasizing cultural exchange, environmental preservation and the establishment of new multilateral regulations as foundational elements of the partnership."We need to focus on cultural questions to understand the societies between France and China better. Furthermore, protecting our planet for future generations is now a priority, necessitating a global consensus, particularly among the young people," Raffarin said.He also touched upon the need for common regulations in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, or AI, suggesting they could form the basis for the reform of global multilateralism.Addressing strategic misalignments in global politics, particularly regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the 75-year-old emphasized a strong and balanced Europe is beneficial for China.Looking ahead, Raffarin voiced his concern about the current direction of global politics, advocating strongly for cooperation over confrontation."In a world leaning toward confrontation, we need to steer back toward cooperation," he said. "This is the only way forward for a stable and prosperous global community."He added that he views Xi's visit as a cornerstone for not only reinforcing the China-France relationship but also setting a precedent for how major global powers should interact in an increasingly multipolar world.As tensions continue to rise on various fronts, the collaboration between China and France could indeed play a crucial role in navigating the complex web of international relations, he noted.Raffarin welcomed Xi's commitment to expanding access and welcoming French companies and investment into China, underscoring the need for reciprocal relations between China and Europe."What we seek is reciprocity," he said. "The rules that apply to Chinese companies in Europe should similarly apply to European companies in China."In 1958, the Fifth Republic was established in France. General Charles de Gaulle, back in office, pursued an independent foreign policy and attached greater importance to enhancing relations with China.In 1963, former French prime minister Edgar Faure briefed President de Gaulle about his visit to China, describing how Chairman Mao welcomed him with the words: "You arrive on time".Three months later, on 27 January 1964, China and France issued a joint communiqué, announcing the establishment of diplomatic relations. It also marked the first major Western country to establish formal diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China. It was an important step because of the significant light it shed not only on Sino-French relations but on the wider dynamics in Sino-European relations during the decisive period in the 1960s and early 1970s.France and China, while standing firm by their principles, showed flexibility in the negotiations to accommodate as much as they could the concerns of the other side. Both secured the diplomatic relations with a practical and forthcoming approach, setting a fine example of the art of negotiation in the history of diplomacy.2024 marks the 60th anniversary of France's recognition of the People's Republic of China, making it an opportunity for the two countries to communicate their cooperation and friendship. It is also the China-France Year of Culture and Tourism.As a student in 1999, I recall witnessing the then Chinese president Jiang Zemin walking down the streets of Lyon city, through the old quarters of Saint-Jean, with then French president Jacques Chirac. France and China have a long record of understanding and consideration. We share a mutual respect that has grown over the years.Last year, on his first visit to Guangzhou, I had the chance to visit Shamian island with French President Emmanuel Macron and Sylvain Fourriere, our consul general in South China. We talked about Lingnan culture, Guangdong province and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, and also about the crucial functions and missions being played by our civil institutions such as the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China and Alliance Francaise that are always trying to build bridges and relationship between the two cultures.Today, in this post-pandemic era, we can see the first warning signs of a new global order. So what is the status of the relationship and cooperation between France and China?This anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties is taking place against the backdrop of an incredibly special and unstable context, but France has been continuously trying to have a comprehensive and consistent long-term vision about China. French-Chinese cooperation exists in many important fields where France excels. Other than in luxury goods and cosmetics, scientific and technological cooperation between France and China have been a cornerstone of the relationship. From aerospace and the nuclear civil industry to renewable energy, the two countries have made significant strides in joint research and development in fields such as education, academic research, pharmaceuticals, biotech and agriculture.The next step in France-China cooperation should be in new emerging technologies such as computational neurocognitive sciences, artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics and knowledge management. France is developing interesting "research laboratories of excellence", specializing in breakthrough innovation and exploring avenues such as adjacent innovation and radical innovation. France and China can pool their resources to tackle global challenges, deepen cooperation and open up the future.They are engaged in the sectors of renewable energies, biodiversity cooperation and maritime conservation. Both countries are committed to pursuing a prominent level of dialogue about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 2030 and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, maintaining a genuine dialogue that differs from others.China and France have this ability to inspire others, to communicate and spread new narratives, and new collaborative innovation can encourage the global community to aspire for a future marked by cohesiveness.Seizing the occasion presented by the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between France and China, China is willing to reinforce dialogue, deepen and expand cooperation, and push bilateral economic and trade relations to a new level. France is also willing to boost communication with China to inject new momentum into France-China economic and trade cooperation. In an interview with Xinhua News two months ago, former French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius said that China and France are both committed to independence as well as multilateralism and peace. "We do not want a bloc policy, with the risks of conflicts that this entails," he said.Recently, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed the same ideas, that China and France should strengthen strategic coordination and deepen cooperation to contribute to global peace and stability. He made the remarks during his meeting with Macron in Paris, saying that the two heads of state have established a strong mutual trust and a sincere friendship, and guided the development of bilateral strategic cooperation, exerting a profound and positive influence on the world.President Macron and President Xi Jinping are meeting again in Paris to celebrate and to open up a new page of China-France friendly relations. In these complicated times and challenging periods, let us not focus on economic hostility, but rather on cooperation and common dialogue. China should better understand France's leading role in the European Union, its influence among emerging countries, and its positive role in advancing multilateralism and cultural diversity. As for France, it needs to be more inclusive toward China's development and path to modernization.It is time for the whole world to adopt symbiotic cooperation and technological innovation rather than succumb to misguided isolationism and disruptive protectionism. Of late, the focus of global discussions reflects a multifaceted methodology that intertwines economic diplomacy, strategic alliances and a concerted push toward sustainable development. During this period of turbulence and transformation, China and France are pushing for the implementation of initiatives to benefit all.Progress and advancements in technology have catalyzed a shift in the focus of strategic competition between major powers. New mechanisms are highly needed, and France and China can be even more committed to building a more innovation-driven development architecture, a more inclusive international order, while striving for peace and development. Currently, there is a lack of universally accepted and binding international rules in emerging technologies, to build an innovative technology governance mechanism featuring more cooperation, stimulating the potential of targeted breakthrough innovation."The mutual openness of our two nations is indispensable," said the French president. The Xi-Macron meeting in Paris comes a year after the French president visited Beijing and Guangzhou. As the world undergoes profound historical changes, the French believe in engagement with China based on friendship and effective diplomacy. There is a need for interdependence based on mutually beneficial support built on the foundation of mutual trust. By joining hands, China and France will help prevent and avert new divisions in this shattered world, trying to instill hope that both countries will play a positive role in conflict resolutions.The author is executive vice president of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China.When one evokes a city steeped in romantic allure in China, none can rival Hangzhou and the tragic yet eternal tale of "butterfly lovers".The enchanting city is known for a love legend that has endured the passage of time, weaving its way into the very fabric of Hangzhou's identity.For centuries, Hangzhou has been renowned for its picturesque landscapes and timeless charm. At the heart of the romantic glamor lies the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, considered the Chinese equivalent of Romeo and Juliet. Their romantic yet tragic story has long touched the hearts of generations and has been transformed into The Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto, blending Chinese opera elements with Western classical techniques.Listeners are transported to the serene settings of Hangzhou, where the story of Liang and Zhu unfolds amid the tranquil West Lake. The lyrical yet strong rhythm captures their ardent love and heartbreaking separation that ultimately leads to their demise and transformation into a pair of butterflies.The concerto stands as one of the most famous Chinese orchestral works, transcending cultural boundaries and resonating with listeners worldwide.From the scenic banks of the Grand Canal to the serene trails of the Xixi National Wetland Park, Hangzhou is never short of romantic allure, with the placid waters of West Lake having inspired countless works of art and poems.To Rudy Salles, deputy chairman of the Nice Cote d'Azur Metropolitan Tourist Office, the sister-city relationship between Nice on the French Riviera and Hangzhou in East China is a perfect match.Spanning about 9,300 kilometers, the two vibrant cities have been fostering a unique bond since their official declaration as sister cities in 1998.Having visited Hangzhou several times, Salles describes it as a "beautiful city", a metropolis boasting a population of 12 million.The two cities have actively nurtured their connection through numerous initiatives, including extending invitations to each other's major events, he said.Salles was fascinated by the "incredible" shows on the West Lake that he has watched several times, and the dinners he has had by the lake."I remember all that and I hope I will go back as soon as possible," said the 69-year-old, who was a member of the French National Assembly from 1988 to 2017, including serving as its vice-president.Salles also recalled a Nice food festival at the Dragon Hotel Hangzhou, where traditional food, such as salade nicoise — made from tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, olives and anchovies or tuna and dressed with olive oil, and pan bagnat, a sandwich made from whole wheat bread enclosing the classic salade nicoise, was served.Hangzhou had received an invitation to attend the annual carnival in Nice, one of the largest in the world, which concluded in March.In 2017, ahead of the 20th anniversary of the sister-city ties, Hangzhou Opera and Dance Drama Theater staged the show To Meet the Grand Canal in Nice, at the invitation of the Nice government.Prestigious positionsBoth Hangzhou's Grand Canal and West Lake, along with the city of Nice itself, hold prestigious positions on the UNESCO World Heritage List."We have many exchanges like this, cultural exchanges between our two cities, and we are proud of it," Salles said.Nice has developed links with many other Chinese cities, he said, such as Hong Kong, Macao, Ningbo, Xiamen and Zhuhai.Nice had become the second-most popular destination after Paris for Chinese tourists in France, Salles said. During his term as the city's deputy mayor, he had called for efforts to attract Chinese tourists.Emphasizing the importance of exchanges between China and France, Salles said people in France should know more about China, and Chinese should know more about France.Having visited several Chinese cities, he said, "It's important for French people to discover China, because it's not just three or four cities, but many new and beautiful cities."It's a modern country, very well-organized, welcoming to foreigners."I just want to tell the people who don't know China — that the progress in China in the last 50 years has been enormous."chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cnVilla Kerylos, a house in the ancient Greek Revival-style overlooking the Mediterranean, was little known among the Chinese until French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte greeted Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan there on March 24, 2019, during Xi's state visit to France.A 20-minute drive from Nice, the villa was built between 1902 and 1908 by architect Emmanuel Pontremoli for archaeologist Theodore Reinach, based on the model of the noble houses of the Greek island of Delos in the 2nd century BC. Kerylos means "sea swallow", a bird considered a good omen in Greek mythology.Reinach commissioned the exact copies of ancient Greek chairs, taborets and klismos furniture that were kept in the National Archaeological Museum in Naples, Italy. The interior of the house integrated influences from Rome, Pompeii and Egypt. The house boasted all the latest 20th century features at the time, such as plumbing and underfloor heating systems.Reinach spent his holidays there with his family. After his death in 1928, he bequeathed the property to the Institut de France, of which he was a member. The villa was listed as a historical monument by the French Ministry of Culture in 1966, and is now a museum that is open to the public.President Xi Jinping's state visit to France "will be the climax of a series of events celebrating the 60th anniversary of the establishment of China-France diplomatic relations", said Chinese Ambassador to France Lu Shaye.During the visit starting on Sunday, Xi will embark on thorough, in-depth strategic communication with French President Emmanuel Macron on China-France and China-EU relations, Lu said.The visit will help encourage France's commitment to strategic autonomy, openness and cooperation, and will also help Europe "shape a more independent, objective and friendly perception of China", he said.This is Xi's second visit to France and Europe in five years, and the first leg of the head of state's first trip abroad this year.The ambassador stressed the need to "cope with the uncertainty of the world through the stability of China-France relations", and to make good use of the all-around and high-level communication channels between the two countries.The goal is to "make sure ties are always at the forefront of relations between China and Western countries", he said.In recent years, various departments of the two sides have carried forward the consensus reached by the two heads of state via three major dialogue mechanisms — strategic dialogue; high-level economic and financial dialogue; and high-level cultural exchanges.France is China's third-largest trading partner and third-largest source of actual investment from the European Union. China is France's largest trading partner in Asia.Last year, bilateral trade accounted for $78.9 billion despite global trade headwinds, and China's imports from France grew by 5.5 percent year-on-year, according to the Ministry of Commerce.Wang Wentao, minister of commerce, said in Paris last month that the balance of bilateral trade "has been further improved"."The two sides are actively exploring the potential for cooperation in emerging areas such as green industry and clean energy," Lu said.It is important to "safeguard the health and stability of the international economic and trade system through the openness of China-France practical cooperation", and to jointly maintain the stability and resilience of the industrial supply chain, he said.Beijing welcomes France as the guest country of honor at this year's China International Fair for Trade in Services and the seventh China International Import Expo, he noted."I believe there will be more French companies investing, thriving and winning in China," he added, expressing his desire to also see further exchanges in the cultural arena.The Summer Olympic Games will be held this year in Paris, marking the second time the French capital has hosted the event in the past 100 years.Lu stated his hope that China-France sports exchanges and cooperation can tap into the Games to go deeper and become more practical, and "drive the bilateral relations to achieve greater development".Noting that France is a core and major member of the EU, Lu said China-France relations are "an important part of and a powerful engine for China-EU ties"."China has always managed its EU relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, and it regards Europe as a comprehensive strategic partner and an important force in the multipolar world," he said.It is imperative to reject negative ideas — such as those advocating "de-risking" and "reducing dependence" on China — and to ensure that China-France relations will continue to lead China-EU relations to a stable and far-reaching future, he said.At the same time, Lu underlined the need to "promote fair and reasonable global governance through the effectiveness of China-France multilateral cooperation"."China and France will maintain close communication and collaboration in multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, the Group of 20 and the World Trade Organization, and jointly practice true multilateralism," he said.zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com.cnChina and the European Union should increase cooperation on the environment and climate, making it a new engine for a bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership, according to a report released on Friday.The report, titled "China-EU Cooperation on Environment and Climate: Progress and Prospects", was jointly released by the Research Center for Xi Jinping Thought on Ecological Civilization, the National Energy Conservation Center, the Xinhua Institute, and the Institutes of Science and Development of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.The two sides should strengthen their green partnership, effectively leverage the important role of bilateral cooperation on environment and climate, making it a new engine for bilateral comprehensive strategic cooperation, a new highlight of bilateral economic and trade cooperation, a new bond for bilateral cultural cooperation, and a new model for global environment and climate cooperation, said the report.Adhering to a mechanism-led approach, the report noted that the China-EU High-Level Environment and Climate Dialogue should become the leading mechanism to further cooperation mechanisms involving multiple entities, levels and areas.Environment and climate topics can also be covered in other high-level mechanisms. For example, there could be dialogues and exchanges related to environmental products and services and green trade at the China-EU High-Level Economic and Trade Dialogue.Relevant parties should also be encouraged to establish bilateral exchange platforms for different entities, including local governments, think tanks, experts and enterprises. Local governments in China and EU member states should be encouraged to carry out environment and climate cooperation, establishing more sister provinces and sister cities, said the report.Universities of the two sides can explore ways to establish China-EU environment and climate institutes, while the China-EU Environmental Policy Research Center could fully play its role and build platforms for dialogue and cooperation between Chinese and European environment think tanks.To increase cooperation, the report urged efforts to strengthen dialogue and exchanges in fields such as clean energy, advanced energy-saving and carbon-reducing technology, green transportation, green buildings, methane, marine litter, key areas of pollution reduction and carbon reduction, circular economy, environmental technology and environmental trade.The China-EU Green Action should be launched to strengthen coordination and connection in fields including digital economy and artificial intelligence, thereby stimulating new momentum for bilateral green cooperation.The report also stressed further expansion of the coverage of cooperation, noting that triangular cooperation, such as "EU-China+Southeast Asia" or "EU-China+Africa" cooperation, should be enhanced.In conjunction with South-South cooperation on climate change, the green Belt and Road Initiative and other programs, new forms of China-EU cooperation can be explored, bringing in other parties from within the framework of South-South cooperation and the Belt and Road Initiative, said the report.Considering that developing countries face the dual tasks of pollution control and carbon reduction, the report also called for designing cooperation projects able to address both environmental and climate issues.The importance of cultural exchanges and people-to-people connections was highlighted at a seminar co-hosted by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Paris-based National Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilizations, in the French capital on Friday.More than 100 experts and scholars from major think tanks, universities and research institutes in China and France attended the seminar titled "Exchanges and Mutual Learning Between Chinese and French Civilizations: Review and Outlook".Topics such as the practice and testimony of civilizational exchanges, retrospections and reflection on mutual learning between civilizations, as well as the role scientific and technological innovation will play in the future of human civilization, were discussed at the event.Gao Xiang, president of the CASS, said at the opening ceremony that strengthening mutual learning and enriching cultural exchanges between the two countries are an inherent requirement for advancing people-to-people connectivity, consolidating the foundation of mutual trust and deepening partnership, especially as China and France commemorate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of their diplomatic ties.He stressed the importance of equality, inclusiveness and a consensus of cooperation in the process of exchanges and mutual learning between China and France, and expressed faith that deepening cooperation and exchanges between the two countries will create a strong impetus for the further implementation of the Global Civilization Initiative.Jean-Francois Huchet, president of the French institute, reviewed the development of academic exchanges between China and France over the past few decades.He said that his institute has been expanding the scale of Chinese language and culture education, with more China-related subjects in fields such as philosophy, sociology, anthropology and economics being taught, and increasingly more diverse topics being studied.Huchet added that a younger generation of scholars has shown a strong, persistent interest in China and has been willing to conduct research and gain firsthand knowledge.According to Nicolas Idier, inspector-general of Chinese language education at the French Ministry of National Education, Youth and Sports, Chinese is the most widely taught non-European language in France, and the fifth most widely taught foreign language in the country.Idier stressed the importance of foreign language education despite changes in the international situation and certain convenience brought by digital technologies, particularly the development of artificial intelligence.He expressed hope that by learning foreign languages including Chinese, as well as the cultures embedded, students can have a better understanding of the world's major challenges and the true meaning of sustainable development.During the seminar, the French editions of eight titles on China's economics, politics, social governance, history and aesthetics were released, as a joint effort of the China Social Sciences Press, attached to the CASS, and French publishing houses including Editions You Feng.PARIS — A forum on the development of people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and France was held on Saturday, in a bid to boost cooperation and mutual learning.The participants agreed that strengthening cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and France will help broaden consensus and deepen mutual trust with fresh vitality in the new era.This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France, and is also the China-France Year of Culture and Tourism.In his opening speech, President of Xinhua News Agency Fu Hua said the forum, held on the eve of Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to France, is of great significance in boosting cooperation between the media, think tanks and enterprises from the two countries, and in facilitating cultural exchange and mutual learning.Fu said that Xinhua has been dedicated to telling stories about the friendship between the two countries and promoting the Chinese and French cultures."We are willing to work with Chinese and French media outlets, think tanks and other organizations to uphold the principle of equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness among civilizations, and promote the common values of all humanity," he said.Xinhua is ready to jointly showcase the fruits of China-France cooperation, demonstrate the charms of the two countries' traditional cultures and the unique highlights of their modern civilizations, and broaden the bridge of people-to-people exchange and cultural cooperation, Fu noted.Xinhua also stands ready to seize such opportunities as the China-France Year of Culture and Tourism and the Paris Olympic Games to try to hold more cultural exchange activities to push bilateral relations to a new high.China's Ambassador to France Lu Shaye said people-to-people and cultural exchanges are an important foundation and inexhaustible driving force for China-France relations.The two countries are set to launch dozens of cultural and tourism events this year, bringing important opportunities for people-to-people and cultural exchanges, the ambassador said.Lu also expressed his belief that under the strategic guidance of President Xi and President Macron, bilateral ties are bound to show vigor and vitality in the future, and the booming cultural exchanges and cooperation will also lay a more solid public opinion foundation for the sound and stable development of bilateral ties."Culture constitutes the strongest cement between our civilizations," Eric Alauzet, president of the France-China Friendship Group of the French National Assembly, said at the forum.The common history of the two countries after the establishment of diplomatic ties has nourished fruitful cultural and people-to-people exchanges, which have in turn driven cooperation and development in other areas, he said.Bilateral cooperation has achieved many outcomes in economy and trade, and in joint efforts against climate change, Alauzet added, noting that the two countries have held various cultural exchange activities this year, which will further push forward bilateral relations.Saturday's forum was co-sponsored by Xinhua News Agency, the Chinese Embassy in France, and Publicis Groupe, a French multinational advertising and public relations company.Themed "Reinforcing People-to-people and Cultural Exchanges, Promoting the China-France Spirit", the forum drew around 250 representatives from the Chinese and French governments, the United Nations and other international organizations, mainstream global media outlets, think tanks as well as people from cultural and business circles of the two countries.Prior to the opening of the forum, Xinhua News Agency signed a memorandum of understanding with Publicis Groupe.XinhuaChina and France, with diplomatic ties going back six decades, are pointing the way for the green transition, showing that in tackling the challenges facing all of humanity, cooperation is crucial.Facing common threats such as global warming, which is causing extreme weather challenges worldwide, enterprises from both China and France are working together on green solutions and products.As one move toward achieving carbon neutrality, France is building its northern industrial hub of Dunkirk into a "Battery Valley" to attract the participation of multinational battery enterprises, including those from China. In addition to the participation of battery companies, enterprises such as China State Construction Engineering Corp Ltd and BETOM Group, a prominent French engineering design firm, are contributing to the development of the future battery hub.One hurdle to development of the hub was the fact that differences exist between the two countries in areas such as construction standards, environmental regulations and administrative procedures. This is where cooperation between China Mediterranean Holding SAS, an overseas unit of China State Construction Engineering Corp, and BETOM came in."Localization is a major hurdle confronting Chinese players extending their footprint in the 'Battery Valley'. We are keen to bridge this gap," said Lyu Taizhong, director of China Mediterranean Holding's European business department.As an engineering design institute with nearly 60 years' experience, BETOM "plays a key role in supporting CSCEC's overseas business", Lyu said. A team well-versed in both Chinese and European construction standards has been formed as part of the cooperative efforts, with employees from both China and France.Christophe Lac, general manager of BETOM, said that "such a 'mixture' brews fruitful results in our major business areas, including building, engineering and consulting. This engineering design institute is providing comprehensive engineering consulting services for numerous Chinese battery investment companies in the 'Battery Valley'.""Thanks to knowledge about both the needs of Chinese clients and the regulation and operation rules in the French market, the team is clearing away the myriad obstacles for customers from both sides to facilitate project implementation," Lac said.The cooperation is a reflection of the flourishing economic exchanges between the two countries as well as the commitments of companies from both sides in each other's market.Pernod Ricard, a French wine and spirits group, said that after achieving 6 percent year-on-year growth in the Chinese market in its 2023 fiscal year, it will focus on premium and diversified products in the years ahead."China stands as Pernod Ricard's second-largest market, where we have established a presence for over 30 years," said Jerome Cottin-Bizonne, CEO of Pernod Ricard China. "We will respond promptly to ever-evolving market and consumer demands in the country."Since China and France established diplomatic relations in 1964, their bilateral trade has increased more than 800-fold. Today, China is France's largest trading partner in Asia, while France is China's third-largest trading partner and the third-largest source of actual investment within the European Union, according to data from China's Ministry of Commerce.Sino-French trade reached $78.9 billion in 2023, with imports from France increasing 5.5 percent year-on-year, the ministry said.France had established more than 6,000 companies in China by the end of 2021, with investment exceeding $18 billion, and it has expanded innovative business models in China.In addition to investing in innovative ecosystems through partnerships with Chinese companies, many French companies, such as Schneider Electric and Sanofi, have established research and development centers in China.By the end of 2023, China had been the top Asian country in terms of investment and job creation in France for three consecutive years, with nearly $4.9 billion in direct investment. Chinese companies have invested in over 900 French companies, employing more than 50,000 local employees in France, according to the Beijing-based China Chamber of International Commerce.Despite some European politicians advocating of decoupling from China, French companies have consistently maintained a clear and objective stance, basing their actions on facts and upholding mutually beneficial and pragmatic cooperation with China, said Cai Tongjuan, a researcher at Renmin University of China's Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies.Cai said that China and France both possess strong capabilities and advantages, and through cooperation, they can achieve mutual benefits and win-win results, promoting the balance and stability of the global economy.China's ongoing consumption and industrial upgrading boom will continue to attract French investment to China in many areas, such as high-end manufacturing and green development, in the years ahead, she added.China and Europe after a sustained, pragmatic, and in-depth cooperation on water governance, have both made significant contributions to cope with the world's escalating water security challenges, an official with the Ministry of Water Resources said.In an exclusive interview with China Daily, Xu Jing, deputy director general of the ministry's Department of International Cooperation, Science, and Technology, depicted a long history of close and friendly cooperation in water resources management between China and European countries."Since the launch of the China-EU River Basin Management Program in 2007, China and Europe have carried out in-depth research and extensive exchanges in river basin management, flood prevention and mitigation, groundwater management and measures responding to climate change."Aside from implementing extensive personnel exchanges and visits, they have also translated and published a series of policy documents and technical manuals," she said.Xu noted the establishment of the China-Europe Water Platform in 2012 as an important event that marked the beginning of a significant leap forward for the two sides in promoting eco-friendly cooperation in the water resources governance sector.Since then, the two sides have conducted rich pragmatic activities, with focuses on policy exchange, scientific research, and business exchanges, the official noted.She said China and Europe have held nine ministerial-level dialogues and jointly issued five ministerial-level declarations, let alone numerous meetings of the platform's Joint Steering Committee and other exchange programs.Moreover, the collaborative efforts of China and Europe have extended to major international platforms, as evidenced by their co-chairing of the interactive dialogue "Water for Sustainable Development" during the 2023 United Nations Water Conference, she said.Additionally, the 18th World Water Congress in Beijing also served as a venue for profound exchanges and discussions on water management policy experience between the two sides, Xu continued.Fruitful periodThe past 12 years have been a fruitful period that saw China and Europe roll out more than a dozen joint studies in various fields such as basin management, ecological restoration, facilities for rural water resources management and food security, water and urbanization, water and energy, she said.Under the China-EU Partnership Instrument Program from 2018 to last year, the two sides jointly carried out a batch of concrete projects, she said, citing a pilot venture for ecological restoration in the Nanxi River in Zhejiang province as an example.Borrowing experiences in remediating the Rhine, Danube and Mondego rivers in Europe, experts from China and Europe jointly developed a plan for the conservation of a rare migratory fish species in the river.They also recommended the minimum value of discharge that needs to be maintained in the river to ensure optimum conditions for its ecosystem, among other specific proposals on ecological restoration.Xu has especially highlighted productive outcomes from Sino-French cooperation.After the two countries' water resources authorities signed a cooperation agreement in 2009, they then agreed to launch a pilot program in the Haihe River Basin in 2011, she noted.She said France's concept and approaches in drafting integrated planning for river basin management were successively incorporated by experts from the two countries into three documents for water conservation in the Haihe basin.Capacity building is also one of the key aspects of the pilot program. To promote work in this regard, the two sides have so far visited each other about 50 times, with 40 of them by France to China, she said, adding that about 700 Chinese personnel were trained.China and France renewed the cooperation memorandum of understanding on water resources management in 2018.Xu said China and Europe have reached consensus to embark on a new phase of cooperation with a three-year China-EU Cooperation on Water Project, and a draft overall work plan for the project has been prepared.The two sides plan to further enhance joint research and technical exchanges in various fields, including basin management, information technology, groundwater recharge, and water recycling, and organize more study tours in these regards, she said."China and Europe will actively utilize the opportunities presented at important international conferences in 2024 to promote the achievements in China-Europe cooperation on water resources management as they make efforts to contribute their strength to global water governance," she said.With President Xi Jinping's state visit to France to commemorate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and France, Nicolas Idier, inspector general for Chinese language teaching at the French Ministry of National Education, has highlighted the crucial role of Chinese language education in fostering robust bilateral ties."Every state visit has the potential to gain a historical echo, but needs symbols oriented toward the future," Idier said. "As our president was mentioning the importance of 'a patient path of mutual knowledge', President Xi will contribute to the promotion of cultural and educational exchanges."The best thing to do to enhance the desire to learn a foreign language is to keep the doors open and to facilitate academic exchanges between schools and students," he added.Highlighting the significance of showcasing the creativity of the Chinese language, Idier emphasized the importance of involving writers and translators in Chinese language education.He mentioned the Cite internationale de la langue francaise (International City of French Language), which will host the 19th Francophonie Summit in October, as an excellent opportunity to celebrate the long-standing friendship between the French and Chinese languages, dating back to the 18th century and the first translations from Chinese to French.During French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to China in April 2023, he stressed the need for academic connections, understanding, exchanges and conversations of intelligence and learning.In a world where judgments can fall abruptly, resuming the patient path of mutual knowledge becomes essential. To build this path to the future, Macron called for the development of language proficiency, with a focus on promoting the French language in China and the Chinese language in France.According to the French Ministry of National Education, Chinese remains the fifth most-taught language, and the first non-European language behind English, Spanish, German and Italian, with more than 38,000 learners in secondary education, including private schools.This year marks a significant milestone in language promotion with the introduction of the first session of the Bac Français International. The implementation of this program represents a turning point in the history of French education as it incorporates foreign certifications into the official framework of the French baccalaureate for the first time.Idier said: "Requests to open international sections are growing in all languages and particularly in Chinese, with the opening of a complete course in Marseille, starting in September 2024. The course of study proposed by the international programs from the first grade to 10th grade is now open in more than 60 French schools. It is the best way to get access to perfect language ability in both French and Chinese."Joel Bellassen, renowned French sinologist and a distinguished expert in Chinese language and culture, echoed the sentiment, saying there is a global surge in interest in learning the Chinese language, as evidenced by the growing popularity of Mandarin classes worldwide."The increasing popularity of Mandarin classes globally demonstrates the growing interest in learning the Chinese language," he said.Bellassen's profound connection with the Chinese language dates back to his initial visit to Beijing in 1973 as an exchange student.He emphasized the importance of continuous professional development to inspire future generations of Sino-French cultural ambassadors. "China and France will continue collaborating on Chinese language programs in France, expanding the number of Chinese language classes, training additional local Chinese teachers, and developing new teaching materials," he said.China's technology giant Huawei Technologies is committed to the French market despite challenges posed by an increasingly complex global geopolitical situation.Huawei Technologies France, which was launched in 2003, commenced construction on its factory project for mobile phone network equipment in France's Alsace region in April 2023.With an investment of 200 million euros ($214 million), it will be Huawei's first factory in Europe and its largest manufacturing facility outside China.Huawei Technologies France also boasts five R&D centers, an innovation center and a mathematics research center dedicated to basic research. Of its 1,100 employees, 80 percent are locally hired.Zhang Minggang, deputy CEO of Huawei Technologies France, said that for Huawei, France and Europe are more than just important markets, they possess a sound industrial foundation, strong innovation capabilities, rich culture, and are host to numerous international standard organizations."On the one hand, Huawei hopes to create value for France through its activities and investment here. On the other hand, Huawei also hopes to take deeper root in France and Europe through its activities in France," Zhang said.Huawei Technologies France contributes more than 1 billion euros to the French economy each year and has created 9,760 jobs, both directly and indirectly.If the related business revenues of Huawei suppliers and partners are also included, the annual business volume would amount to 2.5 billion euros and total tax to the government coffer would be 265 million euros, including 65 million euros in tax paid directly by Huawei.Zhang was proud that Huawei Technologies France has been recognized by local citizens, parliamentarians and local government officials for its good corporate citizenship.Launched in 2021, the Huawei DigiTruck program offers a mobile classroom equipped with 20 computers, housed in a truck powered by solar energy. It offers workshops aimed at helping locals fight digital illiteracy.According to France's National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies in June 2023, about 15.4 percent of the French population are struggling with digital technology or are unable to use IT tools.Now in the sixth stage of its journey, the DigiTruck has been traveling since March on a four-month route. The DigiTruck program has so far welcomed some 6,000 people in more than 40 French cities. Two-thirds of the attendees are people over age 55.Zhang said local mayors and officials in France have shown great support and enthusiasm for the DigiTruck, assisting in promoting the program and organizing training for local individuals in need."Digital technology is a powerful vector for social and professional integration. Present in France for more than 20 years, Huawei wishes to assume its responsibilities as a major digital player and promote the mastery of IT tools to as many people as possible," Zhang said.Zhang admitted that the fearmongering by the European Commission, branding Huawei as an unreliable vendor, had hurt the company.He said facts speak louder, and various evaluations have shown that there is no cybersecurity issue or technical problem with Huawei 5G.He added that he was encouraged by good news received in April, when Huawei Cloud announced its compliance with the EU Cloud Code of Conduct for its cloud services dedicated to the European market, regarded as a demonstration of Huawei Cloud's commitment to privacy, data security and transparency. As China's luxury goods market flourishes, French luxury conglomerate LVMH finds itself at the heart of this growing demand. The Chinese hunger for goods from high-quality, prestigious brands has significantly buoyed LVMH's sales, reflecting broader trends in global luxury consumption, according to industry experts.Louis Vuitton, one of the oldest fashion houses under LVMH, continues to captivate Chinese consumers with its blend of tradition and modernity. "Chinese consumers value brands with a strong tradition and history, preferring luxury items that are durable and timeless," explained Ashley Dudarenok, founder of China-focused digital marketing agency Alarice.She said this appreciation has led LV to engage deeply with local culture through striking marketing strategies, which not only drew local attention but also dominated social media discussions.Similarly, luxury brand Dior connects with the Chinese market through high-profile fashion shows at iconic locations across the country, like the recent major event in Shenzhen that showcased its fall 2023 women's collection.Dudarenok said these events underline Dior's commitment to the Chinese market, which has become increasingly significant post-pandemic.Amrita Banta, managing director at luxury goods consultancy Agility Research & Strategy, echoed this view, emphasizing the substantial role of the Chinese consumer in LVMH's success.She highlighted the strong affinity of Chinese consumers for luxury brands with a distinguished heritage and exceptional craftsmanship, noting that brands like LV and Dior are highly regarded."LVMH has invested heavily in the China market and has shown its commitment to the Chinese consumer over time. It has integrated with the local cultural ecosystem and localized," she said.Wang Qing, a professor and co-founder of the Luxury and Innovation Hub at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, said that the rise of luxury consumption in China is a result of the country's stage of economic development and cultural characteristics."As China's economy has rapidly grown, a large population of new wealthy individuals who use luxury goods to symbolize status and financial success has emerged," she explained. "Culturally, China is a socially interdependent society where people are susceptible to peer pressure and influences."According to management consultants Bain & Company's China Luxury Report, last year China's luxury market grew by about 12 percent to more than 400 billion yuan ($55.27 billion). Previously, another consultancy, McKinsey & Company, had projected that by 2025, the combined spending of 7.6 million Chinese households on luxury goods will hit 1 trillion yuan, equivalent to the combined luxury goods spending in France, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States in 2016.Jonathan Siboni, CEO of data company Luxurynsight, noted that Chinese consumption has been the main driver of global luxury consumption growth over the past few years, contributing to as much as 90 percent of the market growth in 2019.He pointed out the key reasons that luxury brands such as LV, Dior and Hermes are doing well in China is because they excel in three areas: rational feature, such as price and rarity, emotional elements like brand allure, and rational aspect including prestige."Another element that explains the power of luxury brands is the strong control in product, communication, and distribution. Increased control leads to optimized control on brand image, pricing and brand universe. LV and Hermes are the best examples," he said.Sebastien Lion, founder of Next Made In France, characterizes President Xi Jinping's visit to France as vital for enhancing mutual understanding and strengthening bilateral relations.He noted that this visit is especially crucial after the COVID-19 pandemic challenged the longstanding ties between the two countries across economic, cultural, educational, and touristic sectors.Lion, whose company assists French cosmetics SMEs in finding Chinese distribution partners, emphasized the significance of a close relationship between the two countries, particularly for small brands seeking to expand into the Chinese market."If the context is not good enough, these brands may consider exploring export markets in Europe, the US, or other parts of the world, but not China. Therefore, the president's visit is not only useful but also serves as leverage for French businesses," he said.Recognizing China's status as a global powerhouse, Lion stressed the importance of working with the country and understanding its market dynamics."China is the future for young French people, and we must collaborate with them to tap into their e-commerce markets and comprehend their business landscape," he noted.Lion views Xi's visit as a pivotal opportunity for matchmaking between French brands and Chinese partners.He suggested organizing Chinese supply-chain partner events in France to facilitate connections and subsequently encouraging French brands to explore the Chinese market. Lion believes that physical meetings are essential for building strong partnerships, as face-to-face interactions allow for a deeper understanding of the Chinese market dynamics.Next Made In France specializes in helping brands enter the Chinese market through e-commerce and offline channels. Lion said that its mission extends beyond cross-border e-commerce to long-term development in China. He believes that brands must consider Asia, particularly China, not only as a territory but also as a customer base with global influence.Lion also highlighted the increasing importance of the Chinese market for French brands, noting that Asian customers, including those from China, account for a significant portion of luxury and beauty product sales in France. Therefore, he said it is imperative for French brands to target and address this market.While entering the Chinese market was once relatively straightforward for brands through cross-border e-commerce, Lion acknowledged that recent developments of social media have complicated this process. With game-changers like Douyin and TikTok and the need to trade products from the outset, he stressed that brands must invest in marketing and digital strategies.Despite the evolving landscape, he maintains that cross-border e-commerce remains a valuable initial testing ground for brands considering the Chinese market.Lion also emphasized the need for brands to adapt to Chinese preferences and cultural nuances, which may differ from those of Western markets.In May, Lion will lead an immersion mission with five French cosmetic brands at the China Beauty Expo in Shanghai. The China Beauty Expo is a major cosmetic fair in the Chinese market, the second-largest export market for French cosmetic products in 2023, worth 1.9 billion euros ($2.03 billion), according to Lion.Since the beginning of 2024, he said Chinese companies have signed ambitious distribution agreements over three or five years with French brands of cosmetics, perfumes or dietary supplements that are beginning their development in China.PARIS -- Both China and France value independence as two major countries and the two countries' interactions in the long course of history have released tremendous energy swaying the trajectory of the world, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his signed article published in French media on Sunday.President Xi Jinping's arrival in Paris for a state visit to France draws Chinese students and local community members to the streets, where they wave Chinese and French flags in an enthusiastic welcome.The two-day China Festival 2024, which concluded in Tokyo on Sunday, garnered widespread attention and participation from people from all walks of life in both China and Japan.The festival has been held at Yoyogi Park for many years. It has become an important platform for Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and cooperation, said Wu Jianghao, Chinese ambassador to Japan.The goal of the festival is to showcase the rich, traditional Chinese culture and the country's achievements, allowing more people to experience and understand contemporary China up close."We are willing to work with various sectors in both countries to use the China Festival as a bridge, encouraging more people — especially the younger generation — to participate in friendly exchanges between China and Japan," Wu said at the opening ceremony of the festival in Tokyo on Saturday."We hope that through the two-day China Festival, more Japanese friends will get to know and understand China, and have the opportunity to visit and experience the real and vibrant China," he added.This year's China Festival marks the largest in its history, featuring a record-breaking nearly 150 booths. In addition, the organizers successfully brought in a greater number of artists from China for stage performances than ever before, according to Yoichiro Aoyagi, a member of Japan's House of Representatives and secretary-general of the festival's executive committee.Japan and China, as neighbors, have now become leading nations in Asia and globally, particularly in the economic sphere, said Aoyagi."Although there are indeed many challenges between Japan and China, I believe it is crucial to maintain dialogue and exchanges between the people of both countries. We play a key role in ensuring these connections continue," he said.Former Japanese prime minister Yasuo Fukuda emphasized that mutual exchanges are crucial for sustaining good relationships between the two countries. It's not only about government-level interactions but also about fostering people-to-people exchanges.He further highlighted that the festival aims to showcase the very best of China, with the hope of encouraging more people from Japan to visit and experience the country firsthand.The China Festival plays a key role in promoting such exchanges. Since its launch in 2017, it has consistently attracted large crowds. Masahiro Komura, the parliamentary vice-minister for foreign affairs, said the event offers the Japanese people a valuable chance to experience Chinese culture, including tourism, the economy, regional interactions, and authentic Chinese cuisine.Voicing hope"I strongly hope that the exchange between the people of both countries will deepen and that mutual interest and understanding will grow even further," he said.At this year's China Festival, 147 Chinese companies participated, nearly three times the number from last year, according to Wang Jiaxun, president of China Enterprises Association in Japan. "Currently, relations between China and Japan are not particularly ideal. Many Japanese citizens hold certain prejudices against China and Chinese people, while Chinese citizens also have some misunderstandings about Japan. These issues arise in part due to distorted media coverage. Events like the China Festival help foster mutual trust and understanding, promoting friendly exchanges between the two countries," said Wang.People from Chinese provinces such as Shandong and Hunan also attended the China Festival 2024 to highlight regional interactions.During the opening ceremony of the Shandong cultural exhibition at the festival, Cheng Shoutian, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee, noted that Shandong and Japan are separated by just a sea and have strong cooperation across various fields.He expressed his hope that the event would provide an opportunity for more people to discover Shandong, establish a closer platform for cultural exchange, and enhance cultural interaction and collaboration between China and Japan.Many people showed up at the festival. Hiroko Wada, a 38-year-old Tokyo resident, stopped by a booth offering panda-related souvenirs."I'm here for a panda-themed event because I'm such a big fan of pandas," said Wada, who also loves Chinese cuisine.Nene, a 22-year-old woman who preferred not to share her last name, gave the festival's game of playing ping-pong with a slipper a try."I'm really interested in Chinese culture. I studied Chinese at university, but speaking it is quite challenging," she said."I'm also excited to enjoy some authentic Chinese flavors. There are so many delicious-looking foods here, and I can't wait to stroll around, eating and drinking along the way," she added.Younger people are gradually taking over Japan-China relations, said Toshiyasu Ogawa, a participant of the Japan-China Friendship Association."Five years ago, people in their 70s and 80s were mostly the ones running the festival. But now, it's people in their 30s and 40s, and I feel hopeful that they are passing Japan-China relations on to the next generation," Ogawa said.A memorial service was held in Tokyo on Sunday, marking the 101st anniversary of Chinese victims who were killed following the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan.During that tragic event over 100 years ago, more than 700 Chinese people in Japan survived the earthquake, only to meet their deaths in a bloody massacre perpetrated by the Japanese military, police and militaristic thugs. Some extremists, influenced by militaristic ideology and strong xenophobic sentiments, deliberately fabricated excuses to carry out a massacre of innocent Chinese people.Over the past 11 years, family members of the victims have been working tirelessly between China and Japan to seek justice. They have organized and participated in more than 40 meetings and attended more than 20 memorial services at the massacre sites in Japan. They have repeatedly submitted petitions and demands to the Japanese government to express their strong determination and deep dissatisfaction."We, the families, persist because we have yet to receive a clear apology, and this matter remains unresolved," said Zhou Songquan, a representative of the families of Chinese victims.On behalf of the victims' families, Zhou extended their gratitude to the conscientious Japanese people from all walks of life, who have spent years dedicating tremendous efforts to comfort the souls of the victims and are committed to uncovering the truth and pursuing justice."By holding such memorial events, we hope to revisit that period of history and help more people understand and recognize the truth of the tragedy. Our purpose is not to perpetuate hatred, but to prevent the recurrence of such tragedies and to better create the future," said Zhou."We hope that the Japanese government can truly take up its political and moral responsibilities, seriously address and properly handle the relevant historical issues, and demonstrate its commitment to reflecting on history through concrete actions," he said.Liu Sipan, counselor of the political division at the Chinese embassy in Japan, noted that the immediate cause of the massacre was the malicious spread of rumors and the incitement of social panic, but the root cause lay in Japan's path towards militarism at the time, where extreme nationalism, xenophobia and anti-foreign sentiments prevailed.This also set the stage for Japan's subsequent aggressive wars of invasion, which inflicted immense suffering on China and other Asian countries, she added."It is regrettable that, more than 100 years later, this tragic memory is fading in Japanese society. The Japanese government's stance on historical issues has regressed, and there are negative trends in Japan where the denial, distortion, and beautification of its history of aggression occasionally occur," said Liu.Chinese scholars visiting Tokyo shared their views on the current state and future trajectory of China's economy, refuting claims from some countries that China's economy has peaked and is facing overcapacity.During a lecture held by the Chinese Embassy in Japan on Wednesday, Chen Weidong, director of the Research Institute of Bank of China, told the audience that based on the current situation, there is still significant growth potential in China's real estate market.Currently, the per capita housing area in China is 25 square meters. As urbanization progresses and the average housing area per person expands, combined with the rigid housing demand from college graduates each year, it is estimated that China will need around 1 billion square meters of new housing annually until 2035, Chen said.Overall, China's real estate market is seeking a new balance between supply and demand, aiming to maintain stable demand while ensuring housing prices do not experience significant adjustments, he added.On the issue of local government debt, Chen pointed out that by the end of 2022, the debt ratio of China's local governments was 55.72 percent. Including about 60 trillion yuan ($8.29 trillion) in debt from local government financing vehicles, the overall debt ratio of local governments was approximately 105 percent.The Chinese central government's solution is to set clear debt limits for local governments and implement special policy measures, such as refinancing bond issuance and short-term interest rate cuts, achieving debt swaps, optimize the debt maturity structure, and reduce interest burdens, he said."It's important to emphasize that a large amount of local government debt in China has been invested in high-quality assets, such as infrastructure and emerging industries. Therefore, both local and central governments have substantial asset bases to support this debt," he said.According to a report by the Institute of Finance and Banking at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, local governments have a large asset scale to cover their debt burden.Additionally, local governments have various measures to advance debt resolution. Therefore, Chinese government debt will not pose a systemic risk, Chen said.Regarding remarks on China's so-called industrial overcapacity, Chen said capacity utilization should be viewed in a global market context rather than limited to a single country.Globally, in 2023, the capacity utilization rates were approximately 77 percent for the United States, 79 percent for the European Union, 78 percent for Canada, 74 percent for India, and about 76 percent for China. Over the long term, China's capacity utilization has remained at a stable and reasonable level, he said.Some countries claimed that China's new energy vehicle industry is facing so-called overcapacity. Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics, said from the perspective of the global green transition, NEVs are still in their early stages and there is significant market potential.Currently, the global NEV fleet is around 30 million vehicles, with 20 million of these in China. However, the total number of vehicles worldwide is 1.45 billion. The share of NEVs is very small. Even converting only half of the existing gasoline vehicles to NEVs could take many years, Tu said.The global penetration rate of NEVs, meaning the proportion of NEVs in new car sales, is only 15.7 percent, indicating significant growth potential, he added."The rapid development of China's NEV industry in recent years has raised some concerns, which essentially boil down to discomfort with new competition. This is understandable, but it's important to view the development of this emerging industry with a long-term perspective as it presents numerous possibilities," Tu said.He noted that although Chinese NEV companies do have a relatively good first-mover advantage, having a first-mover advantage does not mean they will always lead, nor does it mean that latecomers will never have a chance."Thus, some countries are overreacting by adopting trade protection measures against China's leading position in the NEV field. Moreover, from the perspective of global climate change mitigation and achieving a green transition, the development of China's NEV industry should be encouraged, not feared," he said.Some US and EU media attribute the success of China's NEV industry solely to government sup-port, which is a very one-sided view. In fact, China's success in this field is due to a combination of proactive government policies and an effective market, Tu said.He further explained that the government does not pick specific companies to support directly with subsidies for NEVs. Instead, subsidies are given to consumers, allowing them to choose the products they prefer.Moreover, China has significantly opened up market access in the NEV field, allowing many new car manufacturers to enter this sector, including private and foreign companies, rather than reserving market opportunities for State-owned enterprises, Tu said.Over the past 40 years, China's economic growth has been heavily driven by factor inputs — capital and labor. In the future, China's economy is likely to be driven more by total factor productivity, or TFP, growth, said Liu Qiao, dean of the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, who believes that it is possible for China to maintain a TFP growth rate above 2 percent.One major source of TFP growth is technological advancement and improved resource allocation efficiency. China's re-industrialization, or digital transformation of industries, presents significant potential for productivity improvements. Developing new infrastructure necessary for re-industrialization requires substantial investment, which will create immense opportunities for technological change and efficiency gains, Liu said.Another area that can boost TFP growth is carbon neutrality. To achieve the dual carbon goals, it is estimated that China will need to invest nearly 300 trillion yuan by 2050, he said.Liu highlighted the importance of sustaining a certain level of investment rate and to invest in future key sectors, such as new infrastructure and strategic emerging industries.In his opinion, future key areas include technological innovation. This involves creating a high-level circulation of technology, finance and industry, where financial support fuels technological advancements, driving industrial innovation.Other key areas include carbon neutrality, the Internet of Things, high-end manufacturing, and in-vestment opportunities arising from the integration of rural populations into urban areas.The Chinese government also has the space to further implement proactive fiscal policies, with many tools at its disposal, Liu said."China's national debt stands at 25 trillion yuan, about 20 percent of GDP. The central government has substantial room to issue national debt to address short-term challenges. Over the next decade, we believe there is room for China's national debt to increase by 60 to 70 trillion yuan," he said.Participants of the Liaoning-Japan Economic and Trade Cooperation Seminar expressed their hope to leverage the geographical proximity and cultural affinity between China's Liaoning province and Japan to continuously deepen and expand pragmatic cooperation in various fields such as economy, trade, industry and culture.Japan is Liaoning's largest trading partner and its largest source of investment. Since China's reform and opening-up, the number of Japan-funded enterprises in Liaoning has exceeded 8,000, with investments exceeding $25 billion, said Hao Peng, secretary of the Communist Party of China Liaoning Provincial Committee, at the seminar held in Tokyo on Friday.Liaoning and Japan should jointly deepen economic and trade cooperation, tap into potential for trade and investment, and nurture new growth points. The two sides have the potential to expand investment cooperation in key areas such as high-end equipment manufacturing, fine chemicals, biomedicine, artificial intelligence and semiconductor equipment, Hao said.He also expressed hope to deepen cooperation in scientific and technological innovation, jointly conduct research on core technologies, and strengthen talent exchange and training.Liaoning and Japan also aim to deepen green and low-carbon cooperation, broaden collaboration on new energy industries, and share opportunities for green development.Liaoning will spare no effort to support the development of Japanese enterprises in the province and provide higher quality and more efficient services, Hao said.China and Japan are important partners in the economic field. Approximately 33,000 Japanese companies are operating in China, Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao said.The two countries have formed a mutually beneficial relationship with a high degree of integration of interests, and their cooperation is comprehensive, wide-ranging and multilevel, Wu said.He emphasized that economic and trade cooperation is an important basis and source of vitality for the development of bilateral relations between China and Japan."Liaoning is one of the provinces closest to Japan geographically. The foundation of cooperation between the two sides is deep, and people-to-people exchanges are close," Wu said."I sincerely hope that both sides will enhance mutual understanding, tap into cooperation potential, create new growth points, and promote the steady and far-reaching development of Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations."Huge market, talentNobuhiko Sasaki, president of the Japan-China Economic Association, said Liaoning has a complete industrial system and infrastructure, a huge market, and abundant Japanese-speaking talent, providing a good environment for investment.Sasaki said that in order for Japanese companies to operate in China with a peace of mind, he hopes that Liaoning officials will continue to improve the predictability, transparency and fairness of policies and further expand Liaoning's opening up to the world.Northeast China has a close historical and economic relationship with Japan. There are many Japan-funded enterprises in Dalian and Shenyang in Liaoning. Good relations have been established between Japan-funded enterprises and Liaoning, said Masayoshi Arai, an official from Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.On April 8, Jin Guowei, vice-governor of Liaoning, presided over a meeting to understand the business conditions of Japan-funded enterprises in Liaoning and listened to their suggestions on the business environment in the province. Arai said he was deeply moved by the attitude of the Liaoning provincial government in listening to the opinions of Japan-funded enterprises and its efforts to solve problems."In November last year, the leaders of Japan and China held talks and reached consensus on strengthening communication at all levels," he said."I believe that today's exchange with Liaoning province is a specific measure to implement the consensus. Strengthening communication at both the central and local levels is very important in promoting exchanges between Japan and China."jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cnFor former Japanese prime minister Yukio Hatoyama, more agricultural products from Shandong province of China will further enrich the dining tables of the Japanese people.Japan is the largest export market for agricultural products from Shandong province of China. At a promotional event in Tokyo on Thursday, Hatoyama expressed his fondness for Shandong, which has many industrial products, agricultural products, and seafood.Representatives of Shandong are inviting people from around the world, including Japan, to explore traditional culture, enjoy the magnificent scenery, and experience diverse folk customs.Bai Yugang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Shandong Provincial Committee and head of the publicity department of the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee, said Shandong has extensive exchanges with Japan, with close cooperation in various fields such as economy, education, environmental protection, culture, tourism, sports, and talent development. He proposed several initiatives for deepening future exchange and cooperation:First, further strengthen economic cooperation by utilizing various mechanisms, encouraging interested businesses to invest in each other's territories.Second, further promote cultural synergy and innovation by exploring the establishment of a new cultural business development alliance and enhancing cooperation in fields like film, animation, gaming, and digital culture.Third, further deepen exchanges and mutual learning of civilizations, with Confucian culture as the bond, supporting academic institutions and higher education institutions to conduct regular dialogues.Fourth, further broaden two-way tourism interaction by promoting joint development of quality routes by tourism departments, organizing characteristic experience activities such as rural tours and folk customs tours, and smoothing channels for mutual visits by tourists.Fifth, further activate youth study visits by encouraging cooperation between primary, secondary, and tertiary schools, organizing youth groups to conduct study exchanges, and promoting the continuity of China-Japan friendship in the next generation.Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping met Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in San Francisco, reaffirming the positioning of comprehensively advancing the strategic and mutually beneficial relations between China and Japan.However, during his recent speech at the US Congress, Kishida called China's stance "the greatest strategic challenge" to the peace and security of Japan."This kind of statement is undesirable, and the strategic and mutually beneficial relationship should be emphasized more," said Hatoyama.Maintaining the long-term healthy and stable development of China-Japan relations is in the fundamental interests of the two peoples and conducive to regional peace and stability, said Yang Yu, minister-counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Japan.The leaders of China and Japan reaffirmed the the positioning of comprehensively advancing the strategic and mutually beneficial relations between the two countries and agreed to dedicate themselves to jointly building a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the demands of the new era.It is hoped that both sides will take the important consensus of the two countries' leaders as a guide, grasp the correct direction, deepen pragmatic cooperation, properly handle differences and disputes, and promote the stable and far-reaching development of China-Japan relations, Yang said.During the promotional event, Shandong province displayed traditional cultural heritage, innovation in intangible cultural heritage, and the achievements of green, low-carbon, and high-quality development through pictures, videos, and physical objects. A total of more than 60 categories and nearly 1,000 products were exhibited on-site.jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cnRepresentatives from various sectors and youth delegates from China and Japan on Wednesday jointly called for further promotion of people-to-people exchanges, strengthening dialogue, enhancing mutual trust, and promoting the healthy and stable development of Sino-Japanese relations.At a forum in Tokyo on Wednesday, Wu Hailong, president of the China Public Diplomacy Association, said that while some issues in current China-Japan relations are unlikely to be resolved immediately, people-to-people exchanges can be initiated first.Various fields of civil exchanges — including education, culture, tourism, local governments, businesses, media, and think tanks — can engage in extensive interaction, Wu said.Government-level consultations and exchange mechanisms at various levels should also be gradually restored, he added."If exchanges between China and Japan can continue and maintain a certain level of enthusiasm, the goodwill of the two peoples may gradually rise. Only through communication can mutual understanding be achieved, and only through understanding can mutual trust be established," Wu said."We must prioritize the overall situation of China-Japan relations and the interests of both countries," he said."The media, think tanks and relevant government departments of both countries should objectively and rationally view the contradictions and differences between the two countries, timely guide the overly aggressive remarks and emotions of the two peoples, and do more things conducive to maintaining friendly bilateral relations," Wu added.Former Japanese prime minister Yasuo Fukuda said the exchanges between Japan and China rely not only on the strength of the government but also on the strength of the private sector.It is necessary to further promote exchanges among individuals to help drive diplomatic relations as the two are interrelated and complementary, Fukuda said. Through people-to-people diplomacy, mutual trust can be further enhanced, he added.Last November, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in San Francisco. The two leaders reaffirmed the positioning of comprehensively advancing the strategic and mutually beneficial relations between China and Japan.Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao said current China-Japan relations are at an important juncture of succession and innovation, facing a series of complex factors.Hopes voicedHe said he hoped that both sides would take the important consensus reached at the meeting of the leaders of the two countries last November as guidance to further strengthen people-to-people exchanges and practical cooperation while properly handling contradictions and differences.Exchanges between China and Japan were greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, he noted.The ambassador said, "We hope that both sides will further expand mutual visits and exchanges, shorten psychological distances, and enhance friendly feelings through face-to-face interactions."According to the former ambassador of Japan to China Yuji Miyamoto, comprehensively advancing the strategic and mutually beneficial relations between China and Japan means rebuilding Sino-Japanese relations conducive to world peace and development.This also means that dialogue, elimination of suspicion, and consolidation of trust between the two countries should be strengthened, said Miyamoto.Former Chinese ambassador to Japan Cheng Yonghua said it is necessary to maintain the stable and healthy development of Sino-Japanese relations, fulfill commitments through actions, and turn the vision reaffirmed in San Francisco into reality."We should clarify that neither side poses a threat to the other and that both are cooperative partners, adhere to the established direction of peaceful development, and grasp the direction of Sino-Japanese relations from a strategic and long-term perspective," Cheng said.As part of the efforts to promote people-to-people exchanges, a gathering for the Japanese fans of the giant panda Xiang Xiang, who returned to China last year, was held in Tokyo on Tuesday.During the event, panda enthusiasts had a video call with Xiang Xiang and her keeper, witnessing her current life in China.The documentary film The Yangtze River, supervised by Japanese documentary director Ryo Takeuchi, will be released in Japan starting on Friday.From 2010 to 2011, Takeuchi filmed a documentary about the Yangtze River for the Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Ten years later, starting in 2021, he spent about two years retracing the 6,300-kilometer-long river and revisiting some of the people living along the river whom he filmed 10 years ago."The portrayal of China in the Japanese media is not objective. I want to show real China to Japanese audiences, neither exaggerating nor criticizing China," said Takeuchi at a screening and media exchange event jointly hosted by his culture communication company and the Chinese embassy in Japan in Tokyo on Sunday.Most Japanese who have been to China will like China, and most Chinese who have been to Japan will also like Japan, he said. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the past few years and the state of Sino-Japanese relations, fewer and fewer Japanese people are going to China now. Takeuchi said he hopes that exchanges between the two peoples will increase."After watching this movie, I'm sure many Japanese will want to visit China. I hope my movie will be the first step for them to understand China, providing them with an opportunity to visit the country in person. Don't blindly criticize China without ever having been there," he said.Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao also expressed hope that more Japanese people could visit China and that people-to-people exchanges between the two countries would be further promoted.Takeuchi, 45, was born in Chiba Prefecture. His family moved to China in 2013 and settled in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, his wife's hometown.Sentimental attachment"I live in Nanjing and have a sentimental attachment to the Yangtze River. I like The Romance of the Three Kingdoms (by 14th-century Chinese writer Luo Guanzhong).There are many places along the Yangtze River related to the Three Kingdoms. … Along the river, there are also cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Chongqing, which are relatively familiar to Japanese people," he said.He had filmed the Yangtze River before but was not satisfied with the work because at that time, he could not speak Chinese and did not understand the real life of the Chinese people. He always had an obsession with learning Chinese and understanding China before filming the Yangtze River again."I'm very much looking forward to seeing the reaction of ordinary Japanese audiences to this film. Not only will Japanese people interested in China go to see it, but also those who like documentaries and movies," Takeuchi said.In addition, he has also made documentaries such as The Reason I Live Here, which introduces the lives and customs of Chinese people living overseas and foreigners living in China. His works also include Beyond the Mountain, Nanjing's Anti-epidemic Scene, Long Time No See, Wuhan, and The Post-Pandemic Era.He has now begun to film the stories of Japanese orphans left behind in China. After Japan's defeat in World War II, they were abandoned by the Japanese and adopted by Chinese families. These people are now in their 80s, and he is filming their stories.Next year marks the 80th anniversary of Japan's defeat, and he expects this documentary to be broadcast in China and Japan then.jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cnInternational and Chinese guests gathered at the Yuantouzhu scenic spot in Wuxi, East China's Jiangsu province on March 21 to commemorate the 37th anniversary of the construction of the Sino-Japanese Cherry Blossom Friendship Forest.Co-built by Wuxi and a Japanese civic group in 1987, the forest is now home to 300,000 cherry blossom trees, a remarkable increase from the initial 1,500 such trees.Song Jingwu, former vice-president of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, noted at the ceremony that the forest is a testimony of the friendship between Chinese and Japanese people.Years of friendly exchanges and collaboration between Wuxi and Japan has promoted economic and social development on both sides, as well as mutual understanding between the two peoples, Song added.A spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry joined Chinese netizens to express deep condolences for the death of renowned Japanese manga artist Akira Toriyama.Known for works such as Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, Toriyama passed away on March 1 due to acute subdural hematoma at the age of 68.

In Dragon Ball, there are too many regrets, just like the youth of oneself."jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cnAdvancing win-win cooperation and realizing the prosperity of both nations is the "only right choice" for China and Japan, and Tokyo "should maintain strategic autonomy and reject bloc confrontation", said Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao.Wu, who is also a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made the comments in a recent exclusive interview with China Daily.When asked about major items on the bilateral agenda this year, Wu referred to the consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida during their meeting in San Francisco in November.He noted that Xi and Kishida agreed on maintaining bilateral dialogue and communication at various levels, and on organizing a new round of the China-Japan High-Level Economic Dialogue and a new meeting of the China-Japan high-level consultation mechanism for people-to-people and cultural exchanges at an appropriate time."The two sides are carrying out discussions and coordination on the detailed arrangements," Wu said."The Japanese side is expected to move toward the same goal with China, create an enabling atmosphere for this with tangible actions and advance the agenda stated above for desirable results," he added.Speaking of the current China-Japan bilateral relationship, Wu noted that in recent years, the ties "have been faced with a series of risks and challenges, as well as considerable disturbances by factors from the outside".He said the two nations should "focus on the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the region's need for peace and stability, and earnestly implement the important consensus of their leaders".The meeting between Xi and Kishida reaffirmed a commitment to comprehensively promote China-Japan strategic and mutually beneficial relations, and "it charted the direction for the improvement and development of relations between the two countries", Wu said.Beijing and Tokyo should "enhance political mutual trust, properly handle contradictions and differences, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, expand people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and promote the sound and stable development of bilateral ties along the right track", he added.As for the major areas of two-way cooperation, the ambassador noted that "the interests of China and Japan are greatly intertwined, and their production and supply chains have an inextricable connection".He pointed to the remarkable potential for cooperation in areas such as scientific and technological innovation, green development and medical care for the elderly.In addition, the two countries face common issues in social governance, such as coping with an aging population and low birthrates, Wu added."Subscribing to the idea of win-win cooperation and boosting their respective development and prosperity is the only right choice" for the two nations, Wu said."To this end, it is important to put into practice the consensus on being partners and posing no threat to each other," he added.The two sides need to properly handle and manage existing issues in accordance with the principles set out in the four landmark China-Japan political documents, Wu said.They also need to "address emerging issues" such as the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water from Fukushima into the sea and "do more to eliminate difficulties and impediments and inject positive impetus into the development of China-Japan relations", he said.Noting that the current international situation has become more volatile, Wu said: "As important countries in the region and the world, China and Japan have the duty and obligation to work together to uphold real multilateralism, promote all-benefiting and inclusive economic globalization, and inject more stability into the world."China once again urged Japan to responsibly handle the disposal of its nuclear-contaminated waters and cooperate in establishing a comprehensive, effective and independently driven long-term international monitoring mechanism involving all relevant stakeholders.On Thursday, a spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Japan expressed strong dissatisfaction with the fourth round of releasing nuclear-contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.Starting on Wednesday, approximately 7,800 metric tons of nuclear-contaminated water will be discharged into the sea over a period of around 17 days, according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the plant.Despite the legitimate concerns of the public and strong opposition from the international community, Japan has continued to discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, transferring the risks of nuclear pollution to the world, the spokesperson said.The discharge began in August, despite opposition. TEPCO estimates that a total of 31,200 tons of nuclear-contaminated water will be discharged during the fiscal year 2023 ending March."The disposal of Fukushima's nuclear-contaminated water into the sea concerns global marine safety and public health. The series of accidents during the process of handling nuclear-contaminated water by the Japanese side fully exposes the mismanagement, inadequate supervision, and lack of long-term reliability of the nuclear-contaminated water treatment facilities," the spokesperson said."We once again urge Japan to seriously address reasonable concerns at home and abroad, cooperate in establishing a comprehensive, effective, and independently driven long-term international monitoring mechanism involving all relevant stakeholders, and responsibly and constructively handle the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water," he said.Anyone who insists on meddling in China's internal affairs and obstructing China's reunification will inevitably pay a heavy price, a spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Japan said on Tuesday.The Japan Self-Defense Forces and the US military named China as a "hypothetical enemy" for the first time in their joint command post exercise, government sources said on Sunday, Kyodo News reported.The computer simulation exercise, which began on Feb 1 and is slated to be held through Thursday, envisions an emergency in Taiwan, China, Kyodo News reported.The embassy spokesperson expressed serious concerns to the Japanese side immediately, clarifying China's firm position. The Japanese side has said that the relevant media report is not true.For some time, certain forces within Japan have repeatedly stirred up trouble on the Taiwan question, escalating tensions in the Taiwan Strait, inciting confrontation and showing a clear tendency toward recklessness.Such actions seriously violate the one-China principle and the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan, the spokesperson said."I want to stress that Taiwan is part of China, and the Taiwan issue brooks no external interference. No one should underestimate the Chinese people's strong determination, firm will, and formidable capabilities in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said."If anyone insists on meddling in China's internal affairs and obstructing China's reunification, it will not just be an issue of 'hypothetical enemy', and they will inevitably pay a heavy price," the spokesperson emphasized.China's embassy in Japan hosted a Chinese New Year reception for overseas Chinese people on Friday for the first time in four years, following an interruption attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.The event was intentionally scheduled on the lunar calendar's Little New Year, usually a week before the Chinese Lunar New Year, to bring together compatriots in a foreign land. Little New Year is also known as the Festival of the Kitchen God, the deity who is said to oversee the moral character of each household.Wu Jianghao, China's ambassador to Japan, extended his sincere New Year greetings and New Year blessings to all compatriots on behalf of the embassy."The past year had been a year of hard work and fruitful achievements. Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, Chinese people at home and abroad united and moved forward," Wu said.Last year, China's economy rebounded and progressed toward high-quality development. The expected full-year GDP growth target of 5.2 percent was achieved, and the Chinese economy contributed 32 percent to global economic growth."Despite challenges, the Chinese economy remained robust and continued to be the most powerful engine propelling the world economy steadily forward," he said.The past year was also a year of mutual learning and exchange. Leaders from China and Japan held important meetings in San Francisco in the United States and reaffirmed the positioning of comprehensively advancing strategic and mutually beneficial relations between China and Japan, setting the direction for the improvement and development of bilateral relations, Wu said.He noted that compatriots showed concern for China-Japan relations and organized a series of activities commemorating the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, injecting positive energy into people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.Compatriots not only actively contributed to promoting China-Japan economic and trade cooperation but also facilitated deeper cultural exchanges between the two countries, he added.This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Currently, China is comprehensively advancing the construction of a powerful nation and the great rejuvenation of the nation in a Chinese modernization style, contributing to the construction of a community with a shared future for humanity.Wu said he hopes the coming year will see overseas Chinese people in Japan play a key role as builders of China-Japan relations, further promoting exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the fields of economy, technology, and culture.A groundbreaking ceremony for the China Pavilion during next year's World Expo 2025 in Osaka was held on Friday at the site in Japan, signifying a major step in China's participation at the event.The China Pavilion is the first large-scale international self-built pavilion to break ground at the Osaka World Expo.

"I hope the Osaka World Expo can serve as a favorable opportunity to foster cultural exchanges and deepen mutual understanding between the people of the two nations."The China Pavilion aims to showcase modern Chinese civilization and the country's developmental achievements, presenting an open, inclusive and amicable image of China, and contributing to the building a community with a shared future for humanity, Wu said.Nearly 200 representatives from relevant government institutions, media outlets and businesses from both China and Japan attended the groundbreaking ceremony held at the expo site in Osaka.Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said the year 2025 marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of sister city relations between Osaka and Shanghai.World Expo 2025 is scheduled to be held from April 13 to Oct 13 next year.China and Japan stand as important economic and trade partners for each other and both sides should maintain stable and smooth industrial and supply chains, and promote the healthy and stable development of economic and trade relations, China's Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday.China has always advocated that export control measures should adhere to the principles of fairness, reasonableness and non-discriminatory practices, said the ministry.No country or region should abuse export control measures and should not harm the legitimate rights and interests of other countries and regions, He Yadong, a spokesman for the ministry, said during a press conference.China and Japan should implement the important consensus reached between the leaders of the two countries, make good use of the export control dialogue mechanism, maintain policy communication, and enhance understanding and mutual trust, He said.The two countries held the first meeting regarding China-Japan export control dialogue mechanism in Tokyo on Jan 17. Both sides agreed to continue close communication, deepen understanding of each other's export control systems, improve the transparency of export control measures and ensure that regular trade is not hindered.Asami Tachibana brims with enthusiasm as she talks about performing with Chinese and Mongolian horsehead fiddle players at a Spring Festival gala in Japan."It was the first time I had the chance to hear that kind of music," the Japanese composer and pianist said, speaking of the event on Saturday."It has been very enjoyable for me from the rehearsal stage, listening to it and experiencing the traditional music of China."The Tokyo Spring Festival Gala, hosted by the Union of Chinese Residing in Japan, is the biggest platform for representatives of Chinese associations from all over Japan and Japan-China friendship organizations to gather together and celebrate Chinese New Year.He Naihe, chairman of the union, a consortium of Chinese groups in Japan, said traditional culture is important in exchanges."We hope this gala will serve as a great platform to promote exchanges and grassroots friendship between China and Japan."Tachibana said she had always wanted "to convey a sense of peace and friendship to people around the world through music"."It's not about borders or nations; it's about reaching people around the world with those feelings, and that's the sentiment I put into my music. I hope it resonates with the hearts of those who are listening."The former Japanese prime minister Yukio Hatoyama, one of the special guests, said at the event: "I believe that overseas Chinese people are praying for the improvement of relations between Japan and China, and I feel passionate about their efforts to make it happen, even in difficult times."There are signs that Japan-China relations are gradually improving, Hatoyama said. "Although there are various issues between the two countries, such as the Taiwan question, I believe that the problem can be solved."Crucial junctureChina's Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao said, "At this crucial historical juncture, revisiting the initial aspirations for peace, rekindling friendly exchanges and advancing mutually beneficial cooperation are prioritized."This year's gala in Tokyo showcased performances that are highly appealing in the traditional Chinese sense, bringing in six renowned artists from China.Yang Shaopeng, a national first-class actor of the Jingju Theater Company of Beijing, said, "Culture is an excellent means of communication. Through cultural exchange and communication I believe that China-Japan relations will improve because art, especially traditional art, reflects the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation and embodies the essence of Chinese traditional culture."Yang, who has given performances in Japan several times, said audiences love Peking Opera, finding it mysterious and particularly distinctive, especially the martial arts scenes."They like to come backstage to learn about our costumes, makeup, orchestra, and how we paint our faces. Sometimes we even paint the face of the Monkey King, or Sun Wukong, for Japanese children, bringing the Japanese people closer to Chinese traditional culture in a more intimate way."Zhou Benming, an inheritor of Chinese trumpet art and a master of the double-reed instrument the suona, said: "Music knows no borders. It easily connects with human emotions."Cultural exchanges would be more effective if artists let music spread spontaneously without a specific purpose, Zhou said."Sincere interactions between people are always welcome. Music and other types of art operate in the same way — sincere expression and genuine representation of the national spirit are enough. That is the best way to propagate."Premier Li Qiang called on Thursday for joint efforts from both China and Japan to uphold the principles of peace, friendship and cooperation in order to bring bilateral ties back on the track of healthy and stable development.During a meeting in Beijing with a delegation of Japanese business leaders, comprising more than 200 executives from major Japanese companies, Li said China-Japan relations are currently at a crucial juncture.The premier said that China and Japan should translate the political consensus that "the two countries are cooperative partners, not a threat to each other" into specific policies and concrete actions.He also urged the Japanese side to properly handle the historical issues and the Taiwan question.The delegation, led by Chairman of the Japan Business Federation Tokura Masakazu, Chairman of Japan-China Economic Association Shindo Kosei and Chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi Ken, is in Beijing on a four-day visit to China starting Tuesday.During the meeting, Li emphasized the need to strengthen economic and trade cooperation between China and Japan and jointly safeguard stable and unimpeded industrial and supply chains.He said that the Chinese and Japanese economies are deeply integrated with each other, playing a crucial role as the "ballast" and "propeller" in bilateral relations.China is willing to tap into cooperation potential with Japan, share development opportunities, and support companies from both countries in strengthening cooperation in the fields of technological innovation, digital economy, green development, healthcare and elderly care to achieve higher-level mutual benefit, the premier said.Li expressed his hope that the Japanese business community will exert a positive influence on the countries' win-win cooperation.He assured the Japanese business leaders that China will continue to uphold the policy of opening-up, further shorten the negative list for foreign investment and fully implement the removal of all the restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector.While ensuring the national treatment for foreign-funded enterprises, Li said that China strives to build a world-class business environment that is market-oriented and governed by a sound legal framework.China welcomes Japanese companies to continue investing in the country, he said. It is hoped that Japan will provide an open, fair and nondiscriminatory business environment for Chinese companies in the country, he added.Sino-Japanese relations had become strained over the past few years. However, during a meeting in November in San Francisco in the United States, President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reaffirmed jointly building a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the demands of the new era.Observers said that the delegation's visit to China has sent positive signals about both economic and political aspects in bilateral ties, indicating the desire of the Japanese business community to maintain dialogue and communication with China in order to seek opportunities for cooperation.The leaders of the three Japanese business organizations told Li that they look forward to both countries building a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship based on mutual benefit.They expressed their willingness to deepen exchanges and cooperation with China in multiple areas and jointly promote regional economic cooperation.caodesheng@chinadaily.com.cn  China urges Japan to refrain from sending wrong signals to the forces advocating "Taiwan independence" and avoid creating disturbances in the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.After the announcement of the election results in the Taiwan region on Saturday, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa openly expressed congratulations to the Taiwan region's new "president-elect" Lai Ching-te."Such actions severely interfere with China's internal affairs, seriously violate the One-China principle, and go against the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan," a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Japan said on Sunday."We strongly express our dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this, and have officially lodged solemn representation with the Japanese side."The spokesperson emphasized that Taiwan is part of China, and the elections in the Taiwan region are China's internal affairs.The One-China principle is a fundamental norm in international relations and a widely recognized consensus in the international community. The Chinese side consistently opposes any form of official exchanges between countries that have diplomatic relations with China and its Taiwan region, the spokesperson said."We earnestly urge the Japanese side to deeply reflect on its history of aggression against Taiwan, faithfully abide by the commitments made on the Taiwan question, refrain from sending any wrong signals to the forces advocating 'Taiwan independence', and avoid creating disturbances in the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait and in Sino-Japanese relations," he said.China strongly opposes the visit of high-ranking officials from the Japan Self-Defense Forces to the war-linked Yasukuni Shrine, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Japan has said, sternly urging Japan to completely sever ties with militarism.According to information released on Saturday by the Chinese Embassy in Japan, its spokesperson said: "High-ranking officials of the Japan Self-Defense Forces visited Yasukuni Shrine, which enshrines many Class-A war criminals from World War II.

We firmly oppose this and sternly urge Japan to face up to and deeply reflect on its imperialist history, completely sever ties with militarism, and gain the trust of neighboring Asian countries and the international community through practical actions."Hiroki Kobayashi, vice-chief of staff of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, visited Yasukuni Shrine on Tuesday with dozens of senior GSDF members.

We insist on striving for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and efforts," the spokesperson said."At the same time, in response to external interference and the activities of a very small number of 'Taiwan independence' separatists and their separatist activities, we will never promise to give up the use of force and reserve the option to take all necessary measures," he added.jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cnBEIJING -- Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday sent a message of condolence to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida over the strong quakes hitting Japan's prefecture of Ishikawa.In his message, Li said he was shocked to learn of the strong quakes in the prefecture, which caused heavy casualties and property loss.On behalf of the Chinese government, Li expressed deep condolences for the deceased, and offered sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured.Li said he believes that under the leadership of the Japanese government, the people in the disaster-hit areas will be able to overcome difficulties and rebuild their homes as soon as possible, adding that China is willing to provide necessary assistance to Japan in earthquake relief.TOKYO - Chinese Consulate-General in Niigata, Japan, has called on Chinese nationals to strengthen safety precautions in winter.The consulate said in a notice on Saturday that Japan is prone to natural disasters, and the weather in the prefectures of Niigata and Yamagata is particularly unpredictable, with frequent snow and rain, in winter.For backpackers, they may keep updated with local weather forecasts and official disaster information, and plan travel routes accordingly, the consulate said.For those choosing group tours, it is recommended to select eligible travel agencies, manage itineraries reasonably, and keep contact information of tour guides, tour leaders and drivers, as well as hotel addresses and phone numbers, according to the notice.Chinese tourists for skiing are reminded to equip themselves with necessary gear and refrain from traveling alone, it added.Chinese nationals traveling by car are advised to choose appropriate vehicles, strictly follow traffic rules, drive cautiously, and reduce speed on icy roads, the notice warned.On Saturday, a Chinese female tourist was found buried in snow and suffocated while skiing in Niigata prefecture.In response to the tragic accident, the consulate staff rushed to the scene and requested the Japanese police to conduct a thorough investigation into the accident.The consulate said that it has informed the family of the deceased and will help family members travel to Japan to deal with the aftermath.Daisaku Ikeda, honorary president of the Buddhist organization Soka Gakkai who contributed greatly to fostering ties between Japan and China, has passed away from natural causes at his residence in Tokyo.He was 95 years old and died on Wednesday evening.

On Sept 8, 1968, 11 years after Josei Toda, the second president of the Soka Gakkai, made his declaration calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons, Ikeda issued a Japan-China proposal, calling for the early normalization of diplomatic relations with China.The proposal resonated widely among those concerned about the future of the two countries, according to the Soka Gakkai.Diplomatic normalization was realized by the Joint Communique of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People’s Republic of China in 1972.Ikeda visited Beijing and held discussions with then Chinese premier Zhou Enlai and then vice-premier Deng Xiaoping in 1974. He had a meeting with then Chinese premier Wen Jiabao during Wen’s visit to Japan in 2007, and maintained ties with China’s leadership for many years, NHK reported.The positioning of the comprehensively advancing strategic and mutually beneficial relationship was reaffirmed in the Thursday meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and a mutual understanding was sought in order to pave the way for a new era in Sino-Japanese relations, according to Japanese media."Additionally, it is reported that both sides acknowledged the differences in their positions on issues of common concern. Through dialogue, they aim to find solutions to these issues. These developments are seen as positive and welcomed by Japan's business community," said Takeo Donoue, executive managing director of the Japan-China Economic Association."The exchange between the top leaders has been a sought-after initiative, and there is an expectation that it will have a positive impact on bilateral relations, including economic exchanges," Donoue said.During their meeting in San Francisco, the two leaders reiterated their commitment to the principles and consensus stipulated in the four political documents between the two countries, and agreed to dedicate themselves to jointly building a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that can meet the demands of the new era, Xinhua News Agency reported.Donoue emphasized that both Japan and China consider it important to build the bilateral relationship in the new era while maintaining the commitment to the fundamental principles agreed upon in the past."From the perspective of economic entities, it is expected that transparent and fair business environments will be developed through exchanges of opinions at various levels. This is particularly crucial for advancing exchanges in areas such as green economy, healthcare, and caregiving," he said.Xinhua contributed to this story.jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cnPresident Xi Jinping highlighted the need for Beijing and Tokyo to reaffirm the positioning of their strategic relationship of mutual benefit and to add new dimensions to the relationship during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in San Francisco on Thursday.The meeting took place one year after the two leaders met in Bangkok, when they were attending the 29th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting.Xi stressed in his opening remarks that the pursuit of peaceful coexistence, lasting friendship, win-win cooperation, and common development is in line with the fundamental interests of the people of China and Japan in the current international landscape.Both sides should grasp the historical trend, follow the trend of the times, focus on common interests, properly handle differences and adhere to the principles set out in their four political documents, Xi said.Both nations should commit to building China-Japan relations that meet the requirements of the new era, he added.This year marks the 45th anniversary for the Treaty of Peace and Friendship Between China and Japan.Xi said the treaty, established in a legal form, set the overall direction for bilateral peaceful cooperation, emphasizing opposition to hegemony and becoming a milestone in the history of bilateral relations.Even though China-Japan relations have weathered storms, they have overall maintained positive momentum over the past 45 years. The relationship has brought benefits to the people of both countries and played a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development, he added.Kishida said China and Japan, as neighboring countries with a shared long history, have the responsibility to follow the path of coexistence and mutual prosperity.As major countries leading the region and the international community, they should contribute to global peace and stability, he added.Educators from China and Japan have called for joint efforts to further promote comprehensive, multilevel collaboration in education to deepen mutual understanding and communication between the two peoples."I hope that schools and educators from both countries can promote cultural exchange and people-to-people interactions by engaging in wide-ranging and multidimensional educational exchanges and cooperation," said Fu Bo, deputy secretary-general of the China Education Association for International Exchange, at the ninth China-Japan Conference on Education Exchange and Cooperation, which opened in Tokyo on Tuesday."This is especially important in strengthening the exchange and interaction among young people, contributing to the healthy and stable development of China-Japan relations."More than 100 educational institutions from both countries are taking part in the three-day event."Through this conference we hope to discuss teaching policies that align with 21st-century development, especially in the post-COVID-19 era," Yoshihiro Watanabe, executive vice-president for cultural affairs at Waseda University in Tokyo, said. "We anticipate lively discussions among educators from China and Japan on how to collaborate in the areas of cultivating future talent, implementing globalized education and strengthening university-level exchanges."Last year about 100,000 international students from China studied in Japan, accounting for about half of Japan's total international student body.In 2019 about 6,000 Japanese studied in China, said Yosuke Kobayashi, director of international affairs at the Higher Education Bureau of Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.Collaborative researchAdditionally, universities in China and Japan are engaged in collaborative research across various fields. There are 9,000 exchange agreements between universities in the two countries, and 130 Japanese universities have established offices in China, Kobayashi said.Du Kewei, counselor of the education section at the Chinese embassy in Japan, said the fundamental approach to fostering people-to-people connectivity is through cultural and humanistic exchange, which plays a crucial role as a stabilizer of national relations, a catalyst for practical cooperation and a facilitator of people-to-people friendships."By promoting cultural and humanistic exchange, advancing mutually beneficial cooperation, and addressing differences appropriately, we strive to construct a China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era," Du said.Chiang Cheng-yin, adviser to the dean of academic affairs at the international affairs division of Waseda University, said he hopes Japanese students who wish to study in China can have a good understanding of China and approach it with an open mind."Sometimes we take students to visit top Chinese enterprises, and many students are very surprised because it is completely different from what they see on Japanese television," Chiang said. "They have the opportunity to gain an objective understanding of China."Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi has emphasized on Thursday that Tokyo should "translate into concrete actions" its words that state its hopes to improve China-Japan relations as soon as possible.Wang made the urge when he met in Beijing with Takeo Akiba, special adviser to the Japanese cabinet and secretary general of Japan's National Security Secretariat.Together with Akiba, Wang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, held consultations under the China-Japan high-level political dialogue mechanism.Wang "clarified China's principled position on the current China-Japan relations and pointed out the right path to improve and develop China-Japan relations", the Foreign Ministry said in a statement."The two sides reiterated that they abide by the principles set out in the four China-Japan political documents and are making efforts to push the two countries' relations back to the track of sound and stable development," the statement said."Both sides agreed to continue maintaining communication in this regard," it added.During the talks, Wang also stated China's position and concerns on topics such as the discharge of radioactive contaminated water from a nuclear power plant in Japan's Fukushima into the sea, Taiwan and the history.Chinese Minister of Ecology and Environment Huang Runqiu urged Japan to engage in full consultations with stakeholders in handling the release of nuclear-contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in a responsible manner."We also called for the prompt establishment of a long-term international monitoring mechanism with the participation of Japan, neighboring countries, and other relevant stakeholders to effectively protect the global marine environment," Huang said at the 24th Tripartite Environment Ministers Meeting among Japan, South Korea, and China. The two-day meeting closed on Saturday in Nagoya, Japan.People from various sectors of the Japanese society have called for the continued building of a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship.Japan's Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said she firmly believes that Japan and China can pave the way to solving various issues and achieve peace and stability in East Asia through candid communication and engaging in continuous dialogue.China's assistance is indispensable not only in terms of Japan-China relations but also in terms of addressing global issues such as climate change and pandemic response, Kamikawa said at a reception in Tokyo on Monday commemorating the 45th anniversary of the signing of the Japan-China Treaty of Peace and Friendship.Currently, there are various possibilities for cooperation in Japan-China relations, but at the same time, there are numerous challenges. In such times, it is crucial to engage in multilevel and repeated dialogue from the leadership to the general public to jointly accelerate the building of a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship, she said via translation.On Oct 23, 1978, during the visit of then Chinese Vice-Premier Deng Xiaoping to Japan, the two countries exchanged the approval documents for the Japan-China Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which officially came into effect."Our ancestors, generation after generation, have made efforts for the development of Japan-China relations. This invaluable spirit is worth revisiting, and we can learn many things from it," said Toshihiro Nikai, a member of Japan's House of Representatives and chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union.Nikai urged everyone present at the inception to return to the original intention of the treaty and pool their wisdom and strength to breathe new life into the spirit of the treaty.Today, Japan and China need to deepen and expand cooperation in addressing global issues such as climate change, said Masakazu Tokura, chairman of the Japan-China Exchange Promotion Executive Committee and chairman of the Japan Business Federation."Looking back over the past 45 years, the relationship between the two countries has not always been smooth," Tokura said. "However, our predecessors faced each issue at the time with sincerity, thus laying the foundation for our present-day relationship."Currently, amid challenges between the two nations, it is essential for both countries to promote mutual understanding through dialogue, he said. As in the past, relentless efforts are needed to steadily address these issues. To create this atmosphere, high-level dialogue and communication between the leaders of both countries are crucial for building a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship.In the context of the relationship between Japan and China, the role of the government is of utmost importance. The establishment of mutual trust at the highest levels of both nations is indispensable. Furthermore, it is essential to actively promote people-to-people exchanges, said Takeshi Noda, president of the Japan-China Society."The current state of Japan-China relations is very challenging, and because of this, we must never engage in warfare again. Instead, we should reexamine the four political documents issued by Japan and China," Noda said.He proposed a toast to the 45th anniversary of the signing of the Japan-China Treaty of Peace and Friendship and to the further progress of the relationship between the two countries.Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao noted that 45 years after the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, the world is undergoing rapid changes in the midst of a century's transformation, and the international and regional situations are becoming more complex and volatile."China-Japan relations are facing increasingly challenging internal and external environments. The times demand that we draw wisdom and inspiration from the 45-year development process of China-Japan relations and deeply contemplate the precious values and paths to achieve peace and friendship in this new context," Wu said.He emphasized that both sides should adhere to the spirit of the treaty, genuinely honor commitments, and rigorously fulfill the principles and obligations established in the four political documents between China and Japan."Together, we should build China-Japan relations that align with the requirements of the new era," he said. "We are willing to work with the Japanese side to manage existing conflicts and differences, address new challenging issues, deepen practical exchanges and cooperation, uphold international fairness and justice, and make the necessary contributions to the peace, stability and development of the region and the world."As a climax of the celebrations of the 45th anniversary of the landmark Treaty of Peace and Friendship Between China and Japan, leaders from both sides pledged to relive the spirit of the treaty and envisioned the future growth of bilateral ties.Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday exchanged congratulatory messages on the 45th anniversary of the signing of the treaty.In his message, Li expressed Beijing's willingness to work with Tokyo to "firmly grasp the correct direction of the development of the two countries' relations" and commit to building a China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era.In August 1978, the leaderships of the two countries made their strategic decision to sign the treaty, one of the four landmark bilateral political documents signed since the normalization of China-Japan relations in 1972.The treaty, in the form of a legal protocol, sets out the general direction of bilateral ties, featuring peaceful coexistence and friendship between the two neighboring countries for generations to come, and emphasizes that both nations are opposed to hegemonism.In his message sent to Tokyo on Monday, Li described the treaty as "an important milestone in the development process of relations between the two countries" and said China is willing to work with Japan to "relive the spirit of the treaty".The premier said the development of China-Japan relations over the past 45 years was "hard-won".He said the progress made in the relationship "has enhanced the well-being of the two peoples and contributed in positive ways to the peace, stability and prosperity of the region and the world".Kishida said, "Japan is willing to relive the spirit of the treaty with China and strive for greater development of Japan-China relations."The Japanese prime minister said it is important for the two sides to work together to build a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship."Japan and China shoulder important responsibilities for peace and prosperity in the region and the world, and have the potential for cooperation in a wide range of areas," he said.Addressing a commemorative reception in Tokyo on Monday, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa noted that there are many challenges facing Japan and China and that "we must renew our determination to further develop the aspirations of our predecessors, which are inscribed in the treaty"."It is important to pass on these aspirations to the next generation, who will be responsible for the future of both Japan and China, and to ensure that this treaty will always retain its brilliance," she added.Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Kamikawa also exchanged congratulatory messages on the same day.The exchange of congratulatory messages between the two sides "sends an important positive message of upholding China-Japan peace, friendship and cooperation", said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.It is still necessary to honor the core contents of the treaty, such as noninterference in each other's internal affairs, when handling China-Japan relations today, she said.Observers said that China-Japan relations are at a critical stage of improvement and development amid many risks and challenges, and the two sides should secure the political foundation of the relationship, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and manage and control contradictions and divergences.Cheng Yonghua, executive vice-president of the China-Japan Friendship Association and former Chinese ambassador to Japan, noted that China-Japan ties have been dampened recently as Tokyo frequently issued negative signals on strategically blocking China and economically "decoupling" with China, and some Japanese politicians even linked the situation in the Taiwan Strait to Japan."Tokyo should not forget its treaty obligations and it needs to rethink the role of the relationship in Japan's diplomatic strategy. Economic development and the improvement of people's livelihoods are common tasks for China and Japan, particularly in this post-pandemic era," he added.Japan is currently China's fifth-largest trading partner, and China is Japan's largest trading partner, export destination and source of imports. Last year, bilateral trade totaled $357.424 billion, according to the Ministry of Commerce.About 61.5 percent of Chinese respondents and 53.1 percent of Japanese respondents endorsed the importance of people-to-people exchanges in improving bilateral relations, according to a recent survey by China International Publishing Group and Japanese think tank Genron NPO.BEIJING -- Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday exchanged congratulations on the 45th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship Between China and Japan.In his message, Li said that 45 years ago, the older generation of leaders and statesmen from both countries made a strategic decision to sign the treaty, which has charted the course for peaceful coexistence and everlasting friendship between the two neighbors in legal terms with an emphasis on opposing hegemonism, and has become an important milestone in the development of bilateral relations.Over the past 45 years, Li said, China-Japan relations have made hard-won progress, which has enhanced the well-being of the two peoples and made contributions to regional and global peace, stability and prosperity.China, he said, is willing to work with Japan to relive the spirit of the treaty, stay the course in steering bilateral relations, and commit to building China-Japan relations suited to the requirements of the new era.In his message, Kishida said that the treaty stipulated the development of bilateral relations featuring lasting peace and friendship, which has, over the past 45 years, served as a guidance for the two sides, laid the foundation for the growth of bilateral ties and safeguarded and advanced their peaceful and friendly relationship.Shouldering an important responsibility of maintaining regional and world peace and prosperity, Japan and China share cooperation potential in a wide range of fields, Kishida said, adding that it is significant for the two sides to work together to build a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship.The Japanese side is willing to relive the spirit of the treaty with China and push for greater progress in Japan-China relations, Kishida said.Dialogue mechanisms between China, Japan essential for Asia, forum hearsA consensus on peaceful development and win-win collaboration between China and Japan has been reached at the 19th Beijing-Tokyo Forum, which concluded in Beijing on Friday.About 100 experts and scholars from the two countries who gathered for the two-day event unanimously believe that China and Japan should work together to build peace and security in Asia and the world, at a time when the risks of global division and regional conflicts continue to increase.This year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which outlines key principles for peace and friendship.China and Japan should rekindle the original intention of the treaty, said the consensus, calling on China and Japan, as two major countries for the peace and prosperity of Asia and the world, to strive to build a peaceful and secure order in Asia and the world and make every effort to achieve this goal.At this time, communication and dialogue are particularly important, said the consensus, suggesting that the two countries should establish structured dialogue mechanisms, especially at the grassroots level, and maintain smooth communication.This was echoed by senior officials, experts and the public from both countries.In his congratulatory message to the forum, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Japan and China bear important responsibilities for fostering peace and prosperity in the region and the international community at large, adding that it is of extreme importance for the two sides to conduct dialogue.A survey released last week showed that the majority of respondents in both countries believe that both China and Japan should revisit the content and core spirit of the treaty and expand the consensus based on it.Potential targetedThe forum also calls for stronger economic and trade cooperation between China and Japan in a bid to unleash more potential for a sustainable and open world economy."The economies of China and Japan complement each other well, and they face common challenges such as the environment, declining birthrates, aging populations and diminishing growth potential. Both countries should strive to create a market-oriented, rule-of-law and internationalized business environment, and promote the process of Asian economic integration," it said.Since the implementation of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1978, bilateral relations have ushered in the best period in history, with more frequent exchanges between the governments and civil societies.China's reform and opening-up policy, which took off the same year, have also led bilateral ties to a new level.In 1981, trade volume between Beijing and Tokyo surpassed $10 billion, more than double the figure of $4.82 billion in 1978. Three decades later, China-Japan trade topped $300 billion in 2011.As the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership took effect last year, observers believe that this will further promote regional economic cooperation and boost confidence in regional economic growth.Cheng Yonghua, former Chinese ambassador to Japan, reaffirmed the achievements that China and Japan have made over the past 45 years, saying that economic complementarity and interdependence between the two countries have always existed and would continue to deepen despite significant changes in their respective economic structures."China and Japan are neighboring countries and major economies in the world. Continuing the path of peaceful and friendly cooperation between the two is in line with the intrinsic needs of each country's economic and social development," he said at the forum.Launched in 2005, the Beijing-Tokyo Forum is an annual event that serves as an important platform for interaction and exchanges between China and Japan.zhaoruinan@chinadaily.com.cnPeople in China and Japan have emphasized the need for stronger trade cooperation and grassroots exchanges between the two countries, as they see bilateral ties as critical to regional peace and development, according to the results of the 19th China-Japan Public Opinion Poll released on Tuesday.The survey, conducted by the China Foreign Languages Publishing Administration and Japanese think tank Genron NPO, found that about 60 percent of Chinese respondents and 65 percent of Japanese respondents consider bilateral relations "important or comparatively important".Bilateral economic and trade cooperation has long been the cornerstone and driving force of Beijing-Tokyo ties, said the survey, adding that more than 54 percent of Chinese respondents and over 60 percent of their Japanese counterparts value each others' nation as a major global economic power and an important trade partner, reaffirming the crucial role of trade in China-Japan ties.The survey also highlighted the significant role of trade in the future growth of both countries, with 60.1 percent of Chinese respondents and over 67 percent of Japanese respondents recognizing the importance of trade cooperation.Furthermore, the survey emphasized the value of people-to-people exchanges in promoting China-Japan friendship, with 61.5 percent of Chinese respondents and 53.1 percent of those in Japan recognizing its significance.Both Chinese and Japanese people expressed high expectations from collaborations in addressing regional and global issues.The survey found that more than 65 percent of Chinese respondents and 62.4 percent of Japanese respondents consider peace as the most important goal to be achieved by the two nations, while 50.5 percent of Chinese respondents and 28 percent of their Japanese counterparts consider cooperative development a crucial shared objective.In addition, the survey revealed shared concerns over the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daichi Nuclear Power Plant.Almost half of Chinese respondents and approximately 40 percent of their Japanese counterparts expressed worries about the issue. Only 25 percent of Japanese respondents had a positive attitude toward the credibility of the International Atomic Energy Agency's review results and the appropriateness of the discharge.This year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan, and respondents from both countries have high expectations for the promotion of peaceful and friendly relations based on the spirit of the treaty.More than 43 percent of Chinese respondents believe that signing new political documents or adding supplementary files would enhance the treaty's effectiveness.The annual survey, which began in 2005, serves as an important platform for both countries to understand public opinion and foster mutual understanding.China's Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao said on Thursday he hopes China and Japan will build political mutual trust, deepen people-to-people exchanges, properly handle differences and disputes, and jointly safeguard Asian unity.Speaking at an event marking the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship and the 74th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Wu said this year is an important milestone for both nations."In the context of the changing global landscape and with a focus on regional and global peace, stability, and development, we hope that both sides will take the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship as an opportunity to revisit the spirit of the treaty, abide by treaty obligations, … build political mutual trust, promote mutually beneficial cooperation, deepen people-to-people exchanges, properly handle differences and disputes, and work diligently to construct China-Japan relations that meet the requirements of the new era," Wu said."We also look forward to China and Japan, as important countries in Asia and the world, jointly safeguarding Asian unity, promoting regional development, and making positive contributions to the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large."The treaty, in legal form, defines peace and friendship as the common goals and obligations of both parties. It sets forth a series of core principles, including enduring peace and friendship between China and Japan, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue, and joint opposition to any country seeking hegemony.During a gathering of distinguished Japanese and Chinese guests in Tokyo on Thursday, Wu said China will steadfastly deepen reform and opening-up."China's reform and opening-up is an ongoing process with no finish line. We will continue to advance deeper reforms and higher-level opening-up, creating a first-class business environment characterized by marketization, the rule of law, and internationalization … China will always welcome investors from countries, including Japan, with a proactive and open attitude, and we are committed to achieving mutual benefit and win-win outcomes," he said.In addition, the world's second-largest economy will unwaveringly work toward building a community with a shared future for humanity, he said.As a practical platform for building a community with a shared future for humanity, the Belt and Road Initiative also celebrates its 10th anniversary this year.China has signed cooperation agreements with 152 countries and 32 international organizations, leading to more than 3,000 cooperation projects in connection to the initiative.It is estimated that by 2030, the BRI will bring about $1.6 trillion in annual benefits to the global economy and help lift nearly 40 million people out of poverty, Wu said.Chinese and Japanese politicians, artists and folks celebrated the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship in Tokyo on Tuesday while protesters rallied against Japan's military buildup.China-Japan relations face complex challenges today, 45 years after the treaty was inked in August 1978, said Wu Jianghao, Chinese ambassador to Japan. Therefore, the importance of the spirit of the treaty has grown even greater."Commemorating the signing of the treaty is not only an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to peace, but also a chance to draw upon the wisdom of our predecessors," he said.By seeking common ground while shelving differences, and consolidating common understandings, "we can infuse more positive energy into the improvement and development of China-Japan relations and construct a China-Japan relationship that is suitable for the demands of the new era," Wu said.The people of both countries are encouraged to use diverse and extensive exchanges to break through information bubbles, transcend prejudices with their own experiences, and establish more objective, truth-based mutual recognition and understanding.The Union of Chinese Residing in Japan awarded a China-Japan peace and friendship medal to former Japanese prime minister Yasuo Fukuda.Fukuda said he hopes that the growth of China-Japan friendship will serve as the starting point for Asia and the world to move together toward peace and prosperity. He said he also hopes that the Chinese community in Japan, together with the Japanese people, can contribute to the economic and social development of both nations.He Delun, president of the Union of Chinese Residing in Japan, noted that there are over 1.1 million Chinese nationals and Chinese descendants in Japan, serving as an important bridge connecting the two countries. They represent an indispensable grassroots force for promoting Sino-Japanese peace, friendship, exchange and cooperation.Also on Tuesday, a number of Japanese citizen groups and some politicians rallied in Tokyo in protest against the nation's aggressive military buildup and attempts to amend its pacifist Constitution.Mizuho Fukushima, leader of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, said her party opposes Japan's military expansion. "Japan should engage with all nations in a peaceful manner, avoid conflict with China and address issues in Sino-Japanese relations through diplomatic means," she said.Japan's defense ministry said on Aug 31 that it is seeking a record 7.7 trillion yen ($52.1 billion) budget for the 2024 fiscal year, up 13 percent from the previous year.Under a plan announced by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, the defense ministry budget for the five years through fiscal year 2027 will total 43 trillion yen, an over 50-percent increase from its previous spending plan covering fiscal year 2019 to 2023, Nikkei Asia reported.Shoichi Mineo, deputy general secretary of the Kanagawa High School Teachers and Staff Union, said the strengthening of the military alliance between the United States and Japan, with Japan serving as a regional stronghold in East Asia, does not necessarily safeguard the interests of the Japanese people."The Kishida administration has completely disregarded the interests of the Japanese people," Mineo said, and the administration should place greater emphasis on dialogue and communication with neighboring countries.Tokyo welcomes the return of China Festival, a well-established event in Japan, during the weekend after a three-year halt because of COVID-19.With an expected attendance of around 150,000 visitors, the two-day event opened on Saturday at Yoyogi Park, showcasing cultural exchanges between Chinese and Japanese people. The festival features more than 80 exhibition booths for various cuisine and products from different regions of China, as well as traditional Chinese cultural presentations such as erhu (two-stringed bowed instrument) performances and martial arts.Visitors of the festival were also given the opportunity to experience the latest environmentally friendly electric vehicles from China, learn about the local customs of Yunnan province, and enjoy a blend of traditional and modern Chinese costumes.BEIJING -- China has made serious representations and made clear its solemn position against Japanese politicians' negative moves related to the Yasukuni Shrine, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.Spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remarks at a press briefing in response to media reports that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida sent a ritual offering to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine on Tuesday, while one of Kishida's cabinet members, economic security minister Sanae Takaichi, paid a visit to the shrine.Today marks the 78th anniversary of Japan's acceptance of the Potsdam Proclamation and its unconditional surrender, Wang said, pointing out that the Chinese people, together with the people of the world, defeated the Japanese militarist aggressors and fascism.It was a great victory of justice over evil, of light over darkness, and of progress over reaction, which will forever be enshrined in the history of the Chinese nation and the history of the human pursuit of justice, Wang said.Noting that the Yasukuni Shrine is a spiritual tool and symbol of the Japanese militarists' war of aggression, and honors Class-A war criminals of World War II, Wang pointed out that the Japanese politicians' negative moves once again reflect Japan's wrong attitude toward historical issues."China has lodged solemn representations with Japan and made clear its solemn position," Wang said.Facing up to and deeply reflecting on history is an essential prerequisite for Japan to restore and develop normal relations with its Asian neighbors after World War II, Wang said, adding that China urges Japan to draw lessons from history, adhere to the road of peaceful development, and make a clean break with militarism through concrete actions to avoid further losing the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community.BEIJING -- A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Saturday said it is hoped that Japan will work with China to take the 45th anniversary of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship Between China and Japan as an opportunity to revisit the spirit of the treaty, recommit to the consensus in the treaty, and jointly build a China-Japan relationship that can meet the requirements of the new era.Saturday marks the 45th anniversary of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship Between China and Japan."Forty-five years ago, China and Japan concluded the Treaty of Peace and Friendship Between China and Japan," the spokesperson said when answering a relevant query, adding that the Treaty codifies the commitment of China and Japan to peace, friendship and cooperation and establishes the ever-lasting principles and direction for bilateral interaction that prove to be as relevant as ever.In the past 45 years, China-Japan relations have come a long way, bringing tangible benefits to the two peoples and contributing to the prosperity and stability of the region and beyond, the spokesperson added."The relations between our two countries are at a critical stage of improvement and growth," said the spokesperson.It is hoped that Japan will work with China to take the 45th anniversary of the treaty as an opportunity to revisit the spirit of the treaty, recommit to the consensus in the treaty, uphold the political foundation, enhance mutually beneficial cooperation, remove distractions and barriers and jointly build a China-Japan relationship that can meet the requirements of the new era, the spokesperson added.Japan and China should make a concerted effort to manage their bilateral relations with great care, strengthen communication between the governments, and engage in cooperation in various fields, politicians and observers told an event in Tokyo on Thursday marking the 45th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.In the last 45 years, the power dynamics between Japan and China have greatly reversed, they said, and the international environment surrounding both countries, including the China-US relationship, has also undergone significant changes."As we celebrate the 45th anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, our relationship is currently at a crossroads. We must hold on to rationality and hope," Yukio Hatoyama, former Japanese prime minister, told the audience."It's crucial to take into account each other's perspectives. Rather than disliking each other due to differing values and systems, it's important to acknowledge differences, mutual respect and mutual understanding."He also highlighted the importance of addressing the Taiwan Strait situation."Japan should uphold its constitutional commitment to renounce war and confirm its adherence to peaceful dispute resolution and nonuse of force. The Japanese government also needs to respect the position that Taiwan is a part of China, as outlined in the Sino-Japanese joint statement inked in 1972, and refrain from supporting Taiwan separatists," he said.US-led encirclementTakakage Fujita, director-general of a civil group dedicated to upholding and developing the well-known Murayama Statement, called for Japan to restore a normal and friendly neighboring relationship with China, instead of blindly following the United States and rushing headlong into an anti-China encirclement under the pretext of a "Taiwan contingency".Following the US, Japan began regulating cutting-edge technology exports to China under the pretext of economic and security concerns. Fujita said this goes against Japan's national interests in the long run."I want to contemplate how the relationship between Japan and China in the 21st century should be. We must ask ourselves: Is it right to continue to depict China as a hypothetical enemy and move steadily toward war preparations?" Fujita said."China is not an enemy. It's our largest trading partner. And true security for Japan lies in a strong friendship with China."Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao said the two countries must firmly grasp the correct direction of peace, friendship and cooperation.China and Japan signed a treaty named after peace and friendship due to the shared experience of a war history inflicted by Japanese militarism that caused suffering to both nations, Wu said."Today, 45 years later, some individuals within Japan seem to have forgotten the lessons of history. They propagate the idea of a 'China threat', incite tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and even threaten to enhance their military deterrence, embracing a dangerous rhetoric. Succumbing to such misleading notions could lead Japan astray once again," he said."In the current context, enhancing people-to-people exchanges to promote mutual understanding is of paramount importance."Starting from Thursday, China will fully resume group tours of Chinese tourists to Japan, and welcome more Japanese people to visit China. Wu added that measures to facilitate visa issuance are being optimized.China on Wednesday condemned former Japanese prime minister Taro Aso's visit to Taiwan, urging Tokyo to refrain from interfering in China's internal affairs or lending support to the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces in any form.Aso, also the vice-president of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, met with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and deputy leader Lai Ching-te during his three-day visit starting on Monday.He delivered a speech in Taipei saying there should be no war in the Taiwan Strait, and called for a posture of strong deterrence and "readiness to fight".Aso is the most senior Japanese political figure from his party to visit Taiwan since 1972, when Tokyo ditched ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.Despite China's opposition, a certain Japanese politician's move sought to hype up cross-Strait tensions, stoke antagonism and confrontation, and blatantly interfere in China's internal affairs, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.China has made serious demarches to Japan over the visit, saying it violates the one-China principle and the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan and tramples on the basic norms governing international relations.The Japanese politician kept raising the possibility of "a war" while in Taiwan, an obvious attempt to stir up trouble in the Taiwan Strait and push the people in the Taiwan region over the edge of an abyss, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in the statement."What makes this Japanese politician think he is in a position or has the confidence to make such unwarranted remarks on Taiwan?" the spokesperson said.No one should underestimate the strong resolve, will and capability of the Chinese people to defend the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the statement said.The spokesperson urged Japan to reflect on its history of aggression, and abide by the one-China principle and its commitments regarding the Taiwan question.The spokesperson also warned the Taiwan authorities that "Taiwan independence" has no future, and soliciting Japan's support and selling Taiwan away will only harm the people in Taiwan.Any attempt to collude with external forces in seeking independence and provocations will only fail, the spokesperson said.China dismissed on Thursday Japan's "global public relations campaign" to justify its plan to dump radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea, and said Japan will fail to "whitewash" its plan no matter how much it tries."If the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water is truly safe, Japan wouldn't have to dump it into the sea—and certainly shouldn't, if it's not," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a daily news conference.The Japanese government "is trying to silence public opposition to the discharge plan in Japan by introducing a special fund", Mao said, adding that the government is using the recent report released by the International Atomic Energy Agency as a "greenlight" for going ahead with the plan.Slamming Japan for "talking about the ocean discharge plan as if it was a done deal", Mao said the legitimacy, legality and safety of the plan is being widely questioned by the international community.The plan is also being questioned by the Japanese people, a recent poll conducted by Kyodo News showed. The poll results revealed that more than 80 percent of respondents said that they felt the explanation provided by the Japanese government on the discharge plan was insufficient.The Japanese government had promised local fishermen in 2015 that it would not release nuclear contaminated water into the sea without gaining understanding from parties concerned.Japan will probably break the promise, Mao said, pointing out that its decision to stick to the ocean discharge plan does not take into account public concerns, particularly those of the fishing and farming communities.Japan should stop pushing ahead with the plan, Mao said, urging it to seriously heed the legitimate concerns of the international community and the people in Japan, have full, sincere communication with neighboring countries, dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water in a truly responsible way, and accept strict international scrutiny.Meanwhile, China has tightened its restrictions on food imported from Japan. The General Administration of Customs announced earlier this month that it would prohibit food imports from 10 Japanese cities or prefectures, including Fukushima, and conduct a strict review of food imports from other parts of Japan.Responding to the Japanese government's plans to call for China to lift the food import restrictions, Mao said that China has good reason to oppose Japan's ocean discharge plan and impose the ban on food items."The Chinese government puts people first. Our job is to be responsible for the health of our people and the marine environment. Our opposition to Japan's ocean discharge plan is based on facts and reason, so are the measures that we have decided to take," she said.Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi on Friday urged Tokyo to "shape an objective and rational perception of China, draw lessons from history with practical actions, and adhere to the path of peaceful development".Wang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the urge in a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi in Indonesia's Jakarta.They were meeting on the sidelines of a series of annual meetings involving 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.Recently, Tokyo has positioned China as the biggest strategic challenge, exaggerating China's so-called threat on multiple occasions and in various documents.Wang said this is "seriously inconsistent with the reality of China-Japan relations" and runs counter to the important consensus of the two sides that they "are cooperative partners, and do not pose a threat to one another".He called on the Japanese side to "improve the feelings between the people of the two countries and promote China-Japan relations to return to the track of sound, stable development".Beijing "is open to" maintaining contacts at all levels, including economic and trade exchanges as well as people-to-people exchanges, he added.Hayashi said Tokyo looks forward to building constructive and stable Japan-China relations and creating conditions for high-level exchanges.He added that there is great potential for cooperation between Japan and China in a wide range of fields. Tokyo welcomes the intimate two-way exchanges and it hopes to further strengthen people-to-people exchanges.Speaking on Tokyo's plan to discharge contaminated water from a nuclear power plant in Fukushima prefecture into the Pacific Ocean, Wang stressed that Japan should "fully communicate with its neighboring countries in a sincere manner, handle it cautiously, rather than persisting in going its own way".He pointed out that there is no global precedent for such discharge, and there are no agreed standards."This is not only a scientific issue, but also a question of attitude," he said.Tokyo should face up to the legitimate concerns of all parties and to the different opinions of experts and scientifically examine different ways for the waste water's treatment, he added.China Festival 2023 will be held in Yoyogi Park, one of the largest parks in Tokyo, in September, with the aim of promoting people-to-people exchanges between China and Japan.At a ceremony on July 12, Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao said the strong demand for cultural exchange between the people of China and Japan is why the China Festival 2023 is being organized.China and Japan agreed to expand people-to-people exchanges. The two sides should continue to leverage their geographical proximity, close people-to-people ties and other unique strengths, and facilitate exchanges and communication through channels between governments, political parties, legislatures and localities among others.The hosting of China Festival 2023 is a reflection of this spirit, Wu said at a news conference at the China Cultural Center in Tokyo.The China Festival has been held for several years, with its popularity increasing each year, Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese Prime Minister and chief advisor of the executive committee of the festival, said at the news conference."Now, after three years of COVID-19, the festival will be held again. I believe the enthusiasm will be even higher. I hope that more people will have the opportunity to experience Chinese culture and cuisine," he said.Fukuda emphasized that people-to-people exchanges are essential for fostering understanding between countries and cultures. Otherwise, there will be no mutual understanding between the people of both countries. Therefore, organizing events like the China Festival is of great importance, he said.China Festival 2023 will be held at Yoyogi Park from September 9 to 10. It is expected to have approximately 80 booths. The exhibition will showcase various cuisines, snacks and products from different regions of China, as well as traditional Chinese cultural presentations such as erhu (two-stringed bowed instrument) performances and martial arts. The event will also include activities related to tourism, youth exchange and urban communication between sister cities, with an estimated participation of around 150,000 people.Yoichiro Aoyagi, a member of the House of Representatives of Japan, told China Daily: "There are indeed issues in current China-Japan relations. It is not a good thing if China and Japan are in opposition. Establishing a dialogue between the two countries is crucially necessary."As a politician, Aoyagi said he highly values people-to-people exchanges, so he has been supporting the China Festival in Tokyo since its beginning in 2017."It is through continuous exchanges among diverse individuals that China-Japan relations can improve. I hope to see the China Festival serve as a channel for people-to-people exchanges," he said.From the beginning, the festival has not only been an event organized by the Chinese embassy in Japan but has also involved Japanese politicians and groups, making it a joint effort, he said.Yuji Miyamoto, former Japanese ambassador to China, said the most important aspect of the current China-Japan relations is promoting cooperation."If China-Japan relations are not good, it would be unfortunate not only for both countries, but for the entire world. What we need to do now is to find ways to enhance cooperation and consider what should not be done to avoid unfriendly relations between the two countries," said Miyamoto in an interview with China Daily.This year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship. A Silk Road-themed exhibition, organized by the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum and The Asahi Shimbun Company, will also be held in Japan starting from mid-September.Chen Zheng, minister counselor of the Chinese embassy in Japan, said the Silk Road represents the historical imprint of the exchange, integration and mutual learning of world civilizations and is a great example of China's inclusiveness and openness.Over two thousand years of history have proven that, as long as countries with different races, beliefs and cultural backgrounds adhere to unity and trust; equality and mutual benefit; inclusiveness and mutual learning; and win-win cooperation, they can share peace and seek common development, composing a chapter of friendship through the ages, Chen said.Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said on Thursday the China-Japan relationship is at a new critical juncture and he called on the two countries to overcome external distractions in developing bilateral ties and jointly oppose "decoupling".Wang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the remarks in a meeting with Yohei Kono, president of the Japanese Association for the Promotion of International Trade, in Beijing.Leading an 80-strong delegation, the 86-year-old former Speaker of the House of Representatives of Japan kicked off the China visit on Monday. It is the 46th visit to China by the association's delegation since it was founded in 1954.Noting that this year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Wang Yi told his Japanese guest to build bilateral relations that meet the requirements of the new era based on fundamental principles, remain undisturbed by external distractions, implement the political consensus that China and Japan are cooperative partners rather than threats to each other, and jointly safeguard the hard-won peace and stability in Asia.He expressed the hope that Kono and the association will strengthen confidence in cooperation, oppose "decoupling economies or severing supply chains", and make new contributions to the improvement and development of China-Japan ties.During the meeting, Wang also slammed a claim in Japan that "any contingency concerning Taiwan would be an emergency for Japan", saying it is absurd and dangerous. He urged Tokyo to be highly vigilant against such claims.Kono said that Japan-China relations have come a long way and cooperation has brought benefits to both sides.The business community does not agree with the politicization of economic issues, and "decoupling economies or severing supply chains" is in the interests of no one, he said.Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, said that Kono's visit signaled the Japanese business community's willingness to improve bilateral ties through enhanced economic and trade cooperation with Beijing.Such a positive voice needs to be heard by Japanese politicians, he said, adding that Japan should look at the overall bilateral ties, and refrain from interfering in affairs concerning China's core interests or working with the United States to contain China.Despite the contradictions and challenges in China-Japan relations, it is important for the two countries to explore opportunities for cooperation and communication, he said.When addressing a welcoming banquet on Tuesday, Kono said that if Japan and China look at the current difficulties in their ties ten years from now, they will find that these difficulties can be overcome.He said he hopes to create a new future together with the Chinese side, and that cooperation is the best way to solve the difficulties in bilateral ties.Premier Li Qiang called on Wednesday for Japan to work with China to implement the political consensus that both countries are cooperative partners, and not a threat to each other.Li made the remark in a meeting in Beijing with a Japanese business delegation led by Yohei Kono, president of the Japanese Association for the Promotion of International Trade. The delegation started its visit to China on Monday.China and Japan are close neighbors that share common waters, Li said.Noting that this year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, the premier said that both sides should always abide by the principles established in the four political documents agreed to by China and Japan.China is committed to promoting high-level opening-up and will continue to support Japanese companies in expanding investment and cooperation in China, he said.Li expressed his hope that Kono's association will further play a leading role in promoting mutually beneficial cooperation and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.He also welcomed closer economic, cultural and people-to-people exchanges and cooperation between the two sides at subnational levels.Kono said that his association is dedicated to promoting economic and trade exchanges between Japan and China, enhancing friendship between the two countries, and supporting China's development.He expressed willingness to work with the Chinese side in upholding the spirit of mutual respect and mutual trust, and continuously promoting friendly cooperation between Japan and China.Kono's association is one of the seven Japan-China friendship groups whose activities are aimed at promoting Japan-China friendship and strengthening economic and trade relations. The ongoing visit, the first in four years, came amid high expectations about promoting a stable bilateral relationship after ties worsened in recent years.From January to May, China's trade with Japan saw a 3.5 percent year-on-year decline, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.There are still many worrisome factors in the current Japanese government's policy toward China, typically noise about "decoupling", analysts said, adding that it is unwise for Japan to blindly follow the US and ruin its economic relations with China.The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday expressed regrets over the "hasty" release of the International Atomic Energy Agency's report on Japan's disposal of nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, which gave Japan approval on the release.In a statement issued on the ministry's website, a spokesperson said the report failed to fully reflect views from experts that participated in the review and the conclusion was not shared by all experts."We believe the IAEA report should not be the 'shield' or 'green light' for Japan's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean," the spokesperson said.According to the ministry, due to its limited mandate, the UN nuclear agency failed to review the justification and legitimacy of Japan's ocean discharge plan, assess the long-term effectiveness of Japan's purification facility and corroborate the authenticity and accuracy of Japan's nuclear-contaminated water data."Therefore the conclusion is largely limited and incomplete," the spokesperson said.The spokesperson added China has noted IAEA chief Rafael Mariano Grossi said the agency conducted the review at the request of the Japanese government and the report is neither a recommendation nor an endorsement of Japan's ocean discharge policy."No matter what the report says, it will not change the fact Japan will release millions of tons of nuclear-contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean in the next three decades," the spokesperson said.The IAEA's report, the ministry alleged, failed to answer questions concerning the long-term effectiveness of Japan's purification facility and the international community's right to be informed when the discharged water exceeds the discharge limit."We once again urge the Japanese side to stop its ocean discharge plan and earnestly dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water in a science-based, safe and transparent manner," the spokesperson said, adding if Japan insists on going ahead, it will have to bear all the consequences.The ministry also urged Japan to work with the IAEA to put in place a long-term international monitoring mechanism that would involve stakeholders, including neighboring countries.TOKYO -- Japan should have a correct understanding of China from the root, adopt strategic independence, understand the trend of the times, and truly promote the stable development of bilateral relations with a constructive attitude, Chinese Ambassador Wu Jianghao said.Wu told a press conference at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo on Friday that China has always advocated good-neighborly friendship and win-win cooperation between the two countries, and has never regarded Japan as an adversary, let alone a threat or an enemy, expressing hopes that Japan will do the same.Regrettably, the Japanese side has publicly positioned China as "the greatest strategic challenge," followed and cooperated with certain countries to oppose and contain China, hyped up the "China threat," and accelerated its military build-up, he noted.If Japan continues to adopt such a cognitive positioning and policy, the foundation of China-Japan relations will be substantially damaged and the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations will be out of the question, Wu added.The ambassador also warned that Japan should not interfere in China's internal affairs, stressing that the Taiwan question is at the core of China's core interests and concerns the foundation of China-Japan relations, a red line that cannot be crossed.The wrongful remarks that "a Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency" is absurd and dangerous, said Wu, adding that it is illogical and harmful to link matters that are purely China's internal affairs with Japan's security.Regarding the discharge plan of Fukushima nuclear wastewater into the sea, Wu said that the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water has a direct bearing on the global marine environment and human health and safety, and no one can make a conclusion as to how long the impact will last and how much harm it will bring.China's position on the issue is clear, that is, it firmly opposes Japan's discharge plan of nuclear-contaminated water, he said, noting that the Japanese side should take the strong opposition at home and abroad seriously, honestly fulfill its international obligations and deal with the nuclear-contaminated water in the safest and most prudent way.When asked about the Group of Seven (G7)'s recent accusations against China, Wu said the G7 has become a political tool of some countries to wantonly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and suppress the development and progress of other countries.The G7 does not represent the international community and their consensus is not a global consensus, the ambassador stressed.China's ambassador to Japan warned Tokyo on Friday that it may lose the Chinese market and the future of its semiconductor industry if it cooperates with the United States on chip export curbs."If Japan insists on doing so, the loss will not only be of the Chinese market, but also the future of Japan's semiconductor industry," said Wu Jianghao, the Chinese envoy, referring to Tokyo's announcement last month that it will tighten exports of 23 types of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.Speaking at the Japan National Press Club, Wu called for Japan to formulate its China strategy independent of Washington and reminded Tokyo that Japan itself was a victim of protectionism and unilateral sanctions."Japan once suffered from the unjust and cruel suppression of the US, and the pain of that experience is still felt, so it should not become an accomplice of the US," said Wu, adding that the cooperation between China and Japan should be open and fair, and not hindered by limitations or the decoupling mentality.'Lost three decades'In the 1980s, US export restraints on Japanese motor vehicle and semiconductor exports dealt a heavy blow to Japan's major car and electronics companies. The Plaza Accord in 1985 resulted in a very strong Japanese yen and further hurt Japanese exporters, which ended with Japan falling into the abyss of what is widely called the lost three decades.Wu also said China will carefully evaluate the actual impact of Japan's policies and will not sit idly by if China's interests are unjustly damaged."We do not want to see a situation where both China and Japan suffer losses, while another country rejoices," he said.The ambassador's remarks came at a time when Japan has been increasingly bellicose toward China, with Japan labeling China as the "greatest strategic challenge" in its National Security Strategy issued last December.Wu said China has never seen Japan as a rival, let alone a threat or an enemy.The ambassador said he hopes that Japan, as an important member of the region and the world, stands on the right side of history and partners with China to build a "community with a shared future for mankind" together by establishing an "objective" perception toward China with "strategic autonomy" that takes into consideration the "trend of the times".Beijing on Thursday voiced welcome to prominent Japanese politician Toshihiro Nikai on becoming chairman of a group of Japanese lawmakers focused on friendship with China.Nikai, former secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, has been appointed as head of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union, a non-partisan organization.At the organization's plenary meeting on Wednesday, it was decided the union will work toward a visit to China in June."Mr Toshihiro Nikai is a veteran statesman, and the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union is one of seven major Japanese organizations promoting friendship with China," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a daily news conference in Beijing on Thursday.For a long time, Nikai and the union have been dedicated to advancing exchanges and cooperation between the two countries, Wang noted."We are glad Mr Nikai has become the union's new chairman and stand ready to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with the union," Wang added.Nikai, 84, was secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party from 2016 to 2021 and has led delegations on multiple visits to China.Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Thursday that Japan has repeatedly hyped up the so-called "China threat "and increased its military buildup in recent years, sending a dangerous message that it is attempting to overturn the post-World War II international order.Calling on the world to remain vigilant against this attempt, Wang said Japan has kept breaching its Peace Constitution and its commitment to the exclusively defense-oriented policy over the years by sharply increasing defense spending and developing offensive weapons.Wang made the remarks while commenting on reports about missile contracts the Japanese Ministry of Defense has signed with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.Japan has awarded the company contracts worth 378 billion yen ($2.84 billion) to develop and build a new missile force, Reuters reported.The four contracts include land-, sea- and air-launched missiles as well as a hypersonic ballistic warhead that it wants to start deploying in 2026, and the new missile force is expected to be capable of striking ships and land targets more than 1,000 kilometers from Japan, according to Reuters.China is paying a high level of attention to such reports and will closely follow the developments, Wang said."We strongly urge the Japanese government to reflect deeply on its history of invasion, effectively respect the security concerns of its Asian neighbors, adhere to the exclusively defense-oriented policy and peaceful development, and act cautiously in the military and security fields," the spokesman said.In December, Japan unveiled plans to increase its defense spending by more than 50 percent to about 43 trillion yen over the next five years, sparking China's strong concerns.In response, the Foreign Ministry has urged Japan, which has increased its defense budget for 10 consecutive years, to take more steps conducive to regional peace and stability.China is seriously concerned about Japan's planned export restrictions on chip manufacturing equipment and called Japan out to correct the wrong doings, China's Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday.The comments came after Japan said last week it planned to restrict exports of 23 types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, aligning its technology trade controls with the US push to curb China's ability to make advanced chips. The Japanese government is seeking public opinions on the measures."The relevant measures proposed by Japan are essentially harmful acts against China under the coercion of a certain country, which will not only damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, but also cause Japanese companies to suffer, and damage the stability of the global supply chain," the Ministry of Commerce said on its official website.China is the world's largest semiconductor market and the largest export destination of Japanese semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The industries of the two countries have long formed a close relationship between the upstream and downstream of the industrial chain, according to the ministry."We hope that the Japanese side will listen to rational voices… and correct its wrong practices in a timely manner, so as to promote the healthy development of economic and trade relations between China and Japan, and work with all parties to maintain the stability of the global semiconductor industry and supply chain," the Ministry of Commerce said."If the Japanese side insists on obstructing cooperation in the semiconductor industry between China and Japan, China will take decisive measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," the ministry added.China expressed strong dissatisfaction on Monday over Japan's export restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment, hoping Tokyo would prudently make decisions and avoid complicating mutual trust and bilateral ties.Japan announced on Friday it would tighten exports of 23 types of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment spanning six categories. The rules, which will take effect in July, were seen as a move to artificially impose restrictions on semiconductor cooperation with China.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news conference that China will evaluate the impact of Japan's policies and will make firm responses if such moves harm China's interests.Mao noted that Beijing expressed concerns and had lodged representations at various levels to Tokyo over the restrictions.China is the world's largest semiconductor market, and the country's integrated circuit imports are nearly $600 billion per year, Mao said.The country is also the largest export market for Japan's semiconductor industries, with annual exports to China exceeding $10 billion. The Chinese market accounts for a quarter of Japan's semiconductor equipment exports, Mao said.Repercussions warnedChina and Japan have carried out mutually beneficial cooperation so far, she said, adding that the restrictions Japan might take will not only harm regional and global semiconductor industry and supply chains, but will also hurt Japanese enterprises. China hopes Japan would act on its statements of advancing cooperation with China and take an objective stance, defend a stable and smooth global industrial chain, a free and open global trade order as well as common interests of both sides, she said.Japan's export controls followed restrictions by the Netherlands on overseas sales of semiconductor technology last month, after the United States secured a deal with the two countries to restrict exports of some advanced chip-making machinery to China in January, Bloomberg reported.Speaking to Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi on Sunday, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang said Washington used bullying to brutally suppress Tokyo's semiconductor industry, and it is now using the same tactics against Beijing, urging Japan not to help the evil.Visit: Japan should handle wastewater responsiblySenior officials in Beijing have urged Tokyo to subscribe to a proper perception of China, appropriately control bilateral divergences and "remove obstacles and burdens" bothering Sino-Japanese ties.They made the call when meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi in Beijing. Hayashi was in China over the weekend on his first visit to the country in his current capacity.The meetings on Sunday sent a clear warning to Tokyo that the relations between China and Japan, the world's second- and third-largest economies, respectively, will fray further if Japan fails to alter its policy regarding Taiwan or continues to echo Washington's plan to contain China geopolitically and economically, observers said.Premier Li Qiang told Hayashi that Tokyo should work toward the same goal with Beijing, manage differences properly and build a relationship that fits the needs of the new era.Major issues, including historical concerns and the Taiwan question, are pivotal to the political foundation of bilateral ties and should be properly tackled with sincerity and credibility, Li said, adding that the two countries are important economic and trade partners, and should achieve a higher level of mutual benefits.State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang told Hayashi that the two sides should push their ties to "rule out disturbances, overcome challenges and move forward".The Taiwan question is "at the core of China's core interests" and it is pivotal to the political foundation of bilateral ties, Qin echoed the premier when urging Tokyo to honor past commitments, refrain from meddling in matters involving the Taiwan region and keep from damaging China's sovereignty.The United States recently asked Japan and the Netherlands to join forces with it to restrain or ban exports to China in semiconductor-related sectors.Last week, Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao warned that the production chain built by Chinese and Japanese firms will be "considerably damaged" if Tokyo is subject to such US-led "suppression"."The Japanese semiconductor industry may lose China — its largest market — and will find it hard to secure the sustainability of its own development," Wu said.On Sunday, Qin told Hayashi that the US had dealt a heavy blow to Japan's semiconductor sector, with an outright bullying approach in the past, and now it is trying to play the same trick on China.Japan "still feels the pain" and it should not side with the US, he said, adding that rallying against China will "lead to nothing but galvanizing China's determination to seek self-reliance and prosperity on its own".As Japan holds the presidency of the G7 Summit this year, Qin urged Tokyo to "properly navigate" the G7 meetings' keynote and agenda, and do more in advancing the region's peace and stability.This year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, one of the four landmark political documents underpinning the relations.Referring to the anniversary, Hayashi said the Sino-Japanese ties "are rich in potential for future growth", and Tokyo is ready to fully implement consensus of leaders from both sides and will stay committed to the four political documents.Japan is ready to boost contacts and pragmatic cooperation with China at all levels, properly address each other's concerns and push for building a constructive and stable relationship, he added.Lyu Yaodong, deputy director-general of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Japanese Studies, said the conflict of interests in security, politics and values "should not be Tokyo's excuse for frequent backsliding and violation of the spirit of the four landmark China-Japan political documents"."Driven by their obsession with (issues of) national interest, policymakers in Tokyo have frequently hedged their bets when shaping China policies, and Japan's approach to China has been drifting between a reconciliatory tone and a tougher tone," Lyu said.The key to keeping the ties afloat lies in whether Japan's China policy can stay true to the principle of the four political documents, and substantially turn into reality the common interests of both countries and the greater region, he added.Speaking about a recently reported case of a Japanese citizen being suspected of espionage in China, Qin said the Chinese side will handle the case in accordance with law.In response to Tokyo's plan to discharge contaminated radioactive wastewater into the Pacific Ocean, Qin said this is a major issue related to the safety of all mankind, and Japan should handle the matter in a responsible manner.Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, also met with Hayashi on Sunday.BEIJING - Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs, in Beijing on Sunday.Noting that China and Japan are close neighbors and important Asian countries, Li said maintaining and developing China-Japan relations benefits not only the fundamental interests of the two peoples but also regional peace, stability, and prosperity.This year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship.Li called on the two sides to review and abide by the principle of the treaty to firmly develop a lasting China-Japan relationship featuring peace and friendship.He called on the Japanese side to take the 45th anniversary of the signing of the treaty as an opportunity to meet China halfway, enhance communication and cooperation, properly handle differences, stay clear of disruptive risks, and keep expanding the positive side of bilateral relations to jointly build a relationship that meets the demand of the times.Li pointed out that major issues of principle, such as history and the Taiwan question, are the bedrock of the political foundation of China-Japan relations, which call for sincere, cordial, and careful settlement.Noting that China and Japan are important economic and trade partners, Li said the two sides should and can make the pie of economic and trade cooperation bigger.He called on the two countries to enhance cooperation in the digital economy, green development, fiscal and financial sectors, as well as medical and elderly care services to achieve high-level mutual benefit and win-win results.Li welcomed Japan to continue to deepen cooperation with China and share China's development benefits.He expressed the hope that the two sides will jointly safeguard free trade, practice true multilateralism, actively promote the process of regional integrity, maintain the stability and smooth flow of industrial and supply chains, and contribute to regional and global development.Japan and China have great cooperative potential in a wide range of areas, said Hayashi, adding that Japan is committed to promoting cooperation with China.Hayashi said Japan is willing to work with China to take the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship as an opportunity to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, maintain high-level exchanges, and keep carrying out dialogue and communication to build constructive and stable bilateral relations.BEIJING - Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang held talks with Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs, in Beijing on Sunday.Noting this year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Qin said the two sides should, in line with the consensus between the leaders of the two countries, review the spirit of the treaty, strengthen exchanges and communication, and overcome difficulties while advancing bilateral ties.He said a profound lesson from bilateral relations over the past half-century is that peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation are the only correct choices for both sides. Noting the four political documents between China and Japan have laid a political and legal foundation for bilateral ties, Qin said keeping promises and drawing lessons from history is the prerequisite for the steady and long-term growth of China-Japan relations.He called on Japan to have a correct understanding of China, work with the Chinese side to enhance dialogue and communication, promote practical cooperation, increase people-to-people exchanges, and properly manage differences to build a China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era.Regarding the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean, the Chinese foreign minister urged Japan to handle the disposal responsibly, as it is a major issue concerning public health and the safety of humanity.On the Taiwan question, Qin said it is the very core of the core interests of China, which bears on the political foundation of China-Japan relations. China urges Japan to abide by the principles enshrined in the four political documents between the two countries and its commitment so far, and refrain from interfering in the Taiwan question or undermining China's sovereignty in any form, he said.In the case of a Japanese citizen suspected of engaging in espionage activities in China, Qin stressed China would handle it following relevant laws.For his part, Hayashi expressed Japan's willingness to work with China, implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, abide by the four political documents between Japan and China, properly handle issues of common concern, promote the building of constructive and stable Japan-China relations, and jointly contribute to regional and global prosperity and stability as responsible countries.The two sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues, including the cooperation between China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, the situation on the Korean Peninsula, and the reform of the United Nations Security Council. BEIJING - Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, met with Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister and former chairman of the Boao Forum for Asia, in Beijing on Friday.Wang said China has reasons to be concerned about the possible regression of Japan's policy toward China and to question whether Japan will continue to adhere to the direction of peaceful development.China hopes Japan will return to the original aspiration of the four political documents between the two countries, remove interference from all sides, and create conditions for the healthy development of China-Japan relations and the resumption of post-pandemic exchanges in all fields, he said.Wang lauded Fukuda's contribution to China-Japan friendship over the years and hoped that more Japanese people from all walks of life will play a positive role in improving China-Japan ties.Hailing China's efforts to peacefully resolve regional disputes, Fukuda said China has actively promoted economic globalization and achieved fruitful results in external exchanges and cooperation, injecting confidence and certainty into this world of change and disorder.Fukuda said he hopes that the two countries will maintain high-level exchanges, strengthen people-to-people exchanges, enhance mutual understanding, eliminate misunderstanding and misjudgment, and work together for peace and development in Asia.China and Japan have completed construction of a direct telephone line under the defense sector's maritime and air liaison mechanism, the Ministry of National Defense announced on Friday, one day before Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi's visit to China.Both sides will keep in touch over the launch of the line, the ministry said in a statement on its official WeChat account.The completion of the line's construction will enrich channels of communication between the two countries' defense authorities, strengthen both sides' ability to manage maritime and air crises, and help further maintain regional peace and stability, the ministry said.The line is a key element of the bilateral maritime and air liaison mechanism, but the Japanese government's "purchase" of the Diaoyu Islands in 2012 led to a halt of the line's construction.In November 2022, as President Xi Jinping met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on the sidelines of the 29th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders' Meeting in Bangkok, the two countries' teams reached several common understandings, including an early launch of the line.Also on Friday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning announced Hayashi's visit to China over the weekend.The China visit will be the first in more than three years paid by a Japanese foreign minister since the then Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi visited China in December 2019.Zhou Yongsheng, a professor at China Foreign Affairs University, told Global Times that the visit by Hayashi shows that China-Japan ties have eased after a time of difficulty, and that China has shown its sincerity by announcing the completion of the direct phone line's construction ahead of the visit.The construction of the line will help avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation, and prevent escalation of tensions, Zhou said.During Hayashi's visit, Chinese leaders will meet with him, and State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang will hold talks with him, Mao said.China attaches importance to Hayashi's visit, Mao said. The two countries are each other's important neighbors, and a healthy and stable bilateral relationship serves the common interests of both countries and the region, she said.China stands ready to work with Japan to follow the strategic guidance of the important common understandings between their leaders, enhance dialogue and communication, deepen practical cooperation, manage and control differences, and build a stable and constructive China-Japan relationship fit for the new era, said Mao.China's leading innovation hub pledged on Thursday to have "a long-term strategy" for its cooperation with Japan, and announced new incentives aimed at attracting more investment as the number of Japanese-funded enterprises in China's technological region passed 700.Mao Wei, Party chief of Suzhou New District, or SND, in Jiangsu province, made the remarks during a meeting with Japanese entrepreneurs in Tokyo."We will take cooperation with Japan as a long-term strategy for the development of the SND and we look forward to sharing with our Japanese friends the opportunities of openness, industrialization, innovation and green development," said Mao, while recalling the district's solid foundation of cooperation with Japan.As one of China's first national high-tech zones, the SND has pursued developing high technology and achieving industrialization for the past three decades, vigorously implementing an innovation-driven development strategy.Data showed that the number of Japanese-funded enterprises in the SND has reached 703, with a total investment of over $20 billion, accounting for one-third of such enterprises in Suzhou. Among them, there are 18 Fortune Global 500 companies, including Panasonic and Canon."It is because of this (innovation-driven strategy) and others that we could achieve creating nearly 8 percent of Suzhou's economic output with only 2.5 percent of the land area," Mao said. Government data showed that Suzhou's GDP last year was $353.9 billion.In order for the SND to remain a strong magnet for Japanese investors, Mao said the SND had carried out a series of initiatives to improve the quality and efficiency of services for Japanese companies."We will take the breakthrough of 700 Japanese-funded enterprises as a new starting point, focus on creating a market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment to improve the long-term service mechanism, and provide professional and high-quality services for the investment and development of Japanese enterprises," Mao added.Under the SND's initiatives, companies that invest in the SND will be eligible for a range of benefits, including tax credits and grants.Yuji Kokubo, a developer of neutron generators, said it chose to invest in the SND because the SND has a complete upstream and downstream industrial chain, a sound policy support system, a good financial business with upgraded industrial infrastructure and a professional service team.Toshiaki Takeuchi, chairman of Nihon Dempa Kogyo, a crystal devices producer that set up the first wholly foreign-owned factory in the SND, said: "I have been deeply involved in the development of the SND for 29 years. During this period, I have received warm support from the government."Young people in both Japan and China should read Japanese Nobel literature laureate and committed pacifist Kenzaburo Oe and commemorate his spirit, experts said at a seminar in Beijing on Wednesday.Several Chinese and Japanese scholars recalled how relevant Oe's works were even today at the seminar, organized jointly by the Chinese Association for Japanese Studies and the Institute of Japanese Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Oe, a Japanese literary giant, died on March 3 aged 88. His works encompass a wide range of themes, from being anti-militarist to being against the US-Japan security treaty. As a novelist, he expressed concerns for Japanese society, history, nationality and other issues, displaying an intellectual's conscience and sense of responsibility.The seminar commemorated Oe as a pacifist who firmly upheld Japan's pacifist Constitution. Participants said Oe respected history, loved peace and had made great contributions to enhancing friendship and cultural exchanges between China and Japan.Gao Hong, head of the Chinese Association for Japanese Studies, said the spirit of Oe will never die. Oe participated in pro-peace activities and co-founded the Article 9 Association. He wished to see a final reconciliation between Japan and China, and hoped Japanese people, especially the youth, grew up to be peace lovers.Gao said that Oe's advocacy was commendable after the end of the Cold War, when Japanese society was seeing a reemergence of nationalism and the political right. He said Oe's spirit can awaken Japanese people's conscience and stop Japan from repeating history.Yang Bojiang, director-general of the Institute of Japanese Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that Oe was a guardian of pacifism and a whistle-blower in Japan after World War II. "He had a keen sense of responsibility for mankind and integrated his works and important global issues together," Yang said.Oe reflected on Japan's history of aggression. Given that Japan is undergoing its most strategic transformation since World War II, Oe's anti-war attitude showed his strong sense of social responsibility, humanity and conscience.Wu Huaizhong, deputy director of the Institute of Japanese Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Oe's pro-peace spirit does not belong to any one country, but to all humanity. It is important to commemorate his pursuit of peace at a time when Japan is adjusting its security strategies and diplomatic policies.In the 45th anniversary of China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, the two countries should carry forward and promote Oe's spirit, work together to bolster peaceful development, stand on the right side of history and strive to build a China-Japan relationship fit for the new era, Wu said.TOKYO -- An event of warm and friendly exchanges centered around giant pandas was hosted by the Chinese Embassy in Japan on Friday evening, with the guests sharing love for the cute animal as well as anecdotes about the China-Japan relations.Attending the big warm party held at a hotel here in Japan's capital city were Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, Director of Ueno Zoo Yutaka Fukuda, head of the Panda Protection Institute of Japan Toshimitsu Doi, and more than 230 giant panda fans who have been active on the front line of friendly exchanges between Japan and China.The panda-themed event came not long after Japanese people waved goodbye to the beloved Japan-born giant panda Xiang Xiang as well as three other pandas returning to China in February.Before the evening party formally kicked off, a documentary film was released on cooperation between the two countries on giant panda protection and research, which evoked happy memories of the audience about pandas."When I was a child, I would stand in a long queue with my family to see giant pandas. It's an experience I will always remember," or "Japan held a writing competition about giant pandas, in which I participated and won a prize" was among people's cited experiences related to pandas.Yang Yu, charge d'affaires of the Chinese embassy in Japan, said when addressing the event that the giant panda is not only a messenger of friendship between China and Japan, but also a symbol of world peace."We are ready to work with Japan and other countries in the world to build the Earth all people live on into a truly peaceful home," he added. In September 2017, Governor Koike announced that the female panda cub born three months earlier at Ueno Zoo was named Xiang Xiang, who soon became a nationwide star and permanently a trending topic on local media.In February this year, Xiang Xiang returned to China after living in Japan for five years.At the party, Ueno Zoo Director Fukuda updated the panda fans on how well Xiang Xiang is doing in China, while Koike said she wishes Xiang Xiang to grow up healthily in China and become a great mother.In talking to people charmed by the giant panda photos that he has taken for years, photographer and blogger of "Mainichi Panda" Takahiro Takauji said that he is planning to organize a group tour of panda fans to China to visit Xiang Xiang."I can feel everyone's deep love for giant pandas," said Ruriko Kojima, a Japanese artist to go to China for studies. "I hope to go to China as early as possible to see them, and to introduce more of the real China to Japanese people. "Araki Tatsuo came to the event wearing a panda mask and a panda tie and carrying a panda doll."Through the giant pandas, I can better introduce Chinese culture to everyone and let people feel the charm of China," said the special researcher at the University of Tokyo.Zhu Jianrong, a professor at Japan's Toyo Gakuen University who has long been active in the friendly exchanges between China and Japan, commented on the event: "When it comes to giant pandas, people have a lot to share.""We need more such events like this tonight to offer an opportunity for the Japanese people to feel the charm of China and to have a better understanding of China," said Zhu.In accordance with law, Chinese coast guard vessels on Wednesday expelled some Japanese vessels which had illegally entered the territorial waters of the Diaoyu Islands, a China Coast Guard spokesperson said on Wednesday night.Gan Yu, spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, said in a statement that on Wednesday its ships had entered the Islands' territorial waters to carry out a normal patrol for rights protection."That was a routine measure of China to safeguard national sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and a strong countermeasure to the intrusion of a Japanese yacht and several patrol vessels into China's territorial waters," the official said.The Diaoyu Island and its affiliated islands are China's inherent territory, Gan said, adding that untrue remarks and reports from the Japanese side had seriously distorted historical facts."We urge the Japanese side to face up to history, respect facts and do more to improve China-Japan relations," the spokesperson said.BEIJING - China urges Japan to fully consult with the stakeholders and relevant international organizations in terms of its nuclear-contaminated water discharge plan, a spokeswoman said on Monday.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning made the remarks at a regular news briefing when asked to comment on media reports that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said last week that the nuclear-contaminated water in Fukushima will be released into the ocean between spring and summer this year."We have noted relevant reports and are gravely concerned. In disregard of the strong concerns of people in Japan and the rest of the world, the Japanese government is set on pushing through the ocean discharge plan despite its obligations under international law. This is an irresponsible act that will endanger the global marine environment and people's health," Mao said.Japan has stored more than 1.3 million tons of nuclear-contaminated water, which means its release into the ocean could take as long as 30 years. The water contains over 60 radionuclides, which will be carried through the ocean to all parts of the world in a decade, causing unforeseeable harm to marine environment and people's health, Mao said."Japan's neighbors, including China, the the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Russia, and the Pacific island countries have repeatedly voiced their concerns and firm opposition to the ocean discharge plan," the spokeswoman said.She stressed that it is Japan's duty under general international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to prevent environmental pollution, minimize the hazardous effect, fully consult with the countries that might be affected, ensure transparency and engage in international cooperation.She called on Japan to take all parties' legitimate concerns seriously, fulfill its obligations, fully consult with the stakeholders and relevant international organizations, handle the nuclear-contaminated water in a science-based, open, transparent and safe manner, including by studying alternatives to ocean discharge, and fully subject itself to international oversight, so as to protect the only planet we humanity call home.Large crowds gathered at Tokyo's Narita Airport on Tuesday to say goodbye as Xiang Xiang, the first giant panda naturally bred and raised in Japan, was flown home to China.The 5-year-old female, born at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens, was originally scheduled to make the trip in December 2020, but it was postponed multiple times due to her huge popularity and the COVID-19 pandemic."The family of pandas in Japan has brought people infinite joy and left them with fond memories," a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Japan told China Daily on Tuesday, adding that giant pandas, a national treasure in China, had carried friendship and goodwill to the broader Japanese society."They (the giant pandas) are connecting the hearts of the people of the two countries," the spokesperson said.According to the embassy, cooperation in wildlife conservation has been the epitome of friendly exchanges between China and Japan. And as this year marks the 45th anniversary of the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, the love for giant pandas is expected to drive more mutually beneficial collaboration between the countries.On Tuesday morning, Xiang Xiang was taken from the zoo by truck to Narita Airport, where she was put on a charter flight bound for Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport in southwestern China. Upon arrival, she was to be transferred to the Bifengxia Giant Panda Base, a research and breeding facility, where it is hoped she will find a mate.Female pandas are said to reach breeding age around 3 or 4 years old. The Ueno Zoo said Xiang Xiang "is of good weight and health and went into estrus earlier this year".Yutaka Fukuda, director of the zoo, said, "I want to thank her for making so many people happy, and I hope (her return to China) will contribute to panda conservation research."Takahiro Takauji, the blogger behind the fan site Mainichi Panda, has visited the Ueno zoo almost daily for about 12 years to take photos. He said: "Xiang Xiang has given us a lot of happiness here in Japan. I want to thank her and hope she can serve as a symbol of peace and a link between Japan and China."I will definitely go to China to see Xiang Xiang in the future," he added.Senior diplomat Wang Yi called on Japan to remove both internal and external disruptions to promote Sino-Japan relations forward steadily.Wang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the remarks when meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi on the sidelines of the 59th Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday.As the year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Wang, also director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission, urged Japan to take the anniversary as an opportunity and meet China halfway.Noting unilateralism, decoupling and cutting off chains serve no one's interests, Wang said Tokyo should grasp the situation and make an independent choice.Wang also stressed Japan must exercise prudence on the discharge of nuclear contaminated water which concerns the marine environment and the health of peoples of all countries.Before fully consulting with neighboring countries, other stakeholders and international institutions, Japan must not initiate the discharge of nuclear contaminated water into the sea, Wang said.Hayashi said cooperation between Japan and China is of great significance to the development and prosperity of the two countries.Japan is willing to strengthen communication and dialogue with China at all levels, bolster cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, and youth exchanges and implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, he added.The two sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues.BEIJING - A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Wednesday once again urged Japan to respond to the legitimate concerns of all relevant parties and dispose of its nuclear-contaminated water in a scientific, open, transparent and safe manner.According to media reports, the technical task force of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited Japan from Jan 16 to 20 to review the country's plan to pipe nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station into the Pacific Ocean, and a report will be published within three months. However, the Japanese government unilaterally announced on Jan 13 that it would discharge the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean in the spring or summer this year.In response to a related query, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a daily news briefing that China is paying close attention to Japan's disposal of the nuclear-contaminated water, and supports the IAEA and its technical task force in conducting the review and evaluation of this issue."We hope that the technical task force will uphold the principles of objectivity, fairness and science, implement the agency's nuclear safety standards strictly, and ensure the absolute safety of the disposal of the nuclear-contaminated water. We look forward to the review report from the technical task force and will study it carefully," she said.There is no precedent for Japan's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, and this discharge process will continue for as long as 30 years. To date, the Japanese side has not provided sufficient scientific or factual basis for this, and has not resolved the international community's concerns about the legitimacy of its nuclear-contaminated water discharge plan, the reliability of its data, the effectiveness of its purification devices, and the uncertainty of the potential environmental impact, Mao stressed.China has noted with concern that the Japanese side officially approved the plan to discharge the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean last July, when the IAEA technical task force was still reviewing and evaluating it. Not long ago, on the eve of the IAEA's visit to Japan, Japan unilaterally announced that it would discharge the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean during the spring or summer this year, Mao said.Such reckless behavior raises questions about whether Japan values the authority of the IAEA and its technical task force. Is Japan determined to proceed with its unilateral discharge plan regardless of the outcome of the assessment? It is necessary for Japan to give responsible answers to these questions, she said.China once again urges Japan to respond to the legitimate concerns of all relevant parties, dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water in a scientific, open, transparent and safe manner, consent to strict supervision, and earnestly protect the marine environment, health rights and interests of people of all countries, Mao said."Without full consultation with neighboring countries and other stakeholders, as well as with relevant international institutions, Japan should not start the discharge process arbitrarily," she added.China has said its embassy and consulates in Japan would resume issuing ordinary visas for Japanese citizens.The decision was announced by the Chinese embassy in Japan on Sunday in a notice and took effect immediately.The Chinese embassy in Tokyo suspended the issuance of ordinary visas for Japanese citizens on Jan 10 after Japan joined a handful of countries in implementing discriminatory entry restriction measures targeting China.The Japanese embassy in China on Jan 20 stated its visa operations in China have "already returned to normal" according to changes in the epidemic situation.The Chinese Embassy in Tokyo announced on Tuesday that it has suspended processing and issuing regular visas for Japanese citizens to visit China.The suspension came into effect on Tuesday and the time of resuming such services remains to be notified, the embassy said in a statement.China on Wednesday slammed Japan for its "reckless and irresponsible" move to push forward a plan to release nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea, urging Tokyo to fully consult with stakeholders and relevant international institutions.In response to the International Atomic Energy Agency's third report on Fukushima water treatment published on Dec 29, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular news conference that the ocean discharge plan for the contaminated water is "by no means" Japan's domestic affair.But as the work of the IAEA's technical working group is still underway and no conclusion has been reached, Mao described Japan's moves to push ahead with discharge preparations as "reckless and irresponsible"."China once again urges Japan to pay attention to the legitimate and justifiable concerns of the international community and fully consult with stakeholders, including its neighboring countries and Pacific Island countries, as well as relevant international institutions," Mao said.Japan should adopt an open, transparent, science-based and safe approach in disposing the water, and accept strict supervision by the IAEA, she added.Mao said the report focuses on the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water and its environmental impact, and proposes methods and plans for the assessment and review of relevant data.She noted that no conclusion has been reached yet on issues of great concern by all parties, such as the authenticity and accuracy of data and whether the data collection methods meet safety standards.The IAEA report has once again demonstrated that the international community's concerns over the accuracy of data on nuclear-contaminated water, the efficacy of the treatment system and the uncertainty of environmental impact are well-founded, Mao added.In July, Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority officially approved Tokyo Electric Power Company's discharge plan, which will be implemented from spring 2023.The endorsement provoked concerns from local fishermen and objections from Asian neighbors.The IAEA Task Force's review mission visited Japan in February and March last year and released relevant reports without any conclusive opinions.China strongly opposes the sensationalization of the "China threat" and defamation of China's military in Japan's new defense documents, said Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a spokesman for China's Defense Ministry.In three security and defense documents that Japan adopted earlier this month, China was described as "an unprecedented strategic challenge". Other aggressive contents including Japan's counter-strike capability, increased military expenditure and the Taiwan question were also included in the documents.Responding to a request for a comment on the sharp shift in Japan's defense policy, Tan said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday afternoon that the China-related contents in the documents distort facts, are filled with prejudices, deliberately hype up the so-called "China threat" and smear China's national defense, the Chinese armed forces and their normal activities."Such acts have gravely interfered in China's internal affairs and created tension in the region. We strongly oppose them," the spokesman said.He said it is Japan that continues to marginalize its pacifistic constitution and defense policies that renounce the right to declare war. With the excuse of "foreign threats", Japan has extensively raised defense spending, increased the investment in military technologies such as hypersonic weapon systems, deepened military cooperation with the United States, sought so-called counter-strike capability, trumpeted the sharing of nuclear weapons with the US and colluded with other countries to establish exclusive circles. With these facts, Japan has become a real challenge to the peace, security and stability in the region, according to the spokesman.Tan urged Japan to keep itself away from the Taiwan question, always remember its history as an invader, reflect on its past crimes, honor its commitment, and be discreet about its words and deeds."We demand that Japan should learn carefully from its history, refrain itself from stepping into the Taiwan question and attempting to make a gain from it, and stay away from the country's doomed old road that alienated itself from its neighbors. Instead, Japan should do more to safeguard the regional peace and stability," he said.The Chinese embassy in Japan on Friday slammed Tokyo for referring to Beijing as its "biggest strategic challenge" in its latest defense documents, saying it was a serious distortion of basic facts and that it violated the spirit of four political documents between the two neighbors."Relevant statements (by Japan) incite 'China threat' intentionally and provoke regional confrontation. China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to this, and has lodged solemn representations with the Japanese side," a spokesperson for the embassy told China Daily.On Friday, the Japanese Cabinet approved three documents, namely the National Security Strategy, the National Defense Program Guidelines and the Mid-Term Defense Program, overturning six decades of its pacifist postwar defense strategy and aiming to arm itself with one of the world's largest military budgets.According to the documents, Japan will not only acquire counterstrike capabilities, a significant departure from its pacifist Constitution, but will also spend 43 trillion yen ($313 billion) in the next five years to strengthen its military, buying cruise missiles capable of striking China and developing hypersonic weapons among others. This will bring Japan's military expenditure to roughly 2 percent of its current GDP, a big change from its 1 percent of GDP practice that Japan has been maintaining for the past 60 years."Historically, Japan has stepped into the wrong path of militarism, conducted aggression and expansion, and committed crimes against humanity. It had brought serious disasters to our region and to the world. This time, Japan has significantly changed its security policy and strengthened its military capabilities. It raises doubt that Japan is walking away from a peaceful development track, and will inevitably invite concern and opposition of all peace-loving people," the embassy's spokesperson said."We solemnly urge the Japanese side to learn lessons from the past, do not use the so-called China threat to cover its own military expansion, and return to political consensus between China and Japan that we are mutual partners and we do not pose threats to each other. Japan needs to avoid becoming a troublemaker and a disrupter of regional security and bilateral relationships."Wang Qi, an East Asian studies researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said it would have been unthinkable for Japan to do this."But it happened anyway, which sends an alert to the world that Japan now wants to possess the capability to directly attack another country's territory," Wang said.A poll by Japanese television network TBS showed that more than 90 percent of Japanese people are against a tax increase due to the soaring military expenditure.WANG XU in TokyoAt forum, Chinese officials highlight gains from relations built on respectSenior Chinese officials stressed the principle of win-win collaboration as a key means of advancing China-Japan relations while addressing a high-end forum that opened on Wednesday.Beijing and Tokyo should work together to ensure the success of each nation, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a recorded video speech for the 18th Beijing-Tokyo Forum.The forum was inaugurated in 2005 as an annual event, and it has emerged as one of the largest high-end platforms between China and Japan in hosting public diplomacy and nongovernment interactions.In addition to win-win collaboration, calls were also heard for interactions between the two sides to be "based on credibility".This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, and next year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.In his speech, Wang called on the two sides to take these two anniversaries as great opportunities to revive the original aspirations of 50 years ago, reaffirm the treaty's spirit of joint opposition to hegemony, and push for the lasting, stable progress of the relations in order to ensure they stay on the right path.Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, noted that major and sensitive issues such as history and Taiwan, which bear on the political foundation of bilateral ties, should be handled properly in particular and relevant commitments must be honored.These issues need commitments fulfilled with actions, they should be properly treated, and efforts should be made to make sure "the line is not crossed", he said.In the first nine months of this year, the value of bilateral trade reached $270.4 billion.Wang said this figure fully manifests the potential and resilience of the economic and trade cooperation between China and Japan.China will further push for high-quality development and expand higher level opening-up, he said, adding that Beijing welcomes Japan taking up a share of the enormous opportunities resulting from this trend, he said.He called for vigilance against "malicious disturbance and containment targeting Sino-Japanese economic and trade collaboration", and he urged that joint efforts be made against unilateralism. Opposition to the concept of economic decoupling, with disruptions to supply chains, should also be voiced, the minister said.Sun Yeli, deputy director of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, said the two sides should stay tuned to the right direction of seeking peace and friendship, and they should tighten their bonds founded on shared interests by deepening economic and trade cooperation.Also, the two sides should promote cultural exchanges and build on the good faith among the peoples of the two countries, he said.Mass media and think tanks are expected to step up their exchanges and collaboration to ensure that reasonable voices are better heard, and that people garner genuine knowledge and wisdom for the Sino-Japanese friendship.He also voiced hope for deepening exchanges and interactions among young people, including teenagers, in order to cement the foundations of the bilateral friendship.Common tasks, missionsJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, in a recorded video speech for the event, said Japan and China have achieved remarkable progress in areas such as politics, the economy and culture, as well as through exchanges of visits, as guided by the strategic thinking and political courage of leaders from the two countries.There is broad space for further cooperation as the two neighbors face common tasks and missions, he said.Japan and China are expected to embark on candid dialogue and deepen their collaboration in their capacities as major countries that shoulder a duty to promote peace and prosperity in the region and beyond, Hayashi said.At the forum, prominent figures, including former Japanese prime minister Yasuo Fukuda, underlined the key role of both countries in promoting peace, stability, and development, and in jointly addressing global challenges.It is hoped that Beijing and Tokyo can work on boosting mutual trust and respect, and build a relationship in which the peoples of the two countries treat each other with an open mind and sincerity and join hands for win-win results, Fukuda said.BEIJING - The Japanese side should speak and act prudently in the military and security fields, and do more things conducive to maintaining regional peace and stability, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.Spokesperson Mao Ning made the remarks at a regular press conference when answering a query related to Japan's increasing defense budget.Mao said that Japan's defense budget had increased for 10 years in a row, and that Japan is also prone to playing up regional tensions and seeking military breakthroughs, adding that such dangerous moves have aroused strong doubts among its Asian neighbors and the international community about whether Japan can stick to an exclusively defense-oriented policy and path of peaceful development.Japan should seriously reflect on its history of aggression, respect the security concerns of its Asian neighbors, speak and act prudently in the military and security fields, and do more things conducive to maintaining regional peace and stability, she said.Most Chinese want relations further boosted to aid stability, survey findsAround two-thirds of Chinese respondents to a survey believe that China and Japan should "build a stronger new type of cooperative relationship" in order to promote peace and stability.The results of the annual poll on China-Japan relations, conducted by the China International Publishing Group and Japanese think tank Genron NPO, were released in Beijing and Tokyo on Wednesday.The survey showed that 78.3 percent of Chinese respondents support cooperation with Japan and on Asian affairs more broadly."Peace", "cooperation and development" and "equality" emerged as the three most popular concepts that Chinese respondents believe both countries should advance together.Gao Anming, vice-president and editor-in-chief of the China International Publishing Group, said that the Chinese respondents want both countries to work together in regional affairs in multiple areas and hope that they will strengthen cooperation to deal with global issues."When it comes to East Asia, avoiding disputes and maintaining lasting peace in Northeast Asia, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and China-Japan maritime and air crisis management are among the top concerns of Chinese respondents," he said.He noted that among global issues, Chinese respondents pay more attention to the response to outbreaks of infectious diseases, climate change and wealth disparities.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.In the poll, the Chinese respondents indicate they believe that the development of the overall bilateral relations over the past 50 years "has not met expectations".Chinese respondents' overall perception of Japan remains stable, and 71.3 percent of them believe that the bilateral relationship is "important" or "relatively important".Historical and territorial issues continue to affect Chinese respondents' perceptions of the relations, and the Japan-US alliance has a negative impact on the ties, according to the survey."The Asia-Pacific region is the most dynamic region in the world economy and is regarded as the engine and growth point of the world economy. China and Japan are close neighbors, and building a good-neighborly relationship can ensure the region's peace, stability and prosperity," said Lyu Yaodong, a veteran research fellow on Japanese diplomatic policy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Japan Studies.Learning from history"It is key for both countries to learn from history, build on their original aspirations made 50 years ago, ensure the ties' proper development, and strive to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that echoes the new era," he said.According to the survey, Chinese respondents reaffirmed the importance of people-to-people exchanges in improving relations.The three most popular types of nongovernmental exchanges are "communication among scholars and researchers", "communication between media" and "talent exchange between businesses".On the economic front, those responding to the poll recognize the achievements made under the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries over the past 50 years, the survey's report said.Last year, 75.4 percent of Chinese respondents to the poll believed that economic cooperation with Japan is still important to China's future, and the number this year rose to 77.4 percent.Given the pressures on global free trade, Chinese respondents support securing the world's free trade system, and they are ready to see China and Japan carry out economic cooperation to deal with the unfavorable international trade environment.On China-Japan economic cooperation, the proportion of Chinese respondents who see "strong complementarity and win-win cooperation" is 75.2 percent, up from 71.6 percent last year."The two countries should strengthen their economic and trade cooperation and identify new areas for cooperation amid the current global economic downturn," Lyu said. "They can gear up teamwork and boost efficacy in areas of common interests such as the low-carbon economy and healthcare."As the second- and third-largest economies, the two countries should inject impetus into the recovery of the world economy."More than 80 experts and scholars from China and Japan conducted in-depth exchanges on bilateral relations at a symposium held online and offline on Sunday.The event was held by the China Foundation for Human Rights Development in collaboration with the Japan-China Friendship Association in both Beijing and Tokyo.Speaking at the symposium, Wang Guoqing, vice-chairman of the China Foundation for Human Rights Development, said that the long-term, sound and stable development of China-Japan relations serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples.Nongovernmental organizations and friendly individuals from the two countries should step up exchanges and trust, and make more contributions to the China-Japan friendship, Wang said.Chinese and Japanese experts at a symposium called on Japan to face up to history and strengthen nongovernmental exchanges to promote the healthy and stable development of Sino-Japanese relations.The event was held by the China Foundation for Human Rights Development in collaboration with the Japan-China Friendship Association in both Beijing and Tokyo on Sunday. More than 80 experts from the two countries conducted in-depth exchanges on bilateral relations via online and offline.Wang Guoqing, vice-chairman of the CFHRD, said that deep reflection on the history of Japanese militaristic aggression is important for the development of Sino-Japanese relations.The history of the nations' exchanges proves that the long-term, healthy and steady development of bilateral relations is in line with the trend of the era and serves the fundamental interests of their peoples, he said.On the basis of equality and mutual respect, China and Japan have strengthened communication and exchanges in the spirit of openness, inclusiveness and seeking common ground while shelving differences, which is conducive to enhancing mutual understanding and trust, according to Wang."The nongovernmental organization is an important force for friendly exchanges and practical cooperation between the two countries," he said. "We should use the unique advantages of NGOs, properly handle differences through constructive dialogue and cooperation, enhance mutual trust and expand consensus, and continue to improve the foundation of the two countries' good friendship."Lyu Xiaoqing, vice-president of the China Society of Sino-Japanese Relations History, said that over the years, many peaceful and anti-war groups and conscientious individuals in Japan have made unremitting and selfless efforts to properly resolve the complex, sensitive issues left over from the postwar period, and they have made some progress.Hu Peng, a researcher at the Institute of Japanese Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that despite the ups and downs in Sino-Japanese relations, the exchanges and cooperation between people from the two countries have not been interrupted in the 50 years since the normalization of their diplomatic ties — particularly when it comes to dealing with their aging populations.Bilateral efforts in the field of public health have also been expanding and deepening. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the two countries provided each other with a large number of epidemic prevention supplies such as masks, goggles and protective suits, Hu said.The two sides should improve exchanges between friendship groups and create conditions and opportunities to attract and train more young people so that they can grow into a new force for nongovernmental cooperation, Hu said.In addition to existing areas of cooperation, the two sides should also work together in other areas, including disaster prevention, urban governance, community governance and rural vitalization, Hu said.Japanese experts and scholars said it is imperative to face historical facts without bias. Japan must acknowledge and reflect on its past aggression against China and faithfully convey such facts to its younger generations, they said.The CFHRD also talked about the operations of the Fund for History, Human Rights and Peace, which was set up by Japan's Mitsubishi Materials Corporation to compensate 3,765 Chinese laborers who were forced to work for the company's predecessor and its contractors during World War II, including 722 who died on the job.in September 2019, the CFHRD took over management of the fund, which plans to pay to 100,000 yuan ($14,000) to each of the victims or their families.The fund has so far paid 129 million yuan to 1,290 families of the victims.BEIJING -- More than 80 experts and scholars from China and Japan conducted in-depth exchanges on bilateral relations at a symposium held online and offline on Sunday.The event was held by the China Foundation for Human Rights Development in collaboration with the Japan-China Friendship Association in both Beijing and Tokyo.Speaking at the symposium, Wang Guoqing, vice chairman of the China Foundation for Human Rights Development, said that the long-term, sound and stable development of China-Japan relations serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples.Non-governmental organizations and friendly individuals from the two countries should step up exchanges, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and make more contributions to China-Japan friendship, Wang noted.Japanese experts and scholars said it is imperative to face historical facts without bias.Japan must acknowledge and reflect on its past aggression against China and faithfully convey the historical facts to its younger generations, they said.TOKYO - Over 130 photographs are shown at an exhibition marking the 50th anniversary of the normalization of the China-Japan diplomatic ties here in Japan.The exhibition, titled "Forever Neighbors", is on its Japan tour after being held in Beijing in June.With people-to-people exchanges as the main theme, the exhibition, which opened at Tokyo Tagenbunka Space on Tuesday, reflects the aspirations of people from all walks of life in China and Japan hoping for friendships from generation to generation.Apart from 110 photographs exhibited in Beijing, 27 photographs with Japanese characteristics have been included in Japan's version of the exhibition.The photographs were categorized into three parts, namely a review of Sino-Japanese exchange activities over 50 years, China in the eyes of the Japanese and Japan in the eyes of the Chinese, as well as photographic works of young people from the two countries.Yang Yu, charge d'affaires of the Chinese embassy in Japan, and former Japanese Prime Ministers Yasuo Fukuda and Yukio Hatoyama, attended the opening ceremony.During his congratulatory speech at the opening ceremony, Yang said that peace, friendship, and win-win cooperation are the only correct choices for the two neighboring countries.It's our common mission to renew our original aspiration for peace and friendship, draw inspiration from historical experience, adhere to the principles and spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan, and build a more mature and stable China-Japan relationship under the guidance of the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, said Yang.It is believed that the precious pictures in this exhibition can lead us through history to relive the original aspirations for friendship, and enhance the sense of mission and responsibility for maintaining and developing the cause of China-Japan friendship, he said.Hatoyama said that Japan and China are not only neighbors who cannot move away, but also neighbors who do not want to move and are neighbors forever.People-to-people friendship functions as an indispensable and important glue for the friendly relations between the two countries, he said, adding that he looked forward to the improvement of Japan-China relations in the next 50 years with the joint efforts of everyone.Hideo Tarumi, Japanese ambassador to China, said in a letter of congratulation to the exhibition that he, as the Japanese ambassador to China and a photographer meantime, hoped that the people of both countries can establish a relationship of mutual respect, recognition and help through photography.The exhibition will last until Oct 30, with lectures given by photographers also to be held.50th anniversary of normalization of relations brings reflections on achievements and the path aheadFor some time, "hot economics, cold politics" has been a frequently used phrase to describe the relationship between China and Japan. But half a century ago a spirit of optimism and goodwill hung in the air as the two governments of the day reached out to each other.Many are hoping that reflections on the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan relations will play a role in guiding the ties toward a smoother path."My grandfather feared that he could be assassinated by opposition forces in Japan if he flew to Beijing for negotiations at the height of the Cold War," Mitsuko Watanabe, granddaughter of Japan's then-foreign minister Masayoshi Ohira, said in an interview with China Daily ahead of the anniversary."But he also thought that he could not get a treaty of peace and friendship with China if he didn't take the risk," said Watanabe, adding that the normalization of diplomatic relations did not come easily and the two countries should cherish that friendship.The same fear was also shared by Kakuei Tanaka, Japan's then-prime minister who inked his name on the historic China-Japan Joint Statement on Sept 29, 1972, together with China's then-premier Zhou Enlai.Tanaka's daughter Makiko Tanaka, who served as foreign minister among key posts from 1993 to 2012, said her father took a huge gamble on normalizing relations with China because his cabinet had been formed just two months earlier. But he had acted to fulfill a long-held ambition.Makiko Tanaka remembers that her father told her before his departure to Beijing that he would resign if the mission failed."Opposition was so fierce in Japan, some ruling party hawks came to my home to stop my father from leaving. But in his opinion, the relationship with China was a fundamental issue in Japanese politics, and it was impossible to talk about Japanese politics without mentioning China," said Makiko Tanaka, adding that China had not left her father's mind since he was first elected to Japan's parliament, known as the Diet, in 1947.The gamble turned out to be a big win. A picture taken from a helicopter by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper in November 1972 shows a queue of thousands of people snaking back from Tokyo's Ueno Zoo. They were there just to see giant pandas Kang Kang and Lan Lan, given as a token of friendship from China. The mood on the streets exemplified the uplifting feeling that had taken hold at the time.A growing number of Japanese people began to view China positively and, according to data from Japan's Cabinet Office, that sentiment reached its highest point in 1980 when polling indicated 79 percent of the Japanese population had a positive image of China.50th anniversary of normalization of relations brings reflections on achievements and the path aheadFor some time, "hot economics, cold politics" has been a frequently used phrase to describe the relationship between China and Japan.

But they began to sour in the 2000s when Japan's then-prime minister Junichiro Koizumi repeatedly visited the notorious Yasukuni Shrine, where 14 Class-A war criminals are honored in Japan.The shrine is regarded as a symbol of Japan's past atrocities and militarism worldwide and its Yushukan, a war museum inside the shrine, espouses Japan's right-wing narrative of its militaristic past.The ties then entered a downward spiral a decade ago following Japan's unilateral change of its policy and the status quo concerning China's Diaoyu Islands by illegally "nationalizing" them in 2012.The trade conflict initiated against China by US president Donald Trump in 2018 saw a further erosion of the China-Japan relationship. In line with the US' actions, Japan heavily politicized economic activities between it and China, including effectively banning communications equipment from China's Huawei Technologies and ZTE imposed that year.The administration of US President Joe Biden is also focused on using economic security as a political weapon and is urging its allies to join in with such efforts against China. Tokyo, which has been caught up in the rivalry, has appeared more enthusiastic than ever to align itself with the US in terms of regional geopolitical and economic confrontation, at the expense of its economic ties with China."Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government has been aggressively promoting the so-called economic security concept, with the Japanese parliament in May passing an economic security bill aimed at guarding technology and reinforcing critical supply chains," said Wang Qi, a researcher of East Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. Such actions have led many to believe that the Japanese government is using economic security as an excuse to shut out China, Wang said.However, despite efforts by some Japanese policymakers to bring about what amounts to an economic decoupling with China, a gap is apparent between the rhetoric of these policymakers and how companies are going about their business in China. In spite of the noise in some quarters, economic ties between the neighbors remain robust — arguably stronger than ever.Trading partnersChina is Japan's biggest trading partner, with the total value of trade having grown by 113 times since 1972 to $371.4 billion last year.The economic interdependence between the two countries showed its resilience during the test posed by COVID-19, with China's share of Japan's overall trade recording all-time highs in both total trade and imports in 2020. It was also in 2020 that China surpassed the US as the No 1 importer of Japanese goods. In the first half of 2022, Japan's imports from China increased by 2.4 percent, marking a record high for a half-year increase.Under the decoupling mindset, the government in Tokyo offered to pay Japanese companies to shift production back home or into Southeast Asia. But a survey conducted by the Japan External Trade Organization last year, covering 679 Japanese firms' Chinese branches and companies, showed that only 3.8 percent of them were planning to shrink their Chinese operations or withdraw from the country in the next one or two years — the lowest figure since 2010.Another survey, conducted by the Sankei Shimbun newspaper in July, found that out of 118 Japanese firms, more than half answered that business with China should remain as it is or continue to develop. In the same survey, not even one company answered that a significant distance between China and Japan is needed."Both Japan and China know well that cooperation benefits both while confrontation serves neither and the development and revitalization of Asia bear closely on the future of China and Japan," said Wang from the CASS. But she also points out that some Japanese lawmakers give priority to politics and ideology. With that approach, it remains to be seen whether the economic aspects of the bilateral relationship can transcend the current political frictions or will be damaged by "shortsighted political agendas".Commenting on Japan's growing tendency to side with the US to contain China, Makiko Tanaka, whose stint as foreign minister came in 2001 and 2002 in Koizumi's government, said: "Japan's alliance with the United States is a linchpin of our diplomacy, but we should not isolate China. We are just banding together and being confrontational toward China."She criticized the visit of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taipei in August as an act that escalated tensions.Yasuo Fukuda, a former Japanese prime minister, said the friction between Japan and China largely stems from the US-China trade disputes, and he takes issue with the suggestion in some quarters that "global trade works better by excluding China".In an opinion article for China Daily, former Japanese prime minister Yukio Hatoyama said that 50 years ago, great politicians of China and Japan understood that the peace between, and the prosperity of, the two countries and East Asia would not be possible unless Japan and China, as nearest neighbors separated by only a narrow strip of water, established a stable relationship."Today, too many people seem to have forgotten the importance of a stable Japan-China relationship," wrote Hatoyama, warning that "the Japanese government should make it clear, both in words and action, that it will adhere to the one-China principle."It should also send a message to the United States and Taiwan, voicing its strongest opposition to the road toward possible war. If the one-China principle becomes hollow, it could accelerate an arms race and trigger a conflict in East Asia. That is what no one wants to see."Five-point suggestionIn a recent speech at a symposium commemorating the 50th anniversary, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi made a five-point suggestion to serve as a guide as the China-Japan relationship embarks on the journey for the next 50 years.The suggestions include honoring commitments and safeguarding political foundation; bearing in mind the overall interests; deepening cooperation, and striving for win-win results; fostering positive and friendly mutual perception and acting in line with the trends of the times, and practicing true multilateralism."In the face of the turbulence and volatility in the world today, China-Japan relations have to press forward, or they will slide backward," Wang Yi said. "The two sides need to renew their original aspiration when establishing the diplomatic relations, take lessons from history, and work to promote sound and steady development of bilateral relations along the right track."They also need to contemplate on ways to build a China-Japan relationship that meets the needs of the new era and adds new substance and impetus to bilateral relations."TOKYO - Wan Gang, representative of the Chinese government and vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the state funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the appreciation ceremony hosted by the Japanese government and Abe's family in Tokyo on Tuesday.Wan told the Japanese side that after the passing away of former Prime Minister Abe, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang sent messages of condolence to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida respectively, and Xi and his wife, Professor Peng Liyuan, sent a message of condolence to Abe's wife Akie Abe.Wan said Abe made contributions to pushing forward improvement and development of China-Japan ties when serving the Japanese prime minister.He said that on behalf of the Chinese government, he was in Tokyo to attend the funeral and extend condolences to the Japanese side.Prime Minister Kishida and Abe's family members talked with Wan, and thanked the Chinese government for sending representatives to attend the funeral.When meeting with Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno on Wednesday, Wan said that leaders of the two countries reached an important consensus last year on building a China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era.He said the two sides should take the consensus as a guidance, and the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of normalization of China-Japan diplomatic ties as an opportunity to promote the sound and steady development of bilateral relations.Matsuno said Japan attaches great importance to developing ties with China, and is willing to work with China to implement the important consensus reached by leaders of the two countries, thus developing constructive and stable bilateral relations.Premier Li Keqiang emphasized on Thursday Beijing's readiness to work with Tokyo to enable the upgrading of bilateral cooperation in all dimensions, wide-ranging areas and multiple levels, calling on the two sides to better tap into the potential for regional economic growth.In a dialogue via video link with business leaders from Japan, Li said that ensuring steady China-Japan relations fits in with the interests of both sides, helps promote the well-being of both peoples and is conducive to regional and global peace, stability and development.The two nations are set to mark the 50th anniversary of the normalization of their bilateral ties later this month.The premier lauded the substantial development made in the overall relationship over the past 50 years, saying that both sides should stay committed to peaceful and friendly coexistence, adhere to the principles of the four bilateral political documents, see each other's development from an objective and rational perspective and work toward steady and sustained progress in bilateral relations.He described their economic and trade ties as the ballast and driver of the bilateral relationship, with their cooperation showing strong resilience and potential.Trade between the two nations reached $371.4 billion in 2021, up by 17.1 percent year-on-year.Li called on the two sides to make full use of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a pact marking the first free trade arrangement between the two nations, adding that Beijing will increase the number of direct flights between them and put sound anti-epidemic measures in place.Li said Beijing will remain committed to a path of peaceful development and that he hopes the two sides will respect each other, treat each other as equals, enhance mutual trust, properly manage differences and jointly safeguard a peaceful and stable neighboring environment to attain the common development of both nations and regional countries.The premier said the Chinese economy, amid shocks that went beyond expectations, has faced mounting downside pressure this year.With a rapid response and timely regulation measures, the economy has now taken on recovery momentum, with major indicators now within an appropriate range, he said.He highlighted the importance of sticking to the facts while making the utmost efforts to attain a better outcome in this year's economic growth.He assured the business leaders that China will remain unwavering in its opening-up policy, saying that the country will be more and more open.In making itself a big market for the world and a top attraction for foreign investment, China will press ahead with reforms to streamline administration and bolster compliance oversight and administrative services to develop a market-oriented, world-class business environment governed by a sound legal framework, Li said.He pledged to formulate regulatory rules that are transparent, stable and predictable, saying that the nation will further widen its market access and put stringent measures in place to protect intellectual property rights.The premier extended a welcoming message to the business leaders in grasping China's development opportunities, actively explore the Chinese market and step up their cooperation with their partners in China.The Japanese business leaders expressed optimism for China's economic prospects, saying that they will continue building up their business in China and help develop a bilateral economic relationship for the new era.State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Tokyo on Monday to honor its commitments to Beijing and abide by the four political documents reached by the two countries to ensure a stable and sound development of China-Japan relations.Wang made the remarks in a video message to a bilateral seminar organized by the Chinese embassy in Japan and the Japan Business Federation, or Keidanren, the country's top business lobby.Wang said there should be no ambiguity or backsliding on major issues concerning the fundamentals of China-Japan relations such as issues relating to history and the Taiwan question, adding that deepening good neighborly relationships and friendships, and revitalizing Asia are the original aspirations, destiny and the responsibilities of both China and Japan.There has been a series of celebratory events held in China and Japan this year as Sept 29 marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries. However, hostile remarks by some Japanese politicians and Japan's meddling in the Taiwan question have cast a shadow on all these celebrations.At the seminar, Chinese Ambassador to Japan Kong Xuanyou said the Taiwan question had been a focus of negotiations when China and Japan normalized relations 50 years ago, and the proper handling of the Taiwan question is the origin of that normalization.One-China principle"The one-China principle concerns the foundation of China-Japan relations and the Japanese government made a serious political commitment to the Chinese side at that time," Kong said.In the China-Japan joint statement, Japan expressed understanding and respect of the stance that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, agreeing to adhere to Article Eight of the Potsdam Proclamation, which built the foundation of bilateral relations, Kong added.Article Eight of the Potsdam Proclamation cited the 1943 Cairo Declaration, which set goals for the postwar order. Together, the two documents stated that Japan should return all stolen Chinese territory, including Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, to China."It is hoped that the Japanese side hold its political commitments faithfully, abide by the one-China principle, be prudent in its words and deeds on the Taiwan question, and refrain from sending wrong signals to the 'Taiwan independence' forces, refrain from participating in any provocative actions so as to avoid further damage to Sino-Japanese relations," Kong said.In his video message to the seminar, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said Japan and China has had a very long history of communication during which they share extensive common interests."Japan is ready to work with China to build a stable and constructive relationship," Hayashi added.As this year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, officials from the two countries share views that the two neighbors need to reaffirm the original aspiration, meet each other halfway to lead the sound, stable and robust bilateral ties into another fifty years.They made the comment at a launching ceremony of a series of interviews commemorating the anniversary. The interviews hear voices of 50 individuals from all walks of life from China and Japan, and elaborate on historical details of exchanges between the two countries, so as to improve people-to-people bonds and consolidate bilateral ties.The stories of the 50 individuals are epitomes of relations between Beijing and Tokyo, and demonstrate their bilateral profound foundation and wishes of the people from the two countries aspiring friendship which spans across generations, said Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Jianghao.Wu called for the two sides to safeguard the political foundation embodied in the four political documents and remove disturbances with wisdom to bring ties back onto the right track. "The two countries should, in a strategic and long-term perspective, stay committed to the important consensus that they are partners and pose no threat to each other."The overall stable growth of bilateral ties has contributed to the prosperity and development of the region and the world at large, Wu said, while underlining the needs to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, bolster people-to-people exchanges and practice multilateralism.According to Wu, trade volume between China and Japan has increased from $1.1 billion in 1972 to $371.4 billion in 2021, and two-way investment volume has reached nearly $130 billion. China and Japan have formed 256 pairs of sister cities and there are more than 1400 direct flights per week, Wu said, adding the number of people-to-people exchanges has exceeded 50 million before the COVID-19.Though significant changes have taken place in international landscapes, the fact that China and Japan are eternal neighbors remains unchanged, said Tarumi Hideo, Japan's ambassador to China. He added that Japan and China have deeply influenced each other in multiple fields including culture and economy.Hideo believed that stories where the two peoples share weal and woe will continue to emerge in the next 50 years and even in the future, saying the two countries need to maintain exchanges and communication and tell the younger generation more touching stories.Wu Hailong, president of the China Public Diplomacy Association, said this year was a milestone and was also a new starting point for Sino-Japan relations as they are faced with more opportunities and challenges.More efforts should be made to step up the public diplomacy to contribute to forging a stronger bond between the two countries' people, he added.Cheng Yonghua, a former Chinese ambassador to Japan and also a representative of the 50 interviewees, said as neighbors who can never move away from each other, China and Japan prove that countries who differ in social systems and ideologies can carry forward friendly cooperation.The two countries have rendered support to each other when confronting with natural disasters and the pandemic, Cheng said, adding that two peoples are also attached to the importance of developing friendly relations.  Beijing vowed to take resolute and strong measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity after a group of Japanese lawmakers led by Keiji Furuya of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party visited the Taiwan region and met with the island's leader Tsai Ing-wen on Tuesday.Furuya's trip interfered in China's internal affairs, violated the one-China principle and the spirit of the four China-Japan political documents and sent a seriously wrong signal to the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday."China strongly condemns such an egregious move," the spokesperson said.The spokesperson said that the Japanese government connived at the political manipulation by individual Japanese politicians for their selfish political gains despite the fact that Japan, which once kept Taiwan under its colonial rule for half a century, is historically responsible for its serious wrongdoing to the Chinese people.However, such behavior of reneging on one's commitment with sinister intentions is doomed to fail and will not stop the historic process of China's complete reunification, the spokesperson said."We urge the Japanese side to stop making provocations or stirring up trouble on the Taiwan question, not to seek selfish gains in the Taiwan Straits and to avoid going further down the wrong path," the spokesperson added.Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, warned Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authorities on Tuesday that their attempt to seek "independence" by colluding with foreign forces is doomed to fail.In a statement issued on Monday, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson criticized the trip of Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb, urging the United States to stop all forms of official interactions with the Taiwan region.The spokesperson stressed that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and the Taiwan question has always been the most important and the most sensitive issue at the heart of China-US relations."The Chinese side firmly opposes official US exchanges with the Taiwan region in any form and under any name. We urge relevant parties in the US to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques," the spokesperson said.Earlier this month, two high-profile visits to the Taiwan region by US lawmakers, including that of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, were strongly opposed by Beijing with a series of countermeasures and days of military drills around the island.Beijing has underscored that the Taiwan question is the key to relations between China and Japan at the latest high-level dialogue of their policymakers, because it is the basis of fundamental trust and credibility in the bilateral relationship.Observers noted that Japan fueled tension in its already frayed ties with China when it joined the recent statement of the G7 denouncing China's military drills following the provocative visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan earlier this month."Taiwan is an inseparable part of China," Yang Jiechi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, told Takeo Akiba, secretary-general of Japan's National Security Secretariat, on Wednesday.The two senior officials were chairing the ninth high-level political dialogue between China and Japan in Tianjin.Tokyo should keep an eye on the fundamental and long-term interests of the two countries and their people, hold a proper perspective of China and follow through on a positive, pragmatic and reasonable China policy, Yang said.The dialogue is a vital mechanism for strengthening high-level strategic communication between the two countries and was initiated in 2015. Nearly 18 months have passed since the eighth dialogue in Tokyo in February last year.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral relations between the two countries.Japan is expected to stay true to the right path of peace and development, staunchly honor the four landmark political documents and political consensus reached by the two countries and work with China to strengthen mutual political trust, Yang said.Tokyo should break away from the zero-sum way of thinking, properly manage divergences and make the bilateral relations more mature, stable, healthy and resilient, he added.According to the Foreign Ministry, the two sides agree that the dialogue was candid, in-depth and constructive, having reached a measure of some consensus and will continue dialogue and communication.The meeting on Wednesday shows Beijing's sincerity in keeping bilateral relations afloat as some hawkish political figures in Japan seek to decouple from China economically and in other areas, the experts said."With the bilateral collaboration developing over the past 50 years, the two countries have formed intertwined bonds of interests. Cooperation is a necessity for both sides, particularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and a complete decoupling does not serve the interests of either side," said Yang Bojiang, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Japanese Studies.Although there are increasing signs of friction or contradictions between the two sides, they should not run into the deadlock of a full confrontation and competition, Yang added.During the Wednesday meeting, Beijing highlighted the need for both sides to insist on their own convictions and "rule out internal and external disturbances". Peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation are the only right choice for bilateral relations."The strengthening of the Japan-US alliance targeting China has constituted a lasting disturbing factor for the China-Japan relationship," said Yang, the CASS scholar.Liu Jiangyong, a professor of Japan studies at Tsinghua University, said: "The rising tension between China and the United States leads to changes of Japan's external climate. The Japanese government has firmly sided with the US and has taken advantage of the China-US feuds, leading to Tokyo's rising hostility against China."Liu said that the structural contradictions between the two countries over historical and territorial issues and the Taiwan question have seriously affected bilateral political relations.The Cabinet of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has embarked on hawkish diplomacy toward China, he noted, saying that Tokyo has publicly accused Beijing of "changing the status quo" by reinforcing patrols around China's Diaoyu Islands.The deterioration of Japanese public opinion and attitudes toward China has prompted more Japanese politicians to take a hard-line approach against China, Liu added.Offerings sent to Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo where war criminals are honoredBeijing denounced Japanese politicians on Monday for distorting and glorifying the country's atrocities in World War II, as Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida failed to mention the nation's aggression and sent ritual offerings to the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors 14 Class-A war criminals.Monday marked the 77th anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender in the war. But instead of fully reflecting on the tragedy, Kishida made no mention of Japanese aggression across Asia in his speech, and tried to depict Japan as a victim rather than an assailant."We should never again repeat the horrors of war," Kishida said, while focusing mainly on the damage and sufferings of Japan.He mentioned the atomic bombings by the United States of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, bloody battles in Okinawa and massive firebombings across Japan, saying the country's peace and prosperity is built on the sacrifice of those who died in the war.Although Kishida avoided a direct visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, the notorious Shinto facility that honors Japan's war dead, including war criminals, he sent ritual offerings there and three of his Cabinet members visited it.In response, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday that it was a grave affront to the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the postwar international order."For quite some time, some Japanese politicians have kept using various means to distort and glorify its history of aggression and openly acted against important legal instruments including the Cairo Declaration of 1943, which clearly stipulates that Taiwan shall be restored to China," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, adding that all peace-loving people in the world will not agree with the moves taken by Japan.The Cairo Declaration is a statement of war aims adopted by the allies on the disposition of territories seized by Japan during the war."The negative move of Japanese political leaders on the issue of the Yasukuni Shrine once again shows the Japanese side's erroneous attitude toward historical issues. China has lodged solemn representations with Japan through diplomatic channels and expressed its righteous position," Wang added.According to Wang, 77 years ago, the people of China, together with the rest of humanity, won a total victory over the Japanese invaders and fascism and it was a great victory over evil, darkness and reaction."Facing history squarely and reflecting deeply are the necessary prerequisites for Japan to restore and develop normal relations with its Asian neighbors after the war," Wang said, adding that "we urge the Japanese side to own up to and deeply reflect on its history of aggression, make a clean break with past militarism, and avoid further breaking its commitment to its Asian neighbors and the international community."Atsushi Koketsu, emeritus professor at Yamaguchi University of Japan, said that only when the Japanese people have a correct understanding of history can Japan avoid launching or participating in wars."Adhering to the Peace Constitution and striving to achieve historical reconciliation with China, South Korea and other Asian neighbors should be a priority, and I think this is the only way for Japan to gain the trust and respect of other countries," Koketsu said.The Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo honors 14 Class-A convicted war criminals among 2.5 million Japanese war dead and is regarded as a symbol of Japan's past atrocities and militarism.The Yushukan, a war museum inside the shrine, espouses Japan's right-wing narrative of the war, which portrays Japan as a victim of the conflict and contends that the country was forced into World War II because of a Western economic blockade.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, an opportunity for the two countries to revisit history and usher in a better future.People on both sides are calling for staying true to and reaffirming the original aspiration of China-Japan ties.In retrospect, the tortuous journey that China and Japan traversed to normalize bilateral ties was, in the first place, a demonstration of the great political courage and sense of historical responsibilities of leaders of the two countries. In the 1970s, against the background of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the normalization of Sino-Japanese ties brought the hostility between the two neighbors to an end and made contributions to preserving peace in Asia. It also paved the way for China to initiate its reform and opening-up policy and to promote its modernization drive in later years.Back then, given the sufferings of the Chinese people in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45), for which Japan owes a debt of blood to China, and the complex global political landscape and Japan's domestic political situation, it undoubtedly required enormous political courage and wisdom to overcome all the obstacles standing in the way of normalizing China-Japan relations, a mission that leaders of the two countries, with their broad and farsighted vision and strong sense of historical responsibility, successfully fulfilled.Compared with the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, or those between the Soviet Union and Japan, the normalization of Sino-Japanese ties was realized in a different manner: It was a two-step process in which the two governments first issued a joint declaration before they signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan, which was approved by their respective legislatures. The special arrangement reflected the complexity of the situation at that time.To follow the general principle of promoting peaceful cooperation and steer the bilateral relations on the right track, China and Japan have signed four political documents over the past half a century: the China-Japan Joint Statement, inked in 1972, which marked the normalization of the bilateral ties; the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan in 1978; the China-Japan Joint Declaration of 1998;and a joint statement, signed in 2008, on advancing strategic and mutually beneficial relations in a comprehensive way.The four political documents constitute the cornerstone of the development of Sino-Japanese ties. China has urged Japan to honor the promises made on issues concerning China's core interests or sensitive areas such as the Taiwan question and historical issues.Over the past half a century, the two-way exchanges between China and Japan have expanded constantly, which has benefited both countries and their peoples. Their economies are complementary in nature, and the two countries have pursued win-win cooperation. Bilateral trade has surged from less than $1 billion in 1971 to $370 billion in 2021, benefiting not only the two countries, but also the development of Asia and the whole world.China and Japan should now seek to consolidate and expand their common ground. They should shelve their differences and properly deal with their contradictions and divergences.China and Japan have different national conditions and social systems, and the development of the bilateral ties is beset by disputes over maritime territories and Japan's historical revisionism, among other issues. After the Cold War, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, China and Japan have had frictions over issues such as Japanese textbooks that whitewash its wartime acts, territorial rights in the East China Sea and Japanese politicians' visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine.These conflicts and disputes will not disappear naturally or diminish over time. Instead, some of them might escalate or worsen in the future. One such flashpoint is Japan's meddling in the Taiwan question. Under such a grim situation, China and Japan should honor their commitments, safeguard the foundation for political mutual trust, and properly manage and control their differences and disputes.Looking back at five decades of the development of Sino-Japanese ties, and against the background of the complex and uncertain international landscape, China and Japan should shoulder their historical responsibilities and stay true to their original aspiration of pursuing peaceful and friendly cooperation. The two sides should draw inspiration from the political wisdom that led to the establishing of diplomatic relations, and carry forward the sense of historical responsibility demonstrated by the older generation of leaders to guide Sino-Japanese relations on the right track.The two sides should safeguard the political foundation of the stable and healthy development of China-Japan ties, adhere to the four political documents, and practice the consensus of being partners, "not posing a threat to the other" and "supporting each other for their peaceful development", so as to ensure long-term peaceful and friendly cooperation.The author is director-general of the Institute of Japanese Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Leading scholars and experts said closer communication and cooperation are crucial to a stable Sino-Japan relationship and the promotion of peace and development in the world during an online forum discussion on Saturday.The forum, held to mark the 50th anniversary of the normalization of relations between the two countries, was jointly hosted by the East Asian Community Institute, the Waseda Institute of Contemporary Chinese Studies and the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies."This forum aims to address current challenges and opportunities presented by the relationship between the two countries and how both nations can act together to build the east Asian community for the next 50 years," said Yukio Hatoyama, former Prime Minister of Japan and president of EACI, in his opening speech.Participating experts agreed that the Sino-Japan relationship has been facing challenges created by issues, including tensions between China and the US, and a slowing global economy, which have been aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Despite these issues, the two countries have managed to stay rational when dealing with one another over the past few years, said experts."In 1972, when the then Japanese prime minister Tanaka Kakuei met with Chinese premier Zhou Enlai to discuss the normalization of relations between the two countries before meeting Chairman Mao Zedong, I, who was then a farmer, saw the prospects of future cooperation between the two countries," said Yang Jiemian, senior fellow and former president at SIIS."If they could then walk the two countries out of the relationship defined by wars, I don't think we should be deterred by the current challenges faced by the two countries. Rather, we should have a long-term vision for the next 50 years. The two countries should enhance exchange and cooperation so as to establish strategic mutual trust to move forward."China's Ministry of National Defense hits back at Japan's misleading white paperThe Ministry of National Defense made stern representations to Japan after the latter released a new defense white paper that made groundless accusations against China."The content related to China in the paper ignored facts and was full of bias," Wu Qian, a spokesman for the ministry, said on Tuesday, criticizing Japan for hyping up the "China threat" theory, and for pointing fingers at China's army development and normal military activities."The Chinese side has expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the paper, which wantonly interferes in China's internal affairs and intensifies regional tensions," he said in a statement.Wu made the remarks after the paper was released on Friday and approved by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's cabinet. It contained abundant content related to Taiwan and accused China of attempting to change the status quo unilaterally in the East and South China seas."The Taiwan question is purely China's internal affair, which tolerates no foreign interference," said Wu, pointing out that compatriots across the Taiwan Straits would never forget that Japan "forcibly seized Taiwan by means of a war of aggression".The spokesman criticized Japan for violating its solemn commitment to China regarding the Taiwan question by releasing the white paper, warning that this "completely wrong and very dangerous" move undermines the political foundation of Sino-Japanese relations.Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said that Japan has hyped up the so-called military threats posed to Taiwan by the mainland in the white paper, completely disregarding the fact that Taiwan is a part of China.Zhu noted that, in the 50 years of its colonial rule over Taiwan, Japan committed heinous crimes and caused misery to Taiwan compatriots.She said Japan ought to reflect on its past misdeeds, abide by the four political documents between China and Japan, and handle the Taiwan question with discretion.Zhong Houtao, a Taiwan affairs researcher for the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the reasons why Japan has highlighted the Taiwan question is based on both history and reality."On one hand, Japan still has a special complex with Taiwan, which was under its colonial rule for a half-century, making Japan still regard the island within its sphere of influence," he said."On the other hand, Japan is attempting to gain more sense of security as a neighboring country of China by increasing its presence in the surrounding regions of China amid the rising China-US tensions," the researcher said."That would make the US put more strategic focus in the Asia Pacific, which would benefit Japan's security in the region."Wu Qian, the spokesman, warned against the Japanese defense policies by making a comparison between China and Japan, noting that China is firmly committed to the path of peaceful development."However, Japan, instead of reflecting on and drawing lessons from history, is blindly making accusations against China, plotting to amend its pacifist constitution and substantially increase defense expenditures," he said, adding that the island country is developing offensive forces and attempting to break through the post-war international order."This has aroused serious concern and high vigilance from the international community, including China," Wu warned, urging the Japanese side to face up to and reflect on its history of aggression and to "stop confusing the world by pretending to be a victim".Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Friday that Japan should "immediately stop the erroneous practice of hyping up security threats in the neighborhood to justify its military buildup".Noting that Japan publicly stated in the paper that it would further increase defense spending to develop its so-called counterstrike capabilities, he said, "It is worrying that Japan is deviating from the path of pacifism and an exclusively defense-oriented policy".A Chinese spokesperson on Tuesday slammed Japan's 2022 defense white paper, stating that it completely disregards facts and is entirely prejudicial.Wu Qian, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense, said that Japan intentionally hyped up the so-called "military threats" posed by China, and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs."China firmly opposes this and urges Japan to immediately rectify its wrongful remarks," he said.BEIJING - Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Saturday sent a message of condolence to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida over the sudden and unfortunate passing away of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.In his message, Li said, "former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made positive contributions to the improvement and development of China-Japan relations. I met with him multiple times and had positive exchanges of views on promoting bilateral ties."Li expressed his willingness to strengthen communication and dialogue with Prime Minister Kishida to boost the sustained, sound and stable development of China-Japan relations.China-Japan relations involve a number of old and new problems, a senior Chinese diplomat said on Tuesday, adding that the difficulties and challenges faced by bilateral ties should not be ignored.Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, made the remark in a phone conversation with Takeo Akiba, secretary-general of Japan's National Security Secretariat.Noting that China-Japan relations have reached an important point in history, with this year marking the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries, Yang said China and Japan must stay on the right track, adhere to win-win cooperation, take a long-term perspective and enhance mutual trust on security.Stable tiesHe called on Tokyo to work with Beijing to ensure stable, healthy and resilient China-Japan relations over the next 50 years and jointly safeguard regional peace and prosperity.According to a statement on the Foreign Ministry's website, Akiba told Wang that Japan stands ready to deepen cooperation with China, and appropriately handle differences and strengthen communications on sensitive bilateral issues and international hot spot issues in order to jointly build a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship.Yang also elaborated on China's principled positions on the Taiwan question and issues related to Hong Kong and the Diaoyu Islands, among others, during the meeting.Experts said that the meeting came at a time when Japan has been closely following the United States' "Indo-Pacific" strategy and is actively engaged in containing China and stirring up confrontation in the Asia-Pacific region.By doing so, Tokyo is also attempting to regain its status in Asia. However, such a practice is not conducive to regional peace, stability and the healthy development of China-Japan relations, and Japan will inevitably have to pay the price for this, they added.Last month, as US President Joe Biden made his first trip to Asia, Tokyo hosted the leaders' meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, an anti-China grouping consisting of the US, Japan, India and Australia. Japan also endorsed the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework launched by Biden in Tokyo.Irresponsible remarksDuring Biden's visit, Japan and the US made irresponsible remarks and groundless accusations on a series of issues related to China's domestic affairs, including on the Taiwan question.Wang Junsheng, a researcher of East Asian studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that Japan is joining with the US to counter China as Tokyo is Washington's close ally, and also because it misjudges China's development."Japan is unwilling to see a rising China because it mistakenly assumes that China's development will harm its own interests," Wang said. "However, the fact is that as close neighbors, both China and Japan will benefit from their good relationship in various areas including trade and the economy, regional cooperation and tackling climate change."Xiang Haoyu, a distinguished research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, said in an article in Global Times that hyping up or creating so-called external threats for specific political purposes will not make Japan great again or bring it absolute security.Instead, it will only get Japan into greater security dilemmas, Xiang said.BEIJING - Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, held a phone conversation on Tuesday with Takeo Akiba, secretary general of Japan's National Security Secretariat.Yang, also director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, said that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan relations, and that bilateral relations have reached a significant historical juncture.In October last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reached an important consensus on the building of a China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era, providing guidance for the development of bilateral relations, Yang said.At present, old and new issues are intertwined in China-Japan relations, and the difficulties and challenges facing bilateral relations cannot be ignored, Yang noted.The two sides should hold on to the right direction, adhere to win-win cooperation, bear in mind the long-term and general situation, enhance mutual security trust, make joint efforts to bring a stable, healthy and strong China-Japan relationship into the next 50 years, and jointly safeguard regional peace and prosperity, he said.For his part, Akiba said the Japanese side is ready to deepen cooperation with China, properly handle differences and strengthen communication on sensitive bilateral issues and international hot issues, so as to jointly build constructive and stable Japan-China relations.Yang clarified China's principled positions on issues involving Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Diaoyu Islands.The two sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues of common concern. Bilateral cooperation between Japan and the United States should not undermine China's sovereignty, security and development interests, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Wednesday.Wang made the remarks during a virtual meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi. These first talks they had since a telephone conversation in November took place days before Japan is to host a summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or the Quad, a group composed of the US, Japan, Australia and India.The Quad summit is also on the agenda of US President Joe Biden's first Asian visit beginning on Friday. The trip will take him to the Republic of Korea and Japan.Wang said that while the US leader has not yet embarked on his journey, the belief that Japan and the US will team up against China has already gone rampant. This is concerning and alarming, he said.Wang said that while Japan and the US are allies, China and Japan have signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Japan-US cooperation should not stir up bloc confrontation, let alone undermine China's sovereignty, security and development interests, he added.China hopes Japan will draw lessons from history with a view to regional peace and stability and act in a prudent way, Wang said, urging Japan not to take a wrong, beggar-thy-neighbor approach.As this year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan relations, Wang called on China and Japan to consolidate the political foundation of bilateral ties and maintain the hard-earned friendship created by the two countries' older generations and the two peoples.One priority is to abide by the principles and spirit of the four China-Japan political documents to keep the bilateral relationship on the right track, Wang said. He also urged the two sides to fully tap the potential for cooperation and strengthen coordination in areas such as the digital economy and climate change governance.The state councilor said that the distracting factors in bilateral ties should be removed in a timely manner, highlighting recent Japanese negative moves on issues concerning China's core interests and major concerns, including the Taiwan question.Some political forces from the Japanese side have made groundless smears and attacks on China, which severely undermined mutual trust and the foundation of bilateral ties, Wang said.He urged Japan to truly honor the commitments it has made and to not let the forces that attempt to destroy China-Japan relations grow stronger.Yoshimasa said Japan and China enjoy broad common interests and huge cooperation potential, and he called on the two countries to be committed to developing a constructive and stable bilateral relationship according to the consensus reached between their leaders.Japan stands ready to work with China to maintain candid communications, reduce misunderstanding and misjudgment, deal appropriately with sensitive issues and promote political mutual trust, he said.Earlier this week, Wang also held a virtual meeting with the ROK's new Foreign Minister Park Jin, saying that it serves the fundamental interests of China and the ROK to guard against the risk of a new Cold War and oppose bloc confrontation.China hopes Japan can partner with China in supporting each other's peaceful development and avoid pitting itself against its neighbors, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday.Speaking at a news conference on the sidelines of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress, Wang said this year marks the 50th anniversary of China normalizing diplomatic relations with Japan, thus it is a key opportunity for both sides to reflect on their history and ties.In the last five decades, China-Japan dialogue and cooperation have expanded, bringing much prosperity to people from both countries, he said. However, there are some people from Japan that don't want China to develop, nor do they wish to see stable China-Japan relations.Therefore, Wang expressed his hopes Japan will keep bilateral relations on the right track."It is important to truly abide by the principles and spirit of the four China-Japan political documents, and implement such important common consensus such as the two countries should 'be partners, not threats', and 'support each other's peaceful development'," Wang said."These are crucial for bilateral ties to develop in the direction of peace and friendship," he added.Wang urged Japan not to go against the trend of the times or take on unnecessary risks based on other parties' desires, and avoid pitting itself against its neighbor.BEIJING -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Tuesday refuted the adoption of China-related resolution by Japan's House of Representatives, stressing that Japan has no authority whatsoever to make wanton remarks about other countries' human rights conditions.Earlier in the day, Japan's House of Representatives adopted a resolution related to China's human rights conditions, which expressed concerns about so-called human rights issues in Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Hong Kong.The so-called resolution about human rights adopted by the Japan's House of Representatives is extremely vile in nature, Zhao said in a statement, noting it disregards facts and truth, maliciously denigrates China's human rights conditions, gravely violates international law and basic norms governing international relations, and grossly interferes in China's internal affairs.The so-called human rights issues claimed by the Japanese side are purely China's internal affairs, bear on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and allow no irresponsible comment by any external forces, he stressed.With a deplorable track record in human rights, Japan has no authority whatsoever to make wanton remarks about other countries' human rights conditions, Zhao said, noting that Japan committed innumerous crimes during the war of aggression it waged in the past.Some Japanese politicians, in utter disregard of overall China-Japan relations and norms of state-to-state interaction, went to great lengths to piece together the so-called resolution, Zhao said, stressing "this is a severe political provocation against the Chinese people."The Chinese government and people are firmly resolved to defend national sovereignty, security and development interests, he stressed, adding that the competent official in China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged solemn representations with the Japanese side."The Chinese side reserves the right to take further measures, " said the spokesperson.Sino-Japanese ties are like "a boat sailing against the current", said a senior Chinese diplomat in Tokyo, adding that "we must forge ahead or it will be driven back".Yang Yu, charge d'affaires of the Chinese embassy in Japan, made the remarks on Thursday during a visit to Soka University, which had played an important role in restoring relations for the two neighbors.The university is located 40 kilometers west of Tokyo.Behind-the-scenes efforts in the late 1960s of Daisaku Ikeda, one of the university's founders, had helped establish the groundwork for a series of political-level exchanges between the two countries, which led to the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1972. To honor that, the campus has two cherry trees that were named after Chinese then-premier Zhou Enlai and his wife Deng Yingchao.Thursday's visit was part of a broader series of events on the schedule this year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan."We are here to jointly review the development history of our ties. We should stay true to our original aspiration when we normalized the relationship and implement consensus reached by our leaders and promote a relationship that meets the requirements of the new era," Yang said.Yoshihisa Baba, president of Soka University, said his university will hold Ikeda's belief to promote friendship between China and Japan."I sincerely wish the Beijing Winter Olympics a great success, and hope that Japan and China will take this opportunity (the 50th anniversary) to carry out various forms of exchanges," he said.China is willing to work with Japan to deepen cooperation on green and low-carbon development and address climate change, senior officials said on Sunday."China and Japan, as friendly neighbors, partners as well as important countries in Asia and the world, share common interests on a wide range of issues and broad cooperation space," said He Lifeng, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic regulator.He noted that the two countries are slated to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relationship next year. "China is willing to work with Japan to achieve economic recovery, promote green development and improve people's lives, led by the carbon peak and neutrality goals."He made the remarks at the 15th China-Japan Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Forum, a pillar in the environmental cooperation efforts between the world's second- and third-largest economies.During the forum, he called for expanding high-level opening-up in the Asia-Pacific region, increasing dialogue and exchanges about policies and deepening cooperation on energy conservation and environmental protection between the two countries."China's energy-saving and decarbonization initiatives will also boost investment and create huge market opportunities as well as room for cooperation," He added. "We welcome the business communities from Japan to actively participate."Looking ahead, He said China will promote the green transformation of energy in an orderly manner, push for upgrades of the industrial structure, accelerate the application and development of green and low-carbon technologies and improve the policy support system in fields such as building an investment and financing system that is compatible with carbon peak and neutrality goals.In response, Hagiuda Koichi, who heads Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, highlighted the importance of cooperation on energy conservation and environmental protection between the two countries, saying it will help promote energy transformation and foster green development.Ren Hongbin, vice-minister of commerce, noted that China and Japan enjoy broad cooperative prospects in green and low-carbon development, and both nations should contribute to their green development and the global economy.Citing China's ambitious goals of peaking carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060, Ren said the two sides should work together to deal with the challenges from climate change, strengthen coordination and exchanges about policies, create a fair business environment and continue to deepen cooperation on energy conservation and environmental protection in third-party markets.According to Ren, the two nations will renew the Sino-Japanese memorandum of understanding on energy conservation and environmental protection technology cooperation under the framework of the Sino-Japanese long-term trade agreement. They are also exploring the negotiation of a memorandum of understanding on strengthening investment cooperation in the field of green development, which will provide new impetus to fostering practical bilateral cooperation.During this year's conference, the two sides signed 11 cooperation agreements. Since 2006, 413 cooperation agreements have been signed at the annual forums.BEIJING - China and Japan have agreed to properly manage maritime contradictions and differences, earnestly safeguard maritime security and stability, and make the East China Sea become a sea of peace, cooperation and friendship.The agreement was reached during the 13th round of high-level consultations on maritime affairs held via video link on Monday.The two sides held a plenary meeting and three working group meetings on maritime defense, maritime law enforcement and security, and the marine economy.Both sides agreed to focus on building China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements for the new era, fully implement the important consensus reached by the two countries' leaders and four-point principled consensus.The two sides reached consensus on conducting cooperation on combating maritime crimes, promoting exchanges between law enforcement officers, and enhancing marine environmental protection.The Chinese side reiterated its solemn position on the Diaoyu Islands and other issues, and urged the Japanese side to earnestly respect China's territorial sovereignty, maritime rights and interests, and stop taking actions that complicate the situation.China also expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's negative actions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, which affected air and maritime security, and made representations on Japan's wrong words and deeds on the Taiwan Strait.The Chinese side stressed firm opposition to external forces' intervention in the Taiwan Strait and urged the Japanese side to be cautious in words and actions to avoid affecting regional peace and stability.The two sides agreed in principle to hold the 14th round of high-level consultations on maritime affairs in the first half of next year.On December 16, 2021, the 38th China-Japan Economic Knowledge Exchange Conference, hosted by the Development Research Center of the State Council, was held in Beijing. Sixty officials and scholars from the Development Research Center of the State Council, the National Development and Reform Commission, China's Ministry of Finance, China's Ministry of Commerce and State-owned enterprises, as well as Japanese institutions, participated in the meeting both online and offline, and discussed economic cooperation.Ma Jiantang, secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the Development Research Center of the State Council, stated in his opening remark that after the outbreak of the COVID-19, China and Japan are both undergoing economic recovery and pursuing sustainable development in the post-pandemic era. China and Japan should step up dialogue, develop China-Japan relations in the new era, jointly safeguard the trade and investment environment, strengthen economic and trade cooperation, achieve complementary advantages and mutual benefit, and make greater contributions to the development of China-Japan relations in the new era.Toshihiko Fukui, president of the Canon Institute for Global Studies and former governor of the Bank of Japan, stressed that Japan and China have a long history of economic and cultural exchanges. The two countries can continue to inherit their historical traditions, carry out in-depth exchanges and cooperation in the fields of carbon neutrality and digital innovation, overcome difficulties together and create a better future.After the opening ceremony, officials and scholars from China and Japan discussed about the world economic situation and bilateral economic situation, economic cooperation, and green economic transformation.Pan Jiang, deputy director of the Department of International Cooperation at the National Development and Reform Commission, said in his keynote speech that in the face of the pandemic, China's economy has recovered steadily, injecting strong impetus into the world economy. It also provides new opportunities for China-Japan economic and trade cooperation. China and Japan should shoulder their responsibilities together, respond to major challenges, uphold multilateralism, and build China-Japan relations in the new era.Yasushi Kinoshita, chairman of the Development Bank of Japan, said that Japan and China should strengthen cooperation and play a leading role in the field of climate change and digital transformation, providing strong support for solving global issues.Luo Xiaomei, deputy head of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Ministry of Commerce, said that the economic and trade cooperation between China and Japan has a long history, and China's further opening-up has injected new momentum into such cooperation. Both China and Japan should strengthen cooperation in various fields and create bilateral economic and trade cooperation in line with the new era.Tetsuya Teshima, executive director of Japan's Mizuho Bank, said that the business environment in Japan and China not only requires enterprises to actively participate in the construction and improvement, but also requires the two countries to strengthen communication and enhance mutual trust.Weng Zuliang, chairman of the China Minmetals Corporation, emphasized that Chinese and Japanese entrepreneurs should join hands in all-round strategic cooperation, fully leverage the scale effect and complementary advantages, jointly achieve high-value results at a relatively low cost, and stimulate new drivers of regional economic development.Gao Shiji, director-general of the Research Institute of Resources and Environment Policies of DRC, stressed that with the philosophy of new development, China is taking actions to achieve its dual carbon goals. It will promote the comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development while pursuing high-quality development.Fu Gangfeng, president of China COSCO Shipping Corporation Limited, said that green development is an important mission for the world shipping industry. China and Japan should jointly promote the green transformation of the shipping industry and green economic development.During the meeting, Chinese and Japanese officials and scholars learned from each other's development and governance experience and reached consensus on cooperation.They agreed that there are broad prospects for economic and trade cooperation between China and Japan. The two countries should comprehensively advance the development of the cooperation mechanism, expand the scope of cooperation, share the vision of cooperation, promote green transformation and make new contributions to global high-quality development.Japan and China are to observe the 50th anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relationship in September 2022.The two countries must sublimate their cooperative relationships to a new dimension beyond the previous phase of focusing on China's reform and opening-up policy.During the past 50 years, China has realized outstanding economic growth and attained a dominant position in the world through its political and economic activities.In December 1979, when then Japanese prime minister Masayoshi Ohira visited China, I had an opportunity to accompany him as his secretary.In his speech delivered in Beijing, Ohira reflected on his thoughts at the time on the negotiation to normalize diplomatic relationships, saying: "Our hearts were full of great anticipation and equally great anxieties. Our anxieties were relieved, however, by the broadmindedness of China's leaders and its people, which was well-expressed by the words of Premier Zhou Enlai on 'seeking big common ground while shelving small differences'. That culminated in the successful conclusion of the great deed to normalize diplomatic relationships between China and Japan." He concluded his speech by stressing that one of the most important factors for international relationships is to maintain the mutual trust between people of the countries beyond the economic interest.China steadily pursued its structural reform, learning from the economic reform experiences of other nations, including Japan. Ohira committed during his official visit to China to offer the so-called yen credit to support the construction of industrial and social infrastructure necessary for economic development. China realized the process of high economic growth since the 1990s and entered the World Trade Organization in 2001. Its economic scale surpassed that of Japan in 2010 to become the world's second-largest economy and grew even further to become about three times as large as Japan's today.During this period of high economic growth, China advanced its economic reform and technological development to become the largest trade partner of Japan, and even attained sufficient capabilities to compete with the United States in advanced technological fields.In July, President Xi Jinping spoke at the informal summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum about the building of "a new and open economic regime of advanced level, by creating a new framework for development".Japan, meanwhile, has overcome the stagnancy of the Heisei Era (1989-2019), and is now pursuing the reform of the Reiwa Era, which began on May 1, 2019.Japan and China need to undertake efforts to achieve "economy of high quality" that pivots around revolutionary information and communication technologies, led by artificial intelligence.While the world economy suffers from the finiteness of resource availability and exacerbation of the global environment, the only path we can choose is to realize, with higher creativity and added value, "economy of high quality," which has less resource dependency and lower burden on the global environment, so that humans can optimize their functions.Japanese industries were proud to be among the world's top-class industrial and technological powers in the 1980s and early 1990s, but its industrial power was flattened to stagnancy by the collapse of economic bubbles. Japan has recently been striving to make a full recovery.China, on the other hand, achieved outstanding success and reached a level high enough to compete with the United States through advancement in industrial technologies.We are now moving to the new stage of economic and social advancement through technological innovation. We have to challenge the following matters.First, we need to deploy innovation vigorously. The 21st century is the age of new development in innovations, with AI and others at the center.I would like to propose a new definition of "innovation", in this age of the latest information technology revolution, as the creation of new intellectual values within the economic sphere through the combination, integration and utilization of information elements collected through revolutionary information technologies.Recently, it was found that the aggregations of intellectual functions in cities have contributed greatly to promoting innovation, such as in the cases of the Silicon Valley in the US, Zhongguancun Science Park in Beijing and the Nanshan district of Shenzhen, Guangdong province. Regional and social cooperation is strongly expected to be encouraged.Second, we have to cooperate for the efficient operation of the global market, which needs to operate freely and rationally under fair and safe rules. Japan and China need to reach agreement for this purpose in cooperation with the US and the European Union, while taking a leading role in restoring the proper functioning of the World Trade Organization.Until then, it is necessary to promote and utilize regional free trade agreements, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and APEC.Japan and China need to have mutual exchanges of their experiences in such rule-making and lead the world to realize "economy of high quality".Third, we need to have mutual cooperation in reforming corporate management methods. The efficiencies of corporate management have been improved significantly through the advancement of information and communication technologies, with work style reform evolving through digital transformation of offices. Corporate value, which may include profit value, customers' value, workers' value and social value, is increasingly expected to grow further through AI and other advanced management tools.Fourth, Japan and China have to expand their mutual cooperation in various fields, including more efficient energy consumption and transfer of pollution prevention technologies. In the future, Japan and China need to deploy wide-ranging collaboration, including in technological development, and, more important, continue working for the deployment and dissemination of their technological achievements to developing countries.Fifth, we have to address demographic changes in society, with fewer children and an aging population. Japan is now facing grave issues arising from its aging society, such as how to secure financial resources to fulfill social security needs in providing health, nursing and medical services to the elderly. Similar issues will likely hit China in the near future. Both countries need to mutually exchange their experiences and cooperate with each other in developing social welfare policies and measures.Finally, Japan and China can strengthen their bonds with the international community through mutual cultural exchanges. It is my belief that if Japan and China can cooperate in integrating industries and cultures, as well as technologies and arts, this will enhance mutual understanding of their cultures by improving the human sense of values, thereby significantly contributing to global stability and the harmonization of human society.Through these mutual exchanges, Japan and China could both provide greater contributions to realizing "economy of high quality" and globalism with mutual trust.The author, a former Japanese vice-minister of international trade and industry, is chancellor of the Incorporated Educational Institution of Toyo University in Tokyo, Japan.BEIJING - China on Wednesday expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recent remarks on Taiwan."Abe, in disregard of the basic norms governing international relations and the principles set out in the four political documents between China and Japan, flagrantly made irresponsible remarks on Taiwan and stirred in China's internal affairs," spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a daily press briefing.China is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposed to this, and has made stern representations through diplomatic channels, he said, adding that Taiwan is part of China's sacred territory and outsiders will never be allowed to get their hands on it.Noting that Japan had colonized Taiwan for half a century and committed countless crimes, Wang said no one should underestimate the resolve, will and ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity."Anyone who dares to take the old path of militarism and challenge the bottom line of the Chinese people will inevitably run into bumps and bruises," he said.BEIJING -- Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Thursday that China and Japan should jointly conform to the major trend of times and hold on to the right direction for bilateral ties to benefit both peoples in a better way, and inject more positive energy into Asia and the world at large.Wang made the remarks in a phone conversation with Japan's new Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, noting that China and Japan are major countries in the region and, respectively, the world's second and third largest economies.Since Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida took office, Chinese and Japanese leaders have conducted positive interactions, Wang said, noting that Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Kishida have reached important consensus that the two countries should build a relationship that meets the requirements of the new era.The two sides, he suggested, should make plans based on the consensus, and take the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan diplomatic ties next year as an opportunity to advance the bilateral relationship along the right track towards long-term stability.Wang said the Communist Party of China (CPC) successfully convened the sixth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee earlier this month, which stressed the CPC has always paid attention to mankind's future and destiny from a global perspective and has always stood on the right side of history and the side of human progress.Wang called upon the Japanese side to observe the principles set out in the four political documents between China and Japan, view China's development objectively and rationally, and put the political consensus that the two countries are cooperative partners and not threats to each other into policies and actions.He also urged efforts to make sure there will be no wavering, backtracking, and line-crossing on major issues concerning history, Taiwan and others, which matter to the political foundation of China-Japan relations and basic trust and faith between the two sides.Wang said the two sides should strive to achieve a higher level of complementary advantages, mutual benefit and win-win results, jointly safeguard the stability of global industrial chains and supply chains as well as a fair and open trade and investment environment, and promote the high-quality development and improvement of the people's well-being in both countries.The two sides should give full play to their unique advantages of geographical proximity and cultural affinity, and take the Beijing Winter Olympic Games and the China-Japan Cultural and Sports Exchange Promotion Year in 2021 and 2022 as an opportunity to create a positive public opinion and social atmosphere, he said.As important countries in the region, China and Japan should be aware of their international responsibilities, jointly practice true multilateralism, and resist any attempt to provoke separation, confrontation or even a new Cold War, Wang said.Wang noted that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will come into effect in January next year, and China and Japan will reach bilateral tariff reduction arrangements for the first time.Both sides should make joint efforts to lead the process of promoting regional cooperation and integration in Asia, he added.Wang pointed out that Japan and the United States are allies, while China and Japan are neighbors that cannot be moved away.Noting that China and the United States are communicating on strategic issues concerning the future of the two countries, Wang said it is hoped that Japan can grasp the general trend, bear in mind the common interests of Japan and the region, and properly handle its relations with China and the United States.For his part, Hayashi said that at present, the international community is in a period of major changes, Asia is becoming increasingly important, and China has been developing rapidly.The international community has paid more attention and expectation to Japan-China relations, he added.Japan is willing to work with China to take the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries next year as an opportunity to strengthen dialogue and exchanges, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, enhance people-to-people exchanges, properly manage differences, shoulder the responsibilities in confronting global challenges, implement the consensuses such as "not threats to each other," and advance the building of stable and constructive Japan-China relations, said Hayashi.Wang expounded China's principles and stance on issues concerning the Diaoyu Islands, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea.The two sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues of common concerns.Officials and scholars from China and Japan have called on the two countries to boost cooperation so as to push bilateral ties to a new level, especially at a time of change posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of unilateralism.As next year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic ties, the two countries should move on in the right direction and advance mutual trust, said Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.There is still huge potential for cooperation between China and Japan as new opportunities have also sprung up, with Wang calling on the two countries to strengthen cooperation in various fields including supply chain, the digital economy and green industry.The senior diplomat made these remarks via video during the opening ceremony of the 17th Beijing-Tokyo Forum on Monday.Good ties between the two nations lie in the close bond of the two peoples, Wang said. China and Japan are neighbors that enjoy similar cultural backgrounds, and the two countries should boost people-to-people exchanges to forge a more profound friendship between the two peoples.Talks between Chinese and Japanese leaders earlier this month mapped out a new path for the development of bilateral ties, said Xu Lin, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee and minister of the State Council Information Office.China and Japan should strengthen dialogue and contact and manage their differences, pushing ties to thrive in the right direction, said Xu, adding that bilateral ties should be viewed in a wider perspective.In a message to the forum, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said that not only high-level exchanges are necessary in developing Japan-China relations but also communication and dialogue between the people of two countries.He expressed the hope that next year's milestone anniversary will be an opportunity to restore people-to-people exchange from the coronavirus.Cao Weizhou, director-general of the China Overseas-Educated Scholars Development Foundation, called for more exchanges between the young people from China and Japan as they are critical in narrowing the gap of the two countries in the future.In facing the uncertainties brought about by the pandemic and challenging Sino-US ties, Yasuo Fukuda, former prime minister of Japan, said "those who advocate Sino-US and Sino-Japanese confrontation are holding a foolish way of thinking"."These people are completely on the opposite side of how to jointly deal with the huge challenges and crises facing mankind and the planet," he said.The two-day forum is being attended by more than 100 officials, business leaders and scholars, discussing Sino-Japanese cooperation in fields including the digital economy, regional security and international collaboration.Public sentiment of Chinese and Japanese people toward Beijing-Tokyo relations remains generally stable compared with last year, with the public seeing bilateral ties as critical to regional peace and development, according to an annual survey released on Wednesday.More than 70 percent of Chinese people regard the relationship as "important or comparatively important" in the 17th China-Japan Public Opinion Poll. Results of the poll were released by China International Publishing Group and Japanese think tank Genron NPO.Similarly, 66.4 percent of Japanese respondents shared the same view as their Chinese counterparts.Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, public perceptions of each side have been stable. More than 60 percent of surveyed Chinese people said their impression of Japan had no obvious change compared with 2020, as more than half of Japanese respondents kept the same views they had last year toward China.According to the poll, the top reasons of surveyed Chinese people who hold a positive view toward Japan are that "Japanese products have good quality" and "Japanese society enjoys a higher level of civilization". Their Japanese counterparts are fond of Chinese history, culture and food, and enjoy a lot of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.Gao Anming, vice-president and editor-in-chief of China International Publishing Group, said cooperation between China and Japan in the past decades has served the interests of the two sides and the two peoples, which is significant for regional and global peace and development.As next year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic ties, talks between the two countries' leaders earlier this month mapped out a new perspective for the development of bilateral ties, Gao said, citing phone calls between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Oct 8.Coordination neededIn the phone conversation with Kishida, Xi called on the two countries to strengthen exchanges in coordination in economic policies, and jointly uphold a trade and investment environment that is open and fair in order to develop higher-quality win-win cooperation by leveraging each other's strengths for mutual benefits.However, history and territorial issues continue to have a lingering negative impact. The poll showed 62.4 percent of Chinese respondents and 56.7 percent of Japanese respondents list territorial disputes as an obstacle in bilateral relations. Uncertainty in China-US ties is also a main force in creating negative feelings between Chinese and Japanese people.Yasushi Kudo, president of Genron NPO, said the pandemic has disrupted face-to-face public-level exchanges of the two countries, though many online events had been held.But he said people from both countries are looking forward to more exchanges and cooperation in future.Gao said opportunities and challenges exist in Sino-Japanese relations amid the instability brought about by the pandemic, and he called for the two governments to promote all-level exchanges and cooperation.In congratulatory message to Kishida, he calls for enhancing cooperationPresident Xi Jinping sent a message to Fumio Kishida on Monday, congratulating him for his success in being elected Japan's 100th prime minister.Xi said that, as China and Japan are close neighbors, advancing their good-neighborly, friendly and cooperative relations serves the crucial interests of the two countries and their peoples and is also conducive to the peace, stability and prosperity of Asia and the world.China and Japan should stay true to the principles set out in the four landmark China-Japan political documents, Xi said.The two countries should strengthen dialogue and communication, enhance mutual trust and cooperation, and strive to build China-Japan ties that meet the needs of the new era, he added.Also on Monday, Premier Li Keqiang sent a message congratulating Kishida on his election victory in parliament.Li said the two sides should champion their political consensus, strengthen exchanges and cooperation, and advance bilateral relations in a healthy and steady manner to stay on the right track.As bilateral diplomatic ties were normalized in 1972, Li added that the two countries should jointly embrace the upcoming 50th anniversary of the normalization of relations.Kishida took office as Japan's 100th prime minister on Monday, replacing all but two of the 20 Cabinet posts under his predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, and eyeing a general election for the country's lower house of parliament on Oct 31.With the Liberal Democratic Party-led ruling coalition holding a majority in both chambers of Japan's parliament, Kishida, who became the LDP's new president last week, won the premiership by a comfortable margin against Yukio Edano, head of the Constitutional Democratic Party, the largest opposition party.The 64-year-old former foreign minister garnered 311 votes in the 465-seat lower chamber, the House of Representatives, and 141 of 241 votes in the upper chamber, the House of Councillors."This is the real starting point. I will go forth with a strong sense of determination, with a strong resolution," Kishida said.Following his appointment, Kishida announced the members of his Cabinet, with 13 of them being posted to ministerial level for the first time.Suga's Cabinet members had resigned en masse earlier on Monday, but they continued to serve as acting ministers until the new Cabinet was appointed.In a move to show the continuity of Japan's diplomacy and security policies, Kishida kept Toshimitsu Motegi as foreign minister and Nobuo Kishi, who is former prime minister Shinzo Abe's younger brother, as defense minister.Former finance minister Taro Aso was replaced by his 68-year-old brother-in-law, Shunichi Suzuki, and 46-year-old Takayuki Kobayashi was introduced to a new Cabinet post in charge of Japan's economic security.Three women－Noriko Horiuchi, Karen Makishima and Seiko Noda－have joined Kishida's Cabinet. Horiuchi will be vaccination minister, replacing Taro Kono, the runner-up in the party's leadership race.Kishida, the first prime minister from the LDP's Kochikai faction in around 30 years, said during a news conference on Monday that he plans to dissolve the lower house on Oct 14 to hold elections on Oct 31. Local media said the move would take advantage of the honeymoon period usually accorded to new governments.Yu Qiang, a researcher of Japan studies at the University of International Relations in Beijing, said: "First, he could use the fresh image of his party and Cabinet to rally support. Second, the current number of coronavirus infections in Japan guarantees him a good atmosphere."Japan has experienced a sharp decline in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, with over 60 percent of the country's population fully vaccinated.On Monday, Tokyo confirmed 87 new cases, marking the first time since November last year that the count has fallen below 100.A poll published on Sunday by Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun found that 64 percent of respondents wanted the LDP to stay in power.Kishida, who served as Japan's foreign minister from 2012 to 2017 under Abe, gained an image during that time as a dovish moderate good at building consensus.In 2016, he helped arrange the visit to Hiroshima by then United States President Barack Obama, the first time a sitting US president had visited the site of the World War II atomic bombing.With the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic and the recovery of the world economy, China-Japan economic and trade cooperation is expected to grow this year, a report said.In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic dealt a heavy blow to Japan's economy and society. Japan's economy shrank in 2020, with real GDP growth of -4.8 percent. Moreover, personal consumption remained weak, enterprise equipment investment shrank substantially, export and import both grew negatively, the unemployment rate rose and workers' incomes declined in the country, the report said.In the near future, there are still uncertainties in Japan's economy, but in one year or two, Japan's economy will gradually recover as the impact of COVID-19 moderates, said Zhang Jifeng, vice-chairman of the National Japanese Economic Association.Moreover, according to the report, Japan's exports deceased by 11.1 percent year-on-year in 2020, while its exports to China increased by 2.7 percent compared with that of the previous year."The growth of China-Japan trade and investment reflects the strong resilience of the bilateral economic ties, and both countries' reliance on each other," Zhang said.He said that uncertainties still exist, as the epidemic is still spreading and unilateralism and trade protectionism are still affecting the world economy, but the prospect of China's economic development is good, which was the only country in the world to achieve positive economic growth in 2020."This year, as the pandemic eases, and both countries' economies recover, bilateral trade and economic cooperation are likely to see growth again," he said.He said China-Japan economic and trade cooperation enjoys a huge potential for development in a wide range of areas, including scientific and technological innovation, energy conservation and environmental protection, healthcare and digital economy.The report was co-released by the National Japanese Economic Association, the Institute of Japanese Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Social Sciences Academic Press (China) in Beijing on Friday.China urged Japan on Monday to face up to and show remorse for its history of aggression, and handle matters such as the "comfort women" issue in an honest and responsible manner.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian made the remarks after Japan's education ministry reportedly approved five publishers' plans to change the term for wartime sex slaves and remove the expression "forced conscription" in reference to those forced to work against their will.Tokyo's approval of the envisioned changes in textbooks came about five months after its Cabinet decided that textbooks could refer to victims of wartime sexual slavery as "comfort women", instead of "military comfort women".The forced recruitment of "comfort women" was a grave crime against humanity committed by Japanese militarism, which is an undeniable historical fact with ironclad evidence, Zhao noted.Again, Japan juggles with words to blur historical facts and downplay its guilt and responsibility as part of efforts to deny and whitewash its history of aggression, he said.This highlights Japan's longstanding dishonest attitude toward its history of aggression, which once again hurts the feelings of the people of the victimized countries, Zhao said.All peace-loving people will never allow such a decision, he said, adding that the international community needs to challenge it."We urge Japan to make a clear break with militarism, and win the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community with concrete actions," he added.Before World War II, an imperial edict imbued young minds with militarism in Japan. Now, the nation's leaders are at it again, only this time the instrument is called a defense white paper targeting children, rather than the Imperial Rescript on Education penned in the Meiji era.In a move reminiscent of prewar Japan, the Japanese government last week released the defense white paper with content tailored for elementary and junior high school students.At first glance, the 30-page report gives an explanation of issues including Japan's national security environment, its relations with nearby countries and new battlefields such as space and cyberspace. But the document hypes up tensions in a way that is likely to create a sense of threat in the minds of the young readers.In one chapter on the security environment affecting Japan, the paper said: "Not only are countries with the greatest military power in the world gathering, but they are also strengthening their military power and activating military activities." It goes on to accuse China of "increasing the amount of money it spends on the military at a fast pace without giving detailed explanations".In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday that China firmly objects to Japan's defense paper aimed at children, and has lodged solemn representations with Japan, urging Tokyo not to mislead the next generation."China has made clear its solemn position on the Defense of Japan 2021 white paper," Zhao said. "I would like to stress once again that China firmly opposes Japan's unreasonable accusations against China's normal defense building, irresponsible remarks on China's legitimate maritime activities and the hypeup of the so-called 'China threat'."Zhao said the document was a means for Tokyo to smear China."It is not constructive at all for Japan to highlight external threats and incite confrontation among minors," he said. "The Japanese side should earnestly face up to and reflect on history, learn lessons from history, and refrain from taking wrong actions to mislead its people, especially the next generation."Sparking strong protestThe document has also sparked a strong protest from the South Korean government, which lodged diplomatic protests with Japan in Seoul and Tokyo. The country urged Japan to "immediately delete the document".Liu Qingbin, a professor at the Institute of Advanced Sciences at Yokohama National University, said the Japanese move is a completely retrogressive approach that the country's neighbors cannot fail to link with Japan's brutal past."Before World War II, the Imperial Rescript on Education brainwashed young people into supporting territorial expansion by convincing them that they were doing it for Asia's own good because it is much easier to rally people like this than rally people around a mission that they believe is about killing or exploiting people," Liu said. "Now they are indoctrinating children again and people start to wonder, what's it for this time?"BEIJING - China firmly opposes Japan unveiling a defense white paper for children, and has lodged solemn representations with Japan, urging Japan not to mislead the next generation, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Friday.Japan's defense ministry on Aug. 16 released a 30-page white paper for elementary and junior high school students on its website, which covers China's military development, the Diaoyu Islands and the South China Sea issues.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a press briefing that China already stated its solemn position on Japan's 2021 defense white paper before, saying China firmly opposes Japan's unreasonable accusations against China's regular national defense construction, irresponsible remarks on China's legitimate maritime activities, and hype about the so-called "China threat.""It is unconstructive for Japan to highlight external threats to minors and incite confrontation," Zhao said.He urged Japan to face up to and reflect on history, learn the lesson from history earnestly, and not mislead its own nationals, especially the next generation.HARBIN - A 17-page copy of the confessions of a commander of the notorious Japanese germ warfare unit to US investigators after World War II has been released in Northeast China's Heilongjiang province on Sunday.Masaji Kitano, the second commander of the Japanese Army Unit 731, wrote the confessions on the human experiments and bacterial warfare conducted by Unit 731 in China to investigators of Fort Detrick of the US Army, after he was extradited to Japan by the United States in 1946, according to Jin Chengmin, curator of the Museum of Evidence of War Crimes by the Japanese Army Unit 731.The United States extradited Kitano from a prison camp in Shanghai to obtain core secrets of Unit 731, Jin noted.Kitano's confessions include five aspects of content, including Unit 731's founder Shiro Ishii, its missions, composition, study and germ warfare weapons. The original copy is now stored in the National Archives of the United States.According to a report by the US investigators, Kitano admitted in the interrogation that Unit 731 conducted human experiments, though in academic papers published during the war, Kitano said monkeys were used in the experiments.After obtaining the material, the US Army accelerated its development of biological weapons in Fort Detrick and pardoned major members of Unit 731, irrespective of their crimes against humanity, said Jin.Kitano served as the second commander of the Japanese Army Unit 731 from Aug. 3, 1942, to March 1, 1945, during which he led the unit's human experiments, conducted large-scale research and development in the field of biological warfare, and sped up the manufacturing of germ weapons.China has expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi's visit on Friday afternoon to the Yasukuni Shrine, a symbol of Japan's past militarism, said Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a spokesman for China's Defense Ministry.Wu said in a statement published Friday night that Kishi's visit has once again showed Japan's wrong attitude toward its shameful history as an invader and its wicked intention of challenging the post-war international order.China has made solemn representations to Japan on the matter, Wu stressed."A nation will have no future if it could not face its history. We demand that Japan must truthfully reflect on its history of aggression, always keep its lessons in mind, take measures to correct its wrongdoings and make actual good deeds to win trust from its Asian neighbors and the international community," said the spokesman.Wu also said that the Japanese defense authorities have recently made a lot of "negative acts" when they dealt with issues related to China. They ganged up with countries outside the region to vilify China's defense policies and military development and to conduct exercises targeting at China. They also meddled in the Taiwan question, which is purely an internal affair of China, and carried out provocative moves in the South China Sea. Those acts have seriously disrupted the China-Japan defense ties."We urge the Japanese side to drop the Cold-War mentality … and work with China, on the basis of mutual respect and noninterference in each other's internal affairs, to advance the defense ties along the right path," said the senior colonel.Two days ahead of the 76th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, Kishi's move marked the first visit by a Japanese defense minister to the notorious shrine since 2016.Beijing has slammed an annual defense policy paper released by Tokyo that for the first time dwells on the need to ensure stability around Taiwan, saying that "China will never allow any country to interfere in the Taiwan question in any form"."Taiwan is part of China's territory, and the Taiwan question is purely China's domestic affair," Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily regular news conference in Beijing on Tuesday.Earlier in the day, Japan's Ministry of Defense issued this year's Defense of Japan, the annual defense policy paper compiled by the ministry to outline Tokyo's views on military security in the region and the world.Zhao said China must be reunified and surely should be reunified, and "the realization of China's ultimate reunification is most conducive to the region's peace and stability".Gross interferenceIn response to Tokyo's recent repeated verbal attacks against China, the spokesman said Japan "grossly interfered in China's internal affairs, unreasonably blamed China's regular national defense buildup and military activities, made irresponsible remarks about China's legitimate maritime activities, and exaggerated the so-called China threat".Zhao added: "This is extremely wrong and irresponsible. The Chinese side is strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it."In response to talk by Washington and Tokyo of an Indo-Pacific Strategy, Zhao said the strategy aims to fuel bloc-based confrontation, create a clique seeking geopolitical contention and revive the Cold War mentality.He also said it amounted to retrogression in history, and should be dumped onto the garbage heap."Can Japan first solve the problem of its attempt to discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean instead of raising its voice on freedom and openness of the Pacific," Zhao said.The spokesman reiterated Beijing's standpoint that Tokyo correct its mindset, show respect for China's sovereignty and display its sincerity in safeguarding regional peace and stability.Debunking allegations made by Japan against China's Coast Guard Law, Zhao said the law is not targeted at specific countries and is fully in line with international law and global practices.Many countries, including Japan, have already formulated and enacted similar laws, and it is time for Japan to stop adopting double standards, Zhao added.BEIJING -- China on Tuesday blasted Japanese deputy prime minister Taro Aso's remarks on defending Taiwan together with the United States if the island is "invaded".Speaking at a regular press briefing, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, "Those remarks are extremely wrong and dangerous, as they severely violate the principles set out in the four political documents between China and Japan, and undermine the political foundation of China-Japan relations. China deplores and rejects this and has lodged solemn representations with Japan.""Japanese militarism once committed innumerous crimes in the aggression against China. However, some politicians are still coveting Taiwan till this day. This fully shows that they haven't learned the lesson from history," the spokesperson said.Zhao said that China will never allow anyone to meddle in the Taiwan question in any way, stressing that no one should underestimate the resolve, the will, and the ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity.A Chinese envoy on Friday urged Japan to reverse its decision to dump contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear accident into the sea.Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, exercised China's right to reply to the Japanese representative at 31st Meeting of States Parties to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea."Just now the Japanese representative made erroneous remarks on the issue of the nuclear-contaminated water from Fukushima nuclear power plant, attempting to emphasize that the treated water will be harmless, and that they have been open and transparent, and the plan has been approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency. These are intentionally misleading for they are not in line with the facts," said Geng.He said China wishes to underline the following points:First, Geng said, the Fukushima nuclear accident is one of the most serious in world history. The contaminated water is composed of cooling water injected into the melted reactor core, as well as groundwater and rainwater.It consists of large amounts of radioactive isotopes which are created in the fission process and are non-existent in nature. There is no precedent to refer to and the impact on marine environment, food security and public health cannot be neglected, he said."If the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water will be harmless as Japan has claimed, why would they not keep it for domestic use? Why does it insist on dumping it into the sea?" the envoy asked.Second, Geng said, the Japanese side has not been transparent and open as it has claimed.He said that before the announcement of its decision to release nuclear-contaminated water into the sea, Japan did not fully consult with neighboring countries and other stakeholders. After the announcement, many Pacific Rim countries including China, as well as organizations such as the Pacific Islands Forum, all expressed concerns on Japan's release decision."But so far, Japan has not responded earnestly to and has not addressed such concerns," said Geng.Third, Geng said, the IAEA has never endorsed or approved Japan's decision to release nuclear-contaminated water into the sea. At present, the IAEA is establishing a technical working group and has confirmed that specialists from China and Republic of Korea will be invited to join the group."China will offer full support to this work, urging Japan to respond to the concerns of the stakeholders and the international community. Japan should act in good faith, with a highly responsible attitude toward international public interests, and in an open, transparent and scientific manner, prudently address relevant issues," he said.Four, Geng said, the disposal of the nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear accident is not merely a domestic issue for Japan. The planned actions will severely harm international public health, safety and the immediate interests of neighboring countries and their people."We once again urge Japan to revoke its wrong decision. It must not wantonly start the ocean discharge before consulting and reaching consensus with all stakeholders including neighboring countries and relevant international institutions," he said.In exercising his country's right to reply, Jongin Bae, deputy permanent representative of the Republic of Korea, said the disposal of contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant is "an extraordinary and unprecedented challenge".In dealing with such "grave concern", coordinated efforts and measures must be carefully undertaken in cooperation with the international community, he added."We expect the Japanese government to reflect whether it has fulfilled all its obligations under international laws," the diplomat said. TOKYO－A panda at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo gave birth to twins on Wednesday, weeks after news of Shin Shin's pregnancy sent stocks in nearby restaurants soaring.The Tokyo zoo's website listed the two newborn pandas as being born an hour and a half apart at 1:03 am and 2:32 am on Wednesday. Their gender has not been determined, and they have not yet been named."Officials are currently doing their best to protect and observe the mother and babies," the statement added.Zoo director Yutaka Fukuda said the twin birth was a first for the Ueno facility."When I heard the news that the second baby was born, I couldn't help but whoop," he told reporters.One of the babies, weighing in at 124 grams, was placed in an incubator, spokesman Naoya Ohashi said in a news conference. The other's weight is unknown.The mother panda "is in good health, and carefully looking after" the other baby, he added.When pandas have twins, they usually only raise one, "so we will be making sure the mother panda will breast feed one while we keep the other in the incubator," Ohashi said.Zookeepers will be swapping the babies so that both cubs experience natural feeding, he added.Mother Shin Shin sparked a rally in stocks of eateries near the zoo earlier this month when her suspected pregnancy was announced, with investors anticipating a visitor boom to the area after the delivery.Extended stayShin Shin was born on July 3, 2005, at the Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, China, and arrived at Ueno Zoo a decade ago, along with her male partner Ri Ri.Zookeepers had been on alert for a possible pregnancy after Shin Shin and Ri Ri mated in early March. The pair are also parents of a female panda, Xiang Xiang, who was born in June 2017 and became a massive draw for the zoo.She was scheduled to be repatriated to China two years after her birth, but Japanese officials negotiated to extend her stay until the end of the year.Japanese media have been offering regular updates on the Ueno pandas, which in non-pandemic times draw huge crowds of domestic and foreign tourists.There are an estimated 1,800 giant pandas left in the wild, mainly in bamboo forests in the mountains of China, said environmental group WWF.Around 600 more live in zoos and breeding centers around the world.The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies giant pandas as "vulnerable".The bears are notoriously bad at reproducing, but in early June, a panda in Malaysia gave birth to its third cub during its stay there.A newborn in Washington DC has enthralled people since its birth in August 2020, with over a million people tuning in within just months to watch Xiao Qi Ji－Little Miracle－on a "Panda Cam".Agencies Via XinhuaJapan's relations with Taiwan are nongovernmental and practical and are based on Tokyo's recognition of the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government, a top Japanese official said on Friday, following Beijing's protest over a recent reference to the island as "a country".Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a regular news conference on Friday that "Japan's position is to maintain working relations with Taiwan at the nongovernment level", in line with the 1972 Japan-China Communique."That's our basic policy and there is no change to that," he said.Kato's remarks came a day after Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga made the reference to Taiwan during a parliamentary debate. Suga, while answering a question about pandemic, made a passing reference to Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia as "three countries".China on Thursday expressed strong dissatisfaction with remarks by Suga and has lodged solemn representations with Japan, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin.Wang said the Japanese leader has openly referred to Taiwan as "a country", which seriously violated the principles of the four political documents including the China-Japan Joint Declaration, and breached the solemn promise of "not regarding Taiwan as a country" made by the Japanese side many times so far.China wants Japan to immediately issue clarifications to eliminate the damage and to ensure that such a thing will not occur again, he said.There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory, said Wang, adding the Taiwan question concerns the political foundation of China-Japan ties, the basic credibility between the two countries, and the international rule of law and justice.Xinhua and agencies contributed to this story.Mikiko Matsuyama, a Japanese ballet dancer and co-founder of Japan's Matsuyama Ballet troupe, died aged 98 on Saturday.According to Matsuyama Ballet, the artistic director of the troupe died of acute heart failure in Tokyo about 3:40 am.Born in Kagoshima prefecture in 1923, Matsuyama had devoted her life to ballet and made a great contribution in introducing Chinese culture to Japan.In 1948 Matsuyama and her husband, Masao Shimizu, founded Matsuyama Ballet, which went on to become a leading ballet troupe in Japan and gain a worldwide reputation. The troupe built up a following in the United States, Europe and China.The troupe has an extensive repertoire that runs the gamut from Western standards such as Swan Lake, Raymonda and Coppelia to Balanchine staples Serenade and Allegro Brillante and Japanese and Chinese material in the form of The Japanese Drum, Five Girls of Okinawa and The White-Haired Girl.In 1955 the latter work was adapted from a Chinese folk story centered on the tragic life of a rural Chinese girl named Xi'er during the 1940s. The White-Haired Girl was warmly received by Japanese when it was staged in Tokyo.In 1958, before China and Japan normalized their diplomatic relationship, the dance performance made its Beijing debut, and Matsuyama and Shimizu met Chinese leaders including Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.With Matsuyama Ballet having become the first foreign troupe to adapt a story from Chinese folklore into a ballet, the Tokyo-based troupe has been regarded as an outstanding participant in Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges and a witness and promoter of the Sino-Japanese friendship.Last year, the Matsuyama Ballet released a video featuring the Chinese national anthem in which the troupe showed support for China amid the COVID-19 outbreak. It had more than 200 million views online and attracted 10,000 posts on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo.Chinese Ambassador to Japan Kong Xuanyou urged Tokyo to handle its relationship with China and the United States in a balanced manner, and should not spark regional rivalries or become entangled in confrontations between major powers.The remarks were made by Kong in a wide-ranging interview with Japan's Kyodo News on Tuesday, during which he touched on a variety of issues such as the US-Japan alliance, China's Taiwan question, issues related to the Diaoyu Islands, and Japan's handling of contaminated water from Fukushima.The Chinese embassy in Japan published the transcript on its official website on Wednesday."It is in Japan's long-term interest to properly handle Sino-Japanese relations and Japan-US relations,"Kong said, adding Japan should have the political wisdom to handle its relations with major powers in a balanced manner."It would be extremely unwise (for Japan) to be involved in a conflict between major powers, or to regard China, its largest cooperative partner, as an opponent or even a threat. It will inevitably hurt Japan's own interests," Kong added.The interview came amid Japan's rising criticism of China on matters ranging from the South China Sea and China's domestic issues, with the latest one mentioning Taiwan in a leader's summit statement for the first time in more than five decades with the US."Japan's words and deeds on issues involving China's internal affairs and core interests have made us feel puzzled and dissatisfied," Kong said,"The Taiwan question is a major one related to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and China's core interests, which China will never allow external interference."Kong said Japan's behavior had clearly violated the principles set out in the four political documents between China and Japan, which the two countries agreed. "They are mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence."On the issue of the Diaoyu Islands, Kong said China had never admitted the islands are "under de facto Japanese control". The two sides should face up to the reality of their different positions and handle the issue properly from a long-term perspective, instead of inciting public opinion and confrontation.The envoy reiterated that China had stated its stance and concerns many times on the Japanese government's decision to discharge contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea."As a neighboring country, Japan only unilaterally informed China and other countries of its contaminated water discharge decision, but did not conduct necessary consultation and communication with China and other neighboring countries in advance," he said.Kong said it is common sense that China expressed its strong concern and dissatisfaction with Japan's actions and urged Tokyo to face up to its responsibility, fulfill its international obligations, and respond to the serious concerns of the international community and neighboring countries.Beijing said on Friday that it has expressed grave concerns to Washington and Tokyo over their negative moves of colluding against China.The remarks came just before Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is due to hold a face-to-face meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House.Media reports said China will be in focus at the meeting with the two sides expected to agree on a joint statement on Taiwan and discuss issues related to Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region."Japan and the US should take China's concerns and requests seriously and refrain from words and deeds that interfere in China's domestic affairs and undermine China's interests," Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular news briefing in Beijing.The spokesman noted that as China-US and China-Japan relations are both at a critical juncture, the international community is watching closely as to what message will be released during Suga's US visit.According to Zhao, the Chinese side has no objection to the development of normal bilateral relations between Japan and the US."But such relations should help enhance mutual understanding and trust among countries in the region, contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and must not target or damage the interests of any third party," he said.Zhao said that China's position on issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, the South China Sea and the Diaoyu Islands, is consistent and clear, and urged Japan and the US not to form cliques against China."Otherwise, China will make necessary actions in response," he added.At the news briefing, Zhao also urged Japan to abide by the spirit of the four-point consensus of principles between China and Japan, further regulate its fishing activities and prevent the situation from deteriorating."Recently, the Japanese side has been allowing unidentified fishing boats to make trouble in the waters of the Diaoyu Islands and this is the fundamental reason why the current situation in the Diaoyu Islands is becoming more complicated," Zhao said.Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Jianghao summoned Japanese Ambassador to China Hideo Tarumi on Thursday in Beijing, protesting Tokyo's decision to discharge radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which China urged Japan to retract.Wu asked that an international joint technical working group that includes China be established to monitor and oversee the wastewater's disposal. He said the discharge should not be initiated without the agreement of stakeholders and international organizations.China will work with the international community to monitor the situation's development and reserve its right to make further responses, he added.Pacific Island nations have joined the call for Japan to rethink its decision on releasing more than 1 million metric tons of radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.Meg Taylor, secretary-general of the Pacific Islands Forum, said Japan has not taken the necessary steps to "fully address the potential harm to the Pacific".Founded in 1971, the Pacific Islands Forum is an intergovernmental organization that aims to enhance cooperation between countries and territories of the Pacific Ocean, including formation of a trade bloc and regional peacekeeping operations.On Wednesday, the forum urged Japan to rethink the decision, since fisheries and ocean resources are crucial to "our Pacific livelihoods and must be protected".As required under international law and highlighted by a meeting in December of the States Parties to the Treaty of Rarotonga, also known as the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, Japan should take all appropriate measures within its territory, jurisdiction or control to prevent significant transboundary harm to the territories of the Pacific, including the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone, Taylor said.The Pacific Islands Forum urgently called on the Japanese government to hold off any discharges of the treated wastewater until further consultations are undertaken with forum members and an independent expert review is undertaken to the satisfaction of all forum members.Japan plans to release the wastewater over about 30 years, beginning in two years.The Treaty of Rarotonga, which was signed by Pacific Islands Forum members in 1985, bans the dumping of radioactive waste into sea.Beijing and Seoul again voiced their shared objection to Tokyo's decision at the first meeting of the China-Republic of Korea dialogue and cooperation mechanism for maritime affairs, which was held on Wednesday via video link.The two sides expressed strong dissatisfaction with Japan's unilateral decision to discharge the nuclear wastewater from the tsunami-crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant, disregarding the opposition of the international community.China and the ROK will continue to maintain close communication and coordination in this regard, and they "are willing to work with the international community and regional countries to take necessary measures and actions to jointly address this international challenge", according to China's Foreign Ministry.The two sides urged Japan to prudently deal with the wastewater issue based on fully consulting with international institutions and neighboring countries and ensuring "substantive participation of relevant countries and international institutions", the ministry said.Moreover, the ROK is considering referring Japan's decision to an international tribunal, the presidential Blue House said on Wednesday.President Moon Jae-in instructed secretaries during an internal meeting to review taking the decision to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, based in Hamburg, Germany.Russia expressed its serious concern on Tuesday and said it expected Japan to demonstrate transparency, informing the states concerned about actions that might pose a radiation threat.Mascot scrappedThe public backlash against Japan's plans to release contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant continued to ferment at home on Thursday, resulting in the Japanese government scrapping an animated mascot intended to sweeten its decision for the public.As part of promotional materials released after Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's announcement on Tuesday, Japan's Reconstruction Agency released a video on its website featuring the radioactive substance tritium as a "cute character" to dispel concerns about the government's decision.Within a day, the tadpolelike character was scrapped and an apology issued after a wave of criticism on social media as well as in Japan's parliament.Tokyo is struggling to convince the public not just at home but also abroad that it can safely release the tritium-tainted water into the Pacific Ocean.A poll in February by Asahi Shimbun found that around 57 percent of Fukushima prefecture residents opposed the release, while a survey conducted by Xinhua News Agency found that over 78 percent of global netizens are against Japan's decision."It seems the government's desire to release the water into the sea takes priority over everything. We fishermen can't understand it," said Katsuo Watanabe, an 82-year-old fisherman in Fukushima.Tokyo Electric Power, the nuclear plant's owner, also has faced a loss of trust."From my perspective, Japan is now in a battle to win trust, whether of the trustworthiness of its government or of the risk posed by the contaminated water," said Hirotake Ran, a professor of East Asian studies at Musashino University in Tokyo.Beijing has delivered a sharpened warning to Tokyo, saying that respecting China's internal affairs is a "minimum requirement" for Japan as a close neighbor, and Japan "should not stretch its long arm too far".The warning－following a series of Beijing's criticisms of Tokyo's joining Washington in lashing out on topics such as Hong Kong and Xinjiang－was issued by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday in a phone conversation with Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.Experts said Japan should engage in damage control to keep its relations with China from being hijacked by the need to bolster the United States-Japan alliance. They also said a further deterioration of China-Japan ties may also affect economic cooperation between the two neighbors.During their conversation, Wang said China and Japan should work to keep their ties from unnecessary twists, turns, standoffs and involvement in major-country confrontations.Japan is expected to "become more positive when viewing China", act as an independent, self-reliant country, and not be exploited by countries with prejudices against China, he said.A superpower's will does not represent the international community, and countries following this superpower are not entitled to monopolize multilateral rules, either, he added.While Tokyo and Washington share an alliance, Tokyo is obligated to honor the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Wang said as he urged advancing the two-way pragmatic cooperation and improving the goodwill between the two Asian nations.Motegi said Japan is willing to properly manage and control differences. He said there is no change in its plan to harness stable growth of its ties with China, and the Japan-US alliance does not target any third party.Last month, representatives of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese embassy in Japan made several sharp rebuttals of Tokyo's attacks on Hong Kong's electoral system reform as well as the US-Japan 2+2 ministerial talks' joint statement attacking Beijing on topics such as the Diaoyu Islands, Taiwan, the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and the South China Sea.In high-profile comments, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told Japan's Fuji TV on Sunday that it is important to create circumstances in which the Taiwan question can be resolved peacefully against the backdrop of countries such as the US and Japan "joining hands in maintaining their deterrence".Yang Bojiang, director-general of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Japanese Studies, said Tokyo's recent attacks on China are accompanied by its growing sense of urgency as it worries that the lingering pandemic will further diminish its comparative advantage in international competition."Japan is eager to increase intimidation aimed at China over the Diaoyu Islands issue by relying more on its alliance with the US, which is adding risks of escalation of maritime tension and strains in political ties," Yang said, adding that further deterioration of its China ties may affect collaboration in economic and technological sectors.Still, Yang stressed the need to foster bilateral strategic mutual trust. There is a great deal of room in regional issues for cooperation and communication by China and Japan, such as the China-Japan-Republic of Korea free trade agreement talks and Korean Peninsula denuclearization, and there are remarkable prospects for both nations in economic and social sectors, he said.This month, Suga will travel to Washington to meet US President Joe Biden. Japan's Kyodo news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying that the talks will involve the situation in Taiwan, and the two sides will discuss whether to include it in the leaders' joint statement.Gao Lan, a professor of Japan studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said that "the US is an inevitable factor in the trajectory of China-Japan ties" given the US-Japan alliance, and the China-Japan relationship has its vulnerable side and often faces twists and turns.Beijing and Tokyo should work together to avoid falling into the trap of bilateral conflict, maintain the steady growth of their ties and shape the trilateral interactions of the US, Japan and China, Gao said at a seminar last month.BEIJING - Japan should view China's development with a more positive mentality, said Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday in a phone conversation with Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.Wang said that China's development has not only enabled the Chinese people to live a better life, but also made positive contribution to promoting regional stability and prosperity.Practice has proved that China's development is a growing force for world peace, a favorable factor for promoting international cooperation and an important opportunity for Japan's long-term economic development, Wang said.China is always aware of its international obligations, Wang said, and firmly supports the international system with the United Nations at its core, firmly supports international rules based on international law, firmly supports true multilateralism and firmly safeguard international fairness and justice.China does not interfere in other countries' internal affairs, nor does it allow other countries to interfere in China's internal affairs, Wang noted, adding that what China upholds is not only its own sovereign rights, but also the basic norms of international relations.The will of some superpower does not represent that of the international community, and a few countries following this superpower have no right to monopolize multilateral rules, said Wang.The law of the jungle will prevail in the world where one cannot distinguish right from wrong doing if some countries, under the guise of multilateralism, are wild about bloc politics or major-country confrontation, or even arbitrarily impose unilateral illegal sanctions on others based on false information, he said, adding that that situation will be a disaster for the vast number of small and medium-sized countries, and the majority members of the international community will not allow that to happen.Wang said that only the Chinese people are entitled to decide what China should do, and that cannot be decided according to the preferences of some foreign countries.He also said that all countries, which all have the right to choose a development path suited to their own national conditions, ought to manage their own domestic affairs first, and work together to meet the common global challenges at the same time.Beijing on Thursday urged Japan to stop sowing discord among nations and refrain from slandering and smearing China.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying expressed grave concern over a series of Japanese negative moves related to China at a daily briefing in response to groundless reports from Japanese media.According to reports, Japan and Indonesia expressed strong opposition to any move by the Chinese side that could potentially escalate tensions in the South China Sea and the East China Sea and concerns over China's Coast Guard Law, during 2-plus-2 security talks held by the two sides in Tokyo.Hua debunked the disinformation categorically, saying "In fact, the Indonesian side communicated and made clarifications with China immediately when Japan released relevant news, and the press briefing of Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi to the media via video link did not have anything targeting China."For any countries to grow relations, it should not only serve bilateral interests, but also play a constructive role in upholding peace and development of the region and beyond, rather than targeting the third party," she added.Hua said the Japanese side should faithfully abide by basic norms governing international relations and take concrete action to preserve the overall situation of China-Japan relations.She also called for Japanese media to shoulder social responsibilities and observe professional ethics, stopping fabricating disinformation, instigating confrontation and stirring up a tense atmosphere among regional countries. China's coast guard law is only routine national legislation that does not target any certain country and the law is fully in accordance with international law and practice, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.For the China-Japan relationship to be more mature and stable, China and Japan need to stay focused without being distracted by any single event, he said.China hopes Japanese society will embrace a more objective and rational perception of China to solidify public support for long-term steady progress in China-Japan relations, Wang said.Brighter December, with boost from neighbor, offers hope for trade pickupSoaring demand from China lifted Japan's exports to their first monthly increase in more than two years in December, government data showed, offering a glimmer of hope for Japan's export-led recovery despite a resurgence of the coronavirus in the country.The value of overseas shipments rose 2 percent in December from a year earlier to 6.71 trillion yen ($64.8 billion), Japan's Ministry of Finance reported on Thursday, slightly below a 2.4 percent increase expected by economists but up from a 4.2 percent decline in the previous month.The increase marked the first monthly increase in Japan's exports since November 2018, or in 25 months. Shipments to China-Japan's largest trading partner-grew 10.2 percent in December from the year-earlier month."The first export pickup in a while (in December) provides some relief but we're far from being in a position to be optimistic about the outlook," said economist Takeshi Minami at the Norinchukin Research Institute.A report by Bloomberg emphasized the point: "China, which has managed to contain the virus and last quarter roared back to pre-pandemic growth rates, has given key support to global trade and to Japan's export-reliant economy."Minami said: "It's hard to imagine that China alone can accelerate growth in Japan's exports."The increase in December does not tell the whole story of Japan's trade performance in 2020.Overseas demand for Japanese goods was dampened throughout the year by the spread of COVID-19.Total exports in 2020 plunged 11.1 percent from the previous year to 68.41 trillion yen, marking the largest fall in 11 years.The annual drop was the sharpest since a 33.1 percent dive in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2009.Exports by Japan in 2020 reached their lowest level in absolute value since 63.75 trillion yen was booked in 2012.For imports, Japan saw its steepest decrease in four years as they sank 13.8 percent to 67.73 trillion yen.Altogether, Japan's exports and imports were down for the second consecutive year in 2020, leaving the country with a goods trade surplus of around 675 billion yen, the first black ink in three years.Positive sign"Improved exports in December is a positive sign for Japan's economy but the imports pointed to ongoing weakness in domestic demand," said Erbiao Dai, vice-president of Asian Growth Research Institute in Fukuoka."The damage to Japan's service sector puts added pressure on exports to lift the economy out of its slump but beyond China, key overseas markets are still struggling which means their demand is also likely to weaken further."The biggest drop was logged by the country's car exports, which plummeted 20 percent from 2019 while exports of auto parts declined 19.1 percent.By country and region, Japan's shipments to the United States-a key market for Japanese goods such as cars and electronics-dropped 17.3 percent in 2020, dragged down by airplanes and chipmaking equipment, while imports were down by 14 percent.Exports to China rose 2.7 percent after a plunge at the beginning of this year and were mainly boosted by plastic, nonferrous metals and equipment for making semiconductors.Japan's imports from China fell 5.3 percent to 17.48 trillion yen.With the European Union, Japan saw a trade deficit shrink 1.5 percent to 1.33 trillion yen, as exports fell 14.6 percent and imports dropped 12.6 percent.Meanwhile, the number of foreign visitors to Japan plunged 87 percent in 2020 to a 22-year low as the country mostly closed its borders in response to COVID-19, Japan National Tourism Organization data showed on Wednesday.Agencies contributed to this story.In increasingly uncertain times and with pressure for countries to choose sides, everyone should work to implement a new international order based on international coordination and existing rules, experts say, referring in particular to relationships between China and Japan and between China and the United States.This is all the more important considering the economic and social disruption that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, said Cheng Yonghua, a former Chinese ambassador to Japan from 2010 to 2019.Relations between China and Japan also need to keep pace with the times and develop in a new way, Cheng said."Although they have gone through hard times, Sino-Japanese relations have overcome difficulties and been back on track with the strategic guidance of the leaders of both countries," Cheng said. "Now the two sides are moving in the right direction to promote the construction of the friendship that meets the requirements of the new era."Policies of the incoming US administration of President-elect Joe Biden and his team are among the most important factors that will affect Sino-Japanese relations, Cheng said.Yoriko Kawaguchi, a fellow at the Musashino Institute for Global Affairs, agreed and said the existing international order faces huge challenges that require people to work out how that order develops."Looking at things realistically, it is hard to say that the tension between China and the US will not continue to expand and become an obstacle that hinders our pursuit of peace."So as China and the US look to resolve their differences, Japan could act as a mediator, said Kawaguchi, who also served as minister for foreign affairs from 2002 to 2004."There is a security treaty between Japan and the US. And China is Japan's important neighbor, having had diplomatic relations with Japan since the second century," she said."If the US-China relationship doesn't develop smoothly it will definitely have an impact on Japan-China relations. In this sense, we also look forward to improved US-China relations because it will also affect the international order."However, Kawaguchi said Japan and China also have their differences."Why is there a gap? The difference among our values is one of the reasons. But, on the other hand, we can't say that there's no room to cooperate with such differences."Rules need to be formulated that both parties, or all countries, can agree with, Kawaguchi said."We must then follow the rules to find a new international order. It requires many countries, including China, Japan and the US, to work together to create a new order for the future, and maintain this order."Yasuo Fukuda, head of the Cultural Exchange Institution for an Asian Community and a former Japanese prime minister, suggested more dialogue to reduce distrust."Only by calmly talking with each other can we reduce the sense of distrust. We should listen to other opinions, reflect more on ourselves and have self-control," Fukuda said.Yao Yunzhu, a retired major general of the People's Liberation Army, said changes in China-Japan and China-US relations should have their own "independent internal connections", and the internal logic depends on "our own judgment of long-term interests". More to be done in teaming with other nations against COVID-19, say expertsAdopting methods most appropriate to their particular needs, China and Japan have made remarkable progress in curbing the spread of the coronavirus at home. However, as the pandemic continues to hold great sway over much of the world, the two continue to work together to fight the disease.Now, as more vaccines show positive results and some countries begin vaccination, experts from China and Japan are calling for the two countries to work even more closely together.Early on, and in a short time, China determined the virus sequence as well as its pathogen, transmission route and incubation period, and shared the information with the world, allowing vaccine research to start quickly, said Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.The center has been working with Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases, and Gao said the two centers could continue to work together on data sharing and technical exchanges, so as to contribute to the global prevention and control of any possible outbreak. "The coronavirus seems to be very adapted to humans, and it's possible for us to have the next pandemic or something else in the future."Kayo Takuma, professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University, suggested that Japan and China can help with the fair distribution of any COVID-19 vaccine in order to better curb or coexist with infectious diseases."It won't work if only some developed countries with purchasing power have access to resources, especially when vaccine stocks are limited," she said. "The vaccine should be provided to people all over the world in a fair way."A report by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in September said it had been shown that a rush among wealthy countries to lay claim to billions of doses of prospective COVID-19 vaccines could lead to hundreds of thousands of more deaths than if the vaccines were distributed equitably.Citing two scenarios from Northeastern University's Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, the report said 61 percent of COVID-19 deaths worldwide that would occur without a vaccine could be prevented by distributing a vaccine among countries proportional to their populations.By contrast, allocating the first two billion doses of vaccine to the highest bidders would prevent just 33 percent of deaths."Only when the pandemic is controlled globally can one's own country benefit from it," Takuma said. "I hope that Japan and China will take the lead in making the vaccine sharing mechanism work as soon as possible."Global initiativeChina and Japan are among 170 countries and economies engaging in COVAX, a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine makers to provide countries worldwide equitable access to safe and effective vaccines once they are licensed and approved.This has also shown the importance of international collaboration, and China and Japan should do their best to support multilateralism, said Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun, former director-general of the World Health Organization.As head of the WHO, Chan put great emphasis on global collaboration, saying that such joint work through the platform of the United Nations is one of the most effective ways of solving global problems.Chan said she hoped by starting with small-scale regional collaboration China and Japan could help expand it to a multilateral effort jointly tackling international issues.Zheng Zhijie, professor at the School of Public Health at Peking University, said China and Japan should play an important role in the future economic integration of the East Asia region, especially in public health. The two should also consider how to strengthen collaboration in preventing outbreaks, recurrences and emerging infectious diseases, he said.With a similar cultural background and coming from the same part of the world, Chinese and Japanese can benefit from efforts to deepen mutual understanding via cultural exchanges in various forms, a forum has heard.The cultural closeness between China and Japan is the foundation of dialogue and mutual trust, said Liu Yandong, director of the International Confucian Association, an academic and cultural association focused on Confucianism.She said the neighbors should use their respective advantages to build a platform for communications and cooperation among professionals in various fields, such as the arts, the protection of cultural relics, environmental protection, scientific research and archaeology.Yasuo Fukuda, head of the Cultural Exchange Institution for an Asian Community and a former Japanese prime minister, said culture is the most effective tool to help Japanese and Chinese understand each other.Although there are differences between the cultures, Fukuda said people will find ways to seek common ground and be able to share each country's culture, as cultural exchange is an important tool to build a community with a shared future."Culture is life itself, and has been playing a very important role since ancient times," he said. "Moreover, cultures should have no national boundaries, so I sincerely believe that culture can serve as a bridge between countries."Communication plazaThe webinar, held simultaneously in Beijing and Tokyo on Friday, focused on providing Eastern wisdom for the international community and deepening mutual understanding by cultural exchanges.Kazuo Ogura, an adviser to the Japan International Exchange Foundation and a veteran Japanese diplomat, suggested a "communication plaza", where everyone can gather and talk to one another."Now that the technology is so advanced and the application of social networks is very common, we can also extend the dimension of communication to the internet," he said."For example, we can invite Japanese and Chinese professors to give us lectures through the internet."Hao Ping, president of Peking University, focused on academic communications among young people, saying universities should strengthen educational cooperation through more channels.Yuji Miyamoto, a former Japanese ambassador to China, echoed Hao's view and said the exchanges between the young people of the two countries have already created a solid foundation."In East Asia, we share similar affections for anime, pop culture, science fiction, food, and even the fashion trends," he said.Neighbors should actively work to upgrade economic ties, forum hearsOfficials and experts from China and Japan have reached agreements that the two countries should strengthen cooperation more than ever, especially in the post-pandemic era.China and Japan share broad common interests, despite some contradictions and differences which do exist, said State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi."For the common parts, we must continue to expand and make them a solid bond that connects the two sides. Regarding the differences and sensitive issues, we should put them in an appropriate position with constructive management and control," he said.The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that all mankind lives in a community with a shared future, and it has once again demonstrated the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, Wang added.The senior diplomat made the remarks by video during the opening ceremony of the 16th Beijing-Tokyo Forum on Monday.This year, the event focused on the international order in the post-pandemic era, discussing how to build Sino-Japanese relations that meet the requirements of the times and to strengthen mutual trust and cooperation. It was held simultaneously in Beijing and Tokyo.As the second-and third-largest economies in the world, China and Japan should focus on future cooperation in various aspects, said Xu Lin, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee and minister of the State Council Information Office."China and Japan should continue to work together to fight the pandemic, exchange information in a timely manner, carry out cooperation in medical drugs, and safeguard the health of the people of the two countries," he said.Xu also said both should take the opportunity of jointly responding to the pandemic as a chance to actively promote the upgrading of economic cooperation between China and Japan. "We should seize the opportunity to promote the development in a wide range of fields such as digital economy, e-commerce, smart cities, energy conservation and environmental protection, medical and healthcare."Firm beliefYasuo Fukuda, a former Japanese prime minister, said in his speech that political leaders, especially those of major countries, must have a firm belief in maintaining peace.On improving Sino-Japanese relations, Fukuda said the foundation lies in the relationship between the peoples of the two countries, making mutual trust more important."We need to carry out more cultural exchanges on a larger scale, as people need to have more direct experience and firsthand information of each other's country to generate mutual understanding," he said.Toshihiro Nikai, secretary-general of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said Japan and China need to continue to promote dialogues and exchanges no matter the situation.He said he hoped the nongovernmental exchanges between the two sides could be further promoted by the upcoming Tokyo Summer Olympic Games, the Beijing 2022 Winter Games, and other events.Katsutoshi Kawano, a Japanese admiral who served as the head of Japan's Self-Defense Forces from 2014-19, said peaceful coexistence should be the mainstream view among major countries, and that more cooperation and exchanges on national defense are needed between Japan and China."I think Japan-China relations have now returned to a normal track, but not in terms of national defense exchanges," he said, while calling for more cooperation mechanisms like the maritime and air liaison mechanism that was set up in 2018.Yao Jingyuan, a research fellow at the Counselors' Office of the State Council, said the economic and trade relations between China and Japan could be "promising" in the future, as China is a market with comparative advantages and strong demand potential.The expanding Chinese market is a major development opportunity, especially for Japanese enterprises, as the economies of the two countries are highly complementary and the industrial chain and supply chain are also highly integrated, Yao said.China and Japan should establish "genuine mutual trust", properly tackle sensitive issues and advance their cooperation, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Wednesday.Wang made the remarks while expressing China's hopes for Japan to further build their ties into those that meet the requirements of the new era, in a meeting with Suga in Tokyo.Such goals are expected to bear fruit at an early date, benefit the two peoples and lay a solid foundation for the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral diplomatic relations, which falls in 2022, Wang added.In addition to building trust, the two countries should promote regional cooperation, speed up the construction of free trade zones and jointly create a promising future for Asia, Wang said.Both sides should be dedicated to the reform of the global governance system, make globalization more open, inclusive and win-win, and shoulder the due international duties of the two countries, Wang added.Wang was on the second day of his official visit to Japan when meeting with the new Japanese leader who assumed office in September.Suga said the new Japanese Cabinet attaches great importance to Japan-China relations and is willing to enhance mutual trust with China and jointly promote the stable development of bilateral relations.Japan expects to strengthen cooperation with China, ensure the success of the Tokyo Olympic Games next year and the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in 2022, and jointly celebrate the 50th anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relations, Suga said.At the start of their meeting, Wang relayed President Xi Jinping's message to Suga.Wang noted that after the new Japanese Cabinet took shape, Xi and Suga had a phone conversation and reached consensus on progressively improving and developing China-Japan relations, they achieved a smooth transition of bilateral ties and made clear the direction of the relations' growth in the next stage.Suga expressed his appreciation for Xi's important message and said developing stable Japan-China relations is very important not only to Japan and China, but also to the region and to the international community, and this is the common responsibility of the two countries.Wang told Suga that with years of effort, the relations have eventually returned to the right track, and both sides should cherish this hard-won situation.When speaking to reporters, Wang responded to a question about the Diaoyu Islands issue by saying that China is highly concerned about the islands' latest situation.He said the Chinese side had no choice but to respond to the recent frequent intrusions by unidentified Japanese fishing boats into the islands' waters.China's position on this issue is clear, Wang said, and the country will continue to firmly safeguard its sovereignty.Wang said the two sides should seriously honor the four-point principled consensus they reached in 2014 and avoid moves that may complicate the situation in sensitive waters. They should communicate in a timely manner in the event of such a problem and handle it properly.China and Japan should make joint efforts to truly build the East China Sea into a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation, which is in line with the fundamental and long-term interests of the Chinese and Japanese peoples, Wang said.Also on Wednesday, Wang met with Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato as well as friendly figures including former Japanese prime minister Yasuo Fukuda.TOKYO - Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi pledged on Tuesday that the two countries will support each other in hosting successful Olympic Games.Wang said China actively supports Japan's hosting of the Tokyo Olympic Games and appreciates Japan's support for the Beijing Winter Olympics. The preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics are progressing smoothly and are fully recognized by the International Olympic Committee, he said.It is hoped that through the Olympic cooperation, China and Japan will promote the friendship between the two peoples and enhance Asia's contributions to the international Olympic cause, he added.For his part, Motegi said Japan supports China in hosting successful Winter Olympics, hoping to strengthen bilateral cooperation and pass the Olympic baton from Tokyo to Beijing so as to make both Olympic Games a complete success.More comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan is expected to strength their mutual understanding in a shifting global situation despite their differences, a newly released report said.The public opinion survey on Sino-Japanese relations found that 75.2 percent of Chinese respondents believe the two countries should build a new cooperative relationship in the future to realize the stable development of the world economy and safeguard peace in East Asia.The figure among Japanese who feel that way is 44.6 percent.The annual survey was jointly conducted by the China International Publishing Group and Japan's Genron NPO from September to October. The results of the survey were released in Beijing and Tokyo on Tuesday.It showed a majority of respondents from both nations valued Sino-Japanese relations a lot, with 74.7 percent of Chinese and 64.2 percent of Japanese in agreement with that sentiment.Respondents from the two countries attach great importance to the relationship and have high expectations on jointly responding to global issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, promoting economic and trade cooperation, and encouraging cultural exchanges.'Cautiously optimistic'People from both sides are "cautiously optimistic about the future development" of relations between China and Japan.The percentage of Japanese respondents holding a "very good (or relatively good)" impression of China stands at 10 percent, having declined from 15 percent in 2019, ending the growth in trend that had been sustained for the past five years.At the same time, 52.9 percent of Chinese respondents said they held a negative impression of Japan, an increase from 52.7 percent in 2019.Both Chinese and Japanese respondents are concerned about the current relationship between the two countries.Given the ongoing tension between China and the United States, the negative impact has become increasingly prominent in Sino-Japanese relations, the survey said, with 52.1 percent of Chinese and 44.4 percent of Japanese respondents agreeing with that assessment.A large portion of the public from both countries, 70.6 percent in China and 47.4 percent in Japan, hope to "control or ignore" the influence of Sino-US tensions and focus on developing Sino-Japanese relations by promoting bilateral cooperation.Sensitive issues such as territorial disputes and historical issues are still seen as the main obstacles to relations, the survey said.Gao Anming, deputy director of the publishing group, said cooperation should be the main aim between China and Japan. There is great potential for cooperation especially after they signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade agreement.Yasushi Kudo, a representative of Genron NPO, said there are great expectations for Sino-Japanese relations."We hope everyone can work together," he said. "No one wants to see a split world."Envoy conveys Beijing's commitment, but calls lack of mutual trust a weak pointChina is ready to work with Japan to tackle difficulties and promote the continuous improvement and development of bilateral relations, Kong Xuanyou, the Chinese ambassador to Japan, said in an interview with a Japanese newspaper.Sino-Japanese relations have maintained a momentum of improvement and development on the whole but still face many issues," Kong told the Asahi Shimbun on Friday."As the international situation has undergone complicated changes in recent years, how to continue the positive momentum of bilateral relations under such circumstances requires joint efforts from both sides."He said that the lack of mutual trust is a weak point in the current relations, while that in the security sector is particularly prominent. Building a constructive Sino-Japanese security relationship is indispensable to the improvement and development of bilateral ties, and both countries should think about how to break through the bottlenecks hampering the development of bilateral relations."The current Sino-Japanese relations have gone beyond the bilateral scope and are exerting an increasingly important influence on the region as well as on the world," said Kong, adding that both sides should constantly explore new ways to add value to their strategic ties.Through his contacts with the Japanese government and society, Kong said he could sense Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's willingness to continue a positive policy toward China and stable relations with China, which are in line with China's goals, he told the newspaper.He added that since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic and personnel exchanges between the countries have been greatly affected, but the current difficulties are only temporary."Our economies are still highly complementary to each other and there is still much room for the growth of people-to-people exchanges," he said. "As different countries have different national conditions, the coronavirus situations and containment measures, how to integrate our different policies will be the focus of our work in the next stage."On China's disputes with the United States, Kong said that there is no doubt that both the China-US relationship and the regional situation have become more complicated.It's important to note that whatever difficulties and challenges China faces, it will firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests. China is firmly opposed to the "new Cold War" mentality held by some US politicians to contain China's development, he said.He added that China's policies and stance toward the US will be consistent no matter who becomes the next US president. That is, China is committed to developing China-US relations featuring nonconflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect, and cooperation.When asked about the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, the Chinese diplomat said that some media have put out a lot of reports that either contradict the facts or are smearing regarding the vocational education and training centers that Xinjiang has set up in line with the law in some places.He said more than 1,000 diplomats, officials, journalists and religious figures have visited Xinjiang."Their consensus is that Xinjiang has made important contributions to the international fight against terrorism and deradicalization and has accumulated valuable such experience for the world," he said, adding that China welcomes all foreigners holding an objective and fair position to visit Xinjiang and learn about its real situation.Shanghai has increased its promotion of innovation and cooperation between domestic and Japanese enterprises."Japan is an important economic and trade partner of Shanghai. The two sides have established a solid foundation for cooperation in long-term economic and trade exchanges," said Zhang Guohua, deputy director of Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce, at the Shanghai Dialogue for China-Japan Innovative Businesses on Sept 25.The event was held by the Shanghai Foreign Investment Development Board, also known as Invest Shanghai, and the Japan-China Economic Association.It is part of the city's efforts to further promote and strengthen economic and trade exchanges between Shanghai and Japanese innovative businesses, bolster enterprise cooperation and facilitate investment.Japan has the largest cumulative amount of actual investment in Shanghai and is among the countries with the most projects in Shanghai, Zhang said.According to figures from Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce, among the regional headquarters and R&D centers of multinational companies based in Shanghai, Japanese companies account for about 12 percent. Shanghai's exports to Japan account for about 10 percent of the city's total exports, while for imports, this figure is about 12 percent.The event focused on software, new energy vehicles and the biomedicine industry, all of which have great potential for cooperation between China and Japan, the event organizer said.At the event, an official with Invest Shanghai gave an introduction about the city's investment environment and promotion policies. Industry experts and think tanks from Shanghai Software Industry Association, Shanghai International Automobile City, Nomura Research Institute Shanghai Limited (NRI Shanghai) were also invited to introduce related industry information.In addition, companies from China and Japan have also shared their development achievements and experiences."I hope this event can serve as a platform and bridge to support the development of more Chinese and Japanese enterprises," Zhang said.In recent years, the city has constantly improved its services for major foreign-invested projects and has established a one-stop green channel for foreign-funded enterprises. To help enterprises solve problems more effectively, it also carried out a series of activities, such as paying on-site visits and organizing round-table meetings between government officials and enterprises.Conversation first with Yoshihide Suga since new PM took office this monthChina would like to make joint efforts with Japan's new government to properly handle major sensitive issues including historical issues and promote mutual political trust, President Xi Jinping said on Friday.Xi made the remarks in a phone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, the first between the two leaders since Suga took office earlier this month.China and Japan, as important neighbors and cooperation partners for each other, have wide common interests and broad space for cooperation, Xi said. With joint efforts, Sino-Japanese relations have returned to a normal track and kept good momentum in recent years, he added.China stands ready to uphold the principles and spirit of the four political documents between the two countries to handle sensitive issues properly, enhance mutual political trust, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, enhance people-to-people exchanges and build bilateral relations that meet the requirements of the new era, Xi said.Noting that COVID-19 is still rampant around the world, Xi said that China and Japan can support each other to achieve win-win results. The two countries should maintain stable and smooth industrial and supply chains, promote the building of fair and open trade and investment environments and improve the quality of cooperation, Xi said. He added that China supports Japan in hosting a successful Olympic Games next year.Xi called on the two nations to jointly uphold multilateralism and firmly safeguard the international order and system with the United Nations at the core.They should strengthen communication, coordination and cooperation among multilateral institutions and regional cooperation mechanisms, work together to deal with global challenges and make positive contributions to prosperity and development in Asia, he said.Suga said Japan considers relations with China as one of its most important bilateral ties. A stable Japan-China relationship not only conforms to the interests of the two peoples but contributes to world peace and prosperity, he said.Suga expressed hope of maintaining close communications with Xi with a view to promoting bilateral cooperation and taking the countries' ties to a new stage. Japan wants to communicate with China to ensure the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will be signed this year, step up negotiations on the China-Japan-Republic of Korea free trade zone and jointly uphold the stability of industrial and supply chains in the region, Suga said.Also on Friday night, Xi held a phone conversation with Angolan President Joao Lourenco. They exchanged views on bilateral ties and the fight against the pandemic and expressed joint commitment to upholding multilateralism.BEIJING - Japan has clearly told China its prime minister will not speak with Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen over the phone as media reported, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Saturday.According to media reports, during a meeting with Tsai on Friday in Taiwan, former Japanese PM Yoshiro Mori expressed the willingness of the Japanese leader to speak with Tsai over the phone if there was an opportunity."We have noted the relevant reports, and has asked Japan to clarify," Wang said in response to a media query. "The Japanese side made it clear the PM will not speak with Tsai over the phone as reported. What the media said will never happen."Message urges relationship that benefits two peoples, is consistent with new eraPresident Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Yoshihide Suga on his election as prime minister of Japan on Wednesday, saying the two countries should forge a bilateral relationship that is consistent with the needs of the new era and benefits the two nations and peoples.In the message, Xi said a long-term, stable, friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Japan, as friendly neighbors and important countries in Asia and the world, fits with the fundamental interests of the two peoples.A healthy bilateral relationship also helps with the peace, stability and prosperity of both Asia and the world, he said.The two sides should abide by principles set by the four political documents and the four-point principled agreement between the two nations and make positive contributions to global peace and common development, he said.Premier Li Keqiang also sent a congratulatory message to Suga on Wednesday.China stands ready to work with Japan to step up friendly exchanges and pragmatic cooperation in various areas and work toward greater progress in bilateral relations, he said.Suga was named Japan's new prime minister following a vote in the country's parliament on Wednesday, succeeding Shinzo Abe as the leader of the world's third-largest economy.Relations between Beijing and Tokyo have been on stable footing in recent years. Li paid an official visit to Japan in May 2018, the first by a Chinese premier in eight years, and Abe visited China in October of that year.While attending the G20 Summit in Osaka in June 2019, Xi accepted in principle an invitation from Abe to make a state visit to Japan in the spring. The visit has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.During a news briefing on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said that Beijing approves of recent statements made by Suga to establish stable diplomatic relations with neighboring countries including China.Da Zhigang, a researcher on Japanese studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in a signed article online that stability may remain a policy priority for Suga in his diplomatic policies with China."Suga's basic consideration in relations with China may be amplifying the positive legacy left behind by Abe in Japan-China relations," he said.He said that Suga may follow Abe's two-sided policy of standing his ground with Beijing in areas such as diplomacy while continuing an emphasis on improving bilateral relations on a flexible basis.With COVID-19 raging worldwide and multilateralism being tested, it is an important time for China and Japan to bolster anti-epidemic cooperation and consolidate their trade and economic cooperation, Da said.Suga was picked as leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Monday with about 70 percent of the votes.After becoming Japan's first new leader in almost eight years, the 71-year-old son of a strawberry farmer pledged to do his utmost to contain the pandemic and deal with its economic fallout, which led to the country's worst contraction in modern times.In a sign that Suga will put a high priority on political stability and continuity, he chose half of the new Cabinet from carry-overs from Abe's administration, with several major posts remaining unchanged."The new Cabinet showed Suga's solicitude for his allies," said Yuzo Tanaka, a professor of economics at Ryukoku University in Kyoto. "The point is whether they can face up to a plethora of challenges including tackling COVID-19 while reviving a battered economy and dealing with a rapidly aging and declining population."There is only a short window for Suga to offer results and it will decide whether he will be a long-term leader or just an interim one," Tanaka added. The front-runner to become Japan's next prime minister has emphasized the importance of the country's relationship with China and vowed to improve it as Tokyo named a new ambassador to Beijing."Getting along well with China, South Korea and other Asian countries is vital to Japan's development," said Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, widely seen as the top contender to succeed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who last month announced his intention to step down as prime minister due to health problems.Suga made the remark during a debate on Saturday with his two rivals for the leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the former LDP Secretary-General Shigeru Ishiba, and the LDP Policy Chief Fumio Kishida.Suga said he would patiently work to improve ties with China while keeping the Japan-US alliance "a basis of relations with Asian countries".The debate on Saturday came ahead of an election on Monday to decide the next president of the LDP. Since the LDP-led coalition controls both houses of parliament, the Diet, the next leader of the party will succeed Abe and is set to be chosen as prime minister in an extraordinary Diet session on Wednesday.Keeping dialogue openKishida and Ishiba also gave their own takes on relations with China."We must never let channels for dialogue close," Kishida said, adding that Japan must be smart in controlling the dialogue.Ishiba, also a former defense minister, said Japan's role should be one of helping realize a world in which the US and China can work together.Suga said he lacks the kind of diplomatic skills that the outgoing prime minister has and said he would need Abe's help if he assumed the top job."Prime Minister Abe's leadership diplomacy was truly amazing. I don't think I can match that. I think there is a diplomatic stance that would fit me, and I will stick to my own style, while also seeking assistance from the Foreign Ministry. And of course I will consult (Abe)."On Friday the government named Hideo Tarumi, an expert on China in the foreign ministry, as new ambassador to China.Tarumi, 59, will replace Yutaka Yokoi, who has been in the post since May 2016. They both belong to the ministry's group of diplomats who underwent Chinese-language training with a focus on advancing relations with the emerging power. The appointment is effective from Wednesday.Tarumi, a graduate of Kyoto University, joined the ministry in 1985 and once led its China and Mongolia division. He has served as a minister at the Japanese embassy in Beijing and was head of the foreign minister's secretariat for a year until July.Agencies contributed to this story.History of pain and oppression drawn on as lesson for peace, progress, experts sayA speech last week by China's President Xi Jinping on resisting Japanese aggression was not only about the Chinese will to carry on the spirit of resisting aggression and following a unique path to prosperity, but also about unity in the face of disruptions to global peace, analysts say.In the speech, at a symposium in Beijing on Thursday commemorating the 75th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, Xi stressed carrying forward in the new era the great spirit of resisting aggression and striving to achieve national rejuvenation.Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said Xi's speech was about "avoiding the recurrence of a war just like what happened in World War II".This can be done by "strengthening people-to-people bonds across the national border, which is one of the main themes of the Belt and Road Initiative".Commenting on Xi's speech, Emeritus Professor Colin Mackerras of Griffith University, one of Australia's leading Sinologists, said China had modernized more than any other country over the past 75 years since 1945, when it achieved victory over Japanese aggression.Xi said the war was the Chinese people's longest and largest fight against foreign aggression in modern times and came with the greatest sacrifice but led to the Chinese people's first complete victory in national liberation.The great victory was a historic turning point in which the Chinese nation rose from severe crisis in modern times and embarked on a journey toward great rejuvenation, Xi said.Mackerras said China has gone "from a poor, oppressed country, destroyed by war and destitution to an economic and strategic powerhouse, with confident and prosperous people proud of their country and its achievements"."China is unique in history for its speed of economic modernization and its rise. In my opinion, the ones who deserve credit for China's rise are the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. We know that the Chinese people are a hardworking people with great confidence and stamina."However, they definitely need leadership, he said."We can see many periods in the past when they have been bowed down, impoverished and humiliated. What separates all but four of the years since 1945 has been the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. So I think it is reasonable to give credit to the Chinese people under the good and effective leadership of the Chinese Communist Party."Mustafa Izzuddin, senior international affairs analyst at the political consultancy firm Solaris Strategies Singapore, said Xi's speech is also a reminder that China is united, stable and is an important player in international affairs.The speech is in line with what Xi has been saying, "which is to look at the events of the past to remind Chinese citizens that it's important to have a strong domestic core", Izzuddin said."Xi is using the lessons of history to ensure that the painful event won't be repeated."Xi's speech is a rallying call to Chinese people to remember what happened in the past and how they can overcome difficulties, Izzuddin said. They need to be strong within to be able to keep China safe and secure, in the face of many challenges.Aaron Jed Rabena, a research fellow at the Asia-Pacific Pathways to Progress, a foreign policy think tank in Manila, echoed that idea, saying he thinks "President Xi is trying to draw an analogy" from the past.Christopher Bovis, a professor at the University of Hull in England, said China's celebrations symbolize remembrance, appreciation and commemoration of national pride and resilience against oppression and aggression.National rejuvenationPresident Xi has praised the patriotism, character and spirit of Chinese people and heralded their victory as a point of national rejuvenation."In the current challenging and difficult times, when the pandemic has severely affected the world, and China is constantly subjected to trade wars, the celebrations against the aggression of foreign forces represent a signal of motivation of the Chinese people to overcome difficulties and achieve national unity."In a heartfelt message the China's leader has successfully touched the people of his country and reached with sincere appreciation to foreign governments for their support in the victory against fascism and totalitarianism, Bovis said."The celebrations reflect a turning point in the nation's pride for national liberation and its rise from severe crisis to a leading global economic power."Rana Mitter, professor of the History and Politics of Modern China, University of Oxford, said the War of Resistance showed that China was able to bring its people together to fight back against an invasion that threatened its sovereignty and integrity."China made a major contribution to the Allied victory, and the resistance and sacrifice of its people was crucial. Today one of the most important legacies of that war is the United Nations; it is essential that all the former wartime Allied powers do their best to preserve and cherish this crucial postwar institution."Wang Mingjie and Bo Leung in London, Chen Yingqun in Beijing and Xinhua contributed to this story.Against the backdrop of stagnation in the World Trade Organization, friction between China and the United States, and growing anti-globalization, momentum has shifted toward regional and bilateral free trade agreements. A free trade bloc of developed economies, led by the US, is gradually being forged.The US and Japan reached a trade agreement on tariff concessions in October last year. Some of the members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, have expressed interest in joining the pact, raising the prospect of a giant transpacific and transatlantic FTA involving more than 40 countries in Asia, Europe and North America.To avoid being isolated by the US in international trade, China must promote trade liberalization and globalization, integrate more deeply into international markets, and forge closer economic ties with more countries.In the context of warming ties between China and Japan, the two countries should launch negotiations on an upgraded bilateral investment agreement as soon as possible, as well as start negotiations for a China-Japan free trade agreement.This would not only help promote China-Japan economic relations, but also boost progress toward a China-Japan-Korea trilateral FTA, accelerate regional economic development, and open doors to China possibly joining the CPTPP.In 2007, China, Japan and South Korea initiated negotiations on a trilateral investment agreement, which was signed in May 2012. Also in 2012, the three countries launched negotiations on a China-Japan-South Korea FTA.Currently, China is the largest trading partner of Japan and South Korea, and Japan and South Korea are China's second-and third-largest trading partners, respectively.At the eighth annual meeting of leaders of China, Japan and South Korea held last year, the leaders said they would work hard to achieve a free, fair, nondiscriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment and keep markets open.If China, Japan and South Korea reach an FTA, it would become the world's third-largest free trade area after the US-Mexico-Canada bloc and the European Union.The current bilateral investment agreement between China and Japan went into effect in 1989.Although China and Japan have signed FTAs with many countries, due to external factors, including the rigidity of the US-Japan alliance, strategic suspicions of the US and volatile relations between South Korea and Japan, China and Japan have not established a free trade mechanism.China and South Korea have already forged an FTA and will start the second phase of negotiations to establish a new mechanism for China-South Korea economic cooperation.South Korea and Japan have held similar negotiations since the end of 2004, but the talks stalled because Japan was unwilling to reduce tariffs on agricultural products.The economic relationship between Japan and South Korea is relatively competitive, and the two countries have often been at odds due to historical issues. Their bilateral relationship has been icy for more than a year, which is an obstacle to the advancement of a China-Japan-South Korea trilateral FTA.As countries separated by only a strip of water, China and Japan have close economic ties. Japan is China's third-largest source of foreign investment, and China is Japan's second-largest destination for foreign investment.Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade between China and Japan in the first half of 2020 was close to $150 billion. Japan's investment in China was about $2 billion, basically reaching the level of the same period last year.At present, the stability and improvement of China-Japan relations have also created the right conditions for the upgrading of economic ties on both sides.During the fight against COVID-19, China and Japan have supported each other.Despite some claims that Japanese companies will withdraw from China, according to Japan's annual survey on Japanese investment in Asia (including the Chinese mainland) and joint ventures in April 2020, about 90 percent of Japanese companies in China said they have no plans to change their supply chains or would only make adjustments inside China if any changes were made.Although President Xi Jinping's visit to Japan was postponed due to the pandemic, warming relations between China and Japan have created good conditions for the upgrading of bilateral ties.In establishing an ongoing high-level dialogue with Japan to upgrade the investment agreement and forge an FTA, China can also play a mediating role in trade negotiations with Japan and South Korea.Mutual assistance amid the pandemic has shown that China-Japan relations can withstand hardships. By working together, the two sides can move on from the past, and bring peace and prosperity to both nations.The author is president of the Center for China and Globalization, a think tank.Latest: Japan to pick new prime minister on Sept 17, Kyodo News Agency reported Sunday. BEIJING -- China on Saturday offered praise for the important efforts made by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to get China-Japan relations back on track and achieve new developments, wishing him a speedy recovery.In recent years, the relationship between China and Japan has improved and achieved new developments. The leaders of the two countries have reached an important consensus on promoting the establishment of bilateral relations that meet the requirements of the new era, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters."We have a positive assessment of the important efforts made by Prime Minister Abe to achieve these ends and at the same time wish him a speedy recovery," Zhao added."We are willing to work with the Japanese side to stick to the principles and spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan, continue to deepen cooperation in the anti-epidemic fight, as well as economic and social development, and promote the continuous improvement and development of bilateral ties," said the spokesperson.Abe said at a press conference on Friday that he will step down from his post due to health concerns. The generation of our fathers and grandfathers endured two devastating world wars, and much else besides. Military conquerors from earlier periods were often lauded over conduct that, by today's standards of behavior, would be considered despicable.Japan has just marked the 75th anniversary of the two terrible atomic bombings of its cities that forced it to surrender, which helped quickly bring World War II to an end by the cessation of all hostilities in the Far East in 1945, apart from the declaration of war against Japanese aggressors by the Soviet Union.Unfortunately, the message that the annual remembrance ceremony conveys implies that Japan was the victim, rather than the aggressor.The Chinese mainland generally, and Hong Kong, too, had ample painful experience of being at the receiving end of Japanese military aggression, as had many other unfortunate parts of East Asia and the Pacific.Japan again attacked China by invading Manchuria back in 1931. This was described by the Lytton Commission as "ethically illegitimate". The commission was established by the League of Nations, the first worldwide intergovernmental organization whose mission was to maintain world peace, to determine what caused Japan's invasion of Manchuria.The wider Sino-Japanese War, which followed from 1937, continued the military expansion of the then-growing Empire of Japan.The infamous Rape of Nanking (then China's capital and today's Nanjing) in late 1937 saw the mass murder by Japanese soldiers of hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war, and of civilians, as well as mass raping and pillaging. Japan's conduct of the war has been described as "Asia's Holocaust".Millions of Asian people, including civilians and captured Chinese soldiers, died. Some estimates put the total death toll at 25 million or more.In Hong Kong, invaded by Japan in 1941, at about the same time as Pearl Harbor was attacked, the Japanese occupation－which lasted for three years and eight months-included the deaths of more than 10,000 Hong Kong people by murder, torture, mutilation and rape.In other parts of China, Japanese military units weaponized deadly infectious diseases, including exposing soldiers and civilians to bubonic plague, botulism, anthrax, smallpox and cholera, causing huge casualties to the Chinese people for years to come.There was even a secret plan to attack California by germ warfare, which had already been launched around the fields and cities of China.Inhuman and illicit experiments were conducted on human beings, who were vivisected as part of their chemical and biological weapons development program. Japan did not hesitate to use such banned germ warfare techniques.The enforced slave labor imposed by Japan on prisoners of war and civilian victims in the territories it conquered remains a byword for cruelty. Many thousands were maltreated, starved or murdered as a result, some while building a railway track to Burma, which is today's Myanmar.Both Nazi Germany and Japan had their own secret research units, tasked with developing nuclear weapons. Had either country not been forced into surrender in time, before these were fully developed, it seems very likely that both countries would have attacked allied countries with them.It just reinforces the justification in forcing Japan to surrender with the two atomic bombs because the alternative could have led to even more casualties and prolonged people's suffering in land and sea battles for Japan's home islands.So instead of just preaching against the use of atomic weapons, clearly justified in the context of the situation at the time, Japanese leaders should be laying wreaths of regret at the many places throughout Asia (such as Nanjing) that it conquered and for the people whom Japanese soldiers had killed or abused during World War II, which it played a pivotal role in triggering.The author is a commentator on Hong Kong social issues. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.China and Japan should handle their differences in a cautious manner and focus on mutually beneficial cooperation to jointly promote bilateral ties and keep them on the right track, China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Wednesday. The two countries need to strengthen cooperation to fight COVID-19, promote economic recovery and maintain regional peace, as uncertainties are rising in the world ravaged by the pandemic, and the global economy is slipping into deep recession, Wang said.Wang made the remarks during a phone call with Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.Bilateral ties have kept improving, and pragmatic cooperation between the countries is developing steadily, Wang said, adding that it is "very valuable" that the scale of their cooperation in trade and investment in the first half of this year kept up with the levels of the same period last year.Both countries should plan and promote cooperation for the next stage to cope with various global and regional challenges, Wang said, calling for them to strengthen dialogue at all levels.They should enhance the existing dialogue mechanisms while encouraging their government departments, businesses and people to increase exchanges in a proper way, Wang said.Also, they should speed up the establishment of a "fast lane" for personnel exchanges, he said.Both sides should also work on restoring and expanding their mutually beneficial cooperation, Wang said.China values Japanese companies resuming their businesses in China, and has adopted a series of supportive measures, hoping Japan will also provide a fair, transparent and nondiscriminatory environment for Chinese companies, he said.China and Japan need to strengthen their cooperation over international and regional affairs, oppose attempts to politicize the pandemic and comments and behavior that disrupt global cooperation to tackle the disease, and support the World Health Organization in playing its role, Wang pointed out.Also, they should continue to support multilateral mechanisms, including the World Trade Organization in playing their roles, work to ensure that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, is signed this year and speed up negotiation over a free-trade agreement between China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, he said.Motegi said Japan hopes to work with China to promote bilateral ties, maintain talks at all levels and promote personnel exchanges, trade and investment while containing the pandemic.Also, Japan supports an early signing of the RCEP, Motegi said.On the verge of fresh waveAs the country works to reopen its economy, a potential second wave of coronavirus cases is causing concerns among citizens.On Wednesday, the country reported 1,002 fresh cases, the highest single-day total on record, surpassing the 982-logged just one day before.The Tokyo metropolitan government reported 250 new infections, 16 fewer than the previous day, when a bodyguard of Japanese Defense Minister Kono Taro tested positive. Kono himself, however, tested negative, according to the defense ministry.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said 60 percent of the people confirmed positive on Wednesday were aged in their 20s and 30s, taking the capital's monthly figure to more than 5,000 and accounting for nearly half of the city's cumulative total of around 11,000.In response, the metropolitan government has raised its pandemic alert to the highest of four levels, meaning infections are spreading.Other places in Japan also saw a record-high increase on Wednesday, with Osaka Prefecture reporting 221 cases and Aichi confirming more than 150.At a news conference on Wednesday, Japan's top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said 550 clusters of coronavirus infections had been confirmed across the country as of Tuesday, and the health ministry had sent 77 teams of experts to 32 prefectures to deal with the cases."The infection clusters need to be identified and contained immediately to prevent further spread," Suga said, adding that the government will continue helping municipalities compile details on the spread of the virus by sending experts.In fighting the outbreak, Yasutoshi Nishimura, the minister in charge of the coronavirus response, said the names of night life establishments should be disclosed if infections are confirmed there as a result of insufficient anti-virus measures.Japan is considering naming Hideo Tarumi, a veteran diplomat known as a Chinese expert, as its new ambassador to China, local media reported on Wednesday.If he assumes the post, the 59-year-old deputy minister of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Secretariat would be another diplomat from the ministry's "China School "to become an ambassador to China after Yutaka Yokoi, the current ambassador who has been in the post since May 2016.The ministry's "China School "refers to those diplomats who had received language training in China after joining the ministry with a specific focus on advancing relations with Beijing.Joining Japan's Foreign Ministry in 1985, Tarumi has held a number of posts, including director of the China and Mongolia Division, chief minister at the Japanese embassy in Beijing, and he was promoted as deputy minister of the secretariat in July last year.Upon arriving in Beijing, Tarumi would be tasked with navigating the relationship between the two neighbors in Northeast Asia, which has been tested by longtime territorial issues and fresh ones like differing views over China's approach to the coronavirus outbreak.On Tuesday, Japan published its 2020 Defense White Paper, accusing China of pushing its territorial claims and spreading disinformation in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak.In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the white paper is fraught with bias against China and false information."China h
