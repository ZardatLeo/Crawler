dischargeshe noted that despite widespread opposition and broken promises to the fisheries community the ocean release continues with numerous contradictions and injustices remaining unaddressedoda added that previous claims such as the lack of space for additional storage tanks or the lower cost of releasing contaminated water into the sea have lost credibility the justification of needing storage for debris removal is also becoming less convincing given the current state of the cleanup effortswe are repeatedly told that decommissioning is essential for recovery and for that the removal of debris is necessary however is it really possible to safely remove such dangerous debris and what will they do after removing it the ultimate form of the decommissioning process has not been discussed and it seems like they are proceeding blindly said odafurthermore not only tritium but also other radioactive substances such as strontium and carbon remain in the water after being released even the dangers of tritium itself have not been adequately explained she addedthirteen and a half years have passed since the triple meltdown at the fukushima plant which was triggered by the magnitude great east japan earthquake and the subsequent tsunami in march  despite the severe damage local fishermen still wish to continue their work and persist in opposing the ocean discharge of

selling fish caught in other prefecturesinsufficient explanationon aug  which marked a year after the ocean discharge began japanese prime minister fumio kishida visited iwaki where he praised the local sashimi as delicious and assured the head of the fisheries cooperative that he would take full responsibility for the discharge until the endi cant help but wonder what hes talking about

operator of the fukushima daiichi plant and the japanese government are now deliberately releasing radiation from the incident into the global environment she added this process began without sufficient explanation or the publics consent making it completely unacceptable oda saidour concern is the longterm impact of radiation and we refuse to allow further contamination of the earths

strategic industries regional revitalization deregulation and peace diplomacyjapans outstanding government debt has now surpassed  trillion yen  trillion signaling a potential fiscal collapse without confronting the difficult reforms that involve painful budget cuts this party leadership election — filled with empty promises — risks accelerating japans decline he saidat the beginning of the debate

safeguarded its territorial sovereignty with the philippines withdrawing its unlawfully anchored vessel from xianbin reef in the south china sea on saturday afternoon after fivemonth illegal halt and china will take countermeasures if philippines continues its political provocations said military expertsthe philippine coast guard vessel no  was illegally anchored near the xianbin reef since april  during which time china took several necessary measures to warn and control the vessel in accordance with the law deterring several philippine attempts to carry supplies to the vesselliu dejun spokesman of the china coast guard said on sunday the philippines move to illegally strand the vessel severely infringed on chinas sovereignty and is a breach of the declaration on the conduct of parties in the south china sea which was signed by china and the members of asean in  and damaged regional peace and stabilityhe said the philippines should stop hyping the issue and infringing on chinas sovereignty and move in the same direction with china to protect the validity of the declaration on the conduct of parties in the south china seahe stressed that china has indisputable sovereignty over the nansha islands including xianbin reef and the adjacent waters the china coast guard will take necessary measures to firmly safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interestszhang junshe a former researcher at the naval research academy said that philippines attempts to transport supplies to its vessel during its illegal halt at xianbin reef under the garb of humanitarian aid was a lame excuseit is the philippines largest and modern vessel on active service which has been put into use in recent years so humanitarian aid is purely an excuse for its scheme of unlawfully anchoring near the reef and jostling with china for the reef he saidhe added that philippines tried to test chinas resolve in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty by keeping the vehicle stranded for such a long time it was also hoping for a favorable response from the united states but chinas mighty deterrence and the slim chance of getting support from the us finally made philippines leave in dismayhe said the vessels withdrawal proved that chinas policies and measures for coping with south china sea issues are appropriate the nation always insists on handling disputes through peaceful means such as negotiations and talks it respects historical facts and behaves in accordance with international lawsthe military expert added that the possibility of philippines continuing its political provocations in the future by sending another vessel to the south china sea cannot be ruled out as it has played unreasonable and shameless tricks in the region in

democratic party or ldp leadership election but none of the current candidates have clearly presented policies on these matters experts saida record nine candidates launched a day election campaign on thursday to vie for leadership of the ldp aiming to succeed fumio kishida as the countrys next prime ministerkishida announced on aug  that he will not seek reelection as leader of the ruling party his cabinet has continued to struggle with low approval ratingsnoriyuki kawamura an emeritus professor at nagoya university of foreign studies said most of the candidates are focusing on creating a superficial sense of renewal or socalled changing the atmosphere in other words they believe that by changing the face of the top leader the atmosphere will change but that alone is highly insufficienthe emphasized that whoever becomes the leader of the ldp will also become the prime minister of japan and the person must carry out fundamental political reform only by doing so can the publics trust in politics be restoredthe kishida cabinet has not conducted any thorough investigation into the issue of politics and money and the political funds control act has not undergone any fundamental revision but rather only minor surfacelevel adjustments said kawamuradespite receiving large sums of taxpayer money through party subsidies ldp politicians repeatedly held political fundraising events and failed to report the funds they received said kazuyuki hamada an international political economy scholar and former parliamentary viceminister for foreign affairs of japanthe ldps ability to reform itself and its vision for national reconstruction are being called into question the people have lost faith in the current political system and nearly half of them do not even bother to vote in elections said hamadathis race seems like something orchestrated by the ldp to divert attention from the issue of politics and money … however the candidates are not addressing the critical issues facing japans politics economy or defense said hamadasatoshi tomisaka professor at the institute of world studies at takushoku university said that voters can experience a certain sense of renewal by observing a somewhat transparent process of power transfer but that effect will not last longboth the renewal of a change in leadership within the ldp and the renewal of a change in the governing party have the same temporary effect of raising expectations however this does not stop the overall systemic fatigue said tomisakain addition to the need to tackle the issue of politics and money a significant shift in japans foreign policy is also required stabilizing relations with china will be a key challenge for the countrys next leader according to kawamura of nagoya university of foreign studiesin recent years japans foreign policy has increasingly aligned with the united states particularly in its adherence to us efforts to contain china this approach has contributed to growing instability and tensions in japans relationship with china kawamura saidto safeguard japans national interests and determine its future direction it is essential to balance its

president of the genron npo the host organization of the conferencedaniel russel former us assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs said people should be careful about labeling the current situation as a cold war because it creates a mindset that could drive policies and would actually escalate riskthere is a substantial difference nowadays from the sovietera cold war situation given the economic interdependence and the lack of cold warstyle proxy wars in addition international and regional frameworks have been established and technology has really changed the game russel notedprojecting the cold war framework onto todays geopolitical landscape clouds our vision and can create selffulfilling prophecies so i think its a mistake to think in cold war terms but at

by those three criteria we are not quite at a cold war yet said jiahowever he noted that people on both sides are thinking in terms of a worstcase scenario approach each side plans for the worst possible situations and takes measures in that direction and that prompts the other side to do the samewe need to change this worstcase scenario approach we need to give the benefit of the doubt to the other side said jiabesides other countries also have a role in shaping the relationship probably they need to make sure that they do not take sides to fuel the conflict he saidchristopher johnstone senior adviser and japan chair at the center for strategic and international studies said the reality of economic interdependence is such that the us is not going to decouple from china and the us has no ability to ask its close allies to decouple eitherwe are not in a new cold war its not a bipolar system said johnstonewhere we are really heading for is a world of competing coalitions

generating concrete economic benefits and excercising leadership on the global stage adequate resources and public awareness are crucial unfortunately african countries are yet to enjoy these privileges from indonesia not only did the country spend less than  percent of its gross domestic product on foreign policy but limited amount is also concentrated on management support and presence

changes as the party prepares for an upcoming election to select its new leader the ldp plans to retain the wording of the warrenouncing article  while adding a new section to explain the selfdefense

said kohei aoyama  a member of the democratic youth league of japancurrently many conservative members of the ldp particularly those in the faction formerly led by late prime minister shinzo abe support such an amendment and winning their support is crucial for any candidate aspiring for the ldp presidency as a result candidates tend to emphasize the importance of amending article  to gain

favor revision of the constitution is lowthe public is more concerned about improving their livelihoods and social security than about constitutional revision yet the ldp is pushing for this because

bloody massacre perpetrated by the japanese military police and militaristic thugs some extremists influenced by militaristic ideology and strong xenophobic sentiments deliberately fabricated excuses to carry out a massacre of innocent chinese peopleover the past  years family members of the victims have been working tirelessly between china and japan to seek justice they have organized and participated in more than  meetings and attended more than  memorial services at the massacre sites in japan they have repeatedly submitted petitions and demands to the japanese government to express their strong determination and deep dissatisfactionwe the families persist because we have yet to receive a clear apology and this matter remains unresolved said zhou songquan a representative of the

japanese government can truly take up its political and moral responsibilities seriously address and properly handle the relevant historical issues and demonstrate its commitment to reflecting on history through concrete actions he saidliu sipan counselor of the political division at the chinese embassy in japan noted that the immediate cause of the massacre was the malicious spread of rumors and the incitement of social panic but the root cause lay in japans path towards militarism at the time where extreme nationalism xenophobia and antiforeign sentiments prevailedthis also set the stage for japans subsequent aggressive wars of invasion which inflicted immense suffering on china and other asian countries she addedit is regrettable that more than  years later this tragic memory is fading in japanese society the japanese governments stance on historical issues has regressed and there are negative trends in japan where the denial distortion and beautification of its history of aggression occasionally occur said liubaku  azerbaijans ruling new azerbaijan party won the most seats in the countrys parliament in a snap election on sunday mazahir panakhov the central election

environmental damage to xianbin reef according to a report released in beijing on friday about the coral reef ecosystem of the reef in the nansha islandsthis conclusion was based on recent field investigations and remote sensing observations leading china to pledge enhanced ecological monitoring and protection efforts in the south china sea chinese scientists saidpart of chinas nansha islands and located east of renai reef xianbin reef falls under the jurisdiction of sansha south chinas hainan provincethe china coast guard also reported recently that philippine coast guard vessels had illegally intruded into the adjacent waters of xianbin reef and renai reef without permission from the chinese governmentbetween may and july a comprehensive assessment of xianbin reef was conducted by the south china sea development research institute under the ministry of natural resources in collaboration with other relevant departments and field research stationsthe report found that around the  survey spots set up by the scientific expedition team the average coverage of reefbuilding coral was  percent with a maximum of  percent which is relatively high compared to major coral reef distribution areas around the worldaccording to the report xianbin reef is home to  species of reefbuilding coral accounting for  percent of the recorded species of reefbuilding coral in the nansha islandsalthough isolated instances of coral bleaching were observed this is due to seasonal warming as it is currently summer no coral diseases were found said wei zheng a senior engineer at the south china sea development research institutethe scientific expedition team conducted material analysis of coral debris from the six cays of xianbin reef and found no terrestrial material input proving that the cays are naturally formedthe report also shows that the cays at xianbin reef have sufficient materials supporting their development and formation and their locations and geomorphology comply with natural lawsthis indicates that the claims made by the philippines about china artificially depositing coral debris in xianbin reef leading to mass coral bleaching and death in the area are completely unfounded wei saidhowever the frequent human activities by the philippines in recent months have started causing a certain degree of environmental damage to the reef said xiong xiaofei chief scientist from the south china sea ecological centerduring a field investigation in may xiong and his team observed the presence of the philippine coast guard vessel mrrv which had been anchored in the lagoon of xianbin reef since aprilwe also observed some philippine fishing boats and witnessed littering and discarded fishing nets he said noting that the expedition team also observed filipinos throwing cigarette butts into the seachen xiangmiao deputy director of the marine science research institute at the national institute for south china studies said we speculate that the actions of the philippines are an attempt to repeat their past tactics as they did with renai reef and huangyan island trying various means to establish a longterm presence at xianbin reef through fishing vessels and coast guard ships then asserting their claims over the reef and attempting to occupy itthey have also been spreading rumors in the international community claiming that china intends to construct artificial islands at xianbin reef which we have never done at all the facts prove that all these claims are fabricated liesthe international community should also clearly see the shameless face of the philippines he addedwei from the south china sea development research institute said further efforts should be made in the future to strengthen the investigation assessment

has much to offer samoa and other small island countries in the transition to clean energy and infrastructure said samoas ambassador to chinachinas leadership in clean energy development and potential partnerships with samoa and other small island states could significantly address the climate crisis and contribute to saving our planet luamanuvae albert mariner told china dailythe international community has shown great admiration for chinas environmental and sustainability initiatives he said china is leading in green technology and clean energy and has a real opportunity to be a global leader in the renewable energy sectorchina boasts about  percent of the worlds solar manufacturing capacity the vast output has lowered solar panel prices worldwide reducing cost barriers for developing countries to access clean energy technology and expertiseon tackling climate change he said now more than ever the world needs political partnerships to resolve the crisis that we face large economies must find a way because at the end of the day politics is at the heart of climate change negotiations he saidchina recognizes the context of small island countries developmental aspirations because these are countries that have nothing to do with climate change and yet theyre right at the forefront facing constant challenges and the impacts of climate change he saidspeaking about chinas belt and road initiative projects the ambassador said the program is critical as every country needs infrastructure development the focus now is on sustainability built into the infrastructure which holds the key to any countrys development he saidwhat china has offered is critical for development he said citing the example of samoa which is said to have one of the best international airports among small pacific island countries after the facility was built with help from chinamariner said a country involved in the bri is always certain that china is providing what their country truly needs the bri is a process and opportunity that allows ongoing conversations between china and the recipient countries he saidsamoa and china enjoy a comprehensive strategic partnership and will celebrate  years of diplomatic relations next yearmariner said chinese migration to samoa began in the late s and china is a large multicultural country with a fascinating and unique historythe more i read about chinas history the greater i understand and appreciate chinas complexity he saidchinas … success in eliminating extreme poverty is a remarkable achievementthe pacific region where samoa was the first small island country to gain independence is often at the heart of geopolitics in some ways mariner said in todays world apart from geopolitical tensions there is also a battle of narrativesone narrative comes from the western media which is very antichina and biased another perspective of people like him who come to china reveals that this mainstream western narrative is so unfortunate and wrong he said adding that china seeks to be understood and respectedchina places peace and stability as important prerequisites to its national economic development programs he addedit continues to pursue where possible peace mediation efforts in some of the most difficult global conflicts in the world and remains one of the biggest contributors to the un peacekeeping fundjapanese citizens are urging that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal become the central issue of the upcoming liberal democratic party ldp presidential election as a means to eliminate corrupt moneydriven politicson tuesday takakage fujita president of the alliance to stop the impermissible acts of slush fund and tax evasion by the ldp filed for a prosecutorial review with the tokyo no  committee for the inquest of prosecutionhe did this with his legal representatives to challenge the tokyo district public prosecutors offices decision to return their criminal complaints these complaints were against senior politicians in the ldp faction led by former prime minister shinzo abe and thenchief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga concerning a slush fund scandal and the misuse of the cabinets secret fundsearlier this year the tokyo district public prosecutors office returned their complaints claiming that the facts of the crime were not specifiedin these cases the special investigation squad of the tokyo district public prosecutors office has already conducted forced searches and seized numerous accounting records so the facts of the crime should be wellknown to the prosecutors therefore this response from the prosecutors office shows either a lack of understanding or a willful disregard for the overwhelming anger of the public over the ldp slush fund and tax evasion scandal fujita said at a news conference on tuesdayordinary people are forced to pay higher taxes down to the last yen with the introduction of the invoice system meanwhile ldp politicians can obtain millions of yen under the guise of political funds through fundraising party ticket sales use this money for personal extravagances and engage in all sorts of unacceptable behavior that defies common sense this is the essence of the scandal that has angered not just ldp supporters but many citizens said fujitahe emphasized that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal has not been properly resolved and the political funding reform law that the ldp and its junior coalition partner komeito forced through in the last ordinary session of japans parliament is an empty meaningless sham of reformthe ldp will hold its upcoming leadership election on sept  with the official campaign period for the race scheduled to start on sept  as the japanese media will focus on the ldp candidates for the next month fujita is worried that the scandal might be laundered through the hype surrounding the electionif the ldp presidential election is going to dominate the media we strongly hope that the slush fund and tax evasion scandal will be made the main theme of the election he saidthe prosecution has repeatedly stated that it will not pursue this case citing reasons such as unspecified facts however ordinary citizens lack the authority or resources to conduct investigations and can only file complaints based on the evidence they possess the prosecution should be investigating and bringing charges based on these complaints said akihiko ohaguchi a lawyer representing the complainantsthe way the prosecution and police are protecting the governments interests is evident … as citizens we must strongly criticize such actions by the prosecution said ohaguchinaohiko hasegawa another member of fujitas legal team said they filed two criminal complaints regarding this matter but both were quickly returned on the grounds that the facts were not specifiedan accusation is a request for investigative authorities to look into suspected facts therefore even if the specifics are not clear it is unacceptable to reject it outright just for that reason on the contrary there should be some level of investigation before a final decision is made said hasegawait appears that from the beginning there was no intention to address the slush fund issue seriously the matter seems to be handled with minimal effort with only lowerlevel figures being targeted while key influential members of the ldp remain untouched said hasegawahe noted that there is significant anger over the political funding issue and genuine frustration over the lack of a serious response what the people truly need is thorough and meaningful action including expulsions and strong recommendations for resignation or tax payment he addedshigeaki koga a policy analyst and a former official of japans ministry of economy trade and industry said the people want to know the facts about the scandal — when did these wrongdoings start who initiated them who spent how much money and for what purpose after clarifying these facts they want those who committed these wrongdoings to be appropriately punished possibly even criminally prosecutedin addition they also want the rules governing political funds to be fundamentally reformed to ensure transparency and fairness so that such incidents never happen again said kogafrom the perspective of the ldp fumio kishidas resignation as japans prime minister is viewed as a way to take responsibility with the hope that this will put the issue to rest they also believe that introducing a new candidate might create the impression of change and help regain the trust of the public he saidhowever from the publics viewpoint kishidas resignation is not so much appreciated as it is considered too late moreover even if a new leader is introduced the public still cannot see any substantial change at this stage and it is unlikely that they will so the ldp might fail to regain the trust of the public said kogaglobal experts and leaders called for higher utilization rates under the regional comprehensive economic partnership or rcep and making collective efforts to unleash the full potential of the framework for economic prosperity for allasean members have rather low utilization rates of rcep which constrains the realization of the agreements benefits said ong tee keat president of the belt and road initiative caucus for asia

framework that aims to lower trade barriers and secure improved market access for goods and services for businesses in the regionaccording to data from the vietnam chamber of commerce and industry vietnams total exports to the rcep region in  amounted to  billion with rcep preferential exports reaching  million it accounts for an rcep export utilization rate of less than  percentstudies indicated the utilization rates for chinas exports and imports were  percent and  percent respectively last yearthe minimum tariff differential with other trade agreements is among the factors leading

nuclearcontaminated water into the ocean expressing concern that the discharge is causing anxiety about the safety of food from fukushimathe citizens conference to condemn further pollution of the ocean a nonprofit organization in iwaki a coastal city in fukushima prefecture called for global action on saturday the organization invited people worldwide to join in by standing up and holding homemade placards to express their opposition to the dischargechiyo oda codirector of the organization also known as koreumi said the process of deciding to release the nuclearcontaminated water into the ocean was done in a way that ignored the opposition from the publicwhen i eat fresh and delicious fish and shellfish or when children and young people play by the sea i feel anxious that the effects of radiation may appear one day i feel that we are losing our natural way of life which is to eat delicious products and play freely in the sea around us said oda a resident of iwakion sunday japan completed its eighth release of around  metric tons of nuclearcontaminated water into the sea this was the eighth release overalltokyo electric power company or tepco the operator of the crippled fukushima daiichi plant has already released over  tons of contaminated water the discharge is expected to continue for several decadesthree japanese civic groups namely the fukushima prefecture peace forum the citizens nuclear information center and the japan congress against a and hbombs submitted a second round of signatures to government officials in tokyo on wednesday requesting an immediate halt to the ocean dischargeearlier this year they submitted a petition accompanied by the first batch of  signatures collected nationwide on wednesday the second batch of  signatures was handed over to officials of japans ministry of economy trade and industry bringing the total number of signatures to tepco has used the advanced liquid processing system or alps to remove multiple radioactive substances from the contaminated water before discharging it into the seahowever this has not alleviated the safety concerns of the japanese public and residents of other countrieseven though alps can reduce radioactive particles in the water it cannot eliminate them entirely moreover the water release is expected to continue for  to  years resulting in a tremendous amount of water containing radioactive substances being discharged said hajime matsukubo secretarygeneral and researcher at the citizens nuclear information centermasashi tsunoda corepresentative of the fukushima prefecture peace forum expressed skepticism over whether the discharged water truly meets safety standardsno assessmentthe government speaks of implementing a longterm monitoring system yet no comprehensive longterm assessment is being conducted therefore i find it hard to simply accept the safety claims based solely on official statements said tsunodamasayo ikeda secretarygeneral of the womens conference a nonprofit organization criticized the japanese government and tepco for claiming the released water is safe without thorough verificationthe presence of tritium and various radioactive substances means there is no guarantee that it wont have any environmental impact ikeda said she stressed the importance of japan continuously verifying the safety of the facilities and the water being releasedtoshihiro inoue a special committee member of the japan congress against a and hbombs criticized the government and tepco for using the term alpstreated water which gives the impression that the water is not contaminatedthis kind of image manipulation has made it increasingly difficult for us to call it contaminated water but the reality is that the water remains contaminated with radiation even if radioactive materials are reduced they are still present said inouehe expressed serious concerns over the longterm environmental impact of releasing this water over an extended period especially regarding its potential effects on marine products that enter the food supplyon thursday tepco suspended experimental work to extract nuclear fuel debris from one of the reactors at the wrecked fukushima daiichi plant after discovering an error in the installation of a debris removal devicethe government has set a goal to decommission the plant by however the recent setback in debris removal underscores the uncertainties surrounding the entire decommissioning process raising concerns that the timeline may be extended even further if the timeline is indeed prolonged it would mean the release of contaminated water could continue said inouewhats really needed now is an acknowledgment that the plans are delayed and that achieving the original goals might be impossible however instead of admitting this and communicating openly with local residents and those in surrounding areas the authorities continue to insist that everything is fine this approach is alarming because it puts undue pressure on the workers which could lead to mistakes and further complications he saidbefore the fumio kishida administration japans nuclear policy was to reduce nuclear power as much as possible but under kishida it has changed to make maximum use of it said motoo tomizuka a member of no nukes plaza tokyowith earthquakes becoming more frequent each year continuing to operate aging nuclear power plants only heightens the risk of another severe accident its a reckless decision said tomizukamasahide kimura a member of the japanese antinuclear campaign group said that in tepcos monitoring results the term not detected is used to indicate that radioactive material levels are below the detection limit however tepco treats these levels as if they are zerogiven the large volume of water being released if you multiply this by the detection limit it becomes evident that a significant amount of radioactivity is being discharged theyre releasing numerous radioactive substances including plutonium and strontium not just tritium kimura said during a protest in front of japans nuclear regulation authority on wednesdayapproach slammedmany others have expressed concern over the japanese governments approach of proceeding with the ocean discharge without properly securing international understandingchinese foreign ministry spokesperson mao ning said on friday that china strongly opposes japans unilateral discharge of nuclearcontaminated water into the oceanlet me stress that the more transparent and open japan is on the issue the easier it will be for japan to alleviate international concerns said maochina once again calls on japan to seriously address both international and domestic concerns and fully cooperate in establishing an independent international monitoring arrangement that remains effective in the long haul and includes substantive participation from japans neighboring countries and other stakeholders she saidkimura supports chinas proposal ideally japan should engage in international dialogue and address these issues with other countries before concerns are raised the discharge is expected to continue for  to  years possibly even longer it is essential to reassess the situation and initiate discussions now even though a year has already passed he saidikeda representing the womens conference shares a similar perspective i believe that an international monitoring system is absolutely necessary and i think it should be established she saidthe reforms initiated by chinas late leader deng xiaoping and

pacific oceanthe date serves as a grim reminder of the environmental and economic impacts of a deeply irresponsible move experts said despite assurances from japanese authorities skepticism remains as fears of longterm contamination and its consequences continue to growdespite fierce opposition both at home and abroad japan began discharging socalled treated water from the nuclear plant into the pacific ocean with the latest and eighth round carried out on aug the chinese embassy in japan expressed its firm opposition to the irresponsible move noting that it concerns the health of all mankind the global marine environment and international public interests which meant it was not a private matter of japanthe move to dump nuclearcontaminated water into the ocean severely violates the international law and is highly irresponsible and selfish drawing widespread condemnation from the international community particularly neighboring countries that bear the brunt of the impact meng xiaoxu a researcher at the institute of japan studies of the chinese academy of social sciences told china dailyunder international law states have a duty to prevent harm and must minimize transboundary damage meng said citing the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter adopted by the international maritime organization in  to which japan is a signatory the convention aims to control and prevent marine pollution by prohibiting the dumping of hazardous materialsjapan has violated other international laws such as the united nations convention on the law of the sea adopted in  meng saidsouth korean environment activists staged a rally near a building that houses the japanese embassy in seoul on wednesday to demand japan stop the

demanding an immediate stop to the releasethe japanese government has not effectively addressed the concerns of its citizens or neighboring countries and the international community wang zhen a research professor of international politics at the shanghai academy of social sciences institute of international relations told china daily the behavior is entirely selfserving and harmful to others driven by narrow selfishness at the expense of others he saida significant leak of  tons of radioactive water detected this month at fukushima once again highlights the management chaos at tokyo

accident the highest on the international nuclear and radiological event scalein  the government and tepco promised local fishermen and fishing federations that they would not dump nuclearcontaminated water into the sea without the understanding of those concernedhowever in  the japanese government unilaterally decided to discharge millions of tons of nuclearcontaminated water into the sea in  after treatment and dilution a process that can continue for decadesaccording to wang japan initially adopted a cautious attitude he added that the shift in  was driven by the fact that tepcos storage tanks were projected to become full by autumn mitsuhisa furuichi a parliamentarian from the fukushima prefecture said the japanese government and tepco opted for what they call the cheapest way of getting rid of the nuclearcontaminated waterthe japanese government set up a committee to determine what to do with the water furuichi told cgtn in april the committee decided that the cheapest way was to discharge the water into the sea and since it could be done at a cost of  billion yen  million or so they chose to do that … also about  billion yen was spent on reputation damage controlthe primary consideration for discharge is costsaving rather than the environmental safety of its citizens and the international community wang said tepcos spending on public relations rather than investing in nuclear security and proper treatment further highlights the narrow selfinterest and opportunism of both the japanese government and tepcothe cheapest solution turned out to be the most costly for the international community in terms of the nuclear risks borne by the whole of humanity meng saidwithout sufficient scientific evidence and transparency the irresponsible discharge will inevitably result in serious consequences meng addedthe us state department said in a statement in august last year the united states is satisfied with japans safe transparent and sciencebased processthere is a clear tendency among western countries to politicize the environmental issues surrounding japans move meng said from a strategic perspective the us supports its ally japan and sees potential benefits in deteriorating sinojapanese relationssome us politicians not only refrain from condemning japans discharge but criticize other countries legitimate concerns and moves including the suspension of seafood imports from fukushima wang saidwould the us and its western allies remain as calm and satisfiedif other nonwestern countries adopted similarly irresponsible practices as

dozens of sdf members in a collective visit to the shrine riding in an official vehicle in april retired maritime sdf admiral umio otsuka was announced as the th chief priest of yasukuni shrine the

museumon thursday japanese prime minister fumio kishida sent ritual offerings to the shrine in his capacity as president of the ruling liberal democratic partyatsushi koketsu an emeritus professor at yamaguchi university of japan noting that yasukuni shrine which played a key role in supporting japanese militarism is central to japans state shinto pointed out that visits by sdf members clearly violated the constitutional principle of the separation of religion and statethis is an attempt to revive the prewar militarism that used state shinto and such moves should be strongly criticized the scholar statedwhy is the sdf leadership so obsessed with yasukuni shrine in a recent public lecture in tokyo tetsuya takahashi an emeritus professor at the university of tokyo explained that many of the sdf predecessors such as members of the national police reserve and the maritime guard had participated in japans aggressive warsto put it simply the sdf has not severed ties with the old japanese military nor does it wish to takahashi remarkedthe scholar said that the sdf is now openly teaching students at the national defense academy of japan about how officers of the former japanese military commanded their subordinates by inviting rightwing politicians to promote the socalled military spirit of the old japanese forcesaccording to takahashi the sdf also uses yasukuni shrine as an educational base where young people who lack a proper understanding of japans history of aggression are taken to visit there they are indoctrinated with the idea that dying for the country allows one to enter the shrine and be enshrined as a deity a concept takahashi described as an emotional alchemysayuri saito a constitutional law professor at keisen university in japan argued that yasukuni shrine has not erased the militaristic colonialist and imperialist values of the old constitution or the socalled meiji constitution but affirms instead a historical perspective that could revive these valuesin her view the controversial shrine does not recognize the value of the current pacifist constitution with its beliefs incompatible with the basic principles of peace enshrined in the constitution which explains why forces that support the yasukuni historical perspective are eager to revise japans constitutionsaito pointed out that although yasukuni shrine lists words like safety and peace on its website its very concept is entirely different from the peace envisioned by the japanese constitutionthe yasukuni shrine located in central tokyo honors  convicted classa japanese war criminals from world war ii including hideki tojo inperson visits of japanese politicians to the shrine have long been strongly condemned by peace advocates within japan and the international communitykoketsu warned that the sdfs frequent involvement with yasukuni shrine would only heighten concerns in asia particularly in china and south korea and increase distrust and vigilance toward the japanese governmentthe growing power of the sdf and the revival of the yasukuni ideology will be seen as a resurgence of japanese militarismtrue peace will not come from an elite sdf but from

month though the figure rebounded slightly from last month the latest cabinet disapproval rating was  percent according to an opinion poll published by jiji press last weekthe starting point for the loss of support was the political funding scandal involving factions within the ldp said magosaki who is also a former senior official with japans ministry of foreign affairsthere was no prospect of

with russia china and other countries in the field of nuclear energy which opens up opportunities for creating effective regional energy systems such cooperation also helps kazakhstan strengthen its energy independence and ensure stability in the regionwhat mechanisms do you consider effective in managing international cooperation on nuclear and energy projects and how can they be applied to kazakhstans npp construction planson the international stage the key mechanisms for successful cooperation are transparency trust and clear legal frameworks it is important to establish sustainable

with its npp planskazakhstan has unique opportunities not only as a uranium supplier but also as a producer of nuclear energy with the growing interest in clean energy sources kazakhstan can become a leader in the development of small modular reactors smrs which offer more flexible and economically advantageous solutions for energy supply additionally kazakhstan should consider participating in international projects for the development and implementation of nuclear waste recycling technologies which could significantly increase the added value in the countrys nuclear industrybased on your professional experience what measures could the kazakh government implement to attract foreign investments and expertise and ensure the success of the projectto attract foreign investments and

support plays a crucial role in the success of any nuclear project in france where nuclear energy is the main source of electricity regulators place great emphasis on communication with the public the main mechanisms include transparent information about safety environmental aspects and the benefits of nuclear energy public hearings meetings with local communities and educational programs are

sources of power owing to their intermittency but he said nuclear energy will not only cut carbon emissions but is also a stable and flexible energy sourceas of  more than  percent of the power generated in the asean region was from coal and gas while renewables accounted for about  percentarianto said the first step in deploying nuclear power in the region is for the governments to have a strong political will to use nuclear power as a means to secure energy supply and transition to a cleaner source of fuel to create policies and laws on nuclear development and to build the nuclear power plantssignificant progressthe asean booklet has highlighted several countries that have made significant progress in their plan to use nuclear energy in the future indonesia for example has

do we allow netanyahu and his radical government to impose their agenda on the region and doom it to a future of more conflictor do we do what we all believe is right and bring about that permanent

wishes of peace and safety for the trip he saidduring their stay in thailand fu said many thai people asked him lots of questions about china apart from ordinary ones such as whether china had banks

their bodies as fertilizer also they were curious about my marriage and ask whether my wife was picked from a group of women that were arranged by the government fu recalled with laughterthose

from the asia news network ann of which china daily is among its  leading titlesthe south korean economy is poised to continue its recovery in the latter half of this year but the country must address its existential issue which stems from problems such as low productivity and a declining population the organization for economic cooperation and development said on july we publish surveys every two years but this one is about an existential issue for south korea said vincent koen the oecds country studies division chief in the economics department during a press briefing at the ministry of economy and finance building in the city of sejongone urgent issue south korea must address is the population decline and its notoriously low fertility rate according to the oecd economic surveys korea  report released that daysupporting people to have the number of children they desire would dampen the projected population decline while lengthening working lives and welcoming more foreign workers would counteract the adverse effects of aging the report notedfor this koen also called for structural reforms in the labor market improvements in labor and family policies and changes in societal norms to counter population declinethe report also called for a decisive upgrade in south koreas exportoriented growth model to bolster declining productivityciting the gap between large and small companies as a key reason for falling productivity the oecd urged reforms to create a level playing field for competition stricter management of subsidies and benefits for small and mediumsized companies as well as streamlined regulations to enhance market competition are recommended the report saidmeanwhile the oecd survey report forecast a  percent growth outlook for the south korean economy this year driven by improved exports and strengthening domestic demand in the second halfwith inflation falling back and renewed demand for computer chips powering a wave of investment in ai across the world exports are again driving growth koen saidfor  the oecd expected that south koreas economic growth would slow to  percentunlike exports private consumption in south korea has been weak in the first half of the year pulled down by high interest rates and weak real wage growth the oecd anticipates the domestic market to rebound in the latter half south koreas elevated debt servicing burdens and accumulated inflation will continue to weigh on private consumption and investment in the short term but domestic demand should strengthen from the second half of  the report statedthe korea heraldexposing illicit wildlife trade that thrives on ecommerce platforms is like a game of whackamole even with the use of artificial intelligence toolsillicit online listings of the likes of ivory pangolin scales or even live animals are often disguised using emoji other languages and code words such as rare collectibles that make them difficult to detect said jayasri srikantan who spearheads a volunteer effort under wildlife conservation group world wildlife fund to flag illegal trade to the authoritiesbut an ai model is being developed to assist wwfs volunteers — called cyber spotters — to evaluate flagged listings on ecommerce platforms with greater accuracythe system trained on thousands of wildlife product samples and their estimated black market prices helps to prevent false positives ensuring the groups credibility with law enforcement partnersthe programs accuracy rate is about  percent for now said jayasri adding that new code words and trends are regularly added to the system to keep it up to date with current trendsdeployed in  the wwfs cyber spotter ai model is part of an initiative to fund and kickstart ai projects in singapore to spur ai adoption led by national ai program ai singaporethe ai system which has been in the works since  is designed to help improve the accuracy of reports compiled quarterly by the wwf and by its pool of more than  volunteers in singapore who trawl local ecommerce platforms for hours each month for signs of illegal wildlife trade said jayasri wwf singapores head of education and outreachimages and text from postings flagged by the cyber spotters are uploaded to an ai model which analyzes text and photos for clues of illegally traded wildlife and their productsthe team needs to avoid flagging replicas by mistake and must look out for clues in each listings images text and prices to ascertain if it truly involves an exploited animal listings that have a high mix of these elements could be flagged by the software as genuinely illegalits trickier than it sounds jayasri said spotting ivory for instance is not as easy as it seems as schreger lines — unique patterns found within an elephants bones that guarantee its authenticity — are tough to discern through often blurry images onlinesome sellers brazenly list protected wildlife products online but others employ tactics to conceal their illicit offerings jayasri said these tactics include using emoji or code words that hint at the creature being sold or employing emoji representing the animal which all make it challenging for our team to identify genuine listings accuratelyivory replicas can be sold at low prices while real elephant ivory is more likely to be listed in the hundreds of dollars jayasri saidbut sellers can play all sorts of tricks to slip under the radar like lowering the prices or using other code words so that they arent suspected the ai needs to consider all of thisthe system does not replace the work of volunteers who conduct final checks on the reports before they are submittedjayasri said the team here flags tens of thousands of listings each year in an effort to prevent the illegal trade — the second leading cause of wildlife loss after deforestation worldwide and among the worlds most profitable crime sectorsthe end goal jayasri said is to fully automate the system so that an ai model is able to trawl websites for illegal listings and compile a report on its own but the technology has some way to go before achieving this level of autonomythe international agency

a choice that india has to make the economic survey report saideven though india is the fastestgrowing g country and is now recording growth rates that outpace chinas indias economy is still a fraction of chinas it notedthe report makes a case for removing restrictions on chinese fdi in order to turn india into an export hub that can export to the western economies analysts saybiswajit dhar

improve the competitiveness of the indian manufacturing sectorhe noted that china was able to leverage the strengths of foreign investors to increase the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector but the question is whether india can develop an effective strategy to benefit from chinese companies similar to what china did visavis western multinationals dhar saidsebastian morris a former professor at the indian institute of management in ahmedabad said that fdi from china will help indias manufacturing sector to be more competitive in the international market giving a boost to its

trade organizations after the biden administration finalized tariff increases on certain products made in chinalowerincome us consumers will face the biggest consequences from the new tariff hikes thomas fullerton an american economist and economics professor at the university of texas at el paso told china dailythat is because they purchase more merchandise goods than services and many of those goods are produced in china or contain components that are produced in chinathe biden administration first proposed the higher tariffs in may on more than  billion worth of products from china the tariffs are scheduled to start on sept the tariffs will rise to  percent on electric vehicles evs  percent on solar cells and  percent on ev batteries steel lithiumion batteries aluminum and key minerals increased tariffs on semiconductor chips will take effect over the next two years the office of the us trade representative said but the spike is likely to not only drive up costs for chinese brands that ship to the us but also for american companies and consumers who buy lowcost goods say expertsa substantial portion but not all of the higher costs will be paid by us consumers fullerton said chinese companies and us importers will also see reduced profit margins because not all the tariffs will be completely passed on in the form of higher pricesthe national foreign trade council nftc a trade association based in washington also has expressed concern about the impact that the tariffs will have on cashstrapped us households and importersthere is no question that tariffs raise costs for consumers and adding new and expanded tariffs will harm working families and imperil americas national and economic security nftc vicepresident of global trade policy tiffany smith told china daily tariffs are paid by us importers not the chinese government and represent dollars that are no longer available for these companies to reinvest in innovation employees or expanding their businesses she said the reality is that tariffs are blunt instruments that have not and will not resolve the complex economic challenges that exist between the united states and chinashe said that an analysis by the tax foundation found that the new tariffs proposed by the biden administration in may would create an additional tax burden of  billion on us businesses and consumers the updated tariffs came after a fouryear review aimed at strengthening protections for strategic industries the us trade representative said on sept in  former president donald trump began the original tariffs that eventually covered more than  billion in imports from china which later responded with its own tariffs biden not only kept trumps tariffs in place but has increased the ratevicepresident kamala harris the democratic presidential candidate hasnt detailed her tariff policy trump however has been clearhe recently branded himself a tariff president and the us a tariff nation at a campaign rally in wisconsin harris criticized his policy as a sales tax on american households and a trump tax trump said that its not going to be a cost to you its going to be a cost to another country numerous economists and retail organizations disagree they have projected that if trump enacts proposed tariffs of  to  percent on all goods and  percent on goods from china it will ultimately hurt us consumers walletsin the study why trumps tariff proposals would harm working americans by the washingtonbased peterson institute for international economics piie kimberly clausing and mary lovely argue that the tariffs could end up hurting americans families farmers and exporters the mostthe piie study said that in contrast to trumps frequent and mistaken claims that foreigners bear the impact of tariffs economists have long understood that tariffs burden domestic purchasers of imported goods because imports are the difference between domestic demand and domestic supply a tariff affects both sides of the marketlovely is professor emeritus of economics at the maxwell school of citizenship and public affairs of syracuse university and a senior fellow of the peterson instituteshe told china daily we look at the effect of these proposals on american households as consumers of imported goods the new taxes are economically significant — a household with median income is projected to pay  more each year in import taxes the new taxes are also regressive in the sense that they take a larger share of income from poorer households than richer householdsthe center for american action forum a liberal think tank estimated that tariffs proposed by trump could amount to a  annual tax increase for a middleincome familymodel simulations conducted by sp global intelligence moodys analytics and the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania all confirm that tariffs are primarily paid by consumers within the united states fullerton saidunited nations  fu cong chinas

territoryin remarks at the un general assembly emergency special session on the palestinian question fu said decades of occupation and oppression have inflicted untold sufferings on the palestinian people and made the longcherished dream of independent statehood ever more elusiveending the occupation is not an option but a legal obligation for israel he stressedthe international court of justice icj in its advisory opinion issued on july  unequivocally concluded that israels continued presence in the occupied palestinian territory is a violation of international law and that israel is under an obligation to immediately bring to an end its unlawful presence in the occupied palestinian territories the ambassador said adding that the icjs advisory opinion affirms the longstanding consensus of the international community and pinpoints the crux of the palestinian questionwe urge israel to heed the strong call of the international community by immediately ending its unlawful presence in the occupied palestinian territory he saidfu noted that ending the occupation is to redress historical injustice and more importantly lay the foundation for peaceunderscoring that independent statehood is the inalienable right of the palestinian people as a nation the ambassador said the prolonged illegal occupation has hindered the realization of selfdetermination of the palestinian people and given israel an exclusive veto over palestine this is unacceptableonly a complete end to the occupation and the establishment of the independent state of palestine will truly make it possible for palestine and israel to live side by side in peace for the two peoples to live together in peace and tranquility and for lasting peace to be achieved in the middle east he saidfu emphasized that the implementation of the twostate solution is the only viable way to resolve the question of palestine and is the broad consensus of the international communityhe called on the international community to make greater efforts and demand that israel implement the relevant resolutions of the security council and the general assembly cease its military operations in gaza and stop its illegal settlement activities in the west bankchina advocates the convening of a more broadbased and effective international peace conference to revitalize the political prospects of the twostate solution and to work out a timetable and a roadmap for its implementation he saidtoday is a historic moment fu said noting that the state of palestine has taken a seat among un member states and introduced a draft resolution to the general assembly that focuses on the implementation of the advisory opinion of the icjhe said china will vote in favor of the draft resolution and hopes the resolution will give new impetus to ending the occupation implementing the twostate solution and advancing the middle east peace processin the diverse culinary landscape of the united states there are nearly  asian restaurants in the us where chinese cuisine is prominentyet despite the popularity of chinese food — which is featured on  percent of the menus at asian restaurants — leaders in the chinese catering industry are calling for a shift in focusat a recent industry meeting experts emphasized that while taste remains crucial the future success of chinese restaurants in america hinges on enhancing the overall dining experienceamy duan founder of chihuo and initiator of the taste of asia event stressed that thriving in the competitive american market requires more than just flavor it demands an investment in ambience service and cultural storytellingfood is the language that means you like people so theres no politics no barriers … everyone will enjoy the beauty of good food duan told china daily at a recent north america asian food industry conference and exhibition in los angeleshundreds of people in the catering industry attended the conference to discuss franchise models marketing and brands localization strategies and supply chainsas american consumers increasingly seek authentic globally influenced culinary experiences chinese restaurant owners are encouraged to adapt and innovate learning from the successful models of american chains like mcdonalds and burger king to build a loyal and diverse customer base duan saidchinese cuisine is renowned for its rich and diverse flavors yet westerners might not fully appreciate the intricate techniques and cultural significance behind its preparationmany chinese dishes in the us have been adapted to suit american tastes often resulting in a sweeter lesscomplex flavor profile that has led to americanized chinese food becoming the primary representation of the cuisinemost of the chinese restaurants are feeling lonely they dont know if its the best way to do the business in america and how to promote the asian food culture in america duan saidwhile discussing expanding a restaurant chain globally the industry leaders emphasized the importance of understanding local markets adapting to customer preferences and overcoming cultural barrierszhao yong president of the asian american hospitality alliance highlighted the challenges facing chinese cuisine in the us describing the industry as being in a red ocean state — saturated with competition but lacking in cohesive strategyhe said there are three main problems low prices leading to a decline in quality a lack of standardization and the use of cheap labor which hinders the industrys growth and potential for public recognitionfor example if there is a small restaurant in a small us town with a population of  soon there will be  chinese restaurants in that town more than mcdonalds but everyone is undercutting prices and prices cant go any lower this has been the traditional expansion method for chinese restaurants in the us —competing against each other zhao saidto address those issues zhao suggested creating national chinese food festivals such as hot pot day or soup dumpling day to promote culinary brands and encourage investment in the chinese food supply chainsuch efforts would raise the profile of chinese cuisine he saidhowever some experts expressed doubts about introducing too much of the original culture into the us marketcervantes lee professor of hospitality business at the university of nevada las vegas said that while authenticity is important its crucial to respect local customs and culturethe business should be managed by a team familiar with the local market and the foods flavor must be adapted to suit local tastes lee saidits important not to assume that americans will immediately appreciate our authentic dishes duan saidfor asian restaurants in the us the focus is often on delivering the best flavors and tastes however american customers seek more than just good food they are drawn to the overall atmosphere — whether classic upscale or casual — and the story behind the restaurantservice is also crucial as dining out is about enjoying a complete experience a point emphasized at the gatheringunfortunately many asian or chinese restaurateurs tend to overlook the importance of environment vibe and service concentrating solely on taste which isnt enough to satisfy american diners duan saidstill chinese korean japanese and thai restaurants are increasingly being included on michelins list in recent years they become popular in the us partly due to adapting their offerings to local palatesthis approach contrasts with simply copying menus from their home countries and trying to sell them directly to nonnative audiences duan addedif the greatest challenge for a chinese restaurant is to preserve the traditional flavors and cultural heritage of chinese cuisine while adapting to local american tastes and building a loyal customer base then lao sze chuan in chicago has achieved bothformer chicago mayor rahm emanuel is a loyal customer often bringing

need for more manpower to control and extinguish the major blazesthe workdays are tough considering the length of the fire line the heat the wind and especially the type of fuel which is very dense

and provoking bloc confrontations on the ukraine crisisin the ongoing ukraine crisis there has been a steady influx of large quantities of weapons and ammunition into the battlefield which will only lead to escalated situation and the loss of more civilian lives geng shuang chinas deputy permanent representative to the united nations said at the un security council briefing on arms supply to ukraineit will have an extensive negative impact on international and regional peace and security he warnednoting that china is deeply concerned about the recent spiraling of the intensity of the war the ambassador said the pressing priority of the moment is to respect the principles of no expansion of the battlefield no escalation of the fighting and no provocation by any party with a view to swiftly deescalate the situationhe called on the parties to the conflict to demonstrate their political will meet each other halfway put an early end to the hostilities and relaunch peace talks he also called on the international community to pave the way to this end by providing tangible assistance and facilitation and urged all parties concerned to put peace and humanity first and rechannel their resources and energy to ending hostilities through diplomacyin response to remarks by the us representative that spread a false narrative in his earlier statement distorting and vilifying chinas position on the ukraine issue once again geng emphasized that china did not create the ukraine crisis much less are we a party to the conflictchina has not supplied weapons to either party and we have consistent and rigorous controls over dualuse items we maintain normal trade and economic cooperation with all countries around the world including russia and ukraine he addedunderscoring that chinas position on the ukraine issue is objective and impartial the ambassador said that for over two years china has been working hard to promote peace and encourage and facilitate peace talkshe elaborated the efforts made by china and other countries on the political settlement of the ukraine crisis including the sixpoint consensus jointly issued by china and brazil in may this year this fully demonstrates that diplomatic negotiations and a political settlement meet the common expectations of the majority of countries and represent the will of the international communitywe hope that the united states will not continue to turn a deaf ear to these calls for peace that it will desist from discrediting and obstructing the diplomatic efforts of china and other countries concerned undermining international solidarity creating division and antagonism and provoking bloc confrontations and that it will truly play a constructive role in bringing an early end to the war and achieving peace geng saidfinding the right way for china and the united states to get along with each other is what both nations and the international community need the most a top chinese envoy said

decoupling is illusive viewing each other as new cold war adversaries will prove to be the biggest strategic misjudgment in the st century xie said adding that a conflict between china and the us would be unbearable for both and the worldthe envoy underscored that among the four red lines china has drawn — taiwan democracy and human rights path and system and development rights the taiwan

harris vowed to build an opportunity economy citing plans to make housing more affordable and expand the child tax credit trump repeated his claim that he would impose tariffs on imports from other countries and also criticized the high inflation rates under the bidenharris administrationabortion was a vital issue for both candidates in the debate trump emphasized his position that abortion should be a state issueharris criticized what she referred to as the trump abortion bans since roe versus wade was overturned she also highlighted cases where women have been unable to get abortions after being raped or struggled to get miscarriage carethey also sparred over us foreign policies regarding the israelpalestine conflict the russiaukraine conflict and the us withdrawal from

considered a cornerstone of cooperation expired on aug the uschina science and technology agreement the first official agreement signed after the normalization of uschina relations in the s ended despite the scientific communitys efforts to have it renewedoriginally signed by then us president jimmy carter and then chinese leader deng xiaoping in  the symbolically significant pact had been renewed every five years since it took effect with the most recent renewal in however the agreements fate had been hanging in the balance since august  when it was on the verge of lapsing in an attempt to salvage the agreement the two countries extended it twice for six months each time to negotiate renewal terms those efforts proved unsuccessful and the most recent sixmonth extension expired last monthmany disappointedthe demise of the sta has sparked concern and disappointment among experts in the fieldrichard dasher director of the usasia technology management center at stanford university supports maintaining international cooperationi think we should stay internationally focused and i think that cooperation is good whenever we can do it so in principle i would be in favor of continuing the uschina science and technology agreement dasher told china dailythe frustration surrounding the obstacles to renewing the sta is palpable within the scientific communitydenis simon a former professor at duke universitys fuqua school of business and marcus stanley director of studies at the quincy institute for responsible statecraft voiced their exasperation by asking why cant we just let american and chinese scientists get alongin an article published in the quincy institutes online magazine responsible statecraft the day after the agreement expired the authors emphasized the critical role of the sta in fostering scientific collaborationthe sta provided an overarching framework for facilitating scientific exchanges joint research projects and the sharing of knowledge and technical expertise they wrotesimon and stanley warned of the potential consequences of allowing the sta to lapseit would be a mistake for agreements to facilitate basic scientific research cooperation such as the sta to become irretrievably damaged by the increase in uschina tensions the decision on whether to extend amend or terminate the sta has profound implications for the global scientific community they cautionedthe authors also highlighted the broader context of growing distrust between the two countries which has contributed to the current impasse besides congress the us government has increasingly scrutinized chinese scientists and researchers over national security concerns which has hampered academic exchangesthis climate of growing distrust not only has made renewal of the sta more contentious but it has also made the rekindling of overall science and technology cooperation more difficult they saidroger pielke jr a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative american enterprise institute think tank expressed his support for continuing the sta in the most robust form that can be negotiated between the two nationshe argued that the very existence of such an agreement is more important than its specific details adding he viewed decoupling to be a bad idea and it is also a bad idea in science and technologycrucial supportfor decades the sta has been instrumental in fostering scientific collaboration in areas of basic science such as agriculture clean energy public health and the environment it has provided us and chinese researchers with crucial financial legal and political support enabling them to work together on groundbreaking research and innovationsdasher emphasized the interconnected nature of the global scientific community and the importance of collaborationtheres a continuum between basic research and actual commercialization and certainly in the basic research area theres always cooperation potential just about everywhere he said and youre seeing a lot of papers written jointly between people in china and in the united statesthe agreement has contributed to a rapid increase in both the number and quality of joint papers by chinese and us researchers however in recent years research collaboration has declined attributed to rising tensions and antichina sentimenta study published by the national bureau of economic research in june showed that scientific cooperation between the us and china had drastically decreased since  when the former us president donald trump took officethe study analyzed data in three key areas stem science technology engineering and mathematics trainee mobility use of scientific works between scientists in each country and scientist productivity in each country as measured by the production of peerreviewed papersbetween  and  ethnically chinese graduate students were  percent less likely to attend a usbased phd program moreover those who did attend such programs were  percent less likely to stay in the us after graduation the study foundoutput dropsthe researchers also documented a sharp decline in chinese use of us science as measured by citations although they found no such decline in the propensity of us scientists to cite chinese researchthe trends are corroborated by the state of the science address delivered by us national academy of sciences president marcia mcnutt in junemcnutt presented data showing that the us is dropping in research output as measured by articles published while china is experiencing a tripledigit percentage increase in terms of research quality measured by the percentage of articles in the top  percent cited the us is losing ground while china has moved ahead of the european unionthe shifting landscape of scientific productivity is also reflected in the pharmaceutical industry chinas share of drugs in phase one to three trials has risen dramatically from about  percent in  to  percent in  while the us share is in decline according to mcnuttchinas number of patents per year surpassed the us around  and is now leading by a ratio of  to  as of in the corporate world china has emerged as a dominant force leading the global fortune  list with  out of  companies in  a stark contrast to its nonplayer status in those statistics underscore mcnutts conclusion that advancing the frontiers of basic research now requires international partnerships to benefit all researcherssaving livesthe importance of such partnerships is illustrated by an example provided by dasher involving a medical technology company he described a collaboration between a senior electrical engineer in silicon valley — with innovative ideas for medical image analysis — and a professor in chinachina has eight times as many medical images as the united states does so he cooperated with a professor in china and the two of them have created a company about medical image analysis to detect cancer dasher saidthats a very good use where china has data that is useful for everyone and we have a technology idea i think that kind of thing will continuethe benefits of international cooperation extend to the overall strength of the us technology sector dasher said one of the key strengths of silicon valley has been its diversity with  percent of the technical workforce born in chinaweve benefited from foreign people who come to the united states as students and continue to work here i think that its also the case where some americans may want to go to china and work in china so we need to maintain a very good safe environment for people to cooperate he emphasizedwith dwindling government investment the us industry began taking the lead around  and now dominates us research investment with a  percent share compared with the federal governments  percentthe strengths of the private sector in advancing scientific and technological development however have been challenged by the us governments national security measures aimed at containing chinas development in science and technologythe biotech industry provides a stark example of the potential consequences of decoupling many achievements under the sta such as uschina collaborations on gene editing research that have created diseaseresistant crops and improved yields are at risk of being reduced to historical footnotespatrick beyrer a researcher at the asia society policy institutes center for china analysis said a potential uschina biotech decoupling is being expedited while everyday americans arent adequately prepared for the consequenceshe cited the example of wuxi apptec as a research superstore for its us partners and wuxi biologics the secondlargest biologic outsourcer in the worldrecent policy recommendations from the us house of representatives select committee on china have described us dependence on chinese pharmaceutical supply chains as a distinct national security risk with some lawmakers proposing to block

from us supply chains would have an impact on developing treatments for critical medical conditions including hearing loss cystic fibrosis and leukemiain addition to china representing the largest and most costeffective exporter of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the us market jointly developed drugs agricultural technologies and other biotechenabled solutions have improved countless american lives he wrote in an articlethe collapse of uschina biotech partnerships would spell the end of such jointly developed innovations that harbor the potential to deliver sorely needed global public goods including saving american lives suffering from diseases such as cancer beyrer cautionedtalent crunchthe challenges faced by the biotech industry are symptomatic of a broader issue affecting uschina relations in science and technology export controls and other measures to restrict technology transfer have moved to the heart of the relationship increasing tensions between the two countries and posing significant challenges for us tech companiescraig allen president of the uschina business council criticized the us export controls for causing an intensely difficult problem for us tech companies particularly those that are in silicon valleytheres a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety and i think thats true across the board in tech allen observed during an event at stanford while visiting his organizations members in silicon valleythe semiconductor industry in particular has been hit hard by these restrictions allen said that several us chip companies have recently been banned from selling to an illdefined range of chinese customersits becoming more and more difficult to avoid that conflict of law and thereby the consequences would be terminating or severely restricting what had been a very profitable enterprise for decades he saidhe emphasized the importance of china for many technology companies both as a market and as a source of talentchinas extremely important for the tech companies many of them have a large percentage share of their total sales in china and many of them draw on that enormous chinese talent pool in china and that is not something that they can easily walk away from he saidan april report by the federal reserve bank of new york estimated that in a small subset of tech companies studied  billion of market capital was lost due to export controls when new export controls were announced employment in affected companies declined by  percentit is especially detrimental for american companies when export controls are unilateral enforced by the american government only on american companies in such cases and there are many unilateral export controls that asymmetrically hurt american firms and longterm american competitiveness said allenthese restrictions are disrupting longestablished partnerships and hindering access to crucial talent allen cited the case of a us multinational company whose lead scientist in china was denied a visa to visit his own laboratories in the usamerican companies need to access chinese talent if they are to remain globally competitive if american companies are barred from hiring chinese talent then other companies will be given a longterm structural advantage that probably over a very short period of time will impact american competitiveness he arguedthis talent crunch is exacerbated by the us dependence on international students to meet its stem workforce requirements as noted by mcnutt in her june address the narrowing channel for data flows between rd teams in china and the us is making this challenge more acute every daylooking ahead allen acknowledged the complex political landscape that companies must navigatewe live in a political world companies have to recognize that a potential future conflict between the united states and china would make it impossible for most international trade and investment to continue he saidwhile conflict is certainly not inevitable

astronauts butch wilmore and suni williams blasted into space aboard boeings starliner capsule in early june they expected their trip to last only a weekhowever three months down the line starliner undocked from the international space station and landed in new mexico on saturday minus the two astronauts who remain stranded in space because nasa deemed the starliners problems with its thrusters too fraught with risk for a crewed returndespite starliners safe return nasas commercial crew program manager steve stich said the decision not to have the astronauts on board during the crafts journey back to earth was the right onethe starliners successful return seems like pure luck as the issues it encountered could not be replicated on earth for a solution said lin luzhou assistant professor at beijing foreign studies universitys academy of regional and global governanceit points to problems in quality management an area where boeing used to excel he addeddespite the successful docking in early june and its uneventful return starliner has faced persistent issues including a failed unmanned test trip to the iss in  a doover mission in  went ahead but some thruster malfunctions remainedboeing is shifting away from being the crown jewel of us manufacturing in recent years it has prioritized profit over quality ding yifan a senior fellow at taihe institute a think tank in beijing saidcostcutting measures like outsourcing key components have further compromised standards he saidthe crashes of two boeing  max jets in  and  in indonesia and ethiopia killed  the company faced another blow when a door plug blew off during an alaska airlines flight in januaryit shows a broader decline in us manufacturing capabilities he addedfollowing its launch starliner reported helium leaks and thruster problems extending the space mission multiple times before nasa announced in august that the astronauts will only come back in february on a spacex dragon capsulenasas decision to ultimately rely on the dragon spacecraft must have come after extensive technical evaluations however the issues wont be resolved in just a couple of months lin of the academy of regional and global governance saidspace missions particularly those involving the international space station require meticulous planning and multilateral coordination he addedit is an image issue spacexs space program has indirectly benefited from nasas budget cuts over the years which led to the outsourcing of projects and the layoffs of nasa engineers — many of whom ended up working for elon musk ding of taihe institute saidboeing has a long history of working with nasa apollo  which was propelled by a boeingbuilt rocket landed on the moon in  previously ample funding supported us technological advancements however the focus has now turned to more profitable ventures and space exploration receives less support ding saidadditionally militaryindustrial complexes have shifted federal budget priorities further reducing nasas funding and diminishing its roleboeing incurred about  billion in cost overruns while developing the starliner facing repeated delays and price increases due to supply chain issues agence francepresse reportedthe current model for commercial space exploration undoubtedly starts with significant investment in research which is no longer sustainable under incumbent financing mode lin saidaccording to ding us public finances have become increasingly strained with growing debt leaving less room for discretionary spending the gross federal debt of the us has surpassed  trillion us treasury department data showednasas budget peaked during the apollo program in the s at more than  percent of the us federal budget according to the space report website it fell below  percent after  and has hovered around  percent in recent yearswhen the government budget is primarily allocated to debt repayment and military expenses public funding for space exploration — an area that isnt immediately profitable — diminishes ding saidhowever despite the constraints lin said we are witnessing a second major wave of human space exploration since the apollo program with commercial space ventures booming globallyboth established players as well as newcomers are undergoing significant transformations which will bring both opportunities and challenges he said adding that the key question is whether they can secure a competitive edge in the evolving space industrybeijing condemned on tuesday the socalled biosecure act passed by the united

buyers across latin america and reshaping views about chinese productsthe advanced technology and competitive pricing of chinese vehicles — evs as well as traditional cars — are rapidly translating into rising market share for chinas automakers in the latin american marketin  chinese carmakers sold about  billion worth of vehicles across latin america according to the international trade center by last year the value of chinese vehicles sold in the region almost quadrupled to  billion accounting for roughly  percent of the regions car marketthe quality of the cars and their price caught the attention of buyers like florencio perez romero a pilot in mexico romero recently bought a chinesemade mg rx because of the features it includes like a large touchscreen console myriad sensors and led lighting as well as an appealing panoramic sunroofthese are cool features compared to similar suvs in the market like toyota volkswagen ford and chevrolet it seemed like a good deal said romerothe price tag was another big factor for romero who noted that when all is said and done chinese vehicles end up being cheaper than similar offerings from other brandsmaking strideschinese ev makers have been making strides in global markets byd for example has topped tesla which also makes many of its cars in china as the top ev seller globallybut they are facing significant headwinds in north american and european markets which have increased their scrutiny and tariffs oxford economics noted in a reportthe us increased the import tariffs on chinamade vehicles from  percent to  percent in may and canada followed suit in late august in june the eu commission announced plans to impose tariffs on imported chinese cars and adjusted them in august for example tariffs on tesla evs manufactured in china were cut from  percent to  percent while tariffs on byd vehicles were reduced marginally from  percent to  percentin latin america meanwhile sales are flourishing from mexico all

attached to buying a chinese car make a big differencein chile in particular chinese automakers have been particularly successful both in selling cars to private buyers and providing vehicles to support infrastructure development like public transit chileans are increasingly willing to buy chinese traditional cars and evsbrands like mg maxus great wall and chery have dominated the streets with the highest sales numbers among chinese brands suggesting considerable popularity among chilean customers when buying a new vehicle said renzo burotto a historian at the university of chileaccording to the national automotive association of chile  chinamade cars were imported to the country in  reaching a market share of  percentburotto attributed the growth of chinese evs in chile partly to a free trade agreement and strong commercial ties between the two nationschinese evs are also increasingly visible in public transportation burotto pointed out that santiago the chilean capital uses more than  electric buses imported from china santiago which has the secondlargest fleet of such buses in the world outside of china has replaced more than  diesel combustion busesand there is little reason to think that buyers across latin america will not continue scooping up chinese cars and evs any concerns about the quality technology or safety of madeinchina products are fading quicklychina no longer just makes irons and blenders said burotto it is now not only manufacturing but also leading in innovation with a view to sustainable development and putting chinas

associate professor of the communication and organizational leadership department at robert morris university in pennsylvania said to china dailymoretti referred to the uschina dialogue of the financial working group fwg held in shanghai aug there exist two parallel tracks when you think of the us and china the political track is filled with all kinds of negativity from the us he said whether it be tariffs other forms of sanctions dubious legislative items or the daily negative rhetoric not much in the way of positive news comes out of that moretti saidbut the business community understands how essential it is for the us and china to find ways to keep as many doors open as possible and to ensure that optimistic dialogue exists he saidtogether we account for some  percent of

donemoretti said that green technology is good for china the us and the world so it is meaningful to make efforts to assist companies — large or small new or enjoying a long history — that create products that are costeffective and good for the environmentno matter how much the politicians criticize china they know that cooperation in areas such as pandemic research overcoming food insecurity and creating goodfortheclimate products brings positive results when china and the us are working together he saidus president joe biden has touted green initiatives but also announced new tariffs on

you say you believe in something then demonstrate a real commitment to it moretti said adding that the tariffs imposed by the biden administration on chinese evs make no sensewashington wants a healthier climate and yet it is deliberately blocking cars that are affordable of good quality and good for the globe from us consumers it defies common sense to preach a message of being climatefriendly and then slam the door on one such opportunity he saidthe west is ready to criticize whatever it is that china does he saidif the us showed a commitment to longterm strategic thinking as china has when it comes to the most modern technologies then it would enjoy strong market share for such products he said they did not so the criticism of china for doing so is weakmoretti said hat

uschina agriculture roundtable in multiple cities in china in june was nothing like what i was kind of expectingi had a lot of preconceived ideas about what to expect he told the audience on thursday at an online event to share his experiences there were times i was a little bit even apprehensive about making the trip but it turned out to be a great experienceaccording to min fan executive director of the us heartland china association ushca which organized the roundtable with several chinese agencies the delegation visited universities farms and agriculturalexperiment stations in china they enjoyed talking with their counterparts and also sightseeingwe had a wonderful enlightened trip fan saidbarlow has been to europe south america and africa and knows well the international dairy markets including chinas the trip his first to china opened his eyes to other facets of the countryand china its amazing how they have developed their own industry in the dairy world and are using much less exports than they ever have before barlow saidhe was amazed to see the work ethic in chinaeverybody is working everybody has something to do he said theres no wasteone thing he noticed is how land is used in china when we were on those bullet trains and you looked across you saw every inch of available land was in food production i thought that was fascinatingbarlow was also struck by other aspects of china i found it was obviously the cleanest and probably safest place ive ever been he saidhe said it was fascinating to see practically zero obesity in china and the citizens were very healthy and werent facing a lot of the issues that is really epidemic in our country today with obesity and things like thatthe trip led barlow to realize that it is important to keep the dialogue going its better to talk than to yell at each other and go through what the tvs sayfor olga boldentiller dean of agriculture at tuskegee university it was also her first time in chinai think what was most enlightening for me was the conversation around how the us can partner with china to really address global food security and do so from an educational standpoint she saidi like the model that china has with a few other organizations where they are partnering with developing countries to do work on the ground in china to really uplift a lot of their producers and some of the agricultural practices boldentiller saidlou swanson professor emeritus from colorado state university said he enjoyed the aspect of global citizenship from the trip at colorado state university we really think that peopletopeople studenttostudent facultytofaculty relationships are the core for having any kind of global citizenship said swansonwhat this trip did — and ive taken many delegations of students and faculty to china over the years — is the peopletopeople dimensionswanson said that trade and cultural exchanges are important to avoid misunderstandings that can lead to conflict trips

to expand cooperationthe event on tuesday was presented by the center for american progresslewis said political and economic tensions between the us and china are high and that is exactly when engagement on climate change is of the utmost importance to avoid derailing all the progress that weve made in our engagement with china over the last plus yearsshe said us engagement with china on climate change and clean energy has helped to build up chinas own capacity to track and reduce its emissions as well as its ability to promote a lowcarbon energy transitionand today we see that china has leapfrogged many other countries in these areas and our bilateral exchanges have become much more of a twoway street lewis said i also see that engagement has led to increased ambition transparency and trust between our two countriesshe said us president joe biden administrations inflation reduction act which she said moved the us in the right direction of making clean energy industries more competitive globally may have gone too far in terms of completely excluding chinese entities from participating in the us clean energy sectori think there has to be a conversation about our respective roles in global clean energy supply chains without just letting it devolve into a global trade war that will slow the lowcarbon transition globally she saidlewis visited china this summer for the first time since the pandemic meeting with chinese officials and touring chinas new clean energy manufacturing facilities she said she witnessed how china is leading the world in some aspects of green technologiesshe said there are ways that are smart and protect national security but also allow us to leapfrog and take advantage of a lot of the real impressive innovation that were seeing coming out of china lewis saidshe said the us should also have conversations with china on tough issues such as trade and research or it could risk derailing cooperation on climate changewe need to hit that headon i think its silly to make engagement on basic science a political issue lewis saidaug  marked the th anniversary of the birth of deng xiaoping the late chinese leader

even as us bonds boast higher yieldsas of july overseas institutions holdings in chinas interbank bond market had risen for  consecutive months an increase in foreign holdings of as much as  trillion yuan  billion according to data from the shanghai head office of the peoples bank of china the countrys central bankat first glance the inflow looks counterintuitive — why would investors opt for loweryielding bonds as of late august the year us treasury bonds still yielded around  percentage points more than their chinese counterparts according to market tracker wind infothe answer analysts suggest partially lies in the anticipated interest rate cuts by the united statesthe us federal reserve is expected to lower rates from the current  to  percent range to avoid a recession with chinas monetary policy to remain stable the renminbi is poised to rebound against the dollar this has set the stage for profitable exchange rate plays with the possibilities of investors converting dollars to renminbi investing in chinese bonds and locking in a profit by selling renminbi forward at a higher ratefrom october  to january  chinese bonds yielded  basis points higher on average than us bond yields of the same maturity after taking into account foreign exchange hedging according to calculations by boc internationalresilience of assetsa more fundamental reason for the inflow financial experts from home and abroad said is something beyond technical trading strategies — the growing appeal of renminbidenominated assets among international investors a trend that has withstood the headwinds of us rate hikessince the us fed started a drastic rate hike cycle in march  to combat inflation foreign holdings in chinas interbank bond market have risen they reached  billion yuan as of july with the trillionyuan inflow since september last year surpassing the outflow of  billion yuan between march  and august  according to the pbocs shanghai head officethe allure of renminbidenominated assets has been underpinned by a global shift away from overreliance on the us dollar chinas expansive economic ties and the countrys ongoing financial openingup the experts saidthese factors they said will continue to help the renminbis ascent as an international currency strengthening its reserve payment financing and pricing functions and offering a winwin for the global economydemand for diversification of reserves away from the us dollar remains strong globally driven by geopolitical economic and financial dynamics said massimiliano castelli head of strategy for official institutions at ubs asset managementwe believe the dollar is and will remain for the foreseeable future the main store of value for global investors including reserve managers however currency diversification is set to continue in the future as the world gradually moves toward a multipolar systemthe renminbi looks set to continue its steady rise in global foreign exchange reserves in particular if it is supported by an improvement in the chinese economy the ongoing rise in the use of the renminbi in crossborder payments and the more widespread use of the digital yuan said castellizhu min former deputy managing director of the international monetary fund said the world sees that a dominant us dollar is not necessarily a good thing for the whole world because us monetary policy and fiscal policy may have a big impact on the dollars value and capital movementshaving a more balanced force against the dollar is good for the whole world so i think the renminbi will continue to internationalize to serve that role not only for china but for the whole world and particularly for international financial architecture zhu saidthe worlds pursuit of alternative international currencies to the greenback including the renminbi has accelerated after the us froze the russian central banks foreign exchange reserves and removed several russian financial institutions from the swift messaging system in  in the wake of the russiaukraine conflictshaky greenbackzhang ming deputy director of the institute of finance and banking which is part of the chinese academy of social sciences said the weaponization of the dollar has presented an important opportunity for renminbi internationalizationmany countries have realized that it is dangerous to rely solely on the greenback said zhang who is also deputy director of the national institution for finance and developmentin july the renminbis share in global payments measured by value hit a record  percent swift data showed it remained the fourth most active currency for global payments by value for the ninth consecutive monththe chinese currency was the secondlargest global currency in the trade finance market for the second consecutive month with a market share of  percent in julyas the world has sought systems other than swift the crossborder interbank payment system or cips which specializes in renminbi crossborder payment and clearing has grown in popularity in july two direct and six indirect participants were added to cips by the end of july there were  direct participants and  indirect participants in the systeman increasing number of economies are also experimenting with central bank digital currencies or cbdcs in crossborder payments which can not only bypass the swift system but enjoy a faster settlement speed than the traditional agent bank system as a third party intermediary is no longer requiredearlier this year saudi arabia joined project mbridge a crossborder platform for experimenting with cbdcs — including the digital yuan — for international trade as the sixth full participantproject mbridge resulted from collaboration starting in  between the bank for international settlements innovation arm the bank of thailand the central bank of the united arab emirates the digital currency institute of the pboc and the hong kong monetary authorityglobal domestic challengesgeopolitical dynamics however can be a doubleedged sword experts said with the wall street journal reporting in april that the us was drafting sanctions that threaten to cut some chinese banks off from the global financial systema survey by ubs asset management of  central banks which manage about half of the global foreign exchange reserves showed that  percent of them believed that uschina tensions had not yet affected the internationalization trend of the renminbi thirtynine percent said it had slowed it down and  percent said the tensions had accelerated the trendzhang from cass identified the us suppression of china as a key challenge facing the renminbis internationalization this is in addition to domestic challenges such as economic growth slowing the yields of financial products declining and domestic financial risks becoming more apparentwhile ramping up efforts to boost economic growth china can further internationalize the renminbi through three main tasks zhang said they are improving the currencys function in commodity pricing providing more highquality renminbi financial assets to overseas investors via both onshore and offshore markets and stepping up the development of cipshe said since the pboc began promoting renminbi internationalization in  it has made significant progress over the past  years — the renminbi now holds about a  percent share in international transactions and  to  percent in global reserves the area that remains relatively weak is pricingto further strengthen the renminbis pricing function china — as a major buyer and seller of commodities — can promote renminbi pricing in the trade of commodities such as iron ore copper and natural gas zhang said he cited the example of shanghais launch of an international crude oil futures market denominated in renminbi in  which has grown rapidly into the third largest of its kind in the worldthe resolution adopted at the third plenary session of the th central committee of the communist party of china in july said that efforts should be made to steadily and prudently advance the internationalization of the renminbi and develop offshore renminbi marketsit also said the country would push forward the development of a homegrown controllable crossborder payment system and make steady progress in the rd and application of the digital renminbizhang said cips would serve as a backup option for china and the world particularly if geopolitical conflicts continue to escalate and the us imposes further financial sanctions not only china but also the european union india and saudi arabia are looking for new payment and settlement systems we are providing these countries with a second or third option as well he saidattracting participantsefforts are needed to boost the number of banks directly participating in cips the more direct participants there are the stronger the network will become and the faster payment and settlement will be zhang saidproject mbridge may assume greater importance going forward as an alternative and more efficient option for global payment and settlement he addedxiong aizong a senior research fellow at cass institute of world economics and politics said there is room for development concerning offshore renminbi clearing which can increase the crossborder trade and use of the yuanlast year renminbi clearing banks or arrangements were established in brazil pakistan serbia cambodia and other economies which greatly promoted the use of renminbi by enterprises and financial institutions in these economies for crossborder transactions xiong saiddeepening highlevel financial openingup to expand the channels for foreign investment in renminbi assets is also key to internationalizing the currency he said the bond connect program launched in  the improved qualified foreign institutional investor mechanisms and the swap connect market access scheme launched last year have all added to the currencys appeal to international investors xiong addedpan gongsheng governor of the pboc said in an interview with peoples daily in august that the central bank will promote renminbi internationalization by adhering to marketdriven and voluntary principles continue to improve crossborder renminbi policies optimize the global layout of renminbi clearing banks and promote the healthy development of the offshore renminbi marketsin line with pans remarks the pboc in august inked a memorandum of understanding with vietnams central bank for bilateral local currency swaps which can facilitate crossborder trade and investment in the renminbi by the end of  the pboc had entered into agreements with over  central banks for bilateral local currency swaps totaling  trillion yuanpan added that the central bank will keep the renminbi exchange rate generally stable at a reasonable balanced levelhuang yiping dean of peking universitys national school of development said china should also consider providing commercialized investments lowcost funding and government aid to developing economies to help them bridge the funding gap in achieving a green transitionsuch a scheme would be comparable to the ussponsored marshall plan to rebuild postworld war ii europe but with a focus on green development the scheme would be a winwin as it would facilitate the global

broader asian american community the figure rises to  percent according to the latest data from the us census bureauthe candidates whether for mayor or supervisors all hope to get chinese american voters support because we have become an important voting bloc that they could not afford to ignore louis lam chairman of the american teo chew business association and a board member of the chinatown nonprofit chinese newcomers center told china dailythe current mayoral race exemplifies the heightened focus on chinese american voters incumbent mayor london breed facing a challenging reelection bid has seen her approval rate shift dramatically among this demographic which played an important role in her previous electiona poll conducted by the san francisco chronicle in february revealed that  percent of potential asian voters disapprove of breeds performance and only  percent support herrecognizing the need to regain favor with chinese american voters the mayor has taken actions such as increasing the police budget granting law enforcement more authority addressing homeless encampments and even embarking on a trip to chinaduring her april visit to china breed signed an agreement to bring a pair of pandas to the san francisco zoo a move that resonated strongly with chinese american advocates she also lobbied for the restoration of direct flights between china and san francisco international airport which had been disrupted during the pandemicthose efforts appear to be paying dividends a recent chronicle poll indicated that breeds approval rating among asian voters doubled over the past six months the resurgence in support from the asian and chinese american communities has bolstered her standing in the mayoral racehowever breeds challengers are not ceding ground in the battle for chinese american votesformer san francisco supervisor mark farrell one of breeds main rivals recently secured a crucial endorsement from the san francisco chinese american democratic club — an organization that had previously backed breed in her last mayoral campaignfarrell has been a frequent presence at community events in chinatown distributing chineselanguage flyers and engaging with potential voters his campaign platform emphasizes cracking down on street homelessness and drug use issues that resonate strongly with many chinese american residentsanother prominent challenger daniel lurie founder of an antipoverty nonprofit and heir to the levi strauss fortune has taken a strategic approach to courting chinese american voterslurie has hired a chinese american campaign manager and enlisted chinese american activists to bolster his outreach efforts his campaign has been marked by personal interactions with chinese american residents visiting them in their homes and

chinese american campaign manager to strengthen ties with the citys chinese communitythe intense focus on chinese american voters in this election cycle is no coincidence political consultant jim ross emphasized the critical nature of the demographic saying to san francisco news website mission local it will be very challenging for any candidate to win without getting the most votes from that coalitionthe political engagement of san franciscos chinese american community has reached new heights driven by several factors said lam who attributed the surge to the communitys increasing education levels and a growing awareness of their voting powerall the people i know have realized the importance of casting ballots even those who do not read or speak english their children who are well educated can help them he saidthe successful recall elections in  which replaced several progressive school board members in the city and the liberal district attorney chesa boudin served as a watershed moment demonstrating the communitys ability to effect change through the ballot box he saideconomic concerns and public safety issues remain at the forefront for many chinese american voters as lam pointed out a significant portion of the community consists of small and mediumsized business owners or workingclass individuals who are acutely affected by the citys economic challenges and crime rateits tragic that many businesses in fishermans wharf remain closed and an office tower downtown was sold nearly  percent less than the price about a decade ago said lam adding that it was why he switched his support from breed five years ago to farrell and lurie for the upcoming electionan increasing number of chinese students and tech professionals are expressing their alarm on social

peopletopeople exchangeschinese student chen guo not his real name began his journey to boston massachusetts in  after he was accepted by harvard medical school however his academic dream quickly turned into a nightmare when on arrival in the us city he was subjected to an hour secondary inspection by us customs and border protection officerssharing his harrowing experience on chinese social media platform xiaohongshu earlier this year chen described how the officers scrutinized his emails and online browsing history and chat recordsthe ordeal reached its climax when they discovered a screenshot of a news photo celebrating a successful chinese satellite launch in his digital album despite his legally obtained visa chens entry was denied and he was unceremoniously deportedthey made me stand against a wall with a measuring scale for a photo isnt that how criminals are photographed chen said i never thought i would face such mental humiliationtwo weeks after chen was deported he received a collect parcel from the us which charged him  in postal fees and contained his electronic devices seized by us customsa chinese employee surnamed liu from an international internet company specializing in short video services shared a similar ordeal through his wechat public accountliu had thought he was on a routine business trip departing from guarulhos international airport in sao paulo brazil on march  he wrote in his wechat social media account life has become increasingly simple in middle age and a single backpack is enough for a fiveday business trip across continentshowever his experience at the border in houston texas shattered his relaxed and cheerful mood after getting off the planea cbp officer subjected him to the secondary inspection area at george bush intercontinental airport lius electronic devices were seized and he was interrogated for over  hoursthey asked me if i and my company were engaged in data theft spreading sensitive information and connected to chinese governments liu saidlius valid visa was eventually revoked despite his role in company logistics strategy leading to his deportation from the us and a severe blow to his career liu later learned from a cbp officer that his sufferings arose because his name was similar to that of a chinese scientistthe secondary inspection area is referred to as the small dark room on chinese social media although interviewees clarify it is not literally small or dark but labeled so due to the harassment and oppressive atmospheremore than  chinese students from computerrelated fields have been subjected to unwarranted harassment scrutiny and deportation by us authorities according to latest accountsmost were graduate students whose research areas included artificial intelligence information science cybersecurity electrical engineering software engineering and electronic information engineeringwhen the students applied for their visas the us side would have done the necessary security background checks that is to say they passed the security risk screening to get the visa said wu xinbo dean of fudan universitys institute of international studies and director of the center for american studies at fudan universitybut now even if you get a visa it is highly possible that you can be refused entry and deported when you enter the us which is not reasonableshi yinhong director of the center on american studies at renmin university of china said that these absurd incidents have been on the rise amid the escalating china threat rhetoric with the us increasingly viewing china as its main competitorshi said that the focus on national security signals a rise in protectionism and underscores us insecurity about advancements in science and technologywu from fudan university said the political motivation behind the phenomenon is clear — it aims to control and restrict cultural exchanges between the two countries for national security directly leading to a decline in peopletopeople interactionsmany online discussion forums have been organized through chinese social media platforms to address the concerns with students sharing their educational backgrounds and internship experiences and asking whether their academic credentials might affect their visa applications and entryfor students majoring in business and data at my university will there be issues with visa approvals i believe my major isnt sensitive but im worried that pursuing this degree might be futile asked one forum participantdepends on your luck replied another forum userchen the student who was heading to harvard medical school advised through his social media account that chinese students from universities identified as sensitive by the us should consider refraining from pursuing studies or postdoctoral positions in the countrya student surnamed chou who graduated in  from the university of california san diego said the us has long claimed to be a lighthouse of openness and inclusiveness but its actions run into the opposite directioncompared to the risk of being inspected and deported during each trip to and from the us it is a wiser choice to pursue higher education outside the us chou saidwe have already witnessed a significant decrease in the number of chinese students studying in the us over the past two years and this downward trend is expected to persist fudan universitys wu saidaccording to the open doors report on international educational exchange while china remains the largest source of international students in the us the total number has dropped from  to  in the past four years india surpassed china to become the largest source of international graduate students in  the proportion of chinese students in engineering fields is also decreasing annuallya source from an overseas study consultancy firm in shanghai said that us visa rejection rates for doctoral students in hightech fields are notably high even when they are not rejected the students face rigorous scrutiny prompting many to seek study opportunities in other countries like britain singapore and australia or at european universitiesexperts said that under the pretext of safeguarding national security us law enforcement authorities have overstretched the concept of national security and arbitrarily interrogated and repatriated chinese students which has caused a chilling effect and seriously affected the atmosphere of peopletopeople exchanges between the two countriesthe us attitude toward cultural and educational exchanges might be influenced by the us election and political situation said wu from fudan university adding that the us should act responsibly and be more open and inclusive in

sidestepping tariffs but also sparking a surge in local investment and job creation china daily looks at how international politics and economics are intertwining to drive significant shifts in manufacturing and tradewhen you buy drinks from mcdonalds wendys or dunkin the straws and cups you use are likely from a chinese company while the drinks are either produced in mexico or the united states and are a product of a complex trilateral trade relationshipafter former us president donald trump imposed tariffs on chinese imports and restricted chinese investments starting in march  the company making the cups fuling plastics began to face tariffs on many of its productsas a result fuling moved a factory to indonesia around  it also moved some production to monterrey mexico and then fuling opened a factory in pennsylvaniafuling plastics is not the only chinese company moving factories to north america amid rising uschina geopolitical tensionsmonterrey is the capital of nuevo leon a state in northern mexico chinese corporations last year were responsible for more than  percent of the foreign investment in the state second only to the us at  percent the new york times reporteda lot of our customers that are close to the border of mexico can take advantage of competitive pricing and shorter lead times not only do we avoid the tariffs coming out of china but customers within a reasonable distance of monterrey can enjoy the same type of products manufactured in mexico at a fairly competitive price tom melchiorre president of direct link usa a joint venture of fuling plastics told china dailythe company currently has about  employees in mexico operating out of a facility of  square feet  square meters but soon it will expand to more than  square feet and about  employees only the management is from china while all other employees are mexicanthe ministry of economy of nuevo leon reported that the state received  billion in investments from october  to april  creating  new jobsthe mexican ministry of economy recorded  foreign direct investment announcements in  worth  billion the us led with  billion followed by china with  billionin  chinas direct investment in mexico rose  percent yearonyear chinese companies now represent the fastestgrowing source of foreign investment in mexicothe trend of chinese investment in mexico started around  and will likely continue as the us imposes more tariffs on chinese products and industriesthe increasing tariffs from the us have been imposed on items from china such as solar panels electric vehicles and ev batteries which have led to shipping costs rising about six times melchiorre saidwhen youre producing commodity products and shipping costs rise that much your product is now  to  percent higher so i think it becomes more and more attractive to manufacture in mexico as we continue to face these challenges melchiorre saidmexicos exports to the us last year surpassed chinas for the first time in two decades a development linked to the political tensions between china and the us however the trade relationship between china and the us is resilient even under strained conditionsresearchers analyzed the evolution of the trilateral trade relationship between mexico the us and china from  to  and found that in general for every  percent increase in mexicos exports to the us mexicos imports from china increased by  percentxuedong liu professor of economics and engineering at the national autonomous university of mexico noted that since  about half of the us trade surplus with mexico has been offset by a growing deficit with china making mexico a key assembly hub for north america and china an influential player in the regions tradecosteffective goodsmexico chose chinese products not for political reasons but for their high costeffectiveness and the lack of substitutes from other countries liu told china dailythe primary reason is that mexicos local supply chain is not robust enough to meet all its needs to increase exports to the us mexico must also increase its imports these imports dont necessarily have to come from china they could come from other countries he saidhowever mexico ultimately chooses chinese products due to their competitive pricing this choice isnt driven by any specific policy or political measure but by market economicschinese products offer better value for money compared to those from other countries if this werent the case local manufacturers in mexico would opt for imports from countries like vietnam indonesia or brazil however these countries either lack competitive pricing or a complete supply chain for certain products liu addedthe joe biden administration in july announced new tariffs on imports of mexican steel containing chinese components the us will now impose a  percent tariff on such steel the same rate imposed on steel from china previously mexican steel with chinese components was exempt from dutythese tariffs that the united states put in place specifically to try to prevent metals that come from china from entering their country represent a risk for mexican exports because part of the exports are produced in china and not in mexico and in the short term it is very unlikely that mexico will be able to change that so those commodities are produced here ana azuara commodity markets specialist at grupo financiero base told bnamericas an online source of daily business information and intelligence on latin americathe tariffs were costly for mexico and to compensate for the economic toll the us and mexico agreed that steel imported from brazil that is processed in mexico and then exported to the us will not be subject to tariffs liu saidbut brazilian steel is not as costeffective as chinese steel it is currently very difficult to estimate the potential economic impact on mexico he saidunlike vietnam and malaysia mexico has a stronger industrial base to manufacture its own products especially after joining the north american free trade agreement nafta the predecessor to the usmca in usmca is a free trade agreement between the us mexico and canada which replaced nafta in still mexico faces challenges with its supply chain lacking intermediate and capital goods which limits its export capacity so to increase exports mexico needs to increase imports liu saidmexico is now importing more products from china which used to come from north america in   percent of mexicos imports in electronics such as mobile phones auto parts and motor vehicles came from china sectors where the us was traditionally the main supplier according to americas quarterly a nonprofit publicationsome believe that in the contest between the two major powers the us and china mexico has not yet found a strategy to address the increasingly complex trilateral trade relationship caught between uschina trade dynamics mexicos relationship with china has become more politically complicatedin january  the us mexico and canada established a committee to substitute imports from asia with products manufactured in north americabefore  trade between china and mexico was primarily driven by mutual benefit and market principles liu saidsince  bilateral trade between china and mexico has not only been influenced by economic and market factors but also political ones liu said he said that it is a new characteristic of the trade relationshipmexico welcomes chinese investment in  ahead of his visit to china former mexican foreign minister marcelo ebrard said the country wants to deepen economic ties with china by increasing its exports and attracting more chinese investmentebrard told reporters via a video link from the group of  summit in osaka japan in  that he would be prioritizing the expansion of business ties during his visit to chinawhat were interested in is increasing mexicos presence in china mexicos capacity to export to china and chinas investments in mexico he said according to reutersthe structural reasons that are bringing capital to mexico are here to stay said juan carlos baker pineda mexicos former viceminister for external trade i have no indication that the trade war between china and the us is going to diminish any time soonwhile the chinese origin of the capital coming into mexico may be uncomfortable for the policies of some countries according to international trade legislation those products are to all intents and purposes mexican the bbc quoted him as sayingciting examplesan example of such products is mexicos auto manufacturing industry in  tesla announced plans to establish a factory in mexico which attracted a large number of suppliers to the countrymany of those suppliers were already producing components or raw materials for tesla in china the chinese auto parts makers are rapidly setting up plants on the outskirts of monterrey where tesla plans its manufacturing plantwhile made in mexico is gaining ground in the north american market chinese companies still hold an advantage due to their stronger technical and supply chain foundations experts saidmexico now aims to strengthen local supply chains and increase production value but this has been a longstanding issue while china has invested heavily in technology and research over the past  years mexico has not making it difficult to achieve these goals quickly liu saidmost of the companies going to mexico are bringing skills that we dont currently have in mexico jose luis enciso business intelligence director for keno consulting in beijing told china daily this will benefit us by introducing new skills and creating new suppliers it will also benefit the chinese investors because they will gain access to a new market and become more efficientmeanwhile it is not easy for chinese companies capital and technology to enter the mexican marketgoing to mexico has helped reduce lead times which is an advantage for our customers not having such a long lead time coming from china youre cutting your lead time from  days to  days to two weeks so there are a lot of advantages to producing in mexico melchiorre saidthere also are some disadvantages resin the raw material for melchiorres companys products is more expensive in mexico he said compared with china the cost of labor also is higher in mexico and shipping is very expensive especially when the company produces and ships throughout north americathe further north we go the more expensive and less competitive we are out of mexico melchiorre saidcultural differences are another issue for chinese companies operating in mexico there are not many latin americans who speak chinese and not many chinese who have spanish skills and industry experiencethat can lead to misunderstandings and make it difficult for companies to understand the local context said enciso whose company provides consulting services for chinese businesses entering mexicowhile mexican companies are accustomed to working with european and us firms integrating chinese companies can be challenging that is due to the need for local expertise in engineering legal and accounting services which also must align with the practices of chinese companies enciso addedenciso who also served as minister counselor for trade affairs at mexicos embassy in china remains positive about the future development of economic and trade relations between the two countrieswhile we dont have a free trade agreement in place mexico and china have developed a very good economic and policy dialogue over the past  years he saidthe recent efforts to strengthen ties between china and mexico involve multiple sectorschina southern airlines announced a direct route from shenzhen to mexico city in may and hainan airlines resumed direct flights between beijing and tijuana and mexico city in julythe connectivity is really going to help enhance peopletopeople exchanges enciso saidseveral major ocean carriers have opened new chinatomexico trade routes in recent months at the government level mexican tourism secretary miguel torruco visited china in july which led to support from both governments to continue strengthening bilateral relationshipscertainly the global policy environment will continue to evolve unfortunately with more protectionist measures and security concerns however i believe its only a matter of time until common ground is found to recognize the positive aspects of increasing trade and investment enciso saidin the world of beauty yuesai kan has dedicated decades of her

from around the world have told us president joe biden that broad economic sanctions imposed by the united states amount to collective punishment and violate international law and that it should endin a letter addressed to biden the signers called for the us to comply with the international law by ending the use of broad unilateral coercive measures that extensively harm civilian populationsthe letter said the unilateral application of certain economic sanctions by washington constitutes collective punishment which is considered a war crime and prohibited by the geneva conventionscollective punishment has become a standard practice of us foreign policy through sanctions and the us imposes them more than any other country the letter saidwhile the use of sanctions is different from conventional warfare its collective impact on civilians can be just as indiscriminate punitive and deadly the signatories saidhundreds of millions of people currently live under the sanctions and notable cases include cuba iran syria and venezuelathe sanctions can spark and prolong economic crisis hinder access to essential goods like food fuel and medicine and increase poverty hunger disease and even death rates especially among the children the letter saidcivilian suffering is not merely an incidental cost of sanction policies but it is also the intent the letter said it cited comments by mike pompeo former us secretary of state about the effectiveness of the donald trump administrations sanctions against iran he said things are much worse for the iranian people and were convinced that will lead the iranian people to rise up and change the behavior of the regimeus officials are aware that sanctions cause sufferingconditions induced by sanctions often drive mass migration as in cuba and venezuela recentlyhuman rights groups have said that more than  million people — about  percent of venezuelas population — have fled the south american country in the past decadethe letter echoes a recent report by michael fakhri a united nations special rapporteur who spent two weeks in venezuela to assess the situationeconomic crisisi saw firsthand how unilateral coercive measures in the form of economic sanctions have constrained the governments fiscal ability to implement their social protection programs and deliver basic public services fakhri wrote in his reportnearly  percent of venezuelans live in poverty based on income levels and  percent are exposed to extreme poverty with insufficient income to purchase a basic food basketfakhri also recommended lifting sanctions on

yearoveryear according to the reportbeijing  for ramona klein a yearold native indian woman in america hunger physical punishment and forced labor are all she can remember about a former north dakota native boarding school at which she stayed beginning at the age of sevenduring her stay klein was frequently punished by kneeling on the broom handles and was beaten all over her body with a short paddle by the wardenits a lifelong scar its a lifelong wound she saidkleins experience epitomizes the tragic history of aboriginal americans the us interior department recently released an investigative report showing that at least  native american children died between  and  while attending us governmentrun or supported boarding schoolsmany of those children were abused in boarding schools forced to convert their beliefs and punished for speaking their native languages leaving lasting damage to aboriginal communitiesa war on aboriginal childrensince the enactment of the civilization fund act in  the united states has established native boarding schools on a large scale across the country forcing native children to enroll and destroy their cultural rootsthe conditions in these schools were deplorable and many children were subjected to physical punishment and sexual abuse at school some dying as a resultthe us interior departments report showed that at least  cemeteries had been discovered at  former boarding school sites across the united states for the burial of children who died while at schoolnative american boarding schools are a gruesome chapter in american history said american scholar barbara landis i dont think theres any way to whitewash thatsimilar scenarios played out in canada as well native children were taken most of the time by coerce to native residential schools characterized by poor hygiene physical abuse and hard laboraccording to a report released by canadas truth and reconciliation commission between the s and the s the canadian government established  residential schools to which at least  aboriginal children were forcibly sent and more than  were abused and killed at school there are more than  unmarked graves near the former sites of aboriginal residential schools in many parts of canadathose schools were a war on aboriginal children said survivor doris youngin australia to assimilate aboriginal people the australian government instituted a series of policies in the early th century that allowed authorities in some federal states to take aboriginal children from their parents at any time and for any reason and send them to native boarding schools in these places native children were forced to perform heavy physical labor and endure inhuman abusea report released by the australian government in  estimated that between  and  about onethird of native children were sent to boarding schools in australia dubbed the stolen generationdont try to tell me this wasnt genocidefrom the moment european colonizers set foot on the american continent they viewed native peoples as an obstacle to their plundering and a threat to the colonies to drive out these savages the colonists waged wars against the native indians killing and displacing them however war proved costly for the colonists so the first president of the united states george washington and others suggested that bloodshed could be minimized by forcing the native americans to assimilate into white culturein  carl schurz then us secretary of the interior said that the cost of educating a native indian child was far less than killing a native indian in a war investing in establishing more boarding schools was not only a philanthropic act but also the truest and wisest economyin the late s the us government opened the first boarding school for native indian children the carlisle indian industrial school whose founder richard henry pratt was the original author of the infamous slogan kill the indian in him and save the man over the next halfcentury nearly  aboriginal children attended the schoolthe canadian government inspired by the united states followed suit in establishing residential schools throughout the country and prohibited native children from entering other schoolsthe boarding schools in the united states and canada committed cultural genocide against the uncivilized aboriginal people under the guise of eradicating their savage indigenous cultures and rescuing themdont try to tell me this wasnt genocide survivor ben sherman said they went after our language our culture our family ties our land they succeeded on almost every leveldata from the statistics canada  census shows that most of canadas over  aboriginal languages are on the verge of disappearing with only  percent of aboriginal people being able to speak their native languages fluentlystolen landmany have noticed the sins of aboriginal boarding schools but rarely discussed the motive behind the policy of cultural genocidethe report of the canadian truth and reconciliation commission offered a clear answer  the government wished to divest itself of its legal and financial obligations to aboriginal people and gain control over their land and resourcesaccording to the statistics of american researchers from  to  the us government plundered about  square kilometers of land from the native indians through unequal agreements excessive expropriation or massacrethe period of the greatest expansion of the boarding school system coincided with the colossal theft of indigenous land said brenda child a professor at the university of minnesota in the united statesthe land taken from the native indians along with its underground resources was allocated by the government to public institutions such as colleges and universitiesprofessor childs university of minnesota was one of the institutions built on the stolen land according to a report released by the us news portal grist in february since its establishment in  the university of minnesota has taken more than  square kilometers of land from aboriginal tribes through relevant legislationthe university reaps huge benefits by renting or selling land grazing mining and other activities between  and  those lands produced more than  million us dollars in revenue primarily through leases for mining iron and taconite the report saidaustralia which is vast and sparsely populated has long been recognized by colonists as terra nullius  meaning land belonging to no one they deprived the aborigines of their ownership of land through legislation and occupied their land by expulsion and confiscationin the process of land looting by colonists many native australians were killed while those who survived lost their food sources as they were deprived of land for agricultural productionaccording to a study by australian researchers the first nations population went from an estimated  to  million before the invasion in  to less than  by the early slingering traumathe traumatic experience at boarding schools not only caused lifelong trauma but also had a lasting impact on the next generation of indigenous communitiesour people are still suffering our youths are suffering our children are still being born into very dysfunctional families that were created because of the irs indian residential school system so now we have a whole host of problems said dawn mcintyre a descendant of a survivor of the former beauval indian residential school in saskatchewan in central canadaresidential schools have destroyed indigenous cultures and family structures and the experiences of abuse have left indigenous people suffering from depression violence and drug addictioncanadian studies indicated that the lack of formal education in residential schools has resulted in lower literacy skills among the indigenous people which leads to lower income levels and higher rates of crime and suicide another canadian study found that children of residential school survivors are at greater risk of sexual and alcohol abuseit continues to go through generations and it continues to snowball and it takes a really great deal of effort for a person to lift themselves out of that mcintyre saidindigenous communities in the united states and australia also suffered from the lingering effects of the boarding school systemformer boarding school attendees were more likely to have chronic physical health conditions including diabetes and they had nearly four times the risk of any type of cancer as those who were not subjected to boarding schools according to a study by ursula bear an assistant professor of population health at the university of north dakotanotably bear also found that someone whose father attended a native boarding school had more possibilities of having chronic physical health problems than someone whose father did not attendaustralian government statistics showed that the average life expectancy of indigenous australians is over eight years lower than that of nonindigenous australians with higher rates of infant mortality obesity unemployment and suicideaccording to australian researcher patrick wolfe invasion is a structure not an event the suffering of the indigenous communities is not only from the past but still being perpetuated todaycompulsory residential boarding school education has had profound consequences for several generations of american indians said bearaugust introductionthe national endowment for democracy ned acts as the us governments white gloves it has long engaged

associate administrator for nasas space operations mission directorate said that we could take either path either returning the astronauts on starliner or seeking an alternative method of using spacexon june  astronauts butch wilmore and sunita williams were launched to the iss as part of starliners first crewed test flight and multiple technical problems have since occurredthe issues plaguing starliner include failures in the reaction control system rcs thrusters which are crucial for the spacecrafts maneuverability and safe return to earth and helium leaks in the propulsion system these problems have raised concerns about the capsules safety and reliabilitythe space agency is seriously considering a backup plan involving a spacex crew dragon capsule to bring the two back to earth this contingency could extend their stay in space to approximately eight months with a potential return date around february  according to wednesdays briefingsteve stich manager of nasas

then as we got closer and got a little bit more data we started to put a few more things in placethe starliner issues have broader implications for nasas commercial crew program the agency has long emphasized the importance of having multiple providers for crew transportation to ensure redundancy and continuous access to the iss spacex has been successfully ferrying astronauts to and from the

participating in fluid physics studies to understand how to manage liquids without gravityadditionally they have been involved in routine maintenance tasks including some less glamorous chores like toilet maintenance they also had to take emergency precautions when a defunct russian satellite broke apart near the iss forcing them to prepare for a potential evacuationa final decision on whether to proceed with the starliner return or switch to the spacex backup plan is expected by midaugust until then wilmore and williams will continue their extended stay aboard the issargentinas economic

justices binding code of conduct for the supreme court according to the fact sheetfirstly biden called for a constitutional amendment that makes clear no president is above the law or immune from prosecution for crimes committed while in officethis came in response to the courts july  ruling which determined that presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts performed while in office a decision related to a case involving former president donald trump who was indicted by a federal grand jury for his efforts to overturn the  electionsecondly biden supported a system in which the president would appoint a justice every two years to spend  years in active service on the supreme court currently supreme court justices serve lifetime appointments on the courtduring his tenure

those ambitious goals the state is turning its attention to offshore wind powerin california we have zero offshore wind today  right now china is far ahead of the us on the offshore wind industry daniel kammen a professor of energy at the university of california berkeley and director of its renewable and appropriate energy laboratory saidcalifornia has designated two zones for offshore wind farms — one in humboldt bay in the north and another in central california offshore wind is exciting because it can be permitted more quickly and serves as a battery for the grid kammen saidoffshore wind can complement the production cycles of solar and onland wind energy that characteristic is particularly valuable as solar production quickly diminishes when the sun sets requiring system operators to replace those megawatts with other sources in real time to maintain grid stabilityit also offers flexibility in energy production capable of generating electricity during peak demand and producing hydrogen or methanol during periods of low electricity prices that flexibility presents huge opportunities to decarbonize sectors that have traditionally been difficult to transition to clean energy kammen saidthe state can directly apply some of chinas practices he said the best way to apply it is not just to read about it but to actually get partners from chinacalifornia has already taken such steps by inviting engineering groups from norway the state is also exploring opportunities in fuel cells hydrogen production and other offshore renewable energy sources such as tidal and wave power those areas promise rich opportunities for knowledge exchange and collaboration with chinese partners who have wide experience in the fields kammen addedcalifornia and china have

before it was deployed security experts saythe latest version of its falcon sensor software was meant to make crowdstrike clients systems more secure against hacking by updating the threats it defends

and government offices were disrupted we currently estimate that crowdstrikes update affected  million windows devices microsoft said in a blog post on saturdaycrowdstrike released information to fix affected systems but experts said getting them back online would take time as it required manually weeding out the flawed codewhat it looks like is potentially the vetting or the sandboxing they do when they look at code maybe somehow this file was not included in that or slipped through said steve cobb chief security officer at security scorecard in new york which also had some systems affected by the issueproblems came to light quickly after the update was rolled out on friday and users posted pictures on social media of computers with blue screens displaying error messagespatrick wardle a security researcher specializing in studying threats against operating systems said his analysis identified the code responsible for the outagethe updates problem was in a file that contains either configuration information or signatures he said such signatures are code that detects specific types of malicious code or malwareits very common that security products update their signatures like once a day  because theyre continually monitoring for new malware and because they want to make sure that their customers are protected from the latest threats he saidthe frequency of updates is probably the reason why crowdstrike didnt test it as much he saidit is unclear how that faulty code got into the update and why it was not detected before being released to customersideally this would

the forecast for china had risen from  percent for  and  percent for  compared with the april outlookand this revision was in part based on stronger consumption numbers in the first quarter of the year stronger exports also and that led us to that revision he saidone of the reasons is that we expect that the new program which is called trading and equipment upgrade put in place by the chinese authority will help boost consumption and investment and growth at the same time said jeanmarc natal who is the deputy chief of the world economic studies division in the imfs research departmentwe

vulnerable to new shocks gourinchas in a blog on the july  weo called the us a concerning example and that at full employment it maintains a fiscal stance that pushes its debttogdp ratio steadily higher with risks to both the domestic and global economythe weo report also warned that inflation risks have increased with services prices holding up disinflation which increases the prospect of interest rates staying elevated longer in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertaintywe see an explosion in the number of traderestrictive measures gourinchas said noting that the measures include export restrictions and industrial policies and both may lead to retaliationone concern we have is that going forward this will weigh down on global activity he saidthe report also said that a resurgence of tariffs could lead to retaliation and a costly race to the bottomso lets remember that when we look at the assessment of for instance the previous rounds of tariffs that have been imposed by countries very often the cost assessment finds that its the country that imposes the tariffs that bear the cost of these tariffs he said and so it hurts the domestic

raised public concern about immigration and the farright alternative for deutschland party or afd is continuing to make political ground by campaigning heavily on the issue of migration controlscholzs threeparty coalition government comprising the social democrats greens and free democrats recently held talks with political opponents to try and find common ground over the topic but the opposition christian democrats or cdu said it would not take part in any more meetingsthere is no country in the world with a shrinking working population that has economic growth that is the truth we are confronted with scholz told members of the countrys parliament the bundestagbut while continuing to stress the importance of welcoming outsiders he also made it clear that there must be tighter controls than those employed by previous governmentswe are a country that offers protection to those who are politically persecuted who are running for their lives who have to save their lives and that is in our constitution and we are not putting that up for debate he said openness to the world is therefore necessary but openness to the world does not mean that anyone who wants to can come we must be able to choose who comes to germany i say that quite explicitly herescholz accused opposition groups including the cdu of sloganeering not getting anything done and he said the party was seeking to make publicity out of the issue without trying to resolve itcdu leader friedrich merz said scholzs proposals lacked substance and that is why we are not entering into an endless loop of talks with youbut scholz replied we will never slam a door you can always come back to discussionsat the same time as calling for tougher measures however merz did concede that germany needs to welcome outsiders for its economic and social healthgermany must remain an open and foreignfriendly country he said and wary of the rise of the afd he added that the cdu stands clearly and

a think tank specializing in european issues on friday on the french tv channel france infohowever as the oldest prime minister in the history of the fifth republic barniers challenge will be to remain in office as long as possible and avoid being overthrown he is expected to win  seats with support from macrons coalition  seats the lr  seats and the centrist liot group  seats this total

temporary foreign workers in regions with an unemployment rate of  percent or higherthe policy announced on aug  will go into effect on sept a un report issued july  called the program a breeding ground for contemporary slavery and said workers experienced a wide range of abuses because they had insufficient access to legal remediesemployers will be permitted to hire a maximum of  percent of their workforces from the temporary foreign worker program tfwp down from  percentthe tfwp was designed to help employers fill temporary labor shortages when qualified canadian citizens or permanent residents arent availablein  the highest number of work permit holders were from mexico  followed by india with  according to canadian government data there were  workers from chinaspeaking to reporters at the liberal party cabinet retreat in halifax last monday prime minister justin trudeau said his government had relaxed the programs rules to help businesses facing labor shortages recover from the pandemicbut the economic situation is different now he said and canada no longer needs as many temporary foreign workersaccording to public data from immigration refugees and citizenship canada there were  temporary foreign worker permits issued in  up from  in mario seccareccia a professor in the economics department at the university of ottawa told china daily i would rather describe this as a somewhat hybrid form of indentured labor where workers are brought over and are taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers by abusing them and not respecting their contractual obligations and not fully paying themhe said that existing regulatory mechanisms didnt protect the workers rights the key issue is the power imbalance created by the system in which foreign workers are tied to a single employer he said that creates a dependency that can lead to potential abuse as workers fear losing their jobs and being forced to return to their home countries if the employer no longer wants them seccareccia saida simple solution is to allow the foreign workers during the period of their work permit in canada to find another job for example in agriculture or the services industry removing that bondage to one employer would clearly reduce this abuse he saidhe said the program can easily lead to abuse because it doesnt allow foreign workers to leave abusive employers and to stay in canada during the full term of their permitsbut the federal and provincial governments should have more closely monitored the situation he saidthe un report called for an end to closed work permit systems and for all workers to be given the right to change employers the report also emphasized the need for governments to work proactively to inform workers of their rights rather than deferring to the demands of employersmathis denis a spokesman for employment minister randy boissonnault told china daily the health and safety of temporary foreign workers in canada is paramount it is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure that employers are complying with the program and to hold those who are not to accountdenis noted that in the last fiscal year the government completed  inspections under the tfwp during that period  million in fines were issued to noncompliant employers for violating program rules an increase of approximately  percent from the prior fiscal year twelve employers were banned from the program compared with the previous fiscal year when seven were bannedthe employment ministers office said that last year the government conducted a survey of more than  workers in the tfw program  percent of respondents said they knew about their rights and responsibilities and  percent reported increased knowledge of their rights and the resources and

an election this summer which could mean that the proposed new projects take even longer to be made realityvarious factors contributed to the delay of the new reactor including design complexity and a

sectors soundly and orderly encouraging companies to apply digital intelligent and green technologies to transform traditional industries and imposing tighter institutional constraints for

of chinas economic growth in  contributing  percent of the gdp expansion she said quoting a research paper published by the center in january this year the heightened focus by the chinese government on fostering new quality productive forces including green technologies will likely further drive production in this sectorshe said the growing volumes of affordable clean products in china could also help the global energy transition and the supply chains that need to be expanded worldwidechinas investment and production of green technologies were key drivers in bringing down international prices accelerating the uptake worldwide schaepe said chinese companies are already setting up new production facilities in other countries they can contribute to diversifying supply chains and offering technology transfer particularly with countries in the global southsustained focusmeanwhile chinas sustained focus on green transformation has also driven some traditional energyintensive industries to become cleaner both experts pointed outyang found out that both chinas central and local stateowned enterprises in the electricity sector while owning the majority of coal power assets in the country have actively diversified into renewable energy which significantly contributed to controlling the emissions by limiting coal consumption increasethe steel sector saw no new permits for coalbased steel plants in the first half of  signaling a shift toward cleaner production methods such as electric arc furnaces schaepe saidthe record expansion of renewables capacity coupled with saturation in the real estate sector and emission reductions from heavy industry signals that china may already have seen a carbon emissions peak in  she saiddespite that chinas path to carbon neutrality can still be long and winding she admittedschaepe called for ambitious staged carbon reduction targets leading from peak to carbon neutrality a clearer coal phasedown plan and stronger support for grid flexibility and power market reform to integrate renewablesyang expressed hope that policy support for clean industries would remain on course emphasizing the need for continued

images and data with the real world and the technology has the potential to make driving much safer with holograms on windscreens that can highlight hazards and additional environmental context for journeys likely in the near futureheadup displays or huds are augmented reality displays that can be fitted to cars and work similarly to virtual reality headsets except they provide visual feedback for the real world insteadtwo dimensional huds are actually established technology that have been commonly used in aerospace and the military since as early as the s three dimensional holographic versions however provide a stronger more visible physical presence which can integrate with the depth of field view of the driverthe human brain is not designed for prolonged attention to detail the mind fatigues and distractions become more commonplace and intense the longer time passes when this happens a driver can lose awareness of the road and react too slowly to upcoming hazards huds can help highlight sudden changes in road conditions or preempt themthe technology would solve a major issue in road safety psychology called the look but fail to see phenomenon this is when a user does not register something right in front of their eyes having a secondary display system highlights problems making them harder to miss studies show that visual cues draw human attention to details in situations extremely effectively saving mental energy on prolonged tripsable to assist with navigation performance and hazards the promise of efficient and distractionfree driving is attractive to the consumer car industry which has been silently developing the technology for many yearsminiature lasers powered by a graphics card processing chip produce d holograms that are powerful enough to create visible images even when bathed in intense sunlightsuch advancements may also make driving more accessible to those with poorer vision current driving tests universally rely upon strict eyesight requirements it is hoped that huds may increase accessibility for the differently abled or the elderly in the near futurenaturally each brand or model of car will vary in the type of displays they choose to utilize and the type of holographic images on show sports vehicles could prioritize velocity and physics of the ride perhaps showing the g force the driver is sustaining under each turn urban drivers on the other hand may prefer displays that warn about pedestrians ahead or potholes in the road whatever the requirements of the driver an increased offering of visual information and context could allow them to stay alerta key contemporary issue in a future that could include selfdriving vehicles will be how best to balance road safety with a drivers desire to relax on a trip while still remaining fully aware of hazards and taking action when necessary here huds could also come into play popping up with attentiongrabbing colors and symbols to warn drivers even while they are relaxing much like the way in which inflight entertainment halts when instructions are given for passengers to fasten their seat belts or prepare for landing it is hoped huds will be able to alert drivers in the future by cutting into their relaxationit is important however that they will be designed in a way that notifies people at critical times without causing alarm or confusionaugmented reality displays are likely to become a mainstream optional consumer choice in the near future customers may opt to have the feature built into new car models and also purchase huds as installable separate addon extras this element of choice is equally as important when it comes to customizing huds to fit driver requirements warning messages are of course a mandatory component of the hud experience however extras such as telephone call information and music choices must be carefully managed by drivers and offered with caution by the manufacturer to prevent further distractionsbarry he

bank or ecb will now slash borrowing costs by a quarter of a pointthe optimism followed news that inflation fell during august within the member bloc that uses the euro for currency to a threeyear low of  percent after having edged up in july to  percent from  percent in junebert colijn an economist at ing told the financial times newspaper the fact that eurostat the european unions official statistics agency declared the eurozones inflation rate to be within a whisker of the ecbs target of  percent means rate cuts will be likely when the bank discusses the issue on sept the inflation environment is slowly getting more benign colijn said the ecb has arrived on a long home straighteurostat said germany and spain reported bigger than expected falls in consumer price rises in august while france also did well recording inflation at  percent in spite of cost pressures associated with hosting the olympic gamesif the ecb does reduce its key interest rate by a quarterpoint to  percent it will follow on from a quarterpoint cut in june and could lead to more cuts with the financial times saying traders are now hoping for two or three additional quarterpoint reductions before the end of the yearhowever within the overall inflation rate there was a worrying uptick in the cost of services something that jack allenreynolds from capital economics told the financial times may cause concern at the bankhowever we doubt that augusts unexpected increase in services inflation will stop the ecb from cutting interest rates at its next meeting in september he told the papera  percent fall in the cost of energy during august more than offset the increase in the cost of servicescore inflation which ignores price changes in volatile commodities including alcohol energy food and tobacco stood at  percent in august according to eurostat down slightly from  percent in julyfrench newspaper le monde said the ecb is likely to look closely at the core inflation rate when setting its interest rate and this could mean interest rate cuts are far from certainthe ecb started its campaign of aggressive interest rate hikes in july  when the eurozones inflation rate was rocketing up to  percent in october largely because of fastrising energy and food costs attributed to the ukraine conflictsam miley from the londonbased centre for economics and business research told le monde that interest rate cuts are more likely now than they were a few weeks ago but are not guaranteedthe … rate of core inflation and continually tight labor market will present risk factors to

to ensure institutional stability and that she is regarded as someone who would not gain wider support and approval leading to constitutional deadlockthis has prompted lfi to take action saying it is not up to the president to do political horse tradingmathilde panot the parliamentary leader of lfi said a draft impeachment document has been sent to assembly members from other parties in a bid to gain their supportthe assemblee nationale lower house and senat upper house can and must defend democracy against the presidents authoritarian leanings the document saidthe impeachment bid looks to be largely symbolic rather than meaningful however with twothirds of the combined members of the seat national assembly and seat senate needing to support any action for it to be successfularticle  of

dailyprosecutors in italy say the sinking of the superyacht bayesian off the coast of sicily that left seven people dead could results in charges of manslaughter and negligent shipwreckspeaking to journalists ambrogio cartosio public prosecutor in the town of termini imerese where the meter long yacht owned by british tech entrepreneur mike lynch went down said persons unknown were being looked at and names could soon be made publicit could be that we add someone to the list of people being investigated even way before the recovery of the boat he saidit seems to me likely that offences of negligent shipwreck and manslaughter have been committed its about establishing who they can be ascribed tothe yacht had  people on board when it was caught up in extremely violent winds during the early hours of august  and  people including all but one of the crew managed to escape the other seven people on board including lynch his yearold daughter hannah and jonathan bloomer the chairman of morgan stanley international bank diedthe financial times newspaper reports that the boat went down rear first suggesting that compartments at the back of the boat may have become floodeddeputy prosecutor raffaele cammarano said the boat had been caught up in a truly rapid sudden storm and there are reports that the wind reached force  on the beaufort scale which is hurricane strength in his only public comment so far the ships captain james cutfield said we didnt see it coming when talking about the change of weather but the chief of the company that built the boat giovanni costantino told the bbc human error must be a factor in what had happenedat the back of the boat a hatch must have been left open he said but also perhaps a side entrance for water to have poured insidebefore the storm the captain should have closed every opening lifted anchor turned on the engine pointed into the wind and lowered the keelthe bayesian was a model for many other vessels because of its stability and exceptionally high performance… there was absolutely no problem with it if water hadnt surged in it was unsinkablethe vessel whose tanks are still full of fuel is now lying  meters below the surface and to avoid damage to the boat caused by the water that has built up inside it the recovery process could take as long as two months and cost up to  million euros  millionthis is the most delicate part of the operation and needs to be done very very slowly because the bayesian is full of water marine salvage engineer nick sloane told the daily telegraph newspaper adding that around said  expert divers would be neededthe important thing is that when the yacht reaches the surface the sea must be calm so theyll have to carefully check the weather forecasts the yacht should be recovered exactly as it is in one piece with the aim of maintaining it as intact as possible geneva  the world health organization who on monday launched a global drive to tackle humantohuman

clean technology china is the undisputed world leader two decades of consistent and targeted industrial policy combined with the benefits of a huge domestic market mean that china today produces

southwest england came from  kilometers away in northeast scotland surprised scientists said wednesday solving one mystery but raising another how did its prehistoric builders move the huge slab so farthe neolithic circle of giant stones has been a source of wonder and mystery for nearly  years — in the middle ages the wizard merlin of arthurian legend was said to have stolen the monument from irelandmore recently scientists have determined that the sites upright sandstones came from relatively nearby marlborough while the bluestones arrayed near its center came from walesbut the origin of the altar stone a unique metricton slab lying on its side at the heart of the circle remained elusiveit was long thought to have also come from wales but tests along those lines always drew a blank said richard bevins a professor from aberystwyth university in wales and coauthor of a new studythis prompted a team of british and australian researchers to broaden their horizons — and in turn discover something quite sensational he told afpusing chemical analysis they determined that the altar stone came from scotlands orcadian basin which is at least  kilometers from stonehenge according to the study in the journal naturethe researchers were stunnedthis is a genuinely shocking result study coauthor robert ixer of university college london said in a statementthe astonishing distance was the longest recorded journey for any stone at the time said fellow coauthor nick pearce of aberystwyth universitywhether people about  bc were capable of transporting such huge stones from wales had already been a matter of heated debate among archaeologists and historiansthat a bymeter stone made the trip across much of the length of the united kingdom suggests the british isles were home to a highly organized and wellconnected society at the time the researchers saidthey called for further research to find out exactly where in scotland the stone came from — and how it made its way to stonehengeexplaining theoriesone theory is that the stone was brought to southern england not by humans but by naturally moving ice flowshowever research has shown that ice would actually have carried such stones northward away from stonehenge lead study author anthony clarke from australias curtin university told a news conferenceanother option was that the neolithic builders moved the stones over land — though this would have been extraordinarily difficultdense forests marshy bogs and mountains all formed formidable barriers for prehistoric movers clarke saidanother option is that the stone was transported by seathere is evidence of an extensive network of neolithic shipping which moved pottery and gems around the region clarke saidto work out where it came from the researchers fired laser beams into the crystals of a thin slice of the altar stonethe ratio of uranium and lead in these crystals act as miniature clocks for rocks providing their age said study coauthor chris kirkland of curtin universitythe team then compared the stones age with other rocks across the uk and found with a high degree of certainty that it came from the orcadian basin kirkland saidsusan greaney an archaeologist at the uks university of exeter not involved in the study said it established the first direct link between southern england and northern scotland during this timethe placement of this stone at the heart of the monument on the solstice axis shows that they thought this stone and by implication the connection with the area to the north was incredibly important she told afpagencies

very dangerous precedent ewart saidnick ive contributed to this storyshaoxinyingchinadailycomcnon july  the british public voted overwhelmingly to reject the conservative government of rishi sunak and deliver the labour partys keir starmer to office thus bringing labour to power for the first time since  after years of political instability controversy and chaos that have beset the united kingdom as well as economic stagnation and decline it is hoped that the new government will offer a spell of stability sensibility and pragmatism in its policies both at home and abroad with starmer commanding a massive majority he is sure to forge his own vision for the countryit is hoped that the uk will be able to earnestly and productively reengage with one of its key economic partners — china the previous government is guilty of destroying the bilateral relationship with beijing due to its mismanagement of britains foreign policy as a wholeit pursued a highly ideological path with brexit paid excessive subservience to the united states and deliberately whipped up antichina sentiment domestically to distract attention from its failures then there was opposition from certain parliamentary members groups which were subject to the influence of foreign organizationsthe new government therefore offers an opportunity for britain to reset its relations with the world on more sensible terms although we should not expect geopolitical realities to change and while starmer is by no means a radical having purged the antiwar left from his party while in opposition what we can realistically expect is a foreign policy based more on pragmatism national interests and sensibility as opposed to one premised on ideology identity and shorttermismfor example the previous conservative government was obsessed with pursuing a bilateral trade agreement with the us on the sole premise of anglophone exceptionalism as opposed to actual benefitseven as a protectionist washington showed no interest in such a deal and downing street happily sacrificed its other interests on a whim especially those concerning china its routine weaponization of antichina sentiment for shortterm political gain also made it impossible to engage with beijing even as sunak professed that he wished to do so in certain areas becoming a victim of internal party conflictas a result what we are likely to see from a labour government is not a drastic change in policy but certainly a rebalancing that will make it possible for london to have an amicable relationship with beijing again and to compartmentalize disagreements and areas of cooperation already starmers government is pursuing a reset with the european union that has been described as an end to the brexit era in other words an end to the theatrical nationalism and imperialera nostalgia of the conservatives and a return of cooperationfocused policies when the time is right we are likely to see this happen with china toowhile the previous government was subjected to backbench rebellions frequently led by highly ideological antichina members of parliament starmers largescale majority and emphasis on party discipline will mean his agenda will not be disrupted and therefore backbench mps cannot impose costs on the government for engaging with beijing for example owing to factional conflict within the conservative party individuals such as iain duncan smith and liz truss held disproportionate influence over the governments positions on china and threatened rebellion constantly which is what produced such jarring inconsistencieshowever beijing should nonetheless be aware that usfunded groups and organizations as well as the taiwan region will continue to press for influence among the new batch of mps as well as a hostile mainstream media and thus the socalled golden era will not return this however is preferable to the cold warstyle conflict that was actively sought by some in the previous administration ultimately the uk continues to have significant interests in a cooperative open and mature relationship with china one which can be made to work despite ideological and geopolitical differences as britain enters a new era it is time for a mature reset based on national intereststhe author is a british political and internationalrelations analyst the views do not necessarily reflect those of

landmarks — the eiffel towercharles leung ceo of french luxury jewelry brand chaumet shares the intriguing story behind the medals striking appearancethe olympic committee gave us a very special brief — to create a medal that has never been seen before in olympic history one that would make france shine on the global stage leung told china dailychaumets storied history with the french royal family made them the natural choice for this prestigious commission more than  years ago when napoleon was crowned he came to chaumet for his coronation crowns weve had the honor of designing tiaras and crowns for the french royal court over the centuries leung explained so when there was something this important for france the country turned to us againchaumets opportunity to design the medal for the  paris olympics was largely due to its parent company lvmh group a premium partner of the global sporting eventantoine arnault head of image and environment at lvmh emphasized the significance of the  paris olympics its an exceptional event that hasnt been held in france for  years one of the most closely followed in the world and its taking place in the city where most of our maisons were born arnault said he added that as the leading french group being involved in the paris olympics was not only an obvious choice but also a responsibilitychaumets design team set out to integrate the eiffel tower into the medals structure using recycled steel bars from the iconic landmark itself the eiffel tower was originally meant to be a temporary structure for the  worlds fair but it was such a sensation that paris decided to keep it leung saidthe issue was that the material was not good enough to last for so long so what happened was that over the years little by little bar by bar section by section the original metal framework has been replaced with stronger steel to ensure the towers longevitychaumets designers had the idea of cutting the eiffel tower steel into a hexagonal shape as it holds deep symbolic meaning for the frenchthe hexagon represents the shape of france itself said leung adding that it also evokes the image of the humble but hardworking bee which the french have long associated with national unity and industriousnessadding this slice of parisian history into the medals core was a delicate process we wanted each athlete to be able to bring home a piece of the eiffel tower a tangible connection to the host city that would stay with them forever leung explained the team carefully engineered the setting to showcase the recycled metal surrounding it with a sunray pattern that radiates outwardstrict specificationsleung also said the designers had to meticulously adhere to the olympics strict specifications the weight thickness and other technical details had to be perfect this is not just another piece of jewelry — its a prize that carries immense meaning and prestige he saidadditionally the design incorporates frances rich history of world fairs the

in its mining sector transformation push according to a senior government officialthe plans are part of the countrys grander economic diversification plan — vision  — introduced by saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman al saud in  and includes mining as the third pillar of national industrialism saudi arabias abundant mineral wealth is estimated at  trillionsaudi arabias minister of industry and mineral resources bandar bin ibrahim alkhorayef told china daily in an interview in hong kong on saturday that his country could complement the asia region in providing greater opportunities for relocating most of the manufacturing to his country with cooperation in rd and innovationweve all seen the challenges that had been faced in supply chain disruptions and we believe that saudi arabia can be a great place to solve these challenges he addedtheres a lot of commonalities between the two regions and one of saudi arabias ambitions is to grow its manufacturing base to explore its mining capabilities this is not only to satisfy our local market but also to participate in the global market said alkhorayefthe minister was wrapping up his trip to the greater bay area following a weeklong visit to asia including singapore where he said the purpose was to help large players look to saudi arabia as their next production locationexactly a year ago alkhorayef visited the chinese mainland where he met with senior government officials and visited factories and companieschina is a big country and last time we visited five cities this time we visited guangzhou theres a different flavor in each one of these cities and we try to capture the value and what each region of china can offer to saudi arabia said alkhorayefwe aim to focus on two areas one is to help large players look to saudi arabia as their next production location or logistics location because we can offer a mixture of enablers from the raw material to the energy prices to infrastructure great location he addedbusiness modelsand the other side which is interesting he said was innovation and the adaptation of new business models such as industry  and industry  and artificial intelligence other than manufacturingduring his visit alkhorayef invited chinese companies to invest in saudi which was highlighted by the national industrial strategy during a roundtable meeting organized by the federation of chambers of commerce in guangzhouin hong kong alkhorayef met with senior officials of the trade and industry department the innovation and technology commission and the commerce and economic development of hong kong among others according to the saudi press agencychina is saudi arabias largest trading partner according to the ministry of finance of saudi arabia the volume of trade between the two countries reached more than  billion in we believe saudi arabia can offer many opportunities for many global players from different countries china is definitely the number one trade partner to saudi so its only logical that we find areas of collaboration and bring some local content also to saudi arabia localization is key also to our strategy said alkhorayefwhen it comes to the belt and road initiative proposed by china the minister said saudi was greatly located in an area where it can serve to help many regions connect with each otherdefinitely we are also positioned in a way that allows us to access markets that are growing and have high potential to grow said alkhorayefits great to be here i used to be a businessman visiting china also singapore its great to be here with an official eye ive been really welcomed very well and by everyone both private sector and government so its overwhelming and i think there are great opportunities that we can bring together he addedthe

thinks washington is watching the behavior of hezbollah which so far has proved to be very much within the rules of confrontationhezbollah did not hit any civilian targets it did not hit any israeli city or civilian settlements but instead the focus was on some military posts establishments and installments said yousef adding that washington was not ready for any kind of regional confrontation where israel and iran would face offon the ground yousef said he believes israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu will keep on moving militarily in gaza taking advantage of weak opposition at

novemberaccording to yousef netanyahu will be watching the outcome of those elections to see who wins between former us president donald trump and current us vicepresident kamala harrisi think netanyahus going to continue bargaining with the us as hes bargaining with hamas as he is with the mediators including the egyptians and qataris he saidso this is part of his strategy and vision to

continue its operations with each passing day bringing more destruction to gaza she saidits hard to ignore the suspicion that this is a delaying tactic a diplomatic smoke screen behind which israel carries out its military objectivesthe us speaks of progress but the lack of tangible results suggests the talks are more about stalling than stopping the violencethe question of the philadelphi

between the uae and brics countries we believe there is an opportunity to strengthen that through dialogue among the brics nationswang haoran contributed to this storychina rather than the united states is better positioned to be a negotiator and mediator among countries in the middle east a us expert saysthe chinese government talks to everybody in the region said jack midgley principal of the global consultancy midgley  co and an adjunct associate professor in the security studies program at georgetown university chinas role as a convener an advocate a sponsor of all sides will be much stronger as time goes bythe us military said on aug  that secretary of defense lloyd austin ordered the uss georgia a nuclear submarine to the middle east the pentagon said in a statement that austin issued the order after speaking with israeli defense minister yoav gallantits unbelievably powerful midgley said of the ship whose complement includes  tomahawk cruise missiles each of which can carry a kiloton nuclear warheadthe move of the uss georgia into central command is the clearest possible signal that the us will defend israel with nuclear weapons if necessary he said pointing out that the pentagons announcement was a public signal that the firepower could be used to defend israel and also a very powerful deterrent signal to the iranianssince october the us position has moved toward unconditional support for israel and away from a more balanced position that it took in the past midgley saidthe us government and officials have repeatedly made statements supporting a twostate solutionhowever since the recent escalation of the conflict in gaza there is no discussion about any topic really by the us other than how much military support israel needs midgley saidthe americans used to be the convener they used to be the authority that everyone could talk to in the middle eastmeanwhile chinas position is a balanced one he said adding the country is better able to address all the parties than the us ischina is calling attention to the need of the palestinians at the same time china has maintained its position that the key to success is restraint negotiations and a twostate solutionso the chinese government talks to everybody in the region however the us remains an essential military partner for everyone in the middle east that wont be changed anytime soonhardly achieved anythingon tuesday night us secretary of state antony blinken left qatar concluding his ninth tour to the middle east as with his previous eight trips this one has hardly achieved anything xinhua news agency commenteddespite the declared optimism from the american side american mediation could not solve the problem between hamas and israel because reaching an agreement will not be easy due to the fundamental differences between them said kheir diabat a professor of the international affairs department at qatar universitymostafa amin an egyptian researcher on arab and international affairs said the failure of us mediation in the middle east and its inability to solve the problem from the outset until now arise from the lack of real pressure from washington on israel to stop the war while it continues to supply israel with weapons to kill palestiniansisraeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and farright officials in the israeli government had realized that the joe biden administration is unable to apply meaningful pressure on israel because of its preoccupation with the upcoming presidential election and its unwillingness to jeopardize relations with israel amin saidmidgley said the twostate solution currently is much farther away than it ever has been as none of the three requirements for the solution — ceasefire agreement at some level on borders and governance for palestine — are metand i think chinas voice for a twostate solution and chinas economic influence in the region can help keep this idea alive he saidthe us has already taken a position in favor of israel and is providing unlimited military assistance to the israelisthe second fact is that china maintains good relationships with all of the countries in the region including israelthis represents an opportunity for china to consolidate and improve its relationships in the pacific while the united states is busy elsewhere and im sure that chinese policy will reflect that opportunitychina is one of several

afar to tell the stories of peopletopeople exchanges between china and other countries through the vivid narration of the people in the stories readers can get a better understanding of a country that is boosting opennesschina has spent many years developing its automation and robotics industries and it is now the appropriate time to bring that expertise to the member countries of the gulf cooperation council or gcc said saleh al tunaib cofounder and ceo of btrtechthe gcc comprises saudi arabia kuwait the united arab emirates qatar bahrain and omanweve been working with chinese companies for a while and we found there are huge opportunities al tunaib said noting there was ease of working and efficiencies in the way the chinese companies do businessusually when we try to bring technologies from europe to the middle east it takes between nine and  months to bring them here al tunaib said in contrast chinese companies take three months to come in and deploy their technologies he addedal tunaib noted he has been working in the retail industry for almost  years and said he sees a huge need for automation in the sector for instance the value of ecommerce can be expected to reach  billion in the next couple of years in his viewwhen his team built their first automated warehouse they went through a process of trying to choose the right technology we dealt with mainly us and european technologies as the access to chinese technology was very difficult… in  he saidit was only when his team gained more exposure to the chinese market that they realized the existence of many chinese technologies that they could bring to the middle east regionin the middle east there was not enough access to chinese technology he said al tunaibs team seeks to bridge the gap between china and the middle east as there is a huge opportunity for bringing chinese ecommerce technology to the regional tunaibs team which runs a logistics hub out of kuwait operates its own software to integrate the use of robotics in the retail industryafter operating autostore an innovative automated material handling solution for a few years his business gained a better understanding of the chinese market he said then with the help of ewtp arabia capital which provides access to technology from mature global markets al tunaibs team visited china in januarythey visited four cities in china including guangzhou shenzhen shanghai and hangzhou where they interacted with multiple robotics companiesaccording to al tunaib his company is setting up clients with auto parts and ecommerce warehouses in kuwait across  square meters with the help of robotics technology from china one of the companies involved in the project is quicktron robotics a shanghaibased firm in robotic logistics solutions his team has been working with other chinese manufacturers such as megvii and senad since its visit in january he saidtheres no need for any data to prove the need to connect asia with the gcc and europe the integration of crossborder operations will bring in more business and connect us even further he addedsuch an integration of crossborder operations will take us to another level it will change the way we do business al tunaib saidaccording to al tunaib there is great growth momentum in saudi arabia as the nation plans to spend  billion over the next four years to help improve logistics and the ports sectorthe investment is part of saudi arabias vision  and aims to connect asia through saudi arabia to europe by becoming a global logistics hubexpertise in automationby leveraging the chinese companys expertise in automation al tunaibs company aims to transform the logistics operations of ecommerce businesses throughout the gcc regiontoday we represent quicktron shenzhen dbl technology and many other chinese companies in the middle east region he addedal tunaib said an obvious advantage of chinese companies is their focus on a niche area in the logistics sectoralthough there are different segments of robotics including drones or electronic vehicles within each segment of robotics every chinese company has its own focus such as the automated casehandling mobile robot the chinese companies want to be the best in a specific technologyin many other countries what weve seen is that they try to do something of everything he noted in this process sometimes you lose focus al tunaib addedal tunaib collaborates with chinese companies in two ways one is by bringing technology to the region and adopting these for the public and private sectors the other way is bringing relevant technologies and manufacturing partially or entirely in the gccso there are ways for us to innovate together bring our minds and resources together he saidaccording to al tunaib the people of gulf countries and china share similar traits i love china and its people he said gaza  hamas announced on tuesday the selection of yahya sinwar as its

collaboration with palestinian militant group hamas for the cruel massacre that took place in israel on oct the bills will be returned to the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee for

compensation under international lawpremeditated hostilitythe ministry of foreign affairs and expatriates of palestine said the israeli knessets classification of the unrwa as a terrorist organization

professor at the faculty of law at universitas indonesia told china daily that israels policy to categorize the unrwa as a terrorist organization is highly unusual in the context of international

rights in accordance with international and united nations resolutions to regain the palestinian territories seized by the israeli occupation forceshe pointed out that the settlement decisions and

our moral duty to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to all icj decisions in a consistent manner irrespective of the subject in question the statement saidthe icj advisory opinion will need to be

advisory opinion was not only for the question of palestine but for justice and for all the legal system as he believed that this determination will help in achieving justice and stability in the region if its implementedhe stressed this was why it was important to work with the international community with the un and other states toward imposing a mechanism toward ending this israeli occupationour move will be toward countries bilaterally that means that we will be working with states toward taking irreversible steps toward taking actions by putting consequences on this illegal occupation by not assessed or render aid or recognizing the illegality that israel is doing and consolidating in the occupied palestinian territories awadallah told china dailyhe said there were many things to be done whether at the un general assembly or the un security council level or any other organ within the un human rights council and other bodies in the un toward implementing this important and significant and landmark advisory opinionwe believe that the court said that they did what they had to do on moral and legal basis and its time for the international community to act on these moral and legal bases to end this illegality said awadallahhassan ben imran board member at law for palestine a nonprofit human rights organization praised the courts advisory opinion as good as it offered several legal grounds for palestinians to further their legal struggle for freedom and liberationhowever it should be noted that there is no expectation that israel would comply with it israel has given absolutely no reason to believe in a fraction of that imran told china dailytherefore the only way forward is imposing sanctions economic political and military ones on israel israels

sunday some residents were ordered to evacuate to western gaza city while the order on monday included areas that people had fled to a day earlier and instructed them to evacuate to shelters in deir al balahthe two directly affected areas encompass  health facilities that were recently functional including two hospitals two primary healthcare centers and nine medical points ocha said adding that  out of  hospitals in the gaza strip are only partially functionalthe office said that with nine out of every  people estimated to be displaced in gaza new waves of displacement are mainly affecting people who have already been displaced multiple times only to find themselves forced to flee again under shelling they were forced to reset their lives repeatedly without any of their belongings or any prospect of finding safety or reliable access to essential servicespeople especially children spend long hours queueing to collect water each day ocha said access to emergency health care is also a challenge particularly given limited communications coverage to contact emergency services high transportation costs to reach hospitals  us dollars roundtrip and the long walking distance of at least  kilometers to reach the nearest medical pointin northern gaza the aid partners especially highlighted the lack of safe shelters for up to  idps internally displaced persons who were forced to hastily flee from shujaiyeh and other parts of eastern gaza city following evacuation orders in late june many were found sleeping amid solid waste and rubble with no mattresses or enough clothing and some had sought shelter in partially destroyed un facilities and residential buildingsthe israeli military designated these same areas as evacuation zones forcing many of the same families including young children and the elderly to go through successive waves of displacement over the past two weeks the office saidocha said that insecurity damaged roads the breakdown of law and order and access limitations continue to hamper movement along the main humanitarian cargo route between kerem shalom crossing and khan younis and deir al balahthis has resulted in critical shortages of fuel and aid commodities to sustain humanitarian operations in addition to increasing the risk of spoilage and infestation of stranded supplies especially food due to extremely high temperatures the office saidthe humanitarians said the food security sector fss reports that the shortages forced partners to provide reduced food rations in central and southern gaza in june and undermined their ability to keep bakeries and community kitchens runningaccording to ocha only seven out of the  bakeries supported by humanitarian partners remain operational in gaza all in deir al balah and six bakeries already working at partial capacity have now been forced to completely cease operations due to the lack of fuelthe office said that in the absence of cooking gas and a stable flow of food supplies community kitchens are also struggling to operate resulting in a reduced number of cooked meals prepared throughout gaza as of the end of june about  cooked meals prepared in  kitchens were distributed daily to families across the strip compared to more than  in the first half of juneocha said it meant that displaced households rely on burning wood and plastic from furniture and waste to cook exacerbating health risks and environmental hazardsas for cooking humanitarian partners said they continue to distribute wheat flour and canned food that enter northern gaza through the erez west crossing no commercial trucks have been entering the area for monthsa joint assessment by the un food and agriculture organization and the un satellite centre estimated that about  percent of gazas cropland and onethird of its greenhouses were damagedthe fss reported a neartotal lack of protein sources such as meat and poultry on the local market and only a few types of locally produced vegetables are available at unaffordable pricesthe sector reported that continued military operations in rafah and recent displacement from eastern khan younis where significant agricultural production was concentrated before the war have resulted in additional damage to greenhouses it forced more people to leave their farms unattended further destabilizing food systemsocha said that on friday medecins sans frontieres msf reported that its teams at nasser medical complex were running on emergency medical stocks and all departments were overwhelmed by patients far exceeding available bed capacitymsf said the nasser medical complex is the main site on which field hospitals rely to sterilize their equipment and if the facility is left without electricity several field hospitals will also cease functioningit said the hospital has been unable to bring any medical supplies into gaza since the end of april including most recently on wednesday when the israeli authorities denied trucks carrying msf medical aid entry into the gaza strip due to ongoing hostilitiesthe ceasefire talks between palestinian militant group hamas and israel have seen its momentum dented after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu issued a list of nonnegotiable conditions in relation to israels objectives in gaza despite international calls amid heavy casualties and humanitarian disastersthe news came after hamas delivered its acceptance of threephase arrangements to negotiator countries the united states egypt and qatar while israel continued its bombardment in gaza with palestinian families fleeing

of israeli demands just as the israeli negotiating team was preparing to depart for further talks in cairo and doha expected later this weekaccording to a statement published on the israeli prime ministers website it was netanyahus steadfast position against the attempt to halt israel defense forces action in rafah that led hamas to enter negotiationsit noted that any deal would allow israel to resume fighting until all of objectives of the war have been achieved there would also be no smuggling of weapons to hamas from egypt to the gaza border and no return of thousands of armed terrorists to the northern gaza stripalso israel would maximize the number of living hostages who will be released from hamas captivitythe plan that has been agreed to by israel and which has been welcomed by united states president joe biden will allow israel to retrieve hostages without infringing on the other objectives of the war said the statementisraeli opposition leader yair lapid on his

malaysia told china daily that the tough stance taken by netanyahu might risk derailing the talks because hamas will view the new conditions as unacceptablethe more netanyahu insists on continuing the conflict the deeper the enmity grows said abdul wahedhe said hamas willingness to enter the negotiations is aimed at ending the hostilities with an initial ceasefire followed by discussions on issues like blockadelifting and reconstruction aidif those things are not achieved the conflict will continue therefore a more balanced strategy incorporating security concerns with genuine humanitarian

cultural power it was suggested would minimize us dependence on its militaryin the new century however the us aggressively exercised its hard power first in afghanistan then in iraq and libya us prestige waned as each military venture failed to achieve its stated aims in those years also the us was gradually losing its absolute preeminence in the global economy and the appeal of its

production in kenya as well as promote an alternative food crop in the face of the declining maize production the countrys staple food scientists at the kenya agricultural and livestock research organization have developed highyielding drought and diseaseresistant cassava varietiesthe varieties were developed using semiautotrophic hydroponics technology which involves the use of modified soil that holds plant roots in planting pots with little waterthe soil transports the moisture to the plant roots with the top of the soil remaining relatively dry this allows the production of cassava seeds that are pests and diseaseresistantgodwin macharia a scientist in charge of food crops and research at the kenya agricultural and livestock research organization said the new cassava variety dubbed variety kme or locally as tajirika can double farmers yields by halving the maturity period from  months to a yearone of the most devastating diseases facing cassava farmers in kenya is the cassava brown streak disease we consider it one of kenyas most dangerous plant diseases due to its significant impact on food and economic security macharia saidthe cassava variety that we have developed is resistant to the disease and could considerably improve the crops ability to feed africa while generating income for smallholder farmershe said the variety has the potential to yield up to  metric tons per hectare compared to  metric tons per hectare when using the local cassava varietiesmacharia pointed out that since the research began in  the first batch of  farmers from the coastal region received the improved seeds in  as part of the trialsthis saw kenyas cassava production grow by more than  metric tons in  compared to the previous yearmacharia said the production is set to improve further in the coming years once farmers in western kenya start receiving the improved seedsthey also plan to introduce the crop to areas that traditionally do not grow cassava to improve productiononce the majority of farmers adopt the improved cassava seeds in the country we believe kenyas production will triple due to increased yields per hectare coupled with the fact that the improved cassava matures in half the time it takes for the traditional varieties to mature he saidmacharia termed multiplying and disseminating new cassava varieties to farmers as the key challenge to breeders and scientists this is because cassava is a clonal crop whose multiplication is done using stems and this process can take several years to reach most farmershowever the semiautotrophic hydroponics technology currently being used makes it easier and faster to propagate new seeds hence easily accessible to farmerspatience khasoa a kenyan environmental consultant said cassava production can promote food security among rural populations in kenyaas a cassava advocate she works with local farmers by providing specialized expertise and advisory services related to cassava cultivation processing and value chain developmentwhen it comes to cultivation kenyan cassava farmers need to identify and promote highyielding and diseaseresistant cassava varieties suitable for kenyan agroecological zones this should introduce improved varieties that have desirable traits such as disease and drought tolerance and early maturity khasoa saidthe kenya plant health inspectorate service must also establish and strengthen communitybased seed systems to ensure farmers have access to highquality planting material we need to promote the use of certified planting material to reduce the spread of diseasesotiatochinadailycomcnregional leaders and stakeholders are pushing for amendment of the treaty of the east african community eac to adopt kiswahili as an

and buffalo springs national reserves in november  to march  and june  to april the recorded vocalizations from the elephants indicated that they address each other with individually specific calls dubbed vocal labels the calls were uncovered using a machinelearning algorithm known as random forestthe ultimate dataset comprised  distinct calls of which  unique callers and  unique receivers were identifiedwhen these calls were played back the elephants responded energetically to those addressed to them approaching the source and vocalizing in response — further supporting the existence of vocal labelsjoyce poole scientific director of elephant voices said over the years she often observed a particular elephants contact call answered excitedly by one family member yet a second contact call was answered by a different elephantmickey pardo a postdoctoral research fellow in the department of fish wildlife and conservation biology at colorado state university said the study not only shows that elephants use specific vocalizations for each individual but that they recognize and react to a call addressed to them while ignoring those addressed to othersthis indicates that elephants can determine whether a call was intended for them just by hearing the call even when out of its original context he saiddeeper understandingthe study findings will help in a deeper understanding of elephant cognition offering invaluable insights for their conservation according to the expertsgeorge wittemyer senior author of the study said it promotes fascination and interest in elephants which hopefully translates to empathy for the species and support for conservation effortsthe hope is that if we can decipher how they communicate we may be able to communicate more effectively and directly with them he said in an email to china dailyhe told china daily the study findings are only applicable to african elephants but not in other regions like asia because elephants in those regions are

supporting local industries and communities while helping reduce more than  metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually kenyas rural electrification and renewable energy corporation saidone of the ways is to share expertise and provide training adesina said china can help build local capacities to manage and sustain renewable energy projects this can be done through joint ventures

united nations released in january indicates that major inroads have been made against the disease in africa as a result of steppedup funding and programming the annual report indicated that between  and  malaria mortality rates among all ages in africa halved from  to  per  population at riskin  the mortality rate increased to  per   population at risk partly due to the disruptions in access to malaria prevention and case management caused by the covid pandemic and then decreased slightly to  by  during the period  to  the percentage of total malaria deaths among children under  declined from  percent in  to  percent in  the un report stateddespite the achievements made moeti said that africa has reached a crossroads in controlling the disease since  of the most affected countries that contribute more than  percent of global cases and deaths are in the region she attributed this to challenges such as extreme weather events conflict and humanitarian crises resource constraints biological threats and inequitiesinfants and young children represent about  percent of the mortality while studies show that children under the age of five from the poorest households in subsaharan

prospectsthe predicted production shortfall is expected to intensify households food insecurity increase domestic prices and spur a surge in import needs across the subregion as the new assessment from faos global information and early warning system indicatedacute food insecurity in southern africa estimated at  million people in the first three months of  could deteriorate in late  the un agency warnedadditionally food prices which are already increasing at an annual rate of more than  percent could rise furtheraccording to the current projections south africa and zambia which are typically maize exporters will not be able to cover the supply shortfall over the years white maize supplies from the two countries have been more than sufficient to meet the import demand of the neighboring countriesunfortunately due to the current situation zambia has already started importing maize to meet the shortfall the governments of malawi zambia and zimbabwe on the other hand have declared drought emergencieswhite maize accounts for almost  percent of calories consumed in southern africazimbabwe is expected to experience a significant increase in maize imports because its likely to have a precipitous drop in production imports are also forecast to rise markedly in malawi and mozambiquejonathan pound an economist at faos global information and early warning system said the combination of reduced harvests and rising food prices is particularly harmful to agricultural households and the restoration of production this is because farm incomes are set to be squeezed while more resources will be needed to purchase foodfao warned that low cereal outturns in south africa and zambia could also affect the subregional availability of maize seeds for the subsequent agricultural cropping season starting in septemberthe last time a cereal shortage was experienced in the region was in  following the el niñoaffected harvest during that period nearly  metric tons of white maize were sourced from mexico and the united stateswhen ngaruiya njonge wanted to start learning kung fu  years ago he had no one to teach him and nowhere to go and learn the art since his hometown of kiambu in central kenya had no such facility determined to learn the skill he turned to video streaming service youtube for lessons and since then he has never looked backborn in the remote village of kangoya in kenyas kiambu county njonges interest in kung fu was roused after a teacher in a nearby primary school who was trained in china introduced martial arts to the villagers however once the teacher left the village njonge had nowhere to turn to and this is where youtube tutorials came in handyi used to work as a truck driver with a transport company but after training

time became my first students njonge saidin order to advance his dream of becoming a coach he approached his local county government with a proposal to start training local youths njonge was concerned that his county was known for heavy drinking among the youth and sought to work with the county government by using kung fu to curb the viceas luck would have it the county government allocated him the local community hall for training thus marking the beginning of his journey as a career coach he started by training children and jobless youths at the community hall on saturdays and sundays from having fewer than  trainees at the time he started njonge has seen the sport grow and he now trains at least  children and dozens of youths for free during the weekendsi started with a handful of students but over the years the numbers have grown once i became a registered coach the ministry of education wrote me a letter which i could use to approach schools and request to train their students in kung fu said njonge who is now the president of kenyas kung fu wushu federationso far he has established kung fu clubs in  public primary schools in kiambu county where he trains about  pupils for free despite the lack of monetary support from the government he said that he also trains students in private schools where he makes part of his earnings as president of the kenya kung fu

everything is in place initially there was resistance to it but it has been explained and everybody has accepted it this is our latest move to fight poaching by ensuring that we have honest and professional rangers said don english a regional ranger at kruger national parkdespite adopting a number of measures such as installing cameras radar systems and using detecting dogs fitted with global positioning system devices to prevent poaching in national parks in south africa in recent years poaching of wild animals is still not effectively checked in the countrylast year a total of  rhinos were killed for their horns in south africa an increase of  compared with the previous yearin addition to poachers some national park rangers are also suspected of being involved in poaching in a recent case at a section of kruger national park  out of the  rangers were arrested for working with poachers including a section ranger the rangers supplied tactical information to the poachers and were arrested after money was deposited in the accounts of various relativeskruger national park stretches between mpumalanga and limpopo provinces and is near the borders of eswatini formerly known as swaziland mozambique and zimbabwe covering almost  square kilometersto prevent poaching south africa has been using various means including the use of cameras to record the number plates of cars entering and leaving the parkmain targetsrecently the south african national parks installed cameras in areas with high concentrations of rhinos which are the main targets of poachingenglish said we have developed radar systems that can pick up anything it can differentiate humans and different species of animals and these radars are strategically placed we have a magnetic cable system which picks up any movement or objects we have hightech camera systemsthe south african national parks also use ballistic tests when they find poachers in possession of rifles this helps them to link the poachers with animals which could have been killed in the park english pointed out that some poachers were arrested in possession of rhino horns and rifles and dna tests linked them to the crime where the rhino had been killedthe south african national parks also use dogs which track poachers with global positioning systems strapped on their necks and helicopters that can operate at nightrhinos are the most targeted animals because their horns are sold at higher prices in various parts of the world including southeast asia where they are used for jewelry and as an aphrodisiac south africa is

the countryestablished in  the kenyachina joint laboratory for crop molecular biology at egerton university in nakuru county has developed  crop varieties through molecular breeding of which  have been commercialized the crops are suitable in different ecological conditions disease resistant and high yielding compared with traditional onesonce the seeds are developed they are taken to the agroscience park at the university where seed bulking and commercialization take placeamong the improved seeds are five bean varieties three of which have been released in the market and have attracted much attention from farmers because of their advantagesthe most popular one is the chelalang beans that were released in the market in  in the kalenjin community the name loosely translates to mean a warm beautiful girl who can fetch the highest bride pricepaul kimurto director of agroscience park said chelalang can yield up to  bags or  kilograms per hectareits a very adaptive variety if you grow when there is enough rain it prolongs the growth and puts in more yield when the rainfall is short it quickly accelerates so it has early maturity characteristic hence farmers dont lose yields he saidanna wanjiku a farmer from matangi tisa village in nakuru was amazed by a bean variety last year as the august rains arrived she sowed chelalang and tatton beans another variety under the bulking process and nearing commercializationthe rain vanished for a month after the crops germinated then returned while wanjikus other beans succumbed to the drought the chelalang and tatton beans perseveredwanjiku reaped a remarkable harvest from  kg of tatton beans she collected a bountiful  kg her investment in  kg of chelalang beans yielded  kgin the upcoming rainy season i will plant each of the variety in a hectare land im looking forward to a bumper harvest and consequently increased income she saidhillary chelal a research assistant at egerton university highlighted the

in artificial intelligence or ai has had the effect of disrupting and transforming socioeconomic activities across industries ranging from health trade education and even the mitigation of climate changehowever as industries and governments across the globe are positioning themselves to tap into and exploit these possibilities experts argue that african countries need to tackle governance issues and lack of institutional and infrastructural capacity to establish the building blocks that will allow them to benefit from artificial intelligencethey added that africa needs supportive policies and robust infrastructure to tap the limitless opportunities of artificial intelligence to quicken its development though it is important to regulate the use of ai in africa to avert its risks the experts said that the continent should not wait to have the regulations in place in order to embrace the technologyfayaz king an expert in digital public infrastructure from zimbabwe said ai has the potential to contribute up to  trillion to the african economy by  representing a  percent increase in the continents gdp by  that is why it is important for african governments to incentivize stakeholders across ai value chains with a focus on smallmedium scale enterprises to foster innovation and equitable access to ai technologiesintensifying effortsalfred ongere an information technology expert and the founder of artificial intelligence kenya a nongovernmental organization said the urgency to regulate ai in african countries is expected to intensify because it can potentially be used in disseminating misinformation fake news and disinformation however policymakers should prioritize improving the state of the ai ecosystemin kenya the government proposed a bill last year seeking to create a professional body to oversee the activities of ai practitioners and impose license fees for those working in the sector ongere saidhowever this bill could hold back a nascent sector by reducing the flow of private investment and locking young people out of opportunities he saiddespite arguing against tempered regulation by african governments ongere said that it is still crucial to protect consumers from the risks posed by the unfettered application of ai on the continent he urged african governments to develop an ai road map or policy paper that factors in the views of all stakeholders as a first step rather than imposing regulations that could potentially damage a promising sectoraifocused solutions should address realworld challenges such as rural development low literacy levels and financial inclusion among others more importantly efforts should be directed toward ensuring the commercial viability of these solutions ongere saidking said that regulating ai in africa should address ethical considerations such as data privacy bias and transparency as the use of ai continues to expand it is likely that more countries will follow in introducing such regulationsaccording to him regulating ai in africa could be seen from three perspectives first from the point of a law enacted by a parliament second in the form of strategies toward the adoption of ai and finally on policiesthe question of regulation especially in the african context is that africa is not mature to have fullblown regulation on ai because africa lacks the level of

a friend of china daily for decadesbelinda robinson minlu zhang and heng weili in new york contributed to this storythe science and technology relationship between the united states and china has entered a new era of complexity and uncertainty after a yearold agreement long considered a cornerstone of cooperation expired on aug the uschina science and technology agreement the first official agreement signed after the normalization of uschina relations in the s ended despite the scientific communitys efforts to have it renewedoriginally signed by then us president jimmy carter and then chinese leader deng xiaoping in  the symbolically significant pact had been renewed every five years since it took effect with the most recent renewal in however the agreements fate had been hanging in the balance since august  when it was on the verge of lapsing in an attempt to salvage the agreement the two countries extended it twice for six months each time to negotiate renewal terms those efforts proved unsuccessful and the most recent sixmonth extension expired last monthmany disappointedthe demise of the sta has sparked concern and disappointment among experts in the fieldrichard dasher director of the usasia technology management center at stanford university supports maintaining international cooperationi think we should stay internationally focused and i think that cooperation is good whenever we can do it so in principle i would be in favor of continuing the uschina science and technology agreement dasher told china dailythe frustration surrounding the obstacles to renewing the sta is palpable within the scientific communitydenis simon a former professor at duke universitys fuqua school of business and marcus stanley director of studies at the quincy institute for responsible statecraft voiced their exasperation by asking why cant we just let american and chinese scientists get alongin an article published in the quincy institutes online magazine responsible statecraft the day after the agreement expired the authors emphasized the critical role of the sta in fostering scientific collaborationthe sta provided an overarching framework for facilitating scientific exchanges joint research projects and the sharing of knowledge and technical expertise they wrotesimon and stanley warned of the potential consequences of allowing the sta to lapseit would be a mistake for agreements to facilitate basic scientific research cooperation such as the sta to become irretrievably damaged by the increase in uschina tensions the decision on whether to extend amend or terminate the sta has profound implications for the global scientific community they cautionedthe authors also highlighted the broader context of growing distrust between the two countries which has contributed to the current impasse besides congress the us government has increasingly scrutinized chinese scientists and researchers over national security concerns which has hampered academic exchangesthis climate of growing distrust not only has made renewal of the sta more contentious but it has also made the rekindling of overall science and technology cooperation more difficult they saidroger pielke jr a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative american enterprise institute think tank expressed his support for continuing the sta in the most robust form that can be negotiated between the two nationshe argued that the very existence of such an agreement is more important than its specific details adding he viewed decoupling to be a bad idea and it is also a bad idea in science and technologycrucial supportfor decades the sta has been instrumental in fostering scientific collaboration in areas of basic science such as agriculture clean energy public health and the environment it has provided us and chinese researchers with crucial financial legal and political support enabling them to work together on groundbreaking research and innovationsdasher emphasized the interconnected nature of the global scientific community and the importance of collaborationtheres a continuum between basic research and actual commercialization and certainly in the basic research area theres always cooperation potential just about everywhere he said and youre seeing a lot of papers written jointly between people in china and in the united statesthe agreement has contributed to a rapid increase in both the number and quality of joint papers by chinese and us researchers however in recent years research collaboration has declined attributed to rising tensions and antichina sentimenta study published by the national bureau of economic research in june showed that scientific cooperation between the us and china had drastically decreased since  when the former us president donald trump took officethe study analyzed data in three key areas stem science technology engineering and mathematics trainee mobility use of scientific works between scientists in each country and scientist productivity in each country as measured by the production of peerreviewed papersbetween  and  ethnically chinese graduate students were  percent less likely to attend a usbased phd program moreover those who did attend such programs were  percent less likely to stay in the us after graduation the study foundoutput dropsthe researchers also documented a sharp decline in chinese use of us science as measured by citations although they found no such decline in the propensity of us scientists to cite chinese researchthe trends are corroborated by the state of the science address delivered by us national academy of sciences president marcia mcnutt in junemcnutt presented data showing that the us is dropping in research output as measured by articles published while china is experiencing a tripledigit percentage increase in terms of research quality measured by the percentage of articles in the top  percent cited the us is losing ground while china has moved ahead of the european unionthe shifting landscape of scientific productivity is also reflected in the pharmaceutical industry chinas share of drugs in phase one to three trials has risen dramatically from about  percent in  to  percent in  while the us share is in decline according to mcnuttchinas number of patents per year surpassed the us around  and is now leading by a ratio of  to  as of in the corporate world china has emerged as a dominant force leading the global fortune  list with  out of  companies in  a stark contrast to its nonplayer status in those statistics underscore mcnutts conclusion that advancing the frontiers of basic research now requires international partnerships to benefit all researcherssaving livesthe importance of such partnerships is illustrated by an example provided by dasher involving a medical technology company he described a collaboration between a senior electrical engineer in silicon valley — with innovative ideas for medical image analysis — and a professor in chinachina has eight times as many medical images as the united states does so he cooperated with a professor in china and the two of them have created a company about medical image analysis to detect cancer dasher saidthats a very good use where china has data that is useful for everyone and we have a technology idea i think that kind of thing will continuethe benefits of international cooperation extend to the overall strength of the us technology sector dasher said one of the key strengths of silicon valley has been its diversity with  percent of the technical workforce born in chinaweve benefited from foreign people who come to the united states as students and continue to work here i think that its also the case where some americans may want to go to china and work in china so we need to maintain a very good safe environment for people to cooperate he emphasizedwith dwindling government investment the us industry began taking the lead around  and now dominates us research investment with a  percent share compared with the federal governments  percentthe strengths of the private sector in advancing scientific and technological development however have been challenged by the us governments national security measures aimed at containing chinas development in science and technologythe biotech industry provides a stark example of the potential consequences of decoupling many achievements under the sta such as uschina collaborations on gene editing research that have created diseaseresistant crops and improved yields are at risk of being reduced to historical footnotespatrick beyrer a researcher at the asia society policy institutes center for china analysis said a potential uschina biotech decoupling is being expedited while everyday americans arent adequately prepared for the consequenceshe cited the example of wuxi apptec as a research superstore for its us partners and wuxi biologics the secondlargest biologic outsourcer in the worldrecent policy recommendations from the us house of representatives select committee on china have described us dependence on chinese pharmaceutical supply chains as a distinct national security risk with some lawmakers proposing to block chinese companies such as bgi group and wuxi apptec from future us federal contracting and government technology procurementimpact on treatmentbeyrer warned that the elimination of those companies from us supply chains would have an impact on developing treatments for critical medical conditions including hearing loss cystic fibrosis and leukemiain addition to china representing the largest and most costeffective exporter of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the us market jointly developed drugs agricultural technologies and other biotechenabled solutions have improved countless american lives he wrote in an articlethe collapse of uschina biotech partnerships would spell the end of such jointly developed innovations that harbor the potential to deliver sorely needed global public goods including saving american lives suffering from diseases such as cancer beyrer cautionedtalent crunchthe challenges faced by the biotech industry are symptomatic of a broader issue affecting uschina relations in science and technology export controls and other measures to restrict technology transfer have moved to the heart of the relationship increasing tensions between the two countries and posing significant challenges for us tech companiescraig allen president of the uschina business council criticized the us export controls for causing an intensely difficult problem for us tech companies particularly those that are in silicon valleytheres a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety and i think thats true across the board in tech allen observed during an event at stanford while visiting his organizations members in silicon valleythe semiconductor industry in particular has been hit hard by these restrictions allen said that several us chip companies have recently been banned from selling to an illdefined range of chinese customersits becoming more and more difficult to avoid that conflict of law and thereby the consequences would be terminating or severely restricting what had been a very profitable enterprise for decades he saidhe emphasized the importance of china for many technology companies both as a market and as a source of talentchinas extremely important for the tech companies many of them have a large percentage share of their total sales in china and many of them draw on that enormous chinese talent pool in china and that is not something that they can easily walk away from he saidan april report by the federal reserve bank of new york estimated that in a small subset of tech companies studied  billion of market capital was lost due to export controls when new export controls were announced employment in affected companies declined by  percentit is especially detrimental for american companies when export controls are unilateral enforced by the american government only on american companies in such cases and there are many unilateral export controls that asymmetrically hurt american firms and longterm american competitiveness said allenthese restrictions are disrupting longestablished partnerships and hindering access to crucial talent allen cited the case of a us multinational company whose lead scientist in china was denied a visa to visit his own laboratories in the usamerican companies need to access chinese talent if they are to remain globally competitive if american companies are barred from hiring chinese talent then other companies will be given a longterm structural advantage that probably over a very short period of time will impact american competitiveness he arguedthis talent crunch is exacerbated by the us dependence on international students to meet its stem workforce requirements as noted by mcnutt in her june address the narrowing channel for data flows between rd teams in china and the us is making this challenge more acute every daylooking ahead allen acknowledged the complex political landscape that companies must navigatewe live in a political world companies have to recognize that a potential future conflict between the united states and china would make it impossible for most international trade and investment to continue he saidwhile conflict is certainly not inevitable tensions need to be managed carefully as we try to nudge our way to a more sustainable rulesbased multipolar orderbeijing condemned on tuesday the socalled biosecure act passed by the united states house of representatives urging washington to stop unwarranted oppression against chinese enterprisesthe bill passed by  to  votes on monday would prohibit the us government from contracting with or providing grants to companies that do business with a biotechnology company of concernit names five chinese companies — bgi mgi and its subsidiary complete genomics wuxi apptec and wuxi biologicschina firmly opposes such discriminatory measures against its companies foreign ministry spokeswoman mao ning told a daily news conferencemao urged the us to abandon ideological bias earnestly respect market principles and trade rules stop pushing forward the legislation and provide a fair just and nondiscriminatory business environment for companies from all countrieschina will continue to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of its companies she said adding that the country also supports its companies in safeguarding their rights and interests in accordance with the lawthe legislation needs to pass the us senate before it can be sent to us president joe biden to be signed into lawthe targeted companies have all said the measure is based on false and misleading allegations and would limit competition they denied posing any threat to us national security and stressed that they do not have access to the personal data of us citizens in their operationsthe act is the latest move by us lawmakers who have already succeeded this year in requiring chinesebased parent company bytedance to divest from tiktok or face a us banthe biosecure act is part of a string of chinarelated bills that the us lawmakers are pushing ahead this weekin

vowing to meet regularly to address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral processthe relationship between silicon valley and shenzhen often dubbed chinas silicon valley exemplifies the mutual benefits of cooperation between us and chinese technology companiesrather than viewing chinas technological advancements as a threat prominent uschina business relations experts said such innovations should be welcomed and embracedker gibbs an executive in residence with the china business studies initiative at the university of san francisco said chinese companies have become increasingly competitive and innovative he advocates a reciprocal approach suggesting that the united states and china should learn from each otherchinas digital businesses and services are phenomenal even though reading chinese menus is of course slower for me than english i can easily navigate chinese apps and use them to do everything from ordering food to paying for parking gibbs said he was most recently the president of the american chamber of commerce in shanghaigibbs found these apps powerful and easy to use attributing their rapid development to intense competition and the ability to conduct quick lowcost experiments in the chinese marketwere also seeing digital innovation cross over into traditional businesses chinesemade cars for example have integrated digital interface designs very effectively foreign company ceos often report that their local competitors adopt digital technologies faster which means they are watching and learning from chinese competitors he saidhe also emphasized chinese companies strength in creating innovative business models he cited wechat as an example explaining how it combined existing technologies such as cellphones messaging and mobile payments into a unique and powerful business model that has yet to be replicated in quite the same way elsewhereyou see this kind of thing everywhere in china where an entrepreneur has found a gap and filled it chinas entrepreneurs are unstoppable as long as they are allowed to continue to prosper chinas future is bright he saidcraig allen president of the uschina business council echoed these sentiments cautioning against underestimating the shenzhen modelstrong and ambitiouswhile he believes the silicon valley model will ultimately prevail because of its enthusiastic embrace of diversity and inherently global nature allen urged giving the shenzhen model the respect that it deserves during a recent discussion organized by stanford university on the relationship between silicon valley and shenzhenhe described shenzhen as a strong and ambitious competitor capable of mobilizing vast resources leveraging the vast market scale and utilizing superb engineering talentthey are fast and they are agile they have strong government support and their ecosystem and infrastructure are second to none he said adding that the two regions have had a complementary relationshipsilicon valley has benefited significantly from cooperation with their chinese counterparts particularly in outsourcing laborintensive operations to china and benefiting from chinese excellence in manufacturingthis complementary relationship extends to research and development with many us companies conducting rd in china initially focused on localizing international products these us corporate rd efforts in china are increasingly contributing to the global operations of us companies a trend allen expects to continuei think that chinese entrepreneurial drive and creativity is something to be celebrated and welcomed he said however he acknowledged that rising national security concerns in the us have affected private companies creating an atmosphere of uncertaintyaddressing the issue of us export controls and other measures aimed at containing chinas technological development gibbs said the concept of containing china has been misconstrued and destructivefrom a business perspective he explained the notion of containment does not apply all businesses do better when the economy is strong and consumers have more buying power why would anyone want to contain that americas businesses want chinas economy to be strong and the people prosperous he saidregarding the current strained relations between the us and china gibbs said assigning blame serves no purpose the restrictions on both sides mean consumers lose out and innovation suffers the goal should be to fix the relationship so that these kinds of restrictions will not be necessary beijing called on washington to maintain

of diplomatic relations between china and the us craig allen president of the uschina business council said that since the establishment of ties we have experienced peace and prosperity throughout all of asiaperhaps most importantly effective ties and constant diplomacy have led to an unprecedented halfcentury of peace in the asiapacific region and this is not something we should take for granted he saidpositive dialogue and interaction are necessary between the united states and china on finance trade and economics instead of resorting to tariffs an observer has saidsuch dialogue leads to positive trade interactions said anthony moretti department head and an associate professor of the communication and organizational leadership department at robert morris university in pennsylvaniait increases the potential for foreignowned businesses in both nations it carries with it the potential for good jobs for thousands of peoplemoretti referred to the fifth chinaus financial working group meeting held in shanghai on aug there exist two parallel tracks when you think of the us and china he saidthe political track is filled with all kinds of negativity from the us whether it be tariffs other forms of sanctions dubious legislative items or the daily negative rhetoric not much in the way of positive news comes out of thatbut the business community understands how essential it is for the us and china to find ways to keep as many doors open as possible and to ensure that optimistic dialogue existsdescribing the conversation william pesek a columnist focusing on global economics politics and financial markets called the uschina financial stress hotline a welltimed connection in an asia times articlethe us and chinas agreement to name point people to handle future financial stress events in the worlds two biggest economies and beyond could hardly be better timed he saidthis dialogue framework is the most notable deliverable from last weeks meeting of the financial working group created last year following us treasury secretary janet yellens  china visitnicholas tabor deputy assistant secretary for international financial markets at the us treasury department said in a speech in june that china and the us account for some  percent of global banking assets and are the home authority to  of the worlds  global systemically important banksthe domestic financial stability of the us and china has significant implications for global financial stability and our policies have an outsized effect on how financial risks evolve globally tabor saidworking directly with our chinese counterparts can help advance many of treasurys priorities including our financial stability objective our climate goals and the effectiveness of our global efforts to combat money laundering and illicit financethe process of establishing channels of communication has progressed but much remains to be done he saidmoretti said green technology is good for china the us and the world so it is meaningful to make efforts to assist companies that create products that are costeffective and good for the environment the politicians know that cooperation in areas such as pandemic research overcoming food insecurity and creating goodfortheclimate products brings positive results when china and the us are working together he saidus president joe biden has touted green initiatives but also announced new tariffs on chinese imports including electric vehicles amid us officials accusations about chinese manufacturing overcapacity and their concerns about national securitymake no senseif you say you believe in something then demonstrate a real commitment to it moretti said adding that the tariffs imposed by the biden administration on chinese evs make no sensewashington wants a healthier climate and yet it is deliberately blocking cars that are affordable of good quality and good for the globe from us consumers it defies common sense to preach a message of being climatefriendly and then slam the door on one such opportunity he saidif the us showed a commitment to longterm strategic thinking as china has when it comes to the most modern technologies then it would enjoy strong market share for such productsthey did not so the criticism of china for doing so is weakmoretti said more governors and mayors are leading business delegations to chinathose local and state leaders understand that american jobs created by chinesebased companies are as good as those from usbased companies that is another example of winwin cooperation we need to see more of thatfor harmon barlow executive director of the kentucky dairy development council his participation in the fourth annual uschina agriculture roundtable in multiple cities in china in june was nothing like what i was kind of expectingi had a lot of preconceived ideas about what to expect he told the audience on thursday at an online event to share his experiences there were times i was a little bit even apprehensive about making the trip but it turned out to be a great experienceaccording to min fan executive director of the us heartland china association ushca which organized the roundtable with several chinese agencies the delegation visited universities farms and agriculturalexperiment stations in china they enjoyed talking with their counterparts and also sightseeingwe had a wonderful enlightened trip fan saidbarlow has been to europe south america and africa and knows well the international dairy markets including chinas the trip his first to china opened his eyes to other facets of the countryand china its amazing how they have developed their own industry in the dairy world and are using much less exports than they ever have before barlow saidhe was amazed to see the work ethic in chinaeverybody is working everybody has something to do he said theres no wasteone thing he noticed is how land is used in china when we were on those bullet trains and you looked across you saw every inch of available land was in food production i thought that was fascinatingbarlow was also struck by other aspects of china i found it was obviously the cleanest and probably safest place ive ever been he saidhe said it was fascinating to see practically zero obesity in china and the citizens were very healthy and werent facing a lot of the issues that is really epidemic in our country today with obesity and things like thatthe trip led barlow to realize that it is important to keep the dialogue going its better to talk than to yell at each other and go through what the tvs sayfor olga boldentiller dean of agriculture at tuskegee university it was also her first time in chinai think what was most enlightening for me was the conversation around how the us can partner with china to really address global food security and do so from an educational standpoint she saidi like the model that china has with a few other organizations where they are partnering with developing countries to do work on the ground in china to really uplift a lot of their producers and some of the agricultural practices boldentiller saidlou swanson professor emeritus from colorado state university said he enjoyed the aspect of global citizenship from the trip at colorado state university we really think that peopletopeople studenttostudent facultytofaculty relationships are the core for having any kind of global citizenship said swansonwhat this trip did — and ive taken many delegations of students and faculty to china over the years — is the peopletopeople dimensionswanson said that trade and cultural exchanges are important to avoid misunderstandings that can lead to conflict trips like this help people to understand the importance but also the precariousness of not attending to this global citizenship he saidchina has made major technological advancements in the energy storage and electric vehicle sectors and us companies could be at a disadvantage if us policies preclude them from cooperating strategically with chinese companies an expert saidin an online discussion about cooperation between the united states and china on climate change joanna lewis director of the science technology and international affairs program at georgetown university said the two countries need to expand cooperationthe event on tuesday was presented by the center for american progresslewis said political and economic tensions between the us and china are high and that is exactly when engagement on climate change is of the utmost importance to avoid derailing all the progress that weve made in our engagement with china over the last plus yearsshe said us engagement with china on climate change and clean energy has helped to build up chinas own capacity to track and reduce its emissions as well as its ability to promote a lowcarbon energy transitionand today we see that china has leapfrogged many other countries in these areas and our bilateral exchanges have become much more of a twoway street lewis said i also see that engagement has led to increased ambition transparency and trust between our two countriesshe said us president joe biden administrations inflation reduction act which she said moved the us in the right direction of making clean energy industries more competitive globally may have gone too far in terms of completely excluding chinese entities from participating in the us clean energy sectori think there has to be a conversation about our respective roles in global clean energy supply chains without just letting it devolve into a global trade war that will slow the lowcarbon transition globally she saidlewis visited china this summer for the first time since the pandemic meeting with chinese officials and touring chinas new clean energy manufacturing facilities she said she witnessed how china is leading the world in some aspects of green technologiesshe said there are ways that are smart and protect national security but also allow us to leapfrog and take advantage of a lot of the real impressive innovation that were seeing coming out of china lewis saidshe said the us should also have conversations with china on tough issues such as trade and research or it could risk derailing cooperation on climate changewe need to hit that headon i think its silly to make engagement on basic science a political issue lewis saidpresident xi jinping has urged washington to view china and its development in a positive and rational light and work with china to find a right way for two major countries to get alonghe made the comments when he met with visiting united states national security advisor jake sullivan at the great hall of the people in beijing on thursday

and tech professionals are expressing their alarm on social media about being harassed in what they described as a small dark room at the secondary inspection areas of immigration and border authorities in the united states videothe trend has sparked heightened concerns among international students about traveling to the us in turn fueling calls for the us to halt the revocation of legally obtained visas and stemming the disruption to peopletopeople exchangeschinese student chen guo not his real name began his journey to boston massachusetts in  after he was accepted by harvard medical school however his academic dream quickly turned into a nightmare when on arrival in the us city he was subjected to an hour secondary inspection by us customs and border protection officerssharing his harrowing experience on chinese social media platform xiaohongshu earlier this year chen described how the officers scrutinized his emails and online browsing history and chat recordsthe ordeal reached its climax when they discovered a screenshot of a news photo celebrating a successful chinese satellite launch in his digital album despite his legally obtained visa chens entry was denied and he was unceremoniously deportedthey made me stand against a wall with a measuring scale for a photo isnt that how criminals are photographed chen said i never thought i would face such mental humiliationtwo weeks after chen was deported he received a collect parcel from the us which charged him  in postal fees and contained his electronic devices seized by us customsa chinese employee surnamed liu from an international internet company specializing in short video services shared a similar ordeal through his wechat public accountliu had thought he was on a routine business trip departing from guarulhos international airport in sao paulo brazil on march  he wrote in his wechat social media account life has become increasingly simple in middle age and a single backpack is enough for a fiveday business trip across continentshowever his experience at the border in houston texas shattered his relaxed and cheerful mood after getting off the planea cbp officer subjected him to the secondary inspection area at george bush intercontinental airport lius electronic devices were seized and he was interrogated for over  hoursthey asked me if i and my company were engaged in data theft spreading sensitive information and connected to chinese governments liu saidlius valid visa was eventually revoked despite his role in company logistics strategy leading to his deportation from the us and a severe blow to his career liu later learned from a cbp officer that his sufferings arose because his name was similar to that of a chinese scientistthe secondary inspection area is referred to as the small dark room on chinese social media although interviewees clarify it is not literally small or dark but labeled so due to the harassment and oppressive atmospheremore than  chinese students from computerrelated fields have been subjected to unwarranted harassment scrutiny and deportation by us authorities according to latest accountsmost were graduate students whose research areas included artificial intelligence information science cybersecurity electrical engineering software engineering and electronic information engineeringwhen the students applied for their visas the us side would have done the necessary security background checks that is to say they passed the security risk screening to get the visa said wu xinbo dean of fudan universitys institute of international studies and director of the center for american studies at fudan universitybut now even if you get a visa it is highly possible that you can be refused entry and deported when you enter the us which is not reasonableshi yinhong director of the center on american studies at renmin university of china said that these absurd incidents have been on the rise amid the escalating china threat rhetoric with the us increasingly viewing china as its main competitorshi said that the focus on national security signals a rise in protectionism and underscores us insecurity about advancements in science and technologywu from fudan university said the political motivation behind the phenomenon is clear — it aims to control and restrict cultural exchanges between the two countries for national security directly leading to a decline in peopletopeople interactionsmany online discussion forums have been organized through chinese social media platforms to address the concerns with students sharing their educational backgrounds and internship experiences and asking whether their academic credentials might affect their visa applications and entryfor students majoring in business and data at my university will there be issues with visa approvals i believe my major isnt sensitive but im worried that pursuing this degree might be futile asked one forum participantdepends on your luck replied another forum userchen the student who was heading to harvard medical school advised through his social media account that chinese students from universities identified as sensitive by the us should consider refraining from pursuing studies or postdoctoral positions in the countrya student surnamed chou who graduated in  from the university of california san diego said the us has long claimed to be a lighthouse of openness and inclusiveness but its actions run into the opposite directioncompared to the risk of being inspected and deported during each trip to and from the us it is a wiser choice to pursue higher education outside the us chou saidwe have already witnessed a significant decrease in the number of chinese students studying in the us over the past two years and this downward trend is expected to persist fudan universitys wu saidaccording to the open doors report on international educational exchange while china remains the largest source of international students in the us the total number has dropped from  to  in the past four years india surpassed china to become the largest source of international graduate students in  the proportion of chinese students in engineering fields is also decreasing annuallya source from an overseas study consultancy firm in shanghai said that us visa rejection rates for doctoral students in hightech fields are notably high even when they are not rejected the students face rigorous scrutiny prompting many to seek study opportunities in other countries like britain singapore and australia or at european universitiesexperts said that under the pretext of safeguarding national security us law enforcement authorities have overstretched the concept of national security and arbitrarily interrogated and repatriated chinese students which has caused a chilling effect and seriously affected the atmosphere of peopletopeople exchanges between the two countriesthe us attitude toward cultural and educational exchanges might be influenced by the us election and political situation said wu from fudan university adding that the us should act responsibly and be more open and inclusive in peopletopeople exchangesin a move that could further strain chinaus relations and potentially hamper technological advancement the united states government is expected to impose new restrictions on the use of chinesemade software in autonomous vehiclesthe latest development is part of a broader trend of increasing scrutiny and limitations placed on chinese tech companies operating in the us raising concerns about their impact on economic ties and consumer interestsaccording to sources cited by reuters the us department of commerce is set to propose regulations that would ban the use of chinesemade software in autonomous and connected vehicles in the coming weeksthe move which is expected to target vehicles with level  automation and above will effectively prevent chinese companies from testing their autonomous vehicles on us roadsadditionally the proposal might seek to prohibit vehicles equipped with chinesedeveloped advanced wireless communication modules from operating in the usa us commerce department spokesperson said the department is concerned about the national security risks associated with connected technologies in connected vehiclesthe anticipated move of the administration of us president joe biden has drawn criticism from experts who argue that it prioritizes national security concerns over consumer interests and technological progressthis is unfortunate its another case of national security concerns trumping consumer interests while further harming economic ties between the two countries zhiqun zhu a professor of political science and international relations at bucknell university in lewisburg pennsylvania told china dailythe anticipated ban could have a huge negative impact on the global autonomous vehicle industry given chinas dominance in key technologies such as light detection and ranging or lidar experts saidhesai technology a shanghaibased lidar enterprise with an office in palo alto california has faced increasing scrutiny in recent months it was added to the us defense departments list of chinese military companies earlier this yearhesai sued the pentagon arguing that there was no evidence of its connection to the chinese military although the company was subsequently removed from the list the incident highlights the precarious position of chinese tech enterprises operating in the usregarding the anticipated software ban a hesai spokesperson told china daily that the company is not likely to bear the brunt as it is essentially a hardware company and doesnt make software or handle data storage and transmissionwhile the us is considering banning vehicles with chinesemade systems some chinese companies are making progress in the us marketweride a chinese autonomous tech company recently received approval from the california public utilities commission to test its selfdriving vehicles with passengers in san jose and nearby areas this threeyear permit allows the company to operate test vehicles both with and without a driverweride said it is aware of the anticipated regulations to ban the use of chinesemade software in autonomous vehicles but declined to comment because it is not a rule yetthe biden administrations anticipated move is just one example of the challenges facing chinese tech companies that are seeking to expand their operations in the us several other chinese companies particularly in the electric vehicle industry have encountered rising suspicion of and obstacles to their us expansion plansone notable case involved gotion a chinese ev battery manufacturer whose planned  billion factory in michigan has faced significant setbacksdespite promising to create  jobs with competitive wages the gotion project has been mired in controversy and legal disputes local opposition and concerns raised by us lawmakers have stalled the development planzhu the professor argued that restrictions on chinese investments in the us would result in a loselose situation for both countriesmany chinese companies would like to expand their businesses abroad to enhance their profiles create new markets and become more competitive globally he said if they invest in the us they will not only create new jobs for local communities here but also offer american consumers more options of the goods and services availableexperienced chinese construction companies could potentially help us cities and towns address outdated infrastructure but they are being shut out due to socalled national security concerns he saidas chinaus tension continues to escalate in the technology sector there are growing calls for a more balanced approachthe two governments need to establish some protocol on national security in order to avoid political intervention in normal business dealings zhu said adding

states and are a product of a complex trilateral trade relationshipafter former us president donald trump imposed tariffs on chinese imports and restricted chinese investments starting in march  the company making the cups fuling plastics began to face tariffs on many of its productsas a result fuling moved a factory to indonesia around  it also moved some production to monterrey mexico and then fuling opened a factory in pennsylvaniafuling plastics is not the only chinese company moving factories to north america amid rising uschina geopolitical tensionsmonterrey is the capital of nuevo leon

mexico rose  percent yearonyear chinese companies now represent the fastestgrowing source of foreign investment in mexicothe trend of chinese investment in mexico started around  and will likely continue as the us imposes more tariffs on chinese products and industriesthe increasing tariffs from the us have been imposed on items from china such as solar panels electric vehicles and ev batteries which have led to shipping costs rising about six times melchiorre saidwhen youre producing commodity products and shipping costs rise that much your product is now  to  percent higher so i think it becomes more and more attractive to manufacture in mexico as we continue to face these challenges melchiorre saidmexicos exports to the us last year surpassed chinas for the first time in two decades a development linked to the political tensions between china and the us however the trade relationship between china and the us is resilient even under strained conditionsresearchers analyzed the evolution of the trilateral trade relationship between mexico the us and china from  to  and found that in general for every  percent increase in mexicos exports to the us mexicos imports from china increased by  percentxuedong liu professor of economics and engineering at the national autonomous university of mexico noted that since  about half of the us trade surplus with mexico has been offset by a growing deficit with china making mexico a key assembly hub for north america and china an influential player in the regions tradecosteffective goodsmexico chose chinese products not for political reasons but for their high costeffectiveness and the lack of substitutes from other countries liu told china dailythe primary reason is that mexicos local supply chain is not robust enough to meet all its needs to increase exports to the us mexico must also increase its imports these imports dont necessarily have to come from china they could come from other countries he saidhowever mexico ultimately chooses chinese products due to their competitive pricing this choice isnt driven by any specific policy or political measure but by market economicschinese products offer better value for money compared to those from other countries if this werent the case local manufacturers in mexico would opt for imports from countries like vietnam indonesia or brazil however these countries either lack competitive pricing or a complete supply chain for certain products liu addedthe joe biden administration in july announced new tariffs on imports of mexican steel containing chinese components the us will now impose a  percent tariff on such steel the same rate imposed on steel from china previously mexican steel with chinese components was exempt from dutythese tariffs that the united states put in place specifically to try to prevent metals that come from china from entering their country represent a risk for mexican exports because part of the exports are produced in china and not in mexico and in the short term it is very unlikely that mexico will be able to change that so those commodities are produced here ana azuara commodity markets specialist at grupo financiero base told bnamericas an online source of daily business information and intelligence on latin americathe tariffs were costly for mexico and to compensate for the economic toll the us and mexico agreed that steel imported from brazil that is processed in mexico and then exported to the us will not be subject to tariffs liu saidbut brazilian steel is not as costeffective as chinese steel it is currently very difficult to estimate the potential economic impact on mexico he saidunlike vietnam and malaysia mexico has a stronger industrial base to manufacture its own products especially after joining the north american free trade agreement nafta the predecessor to the usmca in usmca is a free trade agreement between the us mexico and canada which replaced nafta in still

mutual benefit and market principles liu saidsince  bilateral trade between china and mexico has not only been influenced by economic and market factors but also political ones liu said he said that it is a new characteristic of the trade relationshipmexico welcomes chinese investment in  ahead of his visit to china former mexican foreign minister marcelo ebrard said the country wants to deepen economic ties with china by increasing its exports and attracting more chinese investmentebrard told reporters via a video link from the group of  summit in osaka japan in  that he would be prioritizing the expansion of business ties during his visit to chinawhat were interested in is increasing mexicos presence in china mexicos capacity to export to china and chinas investments in mexico he said according to reutersthe structural reasons that are bringing capital to mexico are here to stay said juan carlos baker pineda mexicos former viceminister for external trade i have no indication that the trade war between china and the us is going to diminish any time soonwhile the chinese origin of the capital coming into mexico may be uncomfortable for the policies of some countries according to international trade legislation those products are to all intents and purposes mexican the bbc quoted him as sayingciting examplesan example of such products is mexicos auto manufacturing industry in  tesla announced plans to establish a factory in mexico which attracted a large number of suppliers to the countrymany of those suppliers were already producing components or raw materials for tesla in china the chinese auto parts makers are rapidly setting up plants on the outskirts of monterrey where tesla plans its manufacturing plantwhile made in mexico is gaining ground in the north american market chinese companies still hold an advantage due to their stronger technical and supply chain foundations experts saidmexico now aims to strengthen local supply chains and increase production value but this has been a longstanding issue while china has invested heavily in technology and research over the past  years mexico has not making it difficult to achieve these goals quickly liu saidmost of the companies going to mexico are bringing skills that we dont currently have in mexico jose luis enciso business intelligence director for keno consulting in beijing told china daily this will benefit us by introducing new skills and creating new suppliers it will also benefit the chinese investors because they will gain access to a new market and become more efficientmeanwhile it is not easy for chinese companies capital and technology to enter the mexican marketgoing to mexico has helped reduce lead times which is an advantage for our customers not having such a long lead time coming from china youre cutting your lead time from  days to  days to two weeks so there are a lot of advantages to producing in mexico melchiorre saidthere also are some disadvantages resin the raw material for melchiorres companys products is more expensive in mexico he said compared with china the cost of labor also is higher in mexico and shipping is very expensive especially when the company produces and ships throughout north americathe further north we go the more expensive and less competitive we are out of mexico melchiorre saidcultural differences are another issue for chinese companies operating in mexico there are not many latin americans who speak chinese and not many chinese who have spanish skills and industry experiencethat can lead to misunderstandings and make it difficult for companies to understand the local context said enciso whose company provides consulting services for chinese businesses entering mexicowhile mexican companies are accustomed to working with european and us firms integrating chinese companies can be challenging that is due to the need for local expertise in engineering legal and accounting services which also must align with the practices of chinese companies enciso addedenciso who also served as minister counselor for trade affairs at mexicos embassy in china remains positive about the future development of economic and trade relations between the two countrieswhile we dont have a free trade agreement in place mexico and china have developed a very good economic and policy dialogue over the past  years he saidthe recent efforts to strengthen ties between china and mexico involve multiple sectorschina southern airlines announced a direct route from shenzhen to mexico city in may and

carriers have opened new chinatomexico trade routes in recent months at the government level mexican tourism secretary miguel torruco visited china in july which led to support from both governments to continue strengthening bilateral relationshipscertainly the global policy environment will continue to evolve unfortunately with more protectionist measures and security concerns however i believe

and economic competition it remains universally acknowledged that cultural appreciation forms the cornerstone of international understanding despite current tensions between the united states and china the currency of soft power — based on cultural understanding and mutual respect especially among young people — can bring about peace and prosperityfollowing president xi jinpings invitation to  american youths to visit china over the next five years chinas central and provincial governments are bolstering efforts to give them opportunities for engagement with chinese society realizing the strategic value of cultural familiarityshortterm exchange programs for students and intensive mandarin language courses for instance improve language skills and foster a sophisticated understanding of chinas long history and diverse cultural heritagethe oneweek immersion program that duke kunshan university and jiangsu province developed for  students from duke university and other american colleges powerfully exemplifies this investment in mutual understanding this initiative which will take place in august promises to be an exciting voyage through the cultural historical and economic strongholds of nanjing suzhou and shanghai — cities that have witnessed chinas remarkable present and the ebb and flow of the countrys storied pastshortterm exchange programs apparently have the potential to improve understanding however a harvard business review insight — a customer retained is several folds less costly than a new one acquired — suggests that investing in us students already enrolled in fulltime degree programs in china could be more advantageous and economically costeffectiveschools such as dku are trailblazers in providing a globaloriented degree education in a chinese setting giving students a global outlook and the capacity to prosper in a multicultural society immersed in chinas educational and cultural environment international students have the potential to become genuine ambassadors of cultural understanding bridging gaps through their firsthand accountsas the executive vice chancellor of dku an englishspeaking researchoriented liberal arts and sciences university located just outside of shanghai i am quite familiar with the powerful results that these kinds of exchanges can deliverconsider the case of peter ballentine an american student of the dku class of  dku prides itself on having a truly international campus community with about  percent of its student body being international international students account for no more than  percent of all students at most other universities while attending dku ballentine made friends with students from all over the world and worked together with his professors and fellow students on everything from the curriculum to the schools culture which gave him invaluable experience collaborating with people from different cultural backgrounds after graduation he received funding from the national science foundation graduate research fellowship program of the united states for his work with a duke university research team and is currently pursuing a phd in electrical engineering at columbia universityby observing the success stories of ballentine and many of his peers it becomes clear to me that it is imperative to establish more incentives such as scholarships for american students to enroll in degree programs in china live here learn about its transformation into the secondlargest economy in the world in merely four decades something unprecedented in human history and recognize the complexity of its cultureit becomes even more urgent that more americans can study fulltime in china especially considering that the number of chinese students studying in the us far exceeds that of american students in china that is a challenge not only for china but also for the us regardless of whether the us considers china a major rival or a potential partner in solving global problems this disparity suggests that chinese students and likely future leaders of china are far more knowledgeable about the us than americans are about chinaof course cultural exchanges which go beyond student exchanges include organizing academic and business conferences that emphasize global issues like public health and environmental conservation as the two biggest economic powers china and the us can use such forums to advance initiatives that prevent pandemics and address climate changein addition chinas history culture and  unesco world heritage sites remain huge attractions to many westerners more accessible or visafree agreements may inspire more americans to travel to china more than once by showcasing attractions beyond beijing shanghai and xianlinguistic proficiency is also essential for cultural diplomacy more accessible chineselanguage training at institutions in the us will allow american students to engage more deeply with chinese culture and ideas building enduring appreciation and relationshipsnot to be overlooked is the role of sports and performing arts in diplomacy friendlies in soccer and basketball along with global tours from institutions like the new york philharmonic convey heartfelt exchanges that create lasting memories for participants and spectators alike as with the symbolic pingpong diplomacy  years ago such events spawn friendships beyond the realm of politics chinas adorable envoys the giant pandas also have a unique role to play as they transcend language and politics to generate goodwill and improve conservationin summary the key to overcoming geopolitical tensions lies not necessarily in grand gestures but in a constant flow of cultural exchanges across a wide range of fields including language art education sports and wildlife diplomacy every little bit helps every single persontoperson interaction counts by improving cultural understanding at the individual level the us and china can develop a spirit of cooperation that is

from the frontline chinas war on poverty now a focal point in a censorship controversyhow can we learn from what they did chan asked after watching this documentary i can tell you it took a lot of innovative business models anticorruption efforts planned relocation and incredible sacrifice and hard work on the part of the chinese peopleproduced by pbs in  the film a collaboration between investment banker and china expert robert kuhn and emmywinning director peter getzels documented chinas methods to lift  million people out of extreme poverty in the past  yearsthe film crew traversed china engaging with locals for indepth discussions and exploring bottomup povertyalleviation programs that played a crucial role in eradicating poverty for the final  million people impoverishedhowever after its initial release the documentary faced harsh criticism from antichina politicians who accused it of portraying china in an overly positive light their pressure led to pbs taking down the film after a single showingpbs didnt respond to a request for comment from china dailyi have seen this documentary and also traveled to china since i was a young child witnessing firsthand how china has modernized and uplifted the poorest said chan a volunteer with the china is not our enemy campaign of the antiwar group codepinkshe cited the world banks  report which revealed that china contributed close to three quarters of the global reduction in extreme poverty over the past  years thats pretty incredible she addedone of the key takeaways for chan from the film was the unwavering political will demonstrated by the chinese governmentfrom young cadre in small villages to chinese president xi jinping himself this has been their priority — to dedicate themselves to serving people through poverty alleviation she explained maybe thats the little secret pbs doesnt want us to know they dont want us to know that china is working hard to meet peoples needs while

awareness of the film hoping to encourage broader discussion among americansthe group stressed that the documentary provides not only insights into successful poverty alleviation but also a deeper understanding of china a country often demonized in the public eye in the uscensoring the documentary only serves those wanting to escalate divisions between the us and china warned codepink on its website by censoring voices from the frontline chinas war on poverty they also deprive the public of the opportunity to learn about povertyalleviation policies that have changed millions of lives

codepink san francisco organizer cynthia papermaster at the rally pbs is supposed to be an educational broadcasting company so show the film and have discussionrichard becker west coast coordinator of the answer coalition noted that poverty once a prominent topic in us presidential campaigns has been sidelinedmaybe theres a fear of the elite that if they showed something about how this miraculous transformation has happened in china — alleviating poverty for  million people — that you might have to start talking about poverty in the united states he saidjulie tang a retired san francisco superior court judge and cofounder of pivot to peace recounted her own experience witnessing chinas transformation when she visited china  years ago she saw people living in shabby houses next to mountains in a dangerous environment today those things are no more we see beautiful houses lined up she saidpeople are prevented from seeing the truth of whats happening in china it is a shame

major factor driving prices lower bloomberg reported but it said europe the us india and others are pushing back against chinas dominance and tariffs and further protectionist measures could slow down

mckinsey mobility consumer pulse surveythe survey showed that  percent of current ev owners in the us said that they are likely or very likely to switch back to a traditional gas car primarily due to the high price of evs and anxiety over longdistance driving because of an insufficient number of public charging stationsin china where evs accounted for  percent of new passengercar sales as of may

producer in china and the leading one in the world said william kirby a professor of china studies and business administration at harvard universityin a recent interview with harvard magazine kirby said that such a partnership would benefit the us because china is the leader in clean technology — from solar panels to batteries to evs he said a number of chinese companies would like to manufacture evs in the american market but politics get in the wayhe pointed to the collaboration between ford and catl saying political pressures on ford both from politicians and unions made this very difficult to doford announced last summer that it would invest  billion in the battery venture but had to suspend the project after congress initiated two federal investigations into its license deal with catlaccording to bridge michigan ford resumed the construction this year but the investment was reduced by  billion and the number of new jobs will be reduced by kirby called the us tariff on chinas evs a statement of a kind of technological isolation that to me makes no sense for uswe need to take a step back and think of why are we doing this if we could partner with several of these competing companies ford and catl or general motors and byd why would it be in the national interest of the united states to oppose this he saidchinas evs have a much larger presence in the eu market

brands in the eu marketchinese evs are known for their innovation and technology companies such as nio byd and xpeng are recognized for their technological advancements including battery technology autonomous driving features and smart connectivity those innovations appeal to european consumers looking for the latest technology in their vehicles the mckinsey report saidas a result the report

pushing back against the recently proposed  percent tariff on chinesemade shiptoshore sts cranes warning that the increased costs would have a substantial negative impact on the economyin a series of letters to the us trade representative ustr port authorities terminal operators and industry groups across the country have called for the decision to be reversed or delayed arguing that the tariffs will harm port efficiency disrupt supply chains and ultimately raise prices for consumersthe tariff which was announced by the white house in may as part of a broader trade initiative targeting chinese goods is set to take effect on aug  despite mounting opposition president joe bidens administration has defended the move as necessary to protect american manufacturers and rebuild domestic industriescritics argue however that the tariff will do little to achieve those goals as there are currently no us manufacturers of sts cranes and the global market is dominated by chinese companiescurrently at least seven ports in the united states have  cranes on order from chinese manufacturers with an average cost of  million per crane according to the american association of port authorities aapa the ports now face at least  million in new unexpected costs if the tariff is implementedthe tariff if imposed will not meet its stated objectives aapa president and ceo cary davis wrote in a letter to us trade representative katherine tai on june  instead it will only result in negative outcomes including grave harm to port efficiency and capacity strained supply chains increased consumer prices and a weaker us economythe port of new orleans for example is planning a major expansion of its container capacity it estimates that the tariff would cost  million for its new louisiana international terminal alonethe port of virginia has already signed contracts for  cranes from chinese companies at a cost of  million and could face an additional  million in costs due to the tariffthe aapa also noted that a recent survey suggested at least an additional  cranes were expected to be ordered in the next five years to meet growing demandthe new tariff targets sts cranes which are used to load and unload containerships amid claims by some officials and media reports that the cranes made by chinese manufacturers may be vulnerable to data breaches due to remote control capabilitiesin february biden announced a  billion investment to build sts cranes in the us citing cybersecurity concerns around chinesemade cranesshanghai zhenhua heavy industries co zpmc the worlds largest manufacturer of port equipment has denied the allegationsthe us ports industry also has dismissed the claims as largely unfounded and points out that multiple federal agencies are already addressing any potential security concerns its unnecessary to impose a tariff to secure us ports said the aapathat was echoed by another letter submitted by port houston and jointly signed by  other ports and groups imposing tariffs on these high cost low tech pieces of equipment would in fact damage an important strategic objective of modernizing and improving us infrastructure and put the economic health of our communities and our country in jeopardy they warnedthe opponents also highlighted the lack of viable alternatives to chinesemade cranes zpmc dominates the global market while germany and finland the other two countries producing a small fraction of sts cranes source most of their components from china making their products subject to the  percent tariff as wellcurrently there are no manufacturers of sts cranes in the united states nor have there been for nearly four decades therefore there is no timeline for when sts cranes might be available domestically and the tariff on chinese cranes will do nothing to protect american manufacturers from unfair practices said the aapacritics also noted that the tariff contradicts the biden administrations commitment to infrastructure improvement and emissionreduction delays in port investments including those in zeroemission equipment would negatively impact the domestic green economy and the industries the tariff aims to protect they saidwhen it comes to securing steady lasting progress in chinaunited states relations it boils down to listening to public opinion and responding to the peoples aspirations a former senior diplomat saidyang wanming who is president of the chinese peoples association for friendship with foreign countries told china daily in a recent interview that the more frequently the people of the two countries interact with each other the more solid the foundation of public opinion for the development of chinaus relations will belooking back on history he said that every pivotal

taiwan independence separatists for conducting or inciting secession is a serious warning to them experts sayfor ringleaders or those committing significant crimes life imprisonment or a term of imprisonment of more than  years can be imposed with the possibility of the death penalty for those causing particularly severe harm to the country and the people judicial guidelines issued on june  saidit is a heavy and headon blow to the activities of taiwan independence separatists and it comes in a very timely fashion said wu huiqiu chairman of the board of the washington china unification promoting associationthe guidelines jointly issued by the supreme peoples court the supreme peoples procuratorate and the ministries of public security state security and justice allow for trial in absentia in some casesthe move comes amid escalating tensions across the taiwan strait triggered by repeated separatist attempts made by those advocating taiwan independence particularly since the islands new leader lai chingte who holds strong separatist views took office in mayanthony moretti department head and an associate professor of the communication and organizational leadership department at robert morris university in pennsylvania said that if the separatists continue to see the island as an independent country and themselves as friends of the united states and the west that is the equivalent of walking past a fire and throwing more gasoline on itthe fire only gets hotter and bigger and theres even more potential for problems moretti saidclear signalby issuing the judicial guidelines the central authorities are sending another clear signal and serious warning that taiwans hardcore separatists will be severely punished and they should not have the slightest illusion regarding that wu saidon thursday taiwans mainland affairs council said it would raise the travel alert for the chinese mainland hong kong special administrative region and macao special administrative region to the secondhighest orange alert advising residents to avoid nonessential travelthe next day the taiwan affairs office of the state council said the judicial document does not target most people in taiwan but a few diehard taiwan independence separatiststaiwan compatriots should not have any concerns about traveling across the strait said zhu fenglian spokeswoman for the officethe guidelines deal with stubborn taiwan independence supporters rather than ordinary people of taiwan wu said the line is drawn very clearlymoretti said the in absentia provision seems reasonable because those identified by the chinese mainland but living in taiwan are unlikely to travel there for any trialoutside of the likely harsh comments that the us and the west will offer i dont see any penalties or sanctions coming moretti said china will remind the global audience that outside governments should not interfere with the domestic issues of any countrywu said the judicial guidelines also send a clear signal to the worldthat is to say the taiwan question is one that china can solve by itself and it is reasonable legitimate and necessary for china to use its law and legal procedures to punish the taiwan independence separatiststhere is no position for external forces to intervene and there is no reason for them to say anything about the guidelineswu said he hopes the democratic progressive party realizes the seriousness of the problem abandons its position on taiwan independence and returns to the basis of the  consensus so that it can embark on the path of peaceful development toward reunificationit should be said that the only hope for taiwans fate and future is the ultimate reunification of the motherlandxinhua contributed to this storygiant pandas

far side of the moon has ignited discussions about the united states approach to exclude china from space projects with experts emphasizing that the us should focus on inclusion rather than exclusionthe change  probe returned to earth on tuesday bringing back rock and soil samples from the lunar far side which always faces away from the planetthe probe landed on the moon on june  and lifted off two days later to start its journey back to earth the far side of the moon presents unique technical challenges for both landing and liftoff yet china managed to land the probe collect samples and bring them back safelythe retrieved samples are expected to shed light on the origins of the solar system while the potential for tapping lunar resources offers a promising path for collaboration between the us and china particularly in advancing artificial intelligence technologies according to an editorial posted by a silicon valleybased think tank and consultancy sinotalksprior to the change  mission china published the worlds first highdefinition lunar geologic atlas to among other goals facilitate scientists identification of a proper site for a potential lunar station new knowledge acquired from analyses of samples brought back by the change  probe will enrich the content of the atlas making the establishment of a lunar station more promising mei gechlik founder and ceo of sinotalks told china dailywhen the lunar station is established indepth studies on the moons resources and evolution as well as studies on the whole solar system can be conducted more effectively which could lead to the discovery of new lunar resources for the development of ai hardware more powerful than existing semiconductors she saidin addition innovative ai applications could be tested at the lunar station under conditions not available on earth gechlik said these longterm and expansive benefits should motivate china and the united states to collaborate by contributing the financial capital and human capital needed to pull off this feattaylah bland a researcher at the asia society policy institutes center for china analysis also sees potential for chinaus cooperationchinas latest achievement as the first country to land on the far side of the moon reinforces its space exploration strengths and capabilities bland wrote in a newsletter despite an ongoing space race with the united states chinas collaboration with the european space agency on the change  mission highlights the potential for cooperation not competition she saidhowever a major hurdle stands in the way of such collaboration — the ongoing tensions between the two nations the us has actively excluded china from nasa projects since  and has intensified restrictions to limit chinas access to usdeveloped technologies to contain its ai developmentthis exclusionary approach of the us according to sinotalks is meant to weaken chinas space technology advancement but it might be backfiring as it bars us participation in chinas space missionsunlike their counterparts from france italy and sweden engaging in moonrelated research supported by payloads carried by the change  probe us scientists have missed these opportunities because us restrictions have also excluded them from participating in chinas space projects sinotalks saidthe think tanks editorial board further questioned whether the restrictions would genuinely hinder chinas ai development given its ability to overcome obstacles and continue with its space explorationthe us restrictions are unlikely to be dismantled soon but chinas historic lunar mission presents an opportunity for a shift in its stance said gechlik the sinotalks ceothe  billionyearold lunar samples brought back by the change  probe are  billion years older than samples brought back by the us and the former soviet union decades ago she said noting that china has a good opportunity to extend an olive branch to the us by inviting the countrys scientists to study the new samples togetherthe determination of us scientists to stay competitive in lunar exploration may prompt them to urge us authorities to accept chinas olive branch she said adding if this occurs a new era of moon diplomacy will begin chinas antidoping authorities have hit back at what is described as groundless accusations made by overseas media and in particular its united states counterpart for manipulating facts and undermining the countrys antidoping effortsthe china antidoping agency known as chinada issued a statement on thursday against misrepresentations made by the united states antidoping agency usada at a congressional hearing on tuesdayduring the hearing usada ceo travis tygart made baseless accusations against chinada and the world antidoping agency or wada claiming they were involved in covering up an intentional doping case involving  chinese swimmers in early  a comprehensive investigation had found that the swimmers were not at fault due to a mass contamination incidentthis has severely undermined the reputation of chinada wada and the global antidoping system usadas brazen long arm jurisdiction is undoubtedly a manifestation of outandout hegemonism and imperiousness said the chinada statementits intention to manipulate the case for political purposes is all too clear which runs counter to the principles of fairness justice and integrity it has claimed to championusada is seeking to undermine the wellfunctioning world antidoping order that the antidoping community has worked hard to build and shake up or even subvert the global antidoping governance system which is designated to serve the athletes all over the world equally so as to seize the global antidoping leadership role we strongly reject and oppose such movein response to the  incident wada ran its own investigation on reports by chinada and reviewed the case strictly supported by an external consultation before concluding that no athletes should be held accountable for doping violations the  swimmers involved were proven to have ingested banned substance trimetazidine or tmz unwittingly after inadvertently being exposed to it at a hotel so that their tests at the competition returned positive results for an extremely low concentration of the substancethe case files which were supposed to be kept confidential after having been concluded as contamination in order to protect the athletes involved were somehow leaked to new york times and the german radio network ard which published hyped reports on an otherwise wouldremainundisclosed case in april three months ahead of the paris olympic games which open on july regarding the request of the usada ceo at the hearing to review the case file of the tmz contamination case its purpose is to legitimize the illegal access to and unauthorized disclosure of the information in the case file by media outlets including the new york times and ard and then form distorted and misleading conclusions through the socalled review and investigation with already preconceived judgement so as to reach the purpose of politicization of the contamination case chinada said in its statementwada also responded fiercely to usadas misleading accusation criticizing the agency for politicizing antidoping and calling it hypocritical and displaying doublestandards in a statement published on wednesdaywada president witold banka gave the example of a case involving us athlete erriyon knighton to illustrate usadas double standardthe promising sprinter tested positive for a banned steroid earlier this year but was allowed to compete in the us trials for the paris olympics after an arbitrator ruled this as a nofault contamination case in midjunewithout commenting on the merits it is difficult to understand how usada can declare in a statement that justice was served in this case given it had argued in the hearing that the analytical result was incompatible with meat contamination and had sought a sanction of four years against the athlete it is particularly intriguing that usada made this sudden uturn in its opinion without even having seen the reasoned decision which is not yet available banka saidi cannot help but wonder what usada would be saying if this had involved an athlete in chinacapital market decoupling between the united states and china is occurring to some extent and us restrictions targeting china have played a significant role experts saidthe us department of treasury issued a statement on friday saying that washington would draft rules to carry out an aug  executive order that called for limiting us investments in certain national security technologies and products in countries of concernthe rules applying to artificial intelligence semiconductors and quantum information technologies would prohibit some transactions in certain technologies and products that pose a particularly acute national security threat to the united states or would require that the treasury be first notified of the transactionsus venture capital firms are also pressuring technology startups to cut ties with chinese investors as they expect washington to tighten controls on foreign ownership the financial times reported on june heygen a generative ai startup founded in shenzhen in  that later relocated to los angeles asked its chinese investors to sell shares to their us counterparts ft reportedthere is no question in my mind that these developments are hugely influenced by the us governments tech bans and inbound and outbound investment screening and denial orders sourabh gupta a senior fellow at the institute for chinaamerica studies in washington told china dailythe vc market understandably is simply reacting to the us governments heavyhanded de jure and de facto prescriptionsin  thenus president donald trump signed the foreign investment risk review act which applied greater scrutiny to certain equity investments in areas related to critical technologies critical infrastructure or businesses with sensitive personal data as well as certain types of real estate transactions without explicitly naming chinagupta said that since then the us governments goal has been to shut down any gaps in those areas to prevent chinese entities from using even a minority investment position in earlystage companies to obtain new technologyus president joe biden signed an executive order last august to establish a foreign investment review mechanism to restrict us entities from investing in chinas

advanced computing including chips ai and quantum biotechnologies and biomanufacturing and clean area technologies — where the us would seek to maintain a leadgupta said those areas are where the us side would essentially seek to decouple from chinai think the impact of these policy decisions in the medium to long term will be momentous gupta saidon monday chinas ministry of commerce said the us has repeatedly emphasized that it has no intention of decoupling from china or hindering chinas economic development however it insists on issuing proposed rules to restrict us companies investments in china and suppress the normal development of chinese industries the ministry said in a statementgupta noted that uschina economic interdependence over the past four decades was built on their different endowments and comparative advantageshowever as china has raced up the technology ladder the difference in comparative advantage in the technical areas has shrunk markedly leading to greater resemblance than difference today in industrial structures particularly in advanced manufacturing sectorsgoal laid bareand so the goal for the us going forward is to decouple and suppress china in these sectors rather than countenance fair competition gupta saidwilliam jones a nonresident fellow at the chongyang institute for financial studies said us venture capitalists would certainly like to get a piece of the action in chinas hightech area while the us government is taken aback by chinas rapid progress in hightech and it seeks to restrain that progress by preventing venture capital from getting involved in chinathere is also pushback from some of the major business organizations that would like to see a less restrictive policy toward china from the us government restrictions by the us government on semiconductors and other fields will slow down but not stop the development of these technologies by chinaaccording to global corporate venturing data us corporate venture capital investors backed just  chinabased startup financings in  a  percent decrease from it is inevitable that more foreign investment will pour into china in the medium term seeking to cater to final demand

province in connection with a drugrelated money laundering case based on leads provided by us authorities tong has been apprehended on suspicion of illegal foreign exchange operations and the

successful exchanges held in february and march yielding positive results another onsite exchange is scheduled for the end of this monthadditionally china has launched a special campaign targeting online advertising related to fentanyllike substances and their precursors significantly reducing the quantity of such advertisements on various platforms in response to us requests china has been actively strengthening control over fentanyl and its precursors conducting law enforcement efforts to address the fentanyl issuein may  at the request of the us china was the first country to place the entire class of fentanyl substances under control aiding the international community in managing the fentanyl problem since then us counterparts have repeatedly indicated that they have not seized any fentanylrelated substances originating from china meanwhile the us has not achieved comprehensive control over fentanyl substances despite facing a crisis wei notedover the past decade china has supported all substance scheduling requests made by the us at the united nations commission on narcotic drugs demonstrating chinas commitment to assisting the us in addressing its fentanyl issue wei

substances for export to specific countries bringing the total to shan added that many uncontrolled chemicals have legitimate uses and synthetic drugs cannot be effectively regulated through endless listingsus treasury secretary janet yellens recent statement on trade with china was overly broad and protectionist according to trade expertsthe us is doing what it can and using arguments that it can marshal … to keep chinese goods out of its market sourabh gupta a senior fellow at the washingtonbased institute for chinaamerican studies told china dailyand that is protectionist purely he saidin her remarks at the economic club of new york last thursday yellen blamed chinas overconcentrated supply chain for posing a threat to us jobs and recent investments aimed at building americas green energy sectorshe also said chinas pursuit of its trade policies may interfere significantly with our efforts to build a healthy economic relationshipgupta said that yellen may be asserting that chinas high production capacity high savings rate and low consumption ratio are putting pressure on international marketsbut what economists would also say reciprocally is that the us runs a huge budget deficit and … that it is overconsuming at its end gupta said and therefore the united states kind of sucks in imports from overseas because it doesnt employ or have a balanced budget and therefore theres excess consumption on its endyellen has more than once said that chinas electric vehicles and other green industries have overcapacity that threatens the global supply chain china has countered that the us is essentially using the overcapacity narrative to kneecap other countries strong industries practice protectionism and trample on market principles and international trade rules in the name of fair competitiongupta said most subsidies provided by the chinese government on evs are consumer subsidies and that is wto legaland it is perfectly fine to subsidize infrastructure such as charging stations because the market would not do it on its owngupta said government subsidies are not uncommon for companiesthey didnt just spring up one day governments gave them subsidies — even things like the united states chip industry in the s he saidbut now the chinese government is letting that ev industry run mostly on market force lines and so china has nothing to hide in this regardgupta described the us as a completely protectionist and noncompliant client on trade issues which he said was the real opposition to yellens assertion of macroeconomic imbalances hurting the uschina tradehe said that the us would prefer china to remain downstream of the value chain but it is not for washington to make that callthat is for china to make its own decisions and for the market to make its own decisions he said china is moving far up the valueadded ladder very quickly in sophisticated export goods and the important thing that the us needs to do is try to come back into wtocompliant ways in which it deals with chinathe day after yellens speech the world bank released its global economic outlook in which it raised chinas gdp growth forecast from  percent to  percent in gary hufbauer a nonresident senior fellow at the washingtonbased peterson institute of international economics said that yellens statement targeting china is too broad to lead to a constructive outcomehufbauer said that the us has the right to criticize specific trade policies but it cannot dictate the shape of chinas industrial developmentgood chinese growth should attract more investment from europe japan and korea but not from the us under current geopolitical circumstances moreover if the us puts barriers on capital flows that will discourage investment into china from all sources said hufbauerjake sullivan us national security adviser is one of the main designers of the us science and technology defense strategy against china known as the small yard and high fencein an april speech sullivan said that us policy is to derisk rather than decouple from china which was called out by the chinese side as rhetoric without substanceunfortunately there are no boundaries on sullivans small yard high fence policy derisking may become more like decoupling hufbauer said much will depend on the outcome of the november presidential electiongupta said i think the simplest way to understand this is by understanding that the us wants to decouple from china in certain sectors and doesnt want to decouple in the other sectorshe said that substantial capital would flood into other industrial sectors except in areas such as semiconductors ai or quantum computing where the us and perhaps even western countries want to exclude foreign capital from entering chinathe chinese economy is huge trillions upon trillions and theres a lot of space for foreign investment to come in and earn rewards in the chinese market said gupta therefore a lot of money will also come in now and continue to come in for the long terma free trade group has requested another month to comment on plans by the united states to hike tariffs on chinese imports such as electric vehicles batteries

to life employment and development of the vast number of people in xinjiangthe sinister intentions of containing china by using xinjiang are clear for all to see he saidwashington has in recent years

over the past year dozens of volunteers for the th annual festival have been working diligently to preserve the tradition while also offering a fresh perspective to attendeesits very important for

the miluo riverthe recent words and actions of the united states including those of president joe biden on the taiwan question have been detrimental to crossstrait and uschina relations and the us should stop its provocations experts saidthe us knows that chinas red line is taiwan yes dont cross it just do not cross it anthony moretti associate professor and department head of communication and organizational leadership at robert morris university told china dailythe us has been blurring the onechina policy trying to remove the core elements and actually provoking the onechina principle recognized by the whole world wu huiqiu chairman of the board of the washington china unification promoting association saidin an interview with time magazine biden said us military involvement in taiwan would depend on the circumstances when asked whether he would deploy troops if necessary biden said he was not ruling out using us military forcethe defense security cooperation agency under the us department of defense announced last week that the us state department had approved two potential arms sales of  million to taiwan including the sale of f fighter jet spare parts and maintenance partsmoretti said the us calculation has to include a series of factors when deciding whether to use us military forcefirst the taiwan strait is geographically far from the us second basically youre playing on chinas home turf if the us sends troops to the strait third the us public would consider the recent failures because military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq ended poorly and the cost cannot be ignored moretti saidyou put it all together and to presume that the us would send troops i think is a bad suggestion he saidwu described bidens comment as a hypothetical vague and tactical expression and another move of playing the taiwan cardwhats bad is that hes sending misinformation that the taiwan independence forces in the island would see as a statement that the us is going to act on and that is negative for crossstrait relations wu saidwu also said he was concerned more about the actions including arms salesa delegation of  us defense contractors including lockheed martin and raytheon visited taiwan and held a closeddoor taiwanus defense industry forum with companies and organizations of the island in taipei last week steven rudder former us navy commander of the marine corps forces pacific attended the opening ceremonythis is another example of the biden administrations recent inconsistency in its words and deeds on the taiwan question which has made crossstrait mutual trust even more fragile and us relations even more fragile wu said the us has been playing the game for a long time and it is actually unwilling to see the two sides of the taiwan strait come togetherresponding to bidens comments on not ruling out military force mao ning spokeswoman for the chinese foreign ministry urged the us to stop arming taiwan and stop sending any wrong signals to taiwan independence separatist forcesarms sales opposedcommenting on the latest us plan for arms sales zhang xiaogang spokesman for chinas ministry of national defense urged the us to

harm the us itselfthe chinese peoples liberation army has intensified military training and enhanced combat preparedness to resolutely safeguard chinas national sovereignty and territorial integrity zhang saidwu said the us wants to turn taiwan into a selfdefense island that defends itself rushes ahead and serves as cannon fodder while the us will hide far away when there is a real crossstrait conflictit is unbelievable and impossible for the us to engage in a headon conflict with another major nuclear power wu said the more taiwan provokes the faster the reunification process will bemoretti said he hoped the us could acknowledge that it would be good for people in the us and china and for all of asia and the world to have a cooling of tensions and act accordingly thereafterbut he said he does not expect the political leadership in the us to take action to dial down the situation because the existing political climate in washington would see such behavior as a weaknesswe can hope that there is not an accident of some kind that requires a response that could be very dangerous for all parties involved moretti saidhe suggested that the us can pursue more conversations with china common sense has to guide the conversation and were not seeing enough of that moretti saidwu also said the initiative to end the vicious cycle of uschina relations as a whole and the taiwan question lies more on the us sideit is the us that is constantly provoking creating momentum and sending wrong signals to the taiwan independence forces and the world the initiative lies with the us because the us is the provocative side wu saidus politicians should not be influenced by antichina forces they should have their own calm consideration about how to get along with another major power

part is doing it better than others mao said we hope the united states will contribute real money to and do something concrete for the development and revitalization of africa mao saiddespite ambitions for enhanced food selfsufficiency china is projected to continue relying heavily on us imports of soybeans and sorghum for decades to come according to a food policy expertye yujiang a vicepresident of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas highlighted these findings during the release of the academys annual agricultural sector development report on friday the report forecasts that by  china will still depend on the us for approximately  percent of its soybeans and a substantial  percent of its sorghumacknowledging the importance of stable trade ties with the us ye emphasized the need for a twopronged approach maintaining a strong trade relationship with the us while diversifying sources through strategic partnershipsit is essential to maintain stable trade relations with the united states and make every effort to uphold this stability ye stated he further stressed the importance of exploring new channels and strengthening ties with agricultural powerhouses like brazil and argentina as well as other countries participating in the belt and road initiativethe caas report outlines projections based on various factors including a declining population it anticipates chinas population to reach  billion by  with urbanization reaching  percentto meet the evolving demands of its population the report projects that china will need to significantly increase production of key food groups by  production is expected to rise by  million tons for meat  million tons for eggs  million tons for dairy products and a significant  million tons for aquatic products these figures are expected to climb further by this projected growth will have a substantial impact on animal feed demand the report recommends a  percent increase in planting area for corn and soybeans critical animal feed crops by  this translates to an expansion of  million hectares by  the report forecasts a need for a  percent increase reaching  million hectaresye underscored the significant challenges this expansion presents in terms of land use he emphasized the crucial role of technological innovation in enhancing production efficiency to address these challengesthe event also saw the launch of the  global food policy report by the international food policy research institute pascal lamy board chair of the institute highlighted the complementary nature of the reports emphasizing their shared goal of fostering sustainable and inclusive food systems focused on health equity and resiliencewhile the global food policy report offers a broad perspective on nutrition and food policy globally the china agricultural sector development report provides a localized lens lamy said this localized perspective she noted underscores the importance of contextspecific approaches in tackling food security and nutrition challengesinstead of doubling tariffs on chinese solar products the united states should embrace their affordability according to one expertdavid fickling a columnist for bloomberg opinion who covers climate change and clean energy wrote on wednesday we are still not building enough solar and wind farms nor enough factories for the components theyll use to make the switch work yet president joe bidens justification for doubling tariffs on imported solar to  percent is that to the contrary the world has too many production lines for green techin the article fickling noted that chinese industrial policy caused the price of solar panels to fall from about  cents per watt in early  to just over  cents per watt nowwe should welcome that reducing the cost of green power is the single best thing the world can do if were to escape catastrophic warming in our lifetimes fickling wrotebiden contended last month that the low cost of chinas solar panels are a result of policydriven overcapacity in manufacturing flooding global markets with artificially cheap solar modules and panelsthe white house announced on may  that tariffs on solar cells and modules will increase from  percent to  percent in fickling said that chinese clean technology isnt artificially cheap its just cheapin an appearance on bloomberg the china show on thursday fickling said that were the us is still well below the capacity we needthe amount of renewables waiting to get connected to the us grid is greater than the amount of generating capacity on the us grid as a whole at the moment so there are these huge bottlenecks he said a lot of it has to do with permitting and grid access and some of it has to do with financebut fickling said you cant ignore the tariffs issue its clearly something thats not going to change its an election year issue its not going to change imminentlyhe said that the united states has installed about onetenth of the renewable power that china has installedfickling said that it needs to really increase that rapidly to achieve  net zero emissionsbiden said he put the tariffs in place to protect the american solar industry and companiesbut fickling said that all production lines are going to be needed if the us is to meet the target of decarbonizing its electricity grid by he cited septembers group of  meeting which called for a tripling of renewable power globally by fickling argued that by the end of this decade the power grid will require about twice as many gigawatts of generators connected to it as the current one weve spent more than a century building and all of the net increase has to come from clean powera twoyear us moratorium on tariffs on solar products from cambodia malaysia thailand and vietnam expired on thursdaya report released thursday by the international energy agency iea found that china installed almost  gigawatts gw of new renewable capacity in  more than half the global total and if it maintains that pace it will likely exceed its  target this yearglobal investment in clean energy technology and infrastructure is set to hit  trillion this year the ieas world energy investment report said total energy investment is expected to exceed  trillion for the first time in for every dollar going to fossil fuels today almost two dollars are invested in clean energy said iea executive director fatih birolchina is set to account for the largest share of clean energy investment in  with an estimated  billion while europe will account for  billion and the united states  billionthe united states is now playing catchup on a technology that has really matured in china and its going to be very difficult to recreate those supply chains in a short period of time at a low cost ilaria mazzocco a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies told yahoo finance its entirely feasible but its going to be a long time horizon and its going to be far more costlythe iea report also cautioned that in  the share of global clean energy investment in emerging markets and developing economies outside china is expected to remain around  percent of the totalboth in terms of volume and share this is far below the amounts that are required to ensure full access to modern energy and to meet rising energy demand in a sustainable way the report saidagencies contributed to this storychina said on thursday that it is always open to space exchanges and cooperation with the united states and called on the us to clear

isnt artificially cheap a terminology used in washington dc and its just cheap he saidthe result of capacity in excess of demand is a virtuous cycle of falling prices innovation and industry consolidation while capacity that falls short of demand causes only inflation and shortages said ficklingif bidens promise of a carbonfree grid by  is to have any chance of materializing the united states needs to speed up its rates in connecting with wind and solar power farms at nearly  times of current rates and  times that in  according to ficklingus president joe biden is going to need all

china and the us is a positive sign for collaboration between the two leading countries in artificial intelligence experts say which has established a new platform to draw on each others governance experiences and contribute to global ai regulationboth sides labeled the meeting constructive after talks in geneva switzerland on may sourabh gupta a senior fellow at the institute for chinaamerican studies in washington said there was a genuine sense of constructiveness at the ai meeting given that it opened a channel for communication on an issue that will require a degree of cooperation and coordination from both sides for a long time and given its importanceai is not going away anywhere gupta said adding it is ground enough to label the meeting as constructive as the two sides were able to take a preliminary step in establishing a framework for dialoguezhu rongsheng an expert from tsinghua universitys center for international security and strategy said that in an era of rising geopolitical competition it is a significant step for the two leading ai powers to sit down and discuss global ai governancethis new dialogue mechanism not only meets the international communitys urgent call for ai governance but also showcases the responsible roles both nations can play zhu saidairelated technologies like deepfakes and misinformation have shown their global impact by collaborating the us and china can enhance their regulatory frameworks to protect their citizens and offer guidance to other countriesresponsible roleit is hoped the united states can work with china in this field to play a responsible role as major powers jointly establishing rules to protect the interests of the global majority said zhu who is also a senior researcher at metastrategy institute a think tank in beijinggupta said theres value in all the big players in the system coming and proposing common rules by which ai is regulated at the international level and so thats also a useful area of dialogue within the framework of this conversationin the context of current chinaus relations featuring a mix of competition and cooperation this intergovernmental dialogue mechanism opens new communication channels that help both sides clearly express their airelated security concerns and development goals reducing misunderstandings and strategic misjudgments zhu saidhowever the us suppression and containment of china regarding ai have increased the difficulties in bilateral dialogue in this field he saidon may  a bipartisan group of members from the us house of representatives unveiled the enhancing national frameworks for overseas restriction of critical exports act which seeks to restrict the export of us ai systems to prevent foreign rivalries from using us ai technologyrestricting exportsit also aims to restrict the export of the systems to foreign competitors and authorizes the us department of commerce to prohibit us people from working with foreigners to develop ai systems that allegedly pose a risk to us national securitythe act defines an ai system as any software or hardware implementation of artificial intelligence including artificial intelligence model weights and any numerical parameters associated with the ai implementationthe previous gradual tightening of us restrictions on advanced chips and the consideration of licensing us cloud computing companies to provide advanced ai computing power to foreign customers — especially those in china — are measures to escalate export controls in aisuch actions are intended to raise the fences gupta saidzhu said the us approach is like cutting off your nose to spite your faceit might also be impractical because ai system encompasses multiple facets such as hardware software and data banning software in particular is especially challengingif the us continues to contain china in this manner it risks losing potential users and partners for american ai products and services in china

sichuan jingweida technology group jwd according to the report by us senate finance committee chairman ron wgdens staffthe socalled uygur forced labor prevention act by the us not only sanctioned chinese companies but also hijacked companies from all countries onto the chariot of suppressing china in the name of compliance in an attempt to create an economic coercion alliance foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin saidout of self interests such practice disrupts international trade rules and international industrial and supply chains which represents us hegemony and bullying wang told a daily news conferencewang said that the socalled act is not about preventing forced labor but about creating unemploymentit does not protect human rights but under the guise of human rights harms the survival employment and development rights of the people in xinjiang he said adding that it is the most notorious act infringing upon human rights in the st centurythe us congress in  passed the uygur forced labor prevention act law to strengthen enforcement of laws to prevent the import of goods from xinjiang over the socalled forced labor which has been repeatedly refuted by china calling it

cities she was wearing a gym shirt and we love gym shirts too kristchil said noting that physical education classes are not mandatory at iupthe united states has been celebrating asian and pacific american heritage month in may which has prompted reflection on the challenges chinese americans face despite their integration into us society says zhou min a professor of sociology and asian american studies at the university of california los angelesalthough chinese americans are integrating well they are still affected by dual stereotyping zhou saidin  the us congress passed the chinese exclusion act which was signed by president chester arthur introducing a year ban on chinese laborers immigrating to the us the act was the first significant law restricting immigration into the countryas we celebrate asian heritage month its imperative to acknowledge and address the persistent barriers to equality and inclusion faced by chinese americans and other asian communities zhou saidintertwined with historical discrimination and perpetuated through stereotyping racial profiling and hate crimes modern exclusion persists she saidon the one hand they are lauded as the model minority for their extraordinary achievements on the other hand they are considered forever foreigners because of their lookand old negative stereotypes such as the yellow peril the threat are often invoked when the us and china are at odds with each otherfor example in recent years the china initiative which focused on alleged chinese economic espionage has negatively affected many chinaborn scientists working in us research universities she saidthe most prominent case was that of massachusetts institute of technology professor gang chen a mechanical engineer and nanotechnologist arrested in  and charged with concealing his affiliations with chinese government institutions wire fraud making a false statement on a tax return and failing to disclose a foreign bank accounteven though he was ultimately exonerated the shadow of suspicion lingers perpetuating narratives of disloyalty and espionagealthough all the charges against him were dismissed damage has already been done and is hard to be undone zhou said chens case suggests that chinese americans are still suspects of being disloyal americans having connections to and spying for china when china is perceived as americas enemybroader challengeszhou who last year was elected to the us national academy of sciences just as chen was the same year identifies deeply with the broader challenges facing chinese americans as they may still be viewed with suspicion and mistrust particularly when geopolitical tensions are highsuch perceptions not only harm individuals reputations but also undermine efforts toward genuine inclusion and recognition of their contributions to american society zhou saidthe chinaus relationship and the experiences of chinese americans are deeply intertwined and complex she said and geopolitical tensions between the two countries can have significant direct and indirect effects on the lives of chinese americansuschina relations are good we are good if these relations are bad we will be negatively affectedworsening uschina relations would hurt the us and it would lose out in the global competition for foreign talent from china and elsewhere she said poor relations would also reinforce negative societal stereotypes against chinese americans and create new barriers for immigrant integration even among the better off such as in the case of chenfor us china is our ancestral homeland and the us is our new homeland its our obligation as chinese americans to facilitate communication understanding and cooperation between our adopted homeland and ancestral homelandchinese americans have made great contributions to the economic and social development of the us particularly in science engineering and medicine the effect being significant and multifacetedthe demographics of chinese americans have undergone major changes over the past few decades reflecting a shift toward greater cultural diversity chinese americans today come from a broader range of regions within china compared with what they used toanother shift — a wave of highly skilled professionals and investors compared with lowskilled laborers — is diversifying occupations and income levels creating a more complex chinese american communitythese changes were driven by international migration which was affected by the normalization of uschina relations chinas reform and openingup and us immigration policy zhou saidthe new tariffs that the united states has imposed on a series of products from china is a move by us president joe biden to make china a scapegoat for the us own problems and will eventually make businesses suffer a british business leader and trade expert saidjack perry jr chairman of the  group club which promotes equal and mutually beneficial trade between the united kingdom and china told china daily he felt strongly over the us decision to impose tariffs on imports from china such as electric vehicles solar panels semiconductors and batterieswhat theyre doing is trying

businesses are the ones that are going to suffer from this american people will have to pay more for the retail price and businesses will have to pay more for the wholesale prices … its not about building america better he saidreferring to the overcapacity claim made by us treasury secretary janet yellen perry said it is about positioning america against china and dont want china to be strongthe us is talking about chinese products flooding the market thats not true he saidsomeone asked me where do you think that america is going to have an issue with in what sector with china next and my answer was whatever sector china is strong in thats where the americans are going to have an issue he said its not about ev cars its not about overcapacity its not about flooding the market its not about anything that theyre talking aboutits about the fact that china has evolved theres no other country thats taken a billion people out of poverty in  years theres no one like china that was

economic resilience and could even put american lives at riskonce on shore pray no moreof more than a dozen categories of newlytargeted chinese goods with an aggregate value of  billion medical supplies once badly needed in the us battle against covid stand out as they face unreasonably high tariff adjustments this year despite a significant decline in their sales to the worlds largest

the tariff move has shown a willful america dropping its benefactors as soon as their help is not requiredsome us politicians and businesses believe china profited significantly from mask sales during the pandemic turning a blind eye to the increased costs due to emergency response measures during that time wang explainedas the pandemic has gradually waned since  the company saw a sharp decline in overseas orders currently masks account for less than  percent of the companys exports to the united statesthe impact of higher tariff rates on our goods is minimal wang said ultimately the raised tariffs will not be paid by china but by us importers and consumersobservers said that the us move had been driven by politicians fear of the countrys excess dependence on the chinese industry as

medical supplies like masks and gloves but domestic customers willing to pay the price of madeintheus alternatives have been hard to findus mask makers have been lobbying for federal support to tackle with the huge inventories they cant sell the biden administration claimed its actions are carefully targeted at strategic sectors and will protect american workers and businessesironically some major us clients of wangs company have already protested to the us government as using tariff barriers to shore up domestic manufacturing has proven to be an unwise moveit is more of a political stunt failing to address any real challenge smothering the industrial growth on us turf serious considerations are needed to clear deeprooted obstacles from the persistent demand deficiency high costs modest profits to the absence of longterm plans on coping with the need of strategic stockpiles for public health emergenciesputting up tariff barriers and scapegoating china will do no good to the

semiconductors steel and aluminumnotably a world trade organization panel found in september  that the section  tariffs contravened its regulationsafter chinas ministry of commerce vowed to take resolute measures to safeguard the rights and interests of chinese companies market watchers said that china has many options to counter washingtons actions that may not necessarily target us industrial goods but could focus on other sectorsthe us protectionist measures could reignite a trade conflict with china and damage the us economy in the process since tariffs essentially tax us businesses and consumers by raising the cost of imported goods this could lead to inflation and harm job growth said wu xinbo dean of fudan universitys institute of international studiesin the short term the us might seem aggressive in its efforts to target emerging chinese industries but this approach is unlikely to yield practical results in the long run said chen bin deputy director of the expert committee at the beijingbased china machinery industry federationas china has already taken the lead in the new energy sector with the largest industry chain globally additional tariffs cannot fundamentally alter the inherent comparative advantages of the chinese manufacturers he saiddismissing the china overcapacity narrative he yadong a spokesman for the ministry of commerce told a news conference that the socalled overcapacity perceived by some western countries is not an excess of capacity but rather an excess of anxietyit shows worries of some countries about their own

neutrality goals annual global sales of new energy vehicles need to reach about  million units by  this is more than three times the global sales in  far exceeding the current global supply capacityas technology products in the new energy sector are updated and iterated more rapidly new demand will continually emerge said heoverall the global new energy industry is still in its early stages of development and rapid growth rather than overcapacity there is a relative shortage of production capacity he saidsun xiaohong secretarygeneral of auto branch of the beijingbased china chamber of commerce for import and export of machinery and electronic products said that share of chinese evs exported to the us is fairly small compared to other marketsthe number of chinese evs exported to the us sharply declined to fewer than  units in the first quarter of this year cutting the us markets share of chinas global ev exports to less than  percent data from the general administration of customs showedwith such a minimal export volume the impact of us tariff increases on chinese evs is essentially negligible said sunin a statement released by the china council for the promotion of international trade on wednesday industries like evs lithiumion batteries and photovoltaic cells in china are at the forefront of technological innovation and market competition deeply embedding themselves in global supply chains and making significant contributions to global efforts in energy conservation and sustainable growthconcurrently the us government is providing significant subsidies

solar cells will rise from  percent to  percent tariffs on certain chinese steel and aluminum imports will also see a significant hike from  percent to  percentafter chinas ministry of commerce vowed on tuesday to take resolute measures to safeguard rights and interests of chinese companies market watchers said china has a number of options to respond to this move that might not necessarily target us vehicles but could affect other areascurrently chinese evs have a small market share in the us so the immediate effects of increasing tariffs would be relatively limited said dong chao head of the institute of circulation and consumption under the beijingbased chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperationhowever the rationale behind the us approach is that without intervention the market share of chinese evs in the us would inevitably rise taking action after becoming dependent on the chinese supply chain would entail greater costs said sun lei a senior partner at beijing dacheng law officesthe pressure on chinese companies to invest and build factories in other parts of the world will increase accelerating their decisionmaking processes said sunbecause the automotive supply chain is extensive relocating car assembly lines and production to other countries could affect the entire supply chain including steel aluminum engine technology and lithium batteries he saidtake lithium batteries for another example many global ev brands rely on chinas supply chain from tesla and toyota to bmw and mercedesbenz with the new us tariffs the costs for these automakers evs are likely to increase ultimately affecting consumers said ding rijia a professor specializing in energy economy at the china university of mining and technology in beijinghighlighting that chinas steel aluminum and automobiles currently constitute only a small portion of the us supply chain ding said that rather than suppressing niche markets the latest measures by the us government are more about curbing anticipated import growthsharing similar views lin boqiang head of the china institute for studies in energy policy at xiamen university in fujian province said that the purpose of the us additional tariffs on chinese solar products is still to suppress the industrys development chinas photovoltaic industry has a significant advantage in technology prices and aftersales service thanks to years of largescale development and technological iterationsthey are worried that chinas pv industry will quickly dominate the global market leaving limited growth space for them said linhowever the direct impact of this move on chinas pv industry is limited as exports to the us are not significant it may have a certain impact on market expectations thoughaccording to data from the china photovoltaic industry association solar modules export market had become more diversified last year however in the first  months of  the top  export markets did not include the us whose market share was lower than that of germanys  percent at no liu yiyang deputy secretarygeneral of the cpia said the us sees about  gigawatts of new installations of solar power facilities each year on average which is less than  percent of the global market sharemoreover against the backdrop of global energy transition to the green mode chinese solar products have a strong price advantage and global demand is still strong the countrys solar product exports are developing toward a diversified direction said liucontact the writers at zhongnanchinadailycomcnforeign minister wang yi accused the united states on wednesday of repeatedly imposing unilateral sanctions to suppress china vowing such bullying and hegemonic behaviors would be crushed by wheels of historyhis comments came as the us slapped major new tariffs on chinese electric vehicles lithium batteries photovoltaic cells and others on tuesdayfor some time the us has launched the section  investigation targeting chinese maritime logistics and shipbuilding sectors it has also imposed sanctions on nearly  chinese entities and revoked certain licenses for exports to chinese tech giant huaweiwang said the us frequently imposing unilateral sanctions abusing section  investigation to suppress chinas normal trade and economic activities are the most typical bullying behaviors in the worldit demonstrates that some people in the us have reached a level of irrationality in order to uphold us unipolar hegemony he addedwang said washington resorting to all means to unscrupulously suppress china does not prove its strength but rather exposes a lack of confidenceit cannot solve the us own existing problems but will further disrupt the normal operation of the international production and supply chains he addedinstead of hindering chinas development and rejuvenation the foreign minister said such moves would inspire the  billion chinese people to work even harderthe world trade organization has clearly concluded that the us section  tariffs are violations of its rules and international lawwang said international businessmen with basic common sense hold the view that the us actions harm others without benefiting the us itselfhe slammed the us as one of the founding members of the wto for not only refusing to set a good example but also leading in violating rulesinstead of righting wrongs the us reinforces them he addedwang questioned the us how can the us explain the fair competition it advocates how can it gain trust from the international communitywang reiterated that unilateral acts and protectionism go against the trend of the times at this critical moment of global economic recovery he said the international community should warn the us not to create new troubles for the world anymore foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin said on wednesday that the us tariff increases on electric vehicles and semiconductors from china is another mistake washington has made after it continuously politicizes economic and trade issuesthis will significantly push up the costs of imported products and it is the consumers in the us that will suffer more losses wang said at a regular news briefing in beijingus president joe biden announced on tuesday that he is quadrupling tariffs on chinese electric vehicles to  percent and imposing new levies on computer chips solar cells and lithiumion batterieswang cited a report from the rating agency moodys investors service saying that us importers absorbed more than  percent of the additional costs caused by the increased us tariffs on chinese goodswang said that washingtons protectionist measures will also further undermine the security and stability of global industrial and supply chainsas some european politicians have said that the increased tariffs is the worst policy that will undermine the global trade he saidwe urge the us side to abide by the world trade organization rules and immediately withdraw its tariff increases we will do everything we can to safeguard our interests and rights the spokesman saidthe us governments latest move to slap heavy tariffs on chinese imports including electric vehicles and solar cells shows protectionism and industrial policy is the new consensus approach to economic challenges which is an unfortunate shift in us policy a senior economist said on tuesdaythe united states is increasing tariffs on  billion worth of chinese imports targeting electric vehicles evs advanced batteries steel and critical minerals the white house said on tuesdaythe fresh levies come on top of the already massive tariffs imposed on more than  billion worth of chinese goods which were introduced during the trump administration according to the result of a fouryear review of the china section  tariffs released by the office of the united states trade representative ustr on tuesdaythe review was undertaken under section  of the trade act of  which trump invoked to first launch the china tariffs in the centerpiece of the new tariffs is a quadrupling of levies on chinese evs to  percent starting this year an attempt analysts said would likely result in thwarting the biden administrations own efforts to fight climate change by speeding up ev adoptionerica york a senior economist and research director with the tax foundations center for federal tax policy said that at present consumers are not likely to see an immediate increase in costs because chinese evs are already locked out of the us marketlonger term though it means american consumers will lack choices including competitively priced and innovative chinese evs and face higher prices for green tech and green energy at home york told china daily on tuesdayyorks organization has estimated that the current tariffs and retaliation will reduce longrun us output by about  percent costing thousands of jobs and reducing incomesmaintaining the current tariffs which have been costly to american consumers and the manufacturing sector and doubling or quadrupling down on the approach will further increase costs insulate us businesses from competitive pressures that lead to longrun improvements and put us manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage abroad according to yorkprotectionism and industrial policy are not a recipe for success instead policymakers should pursue reforms that encourage investment innovation and competition she addedthe tariffs that take effect this year also cover solar cells syringes needles steel and aluminum products according to a statement from the ustrthe tariff rate on semiconductors will surge from  percent to  percent by next year while levies on chinese ev batteries and battery parts will more than triple to  percent by gary hufbauer a

avoid further losses to voters who welcome protection he addeddouglas h paal distinguished fellow of the asia program at the carnegie endowment for international peace said tuesdays announcement of

the global solar industry supply chain — the production of polysilicon solar wafers that are processed into solar cells — takes place almost entirely in chinaalthough american companies can create raw polysilicon and a handful of us factories produce solar modules the industry is almost entirely dependent on china for the middle of the supply chain according to solar industry experts no american factory produces solar wafers or cells at scalethe trump administration imposed a separate set of global tariffs on the solar industry in  in february the biden administration extended those tariffs

so globalized that it requires global vision and openness for its healthy development said a renowned expert in chinas automobile industrythe united states ploy to overhype overcapacity in chinas nev sector and its national security concerns over chinese electric vehicles are typical examples of trade protectionism said fu bingfeng executive vicepresident and secretarygeneral of the china association of automobile manufacturers in an exclusive interview with china dailyit is palpably irrational to see chinese nevs hailed as a collective creation for the common welfare of humanity being restricted in the us market fu saidthe remarks came amid the news of washingtons possible tariff hike and restrictions on chinese nevsthe wall street journal quoted anonymous sources as saying that the us government is preparing to raise the tariff rate on chinese evs from roughly  percent to  percentlast week reuters also reported that us commerce secretary gina raimondo said the country could take extreme action and ban or impose restrictions on chinese connected vehicles after the completion of a national security investigationfu said it is very common to find differences regarding legal frameworks and consumption preferences when an industry enters different markets this is what makes dialogue and communication extremely importanthe said that when smart vehicles enter the global market they should integrate with local laws and consumer habits and they also require certain levels of redevelopment to better suit local preferences such as privacy protection however these issues cannot be resolved through trade barriers or protectionismfu said the association has noticed that many countries hope that chinas automobile supply chain can extend overseas including to europe and southeast asia in order to help develop local automotive industries drive local employment and form new patterns of common growthexperts noted that in contrast to the us hostile attitude toward chinese nev makers including the possibility of banning them without any factual evidence to prove their risks china has always shown openness toward foreign ev companiesus carmaker tesla along with five chinese carmakers cleared a key data security test in china conducted by the association and a national computer network center in april which proves how communication can help dismiss data

the overcapacity issue hyped by some western politicians and media fu called for a more objective and openminded viewa global perspective is a must to understand and support changes and development in a highly globalized industry like automaking rather than viewing a specific markets production capacity in isolation he saidaccording to the international energy agency annual ev sales are projected to reach  million units by  more than four times the demand in given the development pattern of the automotive industry maintaining the production capacity utilization rate at a relatively moderate level typically between  percent and  percent is considered a reasonable range fu saiddata from the national bureau of statistics show that the capacity utilization rate of chinas automobile

views on the technological risks of ai global governance and other issues of their respective concernon the evening of may   yang tao directorgeneral of the department of north american and oceanian affairs of the ministry of foreign affairs held a briefing to elaborate on chinas position on united nations general assembly resolution yang said that for some time the united states has been deliberately distorting and challenging unga resolution  adopted in  on restoring the lawful seat of the peoples republic of china in the united nations and expelling the chiang kaishek group it has been trumpeting the notion that taiwans status is undetermined and advocating support for taiwans participation in un conferences and activities recently mark lambert along with other us state department officials blatantly asserted that unga resolution  did not endorse is not equivalent to and does not reflect a consensus for chinas onechina principle has no bearing on countries sovereign choices with respect to their relationships with taiwan does not preclude taiwans meaningful participation in the united nations system and other multilateral forums and did not constitute a un institutional position on the ultimate political status of taiwan moreover the united states claims that its onechina policy is different from chinas onechina principle all this is a us attempt to invent a whole set of false narratives to mislead international public opinion and challenge the onechina consensus among the international community in view of this we deem it necessary to comprehensively and systematically explain the origin and facts of resolution  so as to set the record straight we believe a lie even told a thousand times will not become truthfirst the onechina principle is very clear that is there is but one china in the world taiwan is part of china and the government of the peoples republic of china is the sole legal government representing the whole of china unga resolution  fully reflects and solemnly reaffirms the onechina principle taiwan has been part of china since ancient times this is a historical fact it is also the international consensus the  cairo declaration and the  potsdam proclamation clearly stipulated that taiwan a chinese territory stolen by japan shall be restored to china these documents with international legal effect formed an integral part of the postwwii international order and also established the legal foundation of taiwans status as chinas inalienable territory in  the government of the peoples republic of china was established replacing the government of the republic of china as the sole legal government representing the whole of china it was a change of government without changing china as a subject of international law chinas sovereignty and inherent territorial boundaries did not change rightfully the government of the peoples republic of china fully enjoys and exercises chinas sovereignty including that over taiwan due to continued civil war in china and the meddling of external forces the two sides of the taiwan strait have fallen into a special state of protracted political confrontation however chinas sovereignty and territory have not been split and will never be split taiwans status as part of china has not changed and will never changeon october   the th session of the un general assembly adopted resolution  with an overwhelming majority it states in black and white that the general assembly decides to restore all its rights to the peoples republic of china and to recognize the representatives of its government as the only legitimate representatives of china to the united nations and to expel forthwith the representatives of chiang kaishek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the united nations and in all the organizations related to it the resolution resolved once and for all the question of the representation of the whole of china including taiwan in the united nations as a political legal and procedural issue it made clear that there is only one china in the world and that taiwan is a part of china not a country it also made clear that there is only one seat of china in the united nations and the government of the peoples republic of china is the sole legal representative precluding two chinas or one china one taiwanif taiwans status is undetermined and if chinas representation does not include taiwan why expel the representatives of chiang kaishek why for more than  years has taiwans economic output been counted as part of chinas gdp when calculating chinas scale of assessment in the united nations and many other international organizations why does the united states turn a blind eye to such clear facts and simple logicsecond the un system has always observed resolution  and upheld the onechina principle in dealing with taiwanrelated issues since the adoption of resolution  the un and its specialized agencies and also other intergovernmental international organizations have all adhered to it they regard taiwan as a province of chinas and do not recognize the socalled international representation of the taiwan authorities the un office of legal affairs has issued legal opinions stating very clearly that the united nations considers taiwan for all purposes to be an integral part of the peoples republic of china the united nations considers taiwan as a province of china with no separate status authorities in taipei are not considered to  enjoy any form of governmental status use the term taiwan province of china when a reference to taiwan is required in united nations secretariat documents for decades the un secretary generals and their spokespersons have made it clear when expressing their stance on taiwan that the united nations is guided by resolution  and adheres to the onechina principleas part of chinas territory taiwan has no basis reason or right to participate in the un or any other international organizations where membership is exclusive to sovereign countries any issue concerning the taiwan regions participation in the activities of international organizations must be handled on the basis of the onechina principle as reaffirmed by resolution  the principle is again confirmed in may  by resolution  of the th world health assembly wha which was adopted in accordance with unga resolution  hence whether and how taiwan participates in the wha can only be decided by the central government of china the democratic progressive party authorities in taiwan refuse to accept the  consensus that reflects the onechina principle and are hellbent on the separatist stance of taiwan independence as a result the political foundation for taiwan to participate in the wha no longer exists this position of the chinese government has received wide support from the international community the wha has rejected deliberations of taiwanrelated proposals for many consecutive yearsthird the international community overwhelmingly abides by resolution  and fully and faithfully implements the onechina principle resolution  is a decision made by the un general assembly and must be observed by all member states this is the requirement of the united nations charter the written commitment made by all countries upon joining the un and also an obligation that all un member states must fulfill the onechina principle is also the fundamental prerequisite and political foundation for china to establish and develop relations with all other countries from the very first country that established diplomatic relations with the peoples republic of china to the rd country namely nauru they have all made political commitment to adhering to the onechina principle and included this commitment in political documents such as communiqués and joint statements on the establishment of diplomatic relations with china and they have all severed the socalled diplomatic relations with taiwan this shows that the onechina principle is a universally recognized principle and represents peoples sentiments and a global trendas a signatory to the cairo declaration and the potsdam proclamation the us is fully aware of the historical and legal facts that taiwan belongs to china yet it openly challenges the postwwii international order as if it has amnesia as a founding member of the un and a permanent member of the security council the us not only fails to take the lead in complying with a unga resolution but repeatedly questions and misinterprets it eroding the foundation of the un and trampling on the principles of international law it also attempts to mislead international public opinion with its own malicious distortions and seeks to force its wrong stance upon the international community is this the socalled rulesbased international order the us has been preaching clearly this is nothing but a hegemonic practice of applying international law in a selective way the world has not forgotten that during the discussions that led to unga resolution  the us had teamed up with a few countries to try to create two chinas or one china one taiwan and to push through a dual representation proposal against overwhelming opposition many countries had stepped forward voicing their clear opposition and stressing that the proposal was illegal and inconsistent with reality justice and the principles of the un charter in the end the proposal failed to be put to a vote and was discarded today the us is once again acting against the trend of history and trying to overturn the consensus of the international community it must understand that what it failed to accomplish more than  years ago will have even less chances to succeed todayfourth the us must stop fudging and hollowing out the onechina principle once the biggest obstacle to the normalization of chinaus relations the taiwan question had been fully resolved with the three chinaus joint communiqués and there should be no difference between the understanding and policies of the two sides in the communiqués the us clearly states that the united states of america recognizes the government of the peoples republic of china as the only legal government of china and that the government of the united states of america recognizes chinas position that there is only one china and taiwan is part of china this is the political commitment of the us the political foundation of chinaus relations and above all the original and true meaning of the onechina policy of the us however the fact that china and the us are still discussing the taiwan question  years after the establishment of diplomatic relations is because the us keeps violating the onechina principle and the three chinaus joint communiqués and continues to interfere in chinas internal affairs and obstruct chinas reunificationthe us claims that it adheres to the onechina policy but it has added the taiwan relations act and six assurances to taiwan as precondition and proviso the latter two concocted by the us unilaterally fundamentally violate the onechina principle and the consensus of the international community and have never been recognized by china the us claims that it maintains unofficial relations with taiwan but it has arranged meetings between us and taiwan officials signed agreements with sovereign connotations and an official nature and provided arms and ammunition to the chinese territory how is this unofficial ties president biden has pledged that the us does not support taiwan independence two chinas or one china one taiwan and does not seek to use taiwan as a tool to contain china has the us side honored its commitmentwe remind the us that any move to reverse the course of history is doomed to fail any effort to play the taiwan card will only backfire and any attempt to use taiwan to contain china will be a dead endwe warn the us that with regard to unga resolution  the us has only the obligation to strictly abide by it but no right to arbitrarily distort it or any privilege to act as the us sees fitwe urge the us not to stand on the opposite side of the international community not to stand on the opposite side of international justice and not to stand on the opposite side of the basic norms of international relationschina and the united

videosharing app in his country saying the legislation violates the first amendment rights of us citizensfor the first time in history the congress has enacted a law that subjects a single named speech platform to a permanent nationwide ban and bars every american from participating in a unique online community with more than  billion people worldwide tiktok and bytedance said on tuesday in a petition filed in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuitbanning tiktok is so obviously unconstitutional and the new law leaves tiktok with no choice but to shut down by jan  as continuing to operate in the us wouldnt be commercially technologically or legally possible they saidit will silence the  million us people who use the platform to communicate in ways that cannot be replicated elsewhere they saidthe law which was signed by biden on april  requires bytedance to divest tiktok within nine months or face a ban in the us with a possible threemonth extension if a sale is in progressthe companies said in their petition its impossible to transfer the platforms millions of lines of code to a new owner and that the app will not sell its recommendation algorithmdeclaratory judgmentthey argued that they should be protected by the first amendments guarantee of freedom of expression and are seeking a declaratory judgment that the law is unconstitutionalmoreover congress itself has offered nothing to suggest the tiktok platform poses the types of risk to data security or the spread of foreign propaganda that could conceivably justify the law and has failed to prove the app poses any specific harm in these areas they saidbytedance has insisted it has no intention of selling tiktok the white house has said it wants to see chinesebased ownership ended on national security groundsjameel jaffer executive director of the knight first amendment institute at columbia university said tiktoks challenge of the ban is important expecting tiktoks lawsuit to succeedthe first amendment means the government cant restrict americans access to ideas information or media from abroad without a very good reason for it — and no such reason exists here jaffer said in a statementanything that the us government does not like becomes a threat to national security its an overall excuse to cover everything simply by calling it a national security issue they feel that they can justify taking any action whatsoever george koo a retired international business adviser in silicon valley california told china dailyfor tiktok to take on the us government at the us court system is very much the last measure and whether they will get a fair hearing and fair justice remains to be seen but i wouldnt be surprised if tiktok fails in the lawsuit he saidi think if tiktok is forced to divest the chinese ownership they will have to just leave the us altogether… that will be a very unpopular move for the young people for the  million fans of tiktok koo saidtiktok filed a lawsuit against montana in may  when it issued a similar ban last november a federal judge ruled in favor of tiktok and blocked the law before it took effectlia zhu in

taiwan independence separatist activities the taiwan question is at the core of chinas core interests and the number one red line that must not be crossed in chinaus relations the spokesperson saidwe once again urge the us to earnestly abide by the onechina principle and the three chinaus joint communiqués observe international law and the basic norms governing international relations act on the us leaders commitment of not supporting taiwan independence two chinas or one china one taiwan stop using the wha to create confusion on taiwanrelated issues and avoid sending wrong signals to taiwan

military aid to chinas taiwan region and a bill that stipulates that the social media platform tiktok must be divested from its chinese parent company bytedance or face a national banlin said the package severely violates the onechina principle and the three chinaus joint communiques and it sends a wrong signal to taiwan independence separatist forcesit also undermines the principles of the market economy and fair competition by wantonly going after other countries companies in the name of national security he saidthis has laid bare the hegemonic bullying nature of the us lin said urging the us to respect chinas core interests and major concernslin also rebutted us paranoia about china after us secretary of state antony blinken accused china in an interview on monday of socalled attempts to influence and arguably interfere with the upcoming us presidential electionlin said that noninterference in other countries internal affairs is a basic principle of chinas diplomacy and china never had any interest and will not interfere in any way in the us presidential election which is an internal affair of the usmeanwhile we staunchly reject anyone making an issue of china and damaging chinas interests for election purposes he saidthe us should pivot away from its paranoia and stop making unfounded allegations to smear china and deflect the blame lin said adding that what

this storyeditors note as the peoples republic of china celebrates the th anniversary of its founding this year china daily asked prominent international figures to reflect on their relationship with the country and to talk of the direction in which they see it goingat  dorien emmers a belgian faced a pivotal decision which new language to pursue after already studying greek and latin intrigued by chinese culture but aware of the languages complexity she embraced the challengei like a good challenge recalled emmers now an assistant professor at the chinese studies group and the department of economics at ku leuven belgiums oldest university founded in  she described the decision as being made just out of curiosity and interest and without knowing a lot about chinathe china study program at ku leuven was so intensive that she quickly found herself lost and ended up forgoing a bachelors degree in the subjectafter finishing her undergraduate studies emmers received a scholarship from the china scholarship council to study at the southwestern university of finance and economics in chengdu sichuan province from  to this was an amazing experience and actually had an impact on everything i did afterward she told china daily at her brussels homeas a european emmers finds learning chinese more challenging than studying ancient greek as the latter shares similarities in grammar and vocabulary whereas chinese belongs to a completely different language family however she had much fun learning chinese idioms and colorful expressions that we dont have in our languagesthat was also the beautiful thing about it said emmers who now speaks fluent chinese and is known to many by her chinese name du yanshe also quickly fell in love with chengdu and returned last summer still enamored with the cityi still love the vibe there chengdu ren people are just great people she saidher language skills improved rapidly in chengdu an accomplishment that she said can only be achieved by being there studying the language all year round and practicing the language all day in a fun way by interacting with people or just by reading the signs next to the streetsit is also the case when it comes to learning about a culture and society she said you can only learn it by being thereemmers was fascinated by chinas rapid urbanization and excited about learning new things from singing karaoke to eating hot potshe was overwhelmed by the hospitality received from the chinese who frequently invited her to dinner so she was never alone during mealsinitially she could not eat spicy food during her first three months in chengdu she ate with tissues in hand sweating crying and sneezingbut i really like it now she said shortly after returning to belgium she wanted to know where to find spicy food but failedchengdu people are very lucky to have so many good dishes she said i want to meet local people and make local friendsemmers who holds a phd in economics from ku leuven is a development economist with extensive experience in studying early childhood development in chinait goes back to her time in chengdu where she and several international students taught english to the kindergarten children in yaan about  kilometers from chengdu after the area was struck by a major earthquake in spring it was a very beautiful region but i also realized the english level of yearolds in the boarding school was worse than that of yearolds in chengdu emmers saidcoming from the belgian countryside herself emmers said she became interested in the subject because her mother and grandmother unlike urban women were not allowed to study in belgium in the olden daysafter returning from china she wrote a thesis on this topic while pursuing a masters degree in chinese studies and economics at ku leuvenher research revealed that educational inequalities begin very early in life even in the first year of life for example if a yearold struggles with language development they will likely face difficulties keeping up with their peers by the time they start primary school at age sixstarting to help children catch up at age six is much more difficult much more expensive than helping them when they are  or  years old she said adding that was true around the worldthe lack of resources from financial support to educational materials such as childrens books was a major problem in rural china especially when grandparents often the primary caregivers mistakenly believed it makes no sense to talk to a child who could not yet speakbut actually even for a child who cant talk its important for the language development … these are some small changes that can make a big difference for early child development she said thats what we have been working onsubstantial improvementshaving visited china about  times emmers has seen substantial improvements in early childhood development across chinese cities as living standards have improvedshe was impressed by an early childhood development center she visited in xian shaanxi province where she saw all kinds of specialized classrooms for dancing singing and other activitiesin urban china amazing job …but in rural china none of these of course she saidemmers is excited that going to china has become much easier now with the chinese governments visafree policy for shortterm visits by belgian nationalsshe has traveled across the country from yunnan province to guilin and yangshuo in the guangxi zhuang autonomous region to shaolin in henan province the birthplace of chinese kung fu and dunhuang in gansu province renowned for its caves with ancient muralsshe said her perception of china has changed completely since her visit to china and she felt she did not know anything about china at the timeit has changed so much… i think most people dont realize how little they know about china she saidpeople need to learn about china to actually understand it a little bit… its incredible how quickly china develops and changesshe describes china today as completely different from  years ago and a different country if going back  yearsim a development economist thats why studying china is so interesting you can learn so much from the chinese experience emmers saidthats also such useful information for other countries which try to develop and grow  yes china has done impressive things over the last  yearsemmers is worried about the declining enthusiasm among her students in studying in china because of the pandemic and the global geopolitics that has triggered a lot of negative press in the west about chinahowever she said students who have studied in china generally have very positive experiencesfor most students its really a transformative experience she said so its very

visit once again shows the international community that consolidating chinarussia relations is a strategic choice made by the two nations based on their fundamental intereststhe european commissions decision to impose punitive duties on the imports of battery electric vehicles from china has drawn criticism from experts who worry about a potential trade war and a slowdown in the european unions netzero ambitionthe commission disclosed on tuesday to interested parties the draft decision to impose definitive countervailing duties on imports of evs from china with a slight adjustment from the provisional duties announced earlierthe latest duties range from  percent for saic  percent for geely  percent for byd and  percent for tesla which accounts for more than onethird of the eus ev imports from china the decision will not retroactively collect countervailing dutiesding chun director of the center for european studies at fudan university in shanghai said the commissions decision is extremely regrettableneither china nor the eu should necessarily aim to achieve the most optimum outcome for themselves but the secondbest outcome through coordination ding saidthey should be rational and practical and handle the dispute cautiously to avoid a trade war which will be a loselose outcome for both sidesthe dispute should be resolved through healthy competition and cooperation to promote new energy vehicle industries he said protectionism wont help speed up technological advancement and industrial upgrade or win competition and market or satisfy customerschris aylett a research associate at the environment and society centre at chatham house a think tank in london voiced concerns that the eu tariffs will slow down the blocs green transitiondecarbonization technologies such as solar panels wind turbines and evs share a characteristic that sets them apart from other traded goods aylett wrote on the chatham house websitewhen swapped for fossil fuel alternatives they reduce the quantity of planetwarming gases being pumped into the atmosphere they are needed in vast quantities and in very short order to give any chance of avoiding the worst impacts of climate changehe argued that the eus ambitious goal of net zero by  along with an intermediate target of at least a  percent reduction by  implies deploying massmarket clean technology products like solar panels and electric vehicles in very large numbersworld leaderwhen it comes to cheap clean technology china is the undisputed world leader two decades of consistent and targeted industrial policy combined with the benefits of a huge domestic market mean that china today produces extremely competitively priced highquality lowcarbon goods he said citing examples that the cheapest evs in france were priced between  and  last year while in china more than  models were retailing locally for less than all else being equal anything which stems the flow of the cheapest lowcarbon products will increase the cost of the transition and slow it down increasing the risk of the eu missing its emission reduction targets he saidhe also cautioned that if the eu keeps the cost of consumer goods such as evs high it will strengthen the perception of clean energy as something for the rich and of concern for the climate as an elite preoccupationit is not hard to see how these issues could be exploited for political gain posing further risks to a successful transition aylett saiduri dadush and conor mccaffrey two researchers at brusselsbased think tank bruegel said the punitive tariffs represent a formidable barrier in an industry where average profit margins are typically in the range of  percent to  percentthe biggest effects of tariffs are the rise in consumer prices and over time the diversion of imports to more expensive thirdparty suppliers they wrote in a joint analysisin this case high prices for evs will cause additional damage by directly slowing the green transition and by garbling the commissions message about its urgency and overwhelming importance they said lowincome eu consumers who need a car and are already struggling with high prices will be especially affectedchina has established a clear technological lead across the ev value chain one that may no longer depend on subsidies they addedthey suggest that chinese oems original equipment manufacturers may respond to the duties by establishing production in the eu but that option will also entail higher costs and prices and in any event will only be open to the biggest producerssome chinese producers of evs and batteries may prefer instead to establish their largest facilities in lowercost locations with access to the eu market as is already happening in morocco and turkiye the analysis saidwithin the eu hungary which maintains close relations with china may turn out to be the preferred eu location for chinese oem investmentchina will take all necessary measures to defend the legitimate rights and interests of chinese companies said the ministry of commerce right after the eus latest tarriff desicion late on tuesdaythe european commission the european unions executive arm said on tuesday that it plans to impose import tariffs of up to  percent on chinese evs for potentially five yearsthis decision is based on facts unilaterally determined by the eu rather than mutually recognized facts china firmly opposes it and is deeply concerned about the move a chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said in an online statement late on tuesdaysince the end of june china and the eu have conducted more than ten rounds of technical consultations on this issue based on facts and rules according to the ministrythe spokesperson said that china hopes the eu will genuinely cooperate with the chinese side in a rational and pragmatic manner working together to seek effective solutions and taking concrete steps to prevent an escalation of trade tensionsthe european unions latest decision to impose modified tariffs on imports of electric vehicles from china brings nothing but deep disappointment and will lead to a loselose situation for both sides said a leading industry analyst on tuesdaythe eu has generally upheld the original proposed import duties for chinese automakers despite all the efforts made by the chinese government industry associations and enterprises to communicate and coordinate since early july which is a disadvantageous option for both china and the eu said sun xiaohong secretarygeneral of the automotive branch of the china chamber of commerce for import and export of machinery and electronic products in an exclusive interview with china dailysuns comments came as the eu disclosed on tuesday its draft decision to slightly reduce planned import duties on chinese electric vehicle firms including byd from the original  percent to  percent geely from  percent to  percent and saic from  percent to  percent while new reduced rate for tesla stands at  percent lower than the  percent it had signposted in julythe fact that tesla gets to be exempt from the same tariff level as its chinese counterparts is a glaring practice of double standards sun stressedthe eu has identified  ways in which china allegedly subsidizes electric vehicles which is ridiculous he said adding that china hopes the wto can finally come up with a fair result on the issue after china filed an appeal with the global body earlier this month and challenged the imposition of provisional additional tariffs on imports of chinese evschinese ev companies are also closely monitoring the progress and outcomes of the eus antisubsidy investigation in order to assess the risks of investing in the region and make investment decisions accordingly

countriesa steppedup partnership can promote global agricultural advancements as the two nations commemorate their th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year said ann derwin irish ambassador to chinashe made the remarks at the world agrifood innovation conference  summit dialogue which was held at china agricultural university in beijing late julyderwin highlighting bilateral technical exchanges joint research and development efforts and the promotion of modern agricultural technologies said this expansion of cooperation areas signifies robust growth and potentialsun qixin president of china agricultural university said at the conference that the university has always been committed to deepening international cooperation and exchanges and has established close partnerships with top global institutions such as national university of ireland and university college dublin to promote global agricultural prosperity and developmentat the same time the university is making efforts

global stability and developmentshe said ireland has bolstered collaboration with the world food program the food and agriculture organization of the united nations and african nations particularly focusing on supporting underdeveloped countries through targeted food programsshe also expressed her hope for ireland to play a more substantial role in international agricultural exchangeson july  the british public voted overwhelmingly to reject the conservative government of rishi sunak and deliver the labour partys keir starmer to office thus bringing labour to power for the first time since  after years of political instability controversy and chaos that have beset the united kingdom as well as economic stagnation and decline it is hoped that the new government will offer a spell of stability sensibility and pragmatism in its policies both at home and abroad with starmer commanding a massive majority he is sure to forge his own vision for the countryit is hoped that the uk will be able to earnestly and productively reengage with one of its key economic partners — china the previous government is guilty of destroying the bilateral relationship with beijing due to its mismanagement of britains foreign policy as a wholeit pursued a highly ideological path with brexit paid excessive subservience to the united states and deliberately whipped up antichina sentiment domestically to distract attention from its failures then there was opposition from certain parliamentary members groups which were subject to the influence of foreign organizationsthe new government therefore offers an opportunity for britain to reset its relations with the world on more sensible terms although we should not expect geopolitical realities to change and while starmer is by no means a radical having purged the antiwar left from his party while in opposition what we can realistically expect is a foreign policy based more on pragmatism national interests and sensibility as opposed to one premised on ideology identity and shorttermismfor example the previous conservative government was obsessed with pursuing a bilateral trade agreement with the us on the sole premise of anglophone exceptionalism as opposed to actual benefitseven as a protectionist washington showed no interest in such a deal and downing street happily sacrificed its other interests on a whim especially those concerning china its routine weaponization of antichina sentiment for shortterm political gain also made it impossible to engage with beijing even as sunak professed that he wished to do so in certain areas becoming a victim of internal party conflictas a result what we are likely to see from a labour government is not a drastic change in policy but certainly a rebalancing that will make it possible for london to have an amicable relationship with beijing again and to compartmentalize disagreements and areas of cooperation already starmers government is pursuing a reset with the european union that has been described as an end to the brexit era in other words an end to the theatrical nationalism and imperialera nostalgia of the conservatives and a return of cooperationfocused policies when the time is right we are likely to see this happen with china toowhile the previous government was subjected to backbench rebellions frequently led by highly ideological antichina members of parliament starmers largescale majority and emphasis on party discipline will mean his agenda will not be disrupted and therefore backbench mps cannot impose costs on the government for engaging with beijing for example owing to factional conflict within the conservative party individuals such as iain duncan smith and liz truss held disproportionate influence over the governments positions on china and threatened rebellion constantly which is what produced such jarring inconsistencieshowever beijing should nonetheless be aware that usfunded groups and organizations as well as the taiwan region will continue to press for influence among the new batch of mps as well as a hostile mainstream media and thus the socalled golden era will not return this however is preferable to the cold warstyle conflict that was actively sought by some in the previous administration ultimately the uk continues to have significant interests in a cooperative open and mature relationship with china one which can be made to work despite ideological and geopolitical differences as britain enters a new era it is time for a mature reset based on national intereststhe

insightful blend of technology history and cultureeditors note alberto casartelli an italian native who teaches at tianjin foreign studies university and serves as the deputy secretary of the iccx italychina cultural exchange penned this article to share his insights and reflections from his participation in the justconcluded th nishan forum on world civilizations in qufu shandong provinceon july   and  i had the pleasure and the privilege of participating as an international guest at the th nishan forum on world civilizationsmy job as a professor of italian culture at tianjin foreign studies university places me daily in a situation where the meeting of cultures the one i bring to my students and the one my students bring to me is a fundamental component of my work so i knew that my presence at the forum would be a great opportunity to enrich my inclination in this aspect but i must say that the reality far exceeded my expectationsthe three days at the nishan forum were very intense and every moment was rich in insights and inspiration registration for the event started on july  after the welcome dinner guests were first treated to fantastic light and water displays along with grandiose fireworks and immediately afterwards to the fabulous jinsheng yuzhen theater performance the performance masterfully recounted along with rituals and music the figure of confucius as a teacher and educator and the long journey of a child to become a wise elder combining traditional classical chinese art forms such as poetry music and dance with modern arts and cuttingedge theatrical technology such as the moving stage holographic displays and dancers floating in the air truly a marvel for the eyes and the spiritbut what i would like to emphasize most in this article are the days of july  and  when the speakers contributions brought us to the heart of the festival and best represented the spirit and meaning of the entire forum the common themes of the speeches were memories of the past and inclusiveness one is the essence of the other there can be no inclusive society if it has no memory of its past it was pointed out that these words already bring us back to the model of the teachereducator that confucius himself had described namely the one who reviews the past to form those who will build the future and from here we can connect to the fundamental role that education plays so yesterday as well as today that was often mentioned in the guests speechesreviewing and teaching ones own past and ones own history is the best way if we dont want to say the only way to understand histories and cultures different from our own always with a great attitude of openness and mutual learning always striving for unity and not division to build a network of common values learning from each other appreciating each other and promoting all forms of exchange these values were mentioned many times at the forum and i feel as close to this vision as one could possibly feel a vision that defines the concept of national identity as something inclusive and not as i am unfortunately often used to hearing as something divisive true inclusiveness is one that celebrates differences rather than nullifying them to create a truly more inclusive society one that wants to respect the other rather than dominate with a view to social stability that was already a fundamental principle in the teachings of confucius just as fundamental was the idea and the culture of the family which according to the great philosopher is the very root of civilizationthis is an era of great challenges a complicated time when serious international tensions are undermining the balance without any signs of stopping and this is very worrying never before has the concept of dialogue ever present at this years nishan forum been more important and once again we should learn from our past and what our ancient civilizations have taught us even the place where the forum was held a few kilometers from qufu the hometown of confucius is itself a symbol of brotherhood confucianism is a universal philosophy a universal language of peace in which ethics morality and social harmony are pursued and we can say that shandong is one of the cradles of world civilization a place that sees its present rooted in a glorious history that goes back millenniaon the role of our roots and cultures both western and eastern i have already had the opportunity to mention this in the paper i wrote for the forum titled the cultural and philosophical roots of italy and china as the foundation for friendship and cooperation i have tried in this paper to celebrate the cultures of our two great countries and to emphasize how from the time of the roman empire through the middle ages and the renaissance and to the modern age they have often been intertwined this should always be remembered as an impetus for the perpetual strengthening of our friendship and cooperation especially in a year as important as this one where we celebrate the th anniversary of marco polos death and the th anniversary of the bilateral strategic partnership between italy and chinathe multipolar world that i have had the pleasure of seeing promoted here in nishan forum and with whose idea i am totally in tune is just that friendship cooperation respect fostering modernization without ever losing focus on human values this means combining tradition and modernity it is the past that serves the present it is the union of culture and civilization two elements that are indispensable and that interpenetrate each otheritaly and china are fathers of two cultures the grecoroman and the eastern that we can proudly call classical and on what classicism is i would like to conclude by echoing the words of our ambassador massimo ambrosetti in his july  speech at the parallel forum dialogue on chinese and italian classical civilizations in which he defined classical as everything that has become a model and

will have the chance to see an imaginative take on a familiar favorite later this month when the strong cast of the xian acrobatic troupe brings its production of the acrobatic swan lake to the sadlers wells dance theater in londonthe production which first visited the country in  has previously been played at the royal opera house in covent garden central london and the london coliseum — the largest venue in the capitals west endit blends the beloved classical ballet with the spectacular skills of chinese acrobatics and has already been enjoyed by millions of spectators all over the world most recently at the esplanade art center in singapore and the royal opera house in muscat omannow it is londons turn again with a performance run from june  to  at sadlers wells directed by yan hongxia and choreographed by zhang yuan and liu xinshow producer zhang quan said it was a great honor to make chinese acrobatics appear in the worlds capital of performing arts once again and to help promote chinas excellent traditional culture overseasacrobatics going overseas has always been the most important part of our cultural exchanges he said so every time the team walks out of the country with professionals around the world and facetoface communication with the audience it is a kind of learning and inspirationfor some ballet purists the mixture of dance and acrobatics particularly such routines as the lead ballerina standing on her partners shoulders might seem strange but zhang quan said the combination worked well to produce something distinctive and exciting to watchthere are many art forms today that use fusion and innovation he explainedacrobatics and dance are both technical skills that can be choreographed according to the requirements of the story but also can be used to tell the story and express emotions the development of modern new circus techniques such as the ballet on the shoulders is a good example of thisthis fusion requires constant exploration and practice to create a unique artistic effect and only by skillfully combining the essence of the two art forms can we create works of real artistic value and appreciationthe dancers trusted with performing this perilous setpiece routine are male lead zhou jie and ballerina sun yina who joined the liaoning ballet theater at the age of  and three years later began training with the guangdong acrobatic troupe before making her stage debut aged i think of myself as an acrobatic ballet performer sun said acrobatics is an excellent traditional chinese culture and one of the oldest performing arts in the world while acrobatic ballet is an art form formed by chinese acrobatic artists who try to combine the romance of western ballet with the thrill of oriental acrobaticsi am privileged to be able to carry this artistic inheritance and help develop the art form on stagein their own right ballet and acrobatics are both extremely demanding so blending the two requires a special type of physical and mental strengththe combination has higher physical requirements from performers sun said and switching smoothly between the two disciplines during the performance also requires more energy and attentionshe said acrobatic ballet takes a lot of ballet movements on the ground onto the very small space of the male dancers shoulders to make them into acrobatic movements so there is greater risk for injurybut once audiences adapt to the combined art forms people from south america to southern australia have been enthusiastic and appreciativeacrobatic ballet shows artistic charm crosses national boundaries sun added audiences from all kinds of different cultural backgrounds all over the world have really enjoyed the performancesreaching global audienceoverseeing the productions third london visit in its year history jurek zhang chairman of beijing joyway culture media said he has taken many popular western shows including riverdance to audiences in china but is now genuinely excited to be taking one of chinas showcase pieces to a global audiencechina has been facing the world with an open mind to learn so theres been a lot of interest in all kinds of western cultures and thats kind of the basis of the business he explainedits like cinema in the beginning foreign blockbusters basically ruled the box office but as china develops and we become familiar with the way this business works we can also create very international marketable productions like the acrobatic swan lake so im very happy to make it my first production in londonchanges within the company personnel mean that the production has been out of the global spotlight for some time but jurek zhang said he hopes such a highprofile run as the one in london will reopen the space for this work in the world performance market and might even open a door for other chinese performance companies to take their shows to a wider audiencein recent years many excellent theater pieces have emerged in china including the journey of a legendary landscape painting wing chun which is also on at sadlers wells at the end of august dream of the red chamber and so on which are in our operation

impose retaliatory duties targeting euproduced largeengine vehicles brandy and dairy products they said additionally there is a possibility of further tariff increases on evs imported by china from the eu they said adding that any countermeasures would aim to send a clear message and urge the eu to reconsider its decision regarding chinese evsless than a month after washington announced plans to quadruple the duties for chinese evs to  percent brussels said it would also impose additional tariffs on such products ranging from  percent for byd to  percent for saic on top of the standard  percent car dutythat takes the highest overall rate to nearly  percent the ruling will take effect on july  unless beijing agrees to an effective solution to socalled subsidies that the eu claims are distorting its marketshe yadong a spokesman for the commerce ministry said on thursday at a news conference that the eus recent actions are a breach of world trade organization rules and blatant examples of trade protectionism and china will reserve the right to seek recourse through the wtomeanwhile china has urged the eu to promptly rectify its erroneous practices the spokesman said emphasizing the importance of dialogue and negotiations to effectively address trade disputes expand cooperation and achieve mutually beneficial outcomesaccording to the german think tank kiel institute while the decrease in imports could be partially mitigated by increased production within the eu it would likely result in higher prices for consumers this is because production within the eu is significantly more expensive than in china due to higher energy and material prices and labor costs are much higherin addition of all the electric cars built in china and sold across the eu last year half came from western carmakers the united states ev maker tesla accounted for  percent of all chinesemade evs imported by europe while french carmaker renaults dacia spring added an additional  percent according to a study in late march by european think tank transport and environmentall other companies producing in china that had cooperated with the commissions probe but were not sampled including renault would face an average duty of  percent while tesla could face an individually calculated duty rateoliver zipse ceo of bmw which established a production base in northeast chinas liaoning province said in a statement on wednesday that the additional tariffs imposed by the eu could hinder the development of european automotive companies and ultimately harm europes own intereststhe adoption of protectionist measures such as tariffs could trigger a cycle of retaliation leading to a breakdown of cooperative trade relations he addedliu chunsheng an associate professor at central university of finance and economics said that the increased tariffs on chineseproduced evs entering the eu are expected to translate into higher production costs and affect their pricing ultimately pointing to reduced competitiveness and market sharehowever europes plan to phase out chinese evs might not be an easy feat byd for instance has ample space to adjust pricing due to its relatively high eu premium according to a report by new yorkbased rhodium groupnonetheless the economic losses faced by chinese enterprises without justifiable cause mean that china will by no means make concessions that could compromise the interests of its companies liu addedrelevant authorities in accordance with wto rules and chinese regulations will initiate investigations to address concerns of chinese industries related to subsidies or dumping practices of eu dairy products and pork to safeguard fair market competition and protect the chinese industries legitimate rights said ministry of commerce spokesman hemeanwhile the products targeted for possible retaliatory tariffs such as euproduced largeengine vehicles and brandy might be chosen to exert pressure on sectors that could significantly affect the eus economy said xu hongcai deputy director of the china association of policy sciences economic policy committeemoreover china now imposes a  percent tariff on evs imported from the eu and has not ruled out the possibility of further increasing the tariffs should the situation escalate xu said adding that china leans more toward dialogue and negotiations with

seek dialogue and negotiations to effectively address the ongoing trade friction between the two sides a spokesperson said in a statement released on the ministrys websitethe decision which disregards factual evidence and world trade organization rules has been made despite chinas repeated strong objections and it ignores the appeals and warnings from several eu member states governments and industry sectors the spokesperson saidthe ruling also fails to recognize that chinas competitive advantage in the electric car industry is a result of fair and open competition and the decision is a violation of wto rules and a failure to acknowledge the comprehensive cooperation of chinese companies during the investigation the spokesperson addedfurthermore it is a blatant act of protectionism that will escalate trade friction and undermine fair competition under the guise of maintaining fair competition which will not only jeopardize the legitimate rights and interests of chinas electric car industry but also disrupt the global automotive supply chain the spokesperson saidthe actions taken by the european commission not only harm the interests of european consumers but also jeopardize

asked prominent international figures to reflect on their relationship with the country and to talk of the direction in which they see it goingsince the late s british historian author and broadcaster michael wood has been traveling the world sharing his passion for history and the stories of civilizations and kingdoms across the globe in a string of hugely successful serieshe has written more than  documentaries which have been shown in  countries and territories covering topics including alexander the great the conquistadors india and the life of william shakespeare but one of his most enduring fascinations both professionally and personally is with chinain  wood presented a series called the story of china and just before the novel coronavirus pandemic he made a film about the man who first inspired his love of the country the thcentury poet du futhe film du fu chinas greatest poet has now inspired a book in the footsteps of du fu recounting woods travels while making it he said it was a journey he was more than happy to retrace with viewers and readers to enlighten them about his passion for chinese culturewe know so little in general in our culture about china — its not the only knowledge gap but its a particularly obvious one and thats a real loss he said the great sinologist simon leys wrote a fantastic passage that i often come back to saying that china is the other pole of the human mind — until you know something about china your knowledge of humanity is skewed — you wont be able to tell me what are our universal values and what are just western idiosyncrasiesfor wood his portal to a lifelong love of things chinese was a paperback bookin s manchester china seemed distant and exotic but my first serious encounter with chinese culture was the new penguin translation of poems of the late tang by arthur graham it was a brilliant book i was captivated by it he saidlater when he was doing his postgraduate studies at the university of oxford wood shared a house with a sinologist who used to put books his way which gave him a wider conversance with chinese literatureonce wood talked to a house guest and asked him what he did it turned out he was david hawkes who had been a professor of chinese at oxford but gave it up to translate what he called the novel of the millennium — the dream of the red chamber by cao xueqinhed also produced a book called a little primer of du fu which contained about  poems that you first saw in chinese then in transliteration then literal translation then a literary one with an analysis of each which was amazingwe all have encounters with books that open a window onto a world you never dreamed of and that was one for me i used to carry it around on foreign trips and later i gave copies to other friends it was a book i treasuredvital translationwoods passion for chinese poetry does not stretch as far as being able to speak or read the language but now more than ever he said translators are essentialof course translation is an approximation of language — most of us receive foreign literature through translation so it is vital and a central aspect to dialogue between cultures he said translation is not only completely justifiable but its essential if you look at the times we live in and the difficulties we have in the world one of the biggest is the difficulty of understanding other culturestheres a terrible danger with chinese literature and culture that we think its inaccessible to all but experts because of the script and the language barrier we need dialogue which comes through translation so im a firm believer in translations in the same way a filmmaker should make popularizing films to help make one culture accessible to anotherin his du fu documentary wood said for the chinese people poets have been the ones who most truly express the feelings of the peoplechina has the longest tradition of poetic writing in the world with a timeline dating back before ancient greek writers like homer and wood said that it is this continuity and reverence that has helped keep the works of du fu written  years ago so relevant and so admired in the st centuryall literate and educated chinese people have a deep sense of the importance of that poetic tradition and also a deep sense that historically the poets are the truth speakers to power — they frame the great issues of the day for the ordinary people he said du fu curated his own work carefully virtually nothing survives from before he was in his s so you get the feeling that the works we have are what he would have wanted us to readthe majority of his work is from the period after the an lushan rebellion  which caused devastation when he was forced to take to the road with his familythe eightyear turmoil during the tang dynasty  saw millions of people displaced or killed and one of du fus own children starved to death in an experience that wood thinks left an imprint on his later works that these days would be called posttraumatic stresshes not the only poet to live through catastrophes and write about them but hes the first to become the voice of his time he said he talks about surviving natural disaster and war and what its like to be a refugee he was writing about the sort of scenes we still see all around the world in the modern day because hed lived them himself he took the part of the ordinary people thats a huge part of his storyhonoring the memoryin the film wood visits the thatched cottage museum on the outskirts of chengdu sichuan province where devotees honor the memory of du fu and he speaks to many people to find out what it is about du fus work that still has such an emotional pulllots of people go there and talking to them you get a sense of how traditional chinese people still value him hugely they all say there are a great many qualities to his poetry but his great strength is that its with the ordinary people that he really endureswoods films have been screened in china where he said audiences were intrigued and very receptive to see his outsiders view of their own culture and historyim trying to extend knowledge of china in a sympathetic way so when we sat down to start planning the story of china i said to the team that the key thing was that there should be empathy — i wanted viewers all over the world to think that they would like to be there with us thats the most important thing everything else will just follow he saidwhen it was shown in china people were really happy that they were being shown so honestly because theyre so used to chinabashingi did a series of films for the th anniversary of the openingup and managed to get some incredible interviews with people who had lived through it in the first  hours on the tencent website just the promo for that series got  million hits people really warmed to the fact that we were formally addressing what happened as a great event in world historythe du fu film was a coproduction with chinese broadcaster cctv and wood admitted it must have been slightly weird to have a westerner telling you the story of your greatest poet but once again the response was appreciativewe made comparisons that wouldnt have occurred to them like with the world war i poets writing about the shattering of western ideals and values in war which was a new angle for the chinese audience and they really liked it he saidsometimes with some of the comparisons i had to check with people that i wasnt stretching them too far but no they understood that the films were made in a spirit of loving chinese culture and empathy for the chinese peoplefuture dreamsthere was also one unexpected bonus reaction to the sight and sound of acclaimed english actor ian mckellen reading du fus poemswe were slightly worried about whether it was appropriate having an english person reading a great chinese poet but not only did viewers think he was great they also thought he looked just right for du fu he saidthe book of woods prepandemic du fu journey has only been written in retrospect and he said had he planned it at the time he would have kept a more detailed diary rather than just travel notes but he still has many chinarelated projects he would like to explore furtherfrom a british point of view id love to do something about lord macartney opening the first british embassy in china in  its such an incredible meeting of civilizations with so much mutual misunderstanding out of which so many things that have shaped our modern world sprung it would be fascinating he saidwood added that the story of china series only briefly touched on the th century so he would also love to do something about the history of modern chinaive done literary festivals where ive spoken about du fu to rooms full of people who had never heard of him before which is a great pleasure and its the same with filmmaking its a privilege to be invited in to do any kind of filming in any foreign culture but theres always a special intrigue to filming about chinajulianmailchinadailyukcomtraveling pioneering path laid by silk road steel caravan records major milestonethe chinaeurope

bringing their efforts and expertise together to develop business education said alisia nikitina director general of the rec export schoolon april   whilst in guangzhou in guangdong province during his visit to china french president emmanuel macron shared tea with his host chinese president xi jinping the sharing of tea between the two world leaders was a symbol of the exchanges between civilizations and the values of harmony respect and friendship that this social ritual implies this seemingly simple act of sharing tea is something that takes place millions of times every day throughout the world tea after all is the worlds most popular beverage after water tea also originated in china and is one of its most significant contributions to human civilization the tea and context of the setting where the two leaders took their refreshment also celebrated chinese civilization through music art and aesthetics thus rather than a clash of civilizations the act of sharing tea can pave the way for a confluence of civilizationsit doesnt matter if we are state leaders or ordinary folk when we share tea we are opening ourselves up to the possibility of meaningful dialogue and exchange this civility is indeed one of the hallmarks of civilizationthe global civilization initiative was proposed by president xi in march  through this initiative and the related global development initiative and global security initiative china is outlining a plan for harmony and cooperation between civilizations the global civilization initiative advocates respect for the diversity of civilizations the common values of humanity the importance of inheritance and innovation of civilizations and robust international peopletopeople exchanges and cooperationtea is a part of the story of exchanges between civilizations may  is marked by the united nations as international tea day this is a day set aside to celebrate the tea plant — camellia sinensis — and the people whose livelihoods depend upon it and for everyone else who enjoys this most intoxicating elixir it is therefore very appropriate that we take some time to consider the relationship between tea and civilizationwith regards to art literature and philosophy tea has been a major inspiration for many artists in china and beyond lu yu a chinese writer and tea master completed the classic of tea during the tang dynasty  lu yus work is considered one of the earliest guides to tea cultivation preparation and appreciation in chinese history the classic of tea is the beginning of what we might call a specific tea civilizationlater this body of work and the refined practice of tea drinking became the famous tea ceremony or chanoyu of japan tea also provided the fuel for creativity of many a great intellect beyond china for example samuel johnson  is an english writer best known for his influential literary works and his role in compiling one of the most comprehensive dictionaries of the english language it is well known that johnson was a ravenous imbiber of tea johnsons fondness for tea is evident in his writings where he sometimes humorously remarked on the pleasures of tea drinking and the social atmosphere it fostered the german philosopher immanuel kant  is widely considered one of the most important figures in modern philosophy he also made important contributions to what would become international relations theory his breakfast is recorded as consisting of a cup of tea and a pipe of tobacco as a mild stimulant and refreshing beverage tea has played a positive role in shaping civilizational development and facilitating the exchanges between civilizationstea and humanity are also entangled in what we can refer to as an ecological civilization the concept of ecological civilization also a crucial component of the global civilization initiative reflects chinas commitment to achieving sustainable development while preserving environmental quality and ensuring the wellbeing of present and future generations in china and beyond in this regard the world heritage listed tea gardens of jingmaishan in southwest chinas yunnan province represent valuable contributions to tea civilization part of the value of these groves of ancient tea trees lies in the lessons they can share with the tea industry as it seeks ways to encourage resilient and sustainable tea cultivation practices that will help mitigate the challenge of climate change these tea gardens represent a form of sustainable tea agroforestry that is the embodiment of the chinese civilizational ideals of harmony between nature and humanity tian ren he yithus no matter how we define civilization either as the development of sophisticated knowledge technology art and literature or more inclusively as those knowledge and practices that contribute to a sensitive and sustainable relationship between humanity and nature we can see that tea has played a significant role the global civilization initiative advocates for the equal respect of all human civilizations tea as a form of ritualized shared experience is an excellent way for us to find the time to celebrate what we have in common and what makes us distinct this is in my view precisely what president xi and president macron experienced when they took tea in guangzhou in april as we celebrate international tea day in  lets take the time express our gratitude for the tea plant and all those who work tirelessly to bring us the daily beverage that is the hallmark of a tea civilization tea means peace and harmony between humanity and nature and between the diversity of human civilizations and cultures think about that when you next hold your cup of tea think about the breadth of human experience through tea

parliamentzhou baoyu still remembers the first time she was captivated by the melodic vocal performances of choral singing when the big loudspeaker of the broadcast station in her village played in the field of hope a joyful song composed by th century chinese songwriter shi guangnanas someone who was born and brought up in a small village in anhua county hunan province zhou had never heard choral singing before and was intriguedin  she left her native village and went to high school in the town where she saw a piano for the first time on hearing zhous beautiful voice one day her music teacher encouraged her to overcome her natural shyness and become the lead vocalist of the schools choirthat planted the seed of music in zhous heart and she went on to become a music teacher in a primary school in anhua in she founded a choir in the school which however was put on pause in  as she recalls though the children loved choral singing the level and method of teaching choral singing were not up to the mark in the small villagein  zhou was able to relaunch the choir in the school thanks to edit lanczky a music teacher associated with the beijing hungarian cultural institute who came to the school along with her hungarian colleagues not only to teach the children how to sing but also to train the local music teachers to make choral singing a part of the schools music education programsthe technique that lanczky used to teach choral singing is known as the kodaly method a pioneering music education approach based on the work of hungarian composer zoltan kodaly the method which embraces the key principle of learning by singing with the human voice as the fundamental instrument was inscribed on unescos list of intangible cultural heritage in  it also involves hand signs rhythmic proficiency creative collaborations and cultural connectionsaccording to lanczky in kodalys time pianos were not commonly available to hungarian families consequently the style of singing without instrumental accompaniment known as a cappella was utilized many ancient hungarian ballads were passed down through generations unaccompanied by musicfor children the vocalized sound is natural but using musical instruments isnt she told china daily during an interview in  thats why the kodaly method isnt restricted by spaces and conditionszhou the anhua music teacher said that for children in rural areas it is a luxury to learn music as musical instruments are expensive and the level of music education is not as high as that of big citiessinging is the simplest and most direct way for children to learn and enjoy music she said adding that lanczky and her colleagues used several engaging techniques such as roleplaying games to make learning music fun for the studentsfor local music teachers like me we learned from them how to train the children to sing in a choir using hand signs said zhou chen chenxi a music teacher from hunans anren county also received training in the kodaly methodchildren make friends when they sing in choirs they do rehearsals every week it inspires them to do better in other classes said chen  who was introduced to choral singing in university and fell in love with the art formthe hungarian music teachers led by lanczky were invited to china by the beijing deqing foundation a charity devoted to improving education in the countrys rural areasnearly  chinese music teachers and students attended the classes held by lanczky and her colleagues both online and inperson during the past five years said li kemei founder of the charity who met lanczky in  and initiated the idea of inviting her and the others to offer music lessons to chinese teachers and children in rural areaswe believe that music should be accessible to

further strengthened the two giants advantages in the offshore wind market and has also increased the potential for exploring other markets outside chinazhu said that offshore wind development plays a crucial role in chinas energy transition as it has the advantages of higher resource availability and higher generation efficiency and remains closer to the coastal area power demand centers compared to largescale onshore wind and solar projects offshore wind projects also have the potential to reduce carbon emissions for other oceanic operations such as providing green power for offshore oil and

their s and s and i feel hopeful that they are passing japanchina relations on to the next generation ogawa saida memorial service was held in tokyo on sunday marking the st anniversary of chinese victims who were killed following the  great kanto earthquake in japanduring that tragic event over  years ago more than  chinese people in japan survived the earthquake only to meet their deaths in a bloody massacre perpetrated by the japanese military police and militaristic thugs some extremists influenced by militaristic ideology and strong xenophobic sentiments deliberately fabricated excuses to carry out a massacre of innocent chinese peopleover the past  years family members of the victims have been working tirelessly between china and japan to seek justice they have organized and participated in more than  meetings and attended more than  memorial services at the massacre sites in japan they have repeatedly submitted petitions and demands to the japanese government to express their strong determination and deep dissatisfactionwe the families persist because we have yet to receive a clear apology and this matter remains unresolved said zhou songquan a representative of the families of chinese victimson behalf of the victims families zhou extended their gratitude to the conscientious japanese people from all walks of life who have spent years dedicating tremendous efforts to comfort the souls of the victims and are committed to uncovering the truth and pursuing justiceby holding such memorial events we hope to revisit that period of history and help more people understand and recognize the truth of the tragedy our purpose is not to perpetuate hatred but to prevent the recurrence of such tragedies and to better create the future said zhouwe hope that the japanese government can truly take up its political and moral responsibilities seriously address and properly handle the relevant historical issues and demonstrate its commitment to reflecting on history through concrete actions he saidliu sipan counselor of the political division at the chinese embassy in japan noted that the immediate cause of the massacre was the malicious spread of rumors and the incitement of social panic but the root cause lay in japans path towards militarism at the time where extreme nationalism xenophobia and antiforeign sentiments prevailedthis also set the stage for japans subsequent aggressive wars of invasion which inflicted immense suffering on china and other asian countries she addedit is regrettable that more than  years later this tragic memory is fading in japanese society the japanese governments stance on historical issues has regressed and there are negative trends in japan where the denial distortion and beautification of its history of aggression occasionally occur said liuchinese scholars visiting tokyo shared their views on the current state and future trajectory of chinas economy refuting claims from some countries that chinas economy has peaked and is facing overcapacityduring a lecture held by the chinese embassy in japan on wednesday chen weidong director of the research institute of bank of china told the audience that based on the current situation there is still significant growth potential in chinas real estate marketcurrently the per capita housing area in china is  square meters as urbanization progresses and the average housing area per person expands combined with the rigid housing demand from college graduates each year it is estimated that china will need around  billion square meters of new housing annually until  chen saidoverall chinas real estate market is seeking a new balance between supply and demand aiming to maintain stable demand while ensuring housing prices do not experience significant adjustments he addedon the issue of local government debt chen pointed out that by the end of  the debt ratio of chinas local governments was  percent including about  trillion yuan  trillion in debt from local government financing vehicles the overall debt ratio of local governments was approximately  percentthe chinese central governments solution is to set clear debt limits for local governments and implement special policy measures such as refinancing bond issuance and shortterm interest rate cuts achieving debt swaps optimize the debt maturity structure and reduce interest burdens he saidits important to emphasize that a large amount of local government debt in china has been invested in highquality assets such as infrastructure and emerging industries therefore both local and central governments have substantial asset bases to support this debt he saidaccording to a report by the institute of finance and banking at the chinese academy of social sciences local governments have a large asset scale to cover their debt burdenadditionally local governments have various measures to advance debt resolution therefore chinese government debt will not pose a systemic risk chen saidregarding remarks on chinas socalled industrial overcapacity chen said capacity utilization should be viewed in a global market context rather than limited to a single countryglobally in  the capacity utilization rates were approximately  percent for the united states  percent for the european union  percent for canada  percent for india and about  percent for china over the long term chinas capacity utilization has remained at a stable and reasonable level he saidsome countries claimed that chinas new energy vehicle industry is facing socalled overcapacity tu xinquan dean of the china institute for wto studies at the university of international business and economics said from the perspective of the global green transition nevs are still in their early stages and there is significant market potentialcurrently the global nev fleet is around  million vehicles with  million of these in china however the total number of vehicles worldwide is  billion the share of nevs is very small even converting only half of the existing gasoline vehicles to nevs could take many years tu saidthe global penetration rate of nevs meaning the proportion of nevs in new car sales is only  percent indicating significant growth potential he addedthe rapid development of chinas nev industry in recent years has raised some concerns which essentially boil down to discomfort with new competition this is understandable but its important to view the development of this emerging industry with a longterm perspective as it presents numerous possibilities tu saidhe noted that although chinese nev companies do have a relatively good firstmover advantage having a firstmover advantage does not mean they will always lead nor does it mean that latecomers will never have a chancethus some countries are overreacting by adopting trade protection measures against chinas leading position in the nev field moreover from the perspective of global climate change mitigation and achieving a green transition the development of chinas nev industry should be encouraged not feared he saidsome us and eu media attribute the success of chinas nev industry solely to government support which is a very onesided view in fact chinas success in this field is due to a combination of proactive government policies and an effective market tu saidhe further explained that the government does not pick specific companies to support directly with subsidies for nevs instead subsidies are given to consumers allowing them to choose the products they prefermoreover china has significantly opened up market access in the nev field allowing many new car manufacturers to enter this sector including private and foreign companies rather than reserving market opportunities for stateowned enterprises tu saidover the past  years chinas economic growth has been heavily driven by factor inputs — capital and labor in the future chinas economy is likely to be driven more by total factor productivity or tfp growth said liu qiao dean of the guanghua school of management at peking university who believes that it is possible for china to maintain a tfp growth rate above  percentone major source of tfp growth is technological advancement and improved resource allocation efficiency chinas reindustrialization or digital transformation of industries presents significant potential for productivity improvements developing new infrastructure necessary for reindustrialization requires substantial investment which will create immense opportunities for technological change and efficiency gains liu saidanother area that can boost tfp growth is carbon neutrality to achieve the dual carbon goals it is estimated that china will need to invest nearly  trillion yuan by  he saidliu highlighted the importance of sustaining a certain level of investment rate and to invest in future key sectors such as new infrastructure and strategic emerging industriesin his opinion future key areas include technological innovation this involves creating a highlevel circulation of technology finance and industry where financial support fuels technological advancements driving industrial innovationother key areas include carbon neutrality the internet of things highend manufacturing and investment opportunities arising from the integration of rural populations into urban areasthe chinese government also has the space to further implement proactive fiscal policies with many tools at its disposal liu saidchinas national debt stands at  trillion yuan about  percent of gdp the central government has substantial room to issue national debt to address shortterm challenges over the next decade we believe there is room for chinas national debt to increase by  to  trillion yuan he saidparticipants of the liaoningjapan economic and trade cooperation seminar expressed their hope to leverage the geographical proximity and cultural affinity between chinas liaoning

iaea report should not be the shield or green light for japans discharge of nuclearcontaminated water into the ocean the spokesperson saidaccording to the ministry due to its limited mandate the un nuclear agency failed to review the justification and legitimacy of japans ocean discharge plan assess the longterm effectiveness of japans purification facility and corroborate the authenticity and accuracy of japans nuclearcontaminated water datatherefore the conclusion is largely limited and incomplete the spokesperson saidthe spokesperson added china has noted iaea chief rafael mariano grossi

says it will not change the fact japan will release millions of tons of nuclearcontaminated water into the pacific ocean in the next three decades the spokesperson saidthe iaeas report the ministry alleged failed to answer questions concerning the longterm effectiveness of japans purification facility and the international communitys right to be informed when the discharged water exceeds the discharge limitwe once again urge the japanese side to stop its ocean discharge plan and earnestly dispose of the nuclearcontaminated water in a sciencebased safe and transparent manner the

cruel suppression of the us and the pain of that experience is still felt so it should not become an accomplice of the us said wu adding that the cooperation between china and japan should be open and fair and not hindered by limitations or the decoupling mentalitylost three decadesin the s us export restraints on japanese motor vehicle and semiconductor exports dealt a heavy blow to japans major

japan from jan  to  to review the countrys plan to pipe nuclearcontaminated water from the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station into the pacific ocean and a report will be published within three months however the japanese government unilaterally announced on jan  that it would discharge the nuclearcontaminated water into the ocean in the spring or summer this yearin response to a related query foreign ministry spokesperson mao ning told a daily news briefing that china is paying close attention to japans disposal of the nuclearcontaminated water and supports the iaea and its technical task force in conducting the review and evaluation of this issuewe hope that the technical task force will uphold the principles of objectivity fairness and science implement the agencys nuclear safety standards strictly and ensure the absolute safety of the disposal of the nuclearcontaminated water we look forward to the review report from the technical task force and will study it carefully

sufficient scientific or factual basis for this and has not resolved the international communitys concerns about the legitimacy of its nuclearcontaminated water discharge plan the reliability of its data the effectiveness of its purification devices and the uncertainty of the potential environmental impact mao stressedchina has noted with concern that the japanese side officially approved the

japan unilaterally announced that it would discharge the nuclearcontaminated water into the ocean during the spring or summer this year mao saidsuch reckless behavior raises questions about whether japan values the authority of the iaea and its technical task force is japan determined to proceed with its unilateral discharge plan regardless of the outcome of the assessment it is necessary for japan to give responsible answers to these questions she saidchina once again urges japan to respond to the legitimate concerns of all relevant parties dispose of the nuclearcontaminated water in a

strategic challenge other aggressive contents including japans counterstrike capability increased military expenditure and the taiwan question were also included in the documentsresponding to a

filled with prejudices deliberately hype up the socalled china threat and smear chinas national defense the chinese armed forces and their normal activitiessuch acts have gravely interfered in chinas internal affairs and created tension in the region we strongly oppose them the spokesman saidhe said it is japan that continues to marginalize its pacifistic constitution and defense policies that renounce the right to declare war with the excuse of foreign threats japan has extensively raised defense spending increased the investment in military technologies such as hypersonic weapon systems deepened military cooperation with the united states sought socalled counterstrike capability trumpeted the sharing of nuclear weapons with the us and colluded with other countries to establish exclusive circles with these facts japan has become a real challenge to the peace security and stability in the region according to the spokesmantan urged japan to keep itself away from the taiwan question always remember its history as an invader reflect on its past crimes honor its commitment and be discreet about its words and deedswe demand that japan should learn carefully from its history

embassy told china dailyon friday the japanese cabinet approved three documents namely the national security strategy the national defense program guidelines and the midterm defense program overturning six decades of its pacifist postwar defense strategy and aiming to arm itself with one of the worlds largest military budgetsaccording to the documents japan will not only acquire counterstrike capabilities a significant departure from its pacifist constitution but will also spend  trillion yen  billion in the next five years to strengthen its military buying cruise missiles capable of striking china and developing hypersonic weapons among others this will bring japans military expenditure to roughly  percent of its current gdp a big change from its  percent of gdp practice that japan has been maintaining for the past  yearshistorically japan has stepped into the wrong path of militarism conducted aggression and expansion and committed crimes against humanity it had brought serious disasters to our region and to the world this time japan has significantly changed its security policy and strengthened its military capabilities it raises doubt that japan is walking away from a peaceful development track and will inevitably invite concern and opposition of all peaceloving people the embassys spokesperson saidwe solemnly urge the japanese side to learn lessons from the past do not use the socalled china threat to cover its own military expansion and return to political consensus between china and japan that we are mutual partners and we do not pose threats to each other japan needs to avoid becoming a troublemaker and a disrupter of regional security and bilateral relationshipswang qi an east asian studies researcher at the chinese academy of

right occasion to honor the strategic vision and political courage of the older generation leaders and also the firm conviction of the two peoples to pursue peace and developmentrelations between the two countries enjoyed a honeymoon period in the s and s when japan used its expertise gained from rapid economic growth along with government loans to help china develop its infrastructure and pursue industrial projectsthe baoshan steel plant in shanghai and similar projects became symbols of this cooperation marked by winwin outcomes in the way they promoted the flow of talent skills and technology from japan while laying the foundation for japans huge presence in chinas industrial and consumer marketsthe two countries managed to maintain somewhat good political relations in the s but they began to sour in the s when japans thenprime minister junichiro koizumi repeatedly visited the notorious yasukuni shrine where  classa war criminals are honored in japanthe shrine is regarded as a symbol of japans past atrocities and militarism worldwide and its yushukan a war museum inside the shrine espouses japans rightwing narrative of its militaristic pastthe ties then entered a downward spiral a decade ago following japans unilateral change of its policy and the status quo concerning chinas diaoyu islands by illegally nationalizing them in the trade conflict initiated against china by us president donald trump in  saw a further erosion of the chinajapan relationship in line with the us actions japan heavily politicized economic activities between it and china including effectively banning communications equipment from chinas huawei technologies and zte imposed that yearthe administration of us president joe biden is also focused on using economic security as a political weapon and is urging its allies to join in with such efforts against china tokyo which has been caught up in the rivalry has appeared more enthusiastic than ever to align itself with the us in terms of regional geopolitical and economic confrontation at the expense of its economic ties with chinajapanese prime minister fumio kishidas government has been aggressively promoting the socalled economic security concept with the japanese parliament in may passing an economic security bill aimed at guarding technology and reinforcing critical supply chains said wang qi a researcher of east asian studies at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing such actions have led many to believe that the japanese government is using economic security as an excuse to shut out china wang saidhowever despite efforts by some japanese policymakers to bring about what amounts to an economic decoupling with china a gap is apparent between the rhetoric of these policymakers and how companies are going about their business in china in spite of the noise in some quarters economic ties between the neighbors remain robust — arguably stronger than evertrading partnerschina is japans biggest trading partner with the total value of trade having grown by  times since  to  billion last yearthe economic interdependence between the two countries showed its resilience during the test posed by covid with chinas share of japans overall trade recording alltime highs in both total trade and imports in  it was also in  that china surpassed the us as the no  importer of japanese goods in the first half of  japans imports from china increased by  percent marking a record high for a halfyear increaseunder the decoupling mindset the government in tokyo offered to pay japanese companies to shift production back home or into southeast asia but a survey conducted by the japan external trade organization last year covering  japanese firms chinese branches and companies showed that only  percent of them were planning to shrink their chinese operations or withdraw from the country in the next one or two years — the lowest figure since another survey conducted by the sankei shimbun newspaper in july found that out of  japanese firms more than half answered that business with china should remain as it is or continue to develop in the same survey not even one company answered that a significant distance between china and japan is neededboth japan and china know well that cooperation benefits both while confrontation serves neither and the development and revitalization of asia bear closely on the future of china and japan said wang from the cass but she also points out that some japanese lawmakers give priority to politics and ideology with that approach it remains to be seen whether the economic aspects of the bilateral relationship can transcend the current political frictions or will be damaged by shortsighted political agendascommenting

separated by only a narrow strip of water established a stable relationshiptoday too many people seem to have forgotten the importance of a stable japanchina relationship wrote hatoyama warning that the japanese government should make it clear both in words and action that it will adhere to the onechina principleit should also send a message to the united states and taiwan voicing its strongest

anniversary of the normalization of sinojapanese relations an opportunity for the two countries to revisit history and usher in a better futurepeople on both sides are calling for staying true to and reaffirming the original aspiration of chinajapan tiesin retrospect the tortuous journey that china and japan traversed to normalize bilateral ties was in the first place a demonstration of the great political courage and sense of historical responsibilities of leaders of the two countries in the s against the background of the cold war between the united states and the soviet union the normalization of sinojapanese ties brought the hostility between the two neighbors to an end and made contributions to preserving peace in asia it also paved the way for china to initiate its reform and openingup policy and to promote its modernization drive in later yearsback then given the sufferings of the chinese people in the war of resistance against japanese aggression  for which japan owes a debt of blood to china and the complex global political landscape and japans domestic political situation it undoubtedly required enormous political courage and wisdom to overcome all the obstacles standing in the way of normalizing chinajapan relations a mission that leaders of the two countries with their broad and farsighted vision and strong sense of historical responsibility successfully fulfilledcompared with the establishment of diplomatic relations between china and the united states or those between the soviet union and japan the normalization of sinojapanese ties was realized in a different manner it was a twostep process in which the two governments first issued a joint declaration before they signed the treaty of peace and friendship between china and japan which was approved by their respective legislatures the special arrangement reflected the complexity of the situation at that timeto follow the general principle of promoting peaceful cooperation and steer the bilateral relations on the right track china and japan have signed four political documents over the past half a century the chinajapan joint statement inked in  which marked the normalization of the bilateral ties the treaty of peace and friendship between china and japan in  the chinajapan joint declaration of and a joint statement signed in  on advancing strategic and mutually beneficial relations in a comprehensive waythe four political documents constitute the cornerstone of the development of sinojapanese ties china has urged japan to honor the promises made on issues concerning chinas core interests or sensitive areas such as the taiwan question and historical issuesover the past half a century the twoway exchanges between china and japan have expanded constantly which has benefited both countries and their peoples their economies are complementary in nature and the two countries have pursued winwin cooperation bilateral trade has surged from less than  billion in  to  billion in  benefiting not only the two countries but also the development of asia and the whole worldchina and japan should now seek to consolidate and expand their common ground they should shelve their differences and properly deal with their contradictions and divergenceschina and japan have different national conditions and social systems and the development of the bilateral ties is beset by disputes over maritime territories and japans historical revisionism among other issues after the cold war with the collapse of the soviet union china and japan have had frictions over issues such as japanese textbooks that whitewash its wartime acts territorial rights in the east china sea and japanese politicians visits to the controversial yasukuni shrinethese conflicts and disputes will not disappear naturally or diminish over time instead some of them might escalate or worsen in the future one such flashpoint is japans meddling in the taiwan question under such a grim situation china and japan should honor their commitments safeguard the foundation for political mutual trust and properly manage and control their differences and disputeslooking back at five decades of the development of sinojapanese ties and against the background of the complex and uncertain international landscape china and japan should shoulder their historical responsibilities and stay true to their original aspiration of pursuing peaceful and friendly cooperation the two sides should draw inspiration from the political wisdom that led to the establishing of diplomatic relations and carry forward the sense of historical responsibility demonstrated by the older generation of leaders to guide sinojapanese relations on the right trackthe two sides should safeguard the political foundation of the stable and healthy development of chinajapan ties adhere to the four political documents and practice the consensus of being partners not posing a threat to

enough to compete with the united states through advancement in industrial technologieswe are now moving to the new stage of economic and social advancement through technological innovation we have to challenge the following mattersfirst we need to deploy innovation vigorously the st century is the age of new development in innovations with ai and others at the centeri would like to propose a new definition of innovation in this age of the latest information technology revolution as the creation of new intellectual values within the economic sphere through the combination integration and utilization of information elements collected through revolutionary information technologiesrecently it was found that the aggregations of intellectual functions in cities have contributed greatly to promoting innovation such as in the cases of the silicon valley in the us zhongguancun science park in beijing and the nanshan district of shenzhen guangdong province regional and social cooperation is strongly expected to be encouragedsecond we have to cooperate for the efficient operation of the global market which needs to operate freely and rationally under fair and safe rules japan and china need to reach agreement for this purpose in cooperation with the us and the european union while taking a leading role in restoring the proper functioning of the world trade organizationuntil then it is necessary to promote and utilize regional free trade agreements such as the regional comprehensive economic partnership the comprehensive and progressive agreement for transpacific partnership and apecjapan and china need to have mutual exchanges of their experiences in such rulemaking and lead the world to realize economy of high qualitythird we need to have mutual cooperation in reforming corporate management methods the efficiencies of corporate management have been improved significantly through the advancement of information and communication technologies with work style reform evolving through digital transformation of offices corporate value which may include profit value customers value workers value and social value is increasingly expected to grow further through ai and other advanced management toolsfourth japan and china have to expand their mutual cooperation in various fields including more efficient energy consumption and transfer of pollution prevention technologies in the future japan and china need to deploy wideranging collaboration including in technological development and more important continue working for the deployment and dissemination of their technological achievements to developing countriesfifth we have to address demographic changes in society with fewer children and an aging population japan is now facing grave issues arising from its aging society such as how to secure financial resources to fulfill social security needs in providing health nursing and medical services to the elderly similar issues will likely hit china in the near future both countries need to mutually exchange their experiences and cooperate with each other in developing social welfare policies and measuresfinally japan and china can strengthen their bonds with the international community through mutual cultural exchanges it is my belief that if japan and china can cooperate in integrating industries and cultures as well as technologies and arts this will enhance mutual understanding of their cultures by improving the human sense of values thereby significantly contributing to global stability and the harmonization of human societythrough these mutual exchanges japan and china could both provide greater contributions to realizing economy of high quality and globalism with mutual trustthe author a former japanese

slaves and remove the expression forced conscription in reference to those forced to work against their willtokyos approval of the envisioned changes in textbooks came about five months after its cabinet decided that textbooks could refer to victims of wartime sexual slavery as comfort women instead of military comfort womenthe forced recruitment of comfort women was a grave crime against humanity committed by japanese militarism which is an undeniable historical fact with ironclad evidence zhao notedagain japan juggles with words to blur historical facts and downplay its guilt and responsibility as part of efforts to deny and whitewash its history of aggression he saidthis highlights japans longstanding dishonest attitude toward its history of aggression which once again hurts the feelings of the people of the victimized countries zhao saidall peaceloving people will never allow such a decision he said adding that the international community needs to challenge itwe urge japan to make a clear break with militarism and win the trust of its asian neighbors and the international community with concrete actions he addedbefore world war ii an imperial edict imbued young minds with militarism in japan now the nations leaders are at it again only this time the instrument is called a defense white paper targeting children rather than the imperial rescript on education

first glance the page report gives an explanation of issues including japans national security environment its relations with nearby countries and new battlefields such as space and cyberspace but the document hypes up tensions in a way that is likely to create a sense of threat in the minds of the young readersin one chapter on the security environment affecting japan the paper said not only are countries with the greatest military power in the world gathering but they are also strengthening their military power and activating military activities it goes on to accuse china of increasing the amount of money it spends on the military at a fast pace without giving detailed explanationsin response chinese foreign ministry spokesman zhao lijian said on friday that china firmly objects to

country urged japan to immediately delete the documentliu qingbin a professor at the institute of advanced sciences at yokohama national university said the japanese move is a completely retrogressive approach that the countrys neighbors cannot fail to link with japans brutal pastbefore world war ii the imperial rescript on education brainwashed young people into supporting territorial expansion by convincing them that they were doing it for asias own good because it is much easier to rally people like this than rally people around a mission that they believe is about killing or exploiting

with the fair distribution of any covid vaccine in order to better curb or coexist with infectious diseasesit wont work if only some developed countries with purchasing power have access to resources especially when vaccine stocks are limited she said the vaccine should be provided to people all over the world in a fair waya report by the bill  melinda gates foundation in september said it had been shown that a rush among wealthy countries to lay claim to billions of doses of prospective covid vaccines could lead to hundreds of thousands of more deaths than if the vaccines were distributed equitablyciting two scenarios from northeastern universitys laboratory for the modeling of biological and sociotechnical systems the report said  percent of covid deaths worldwide that would occur without a vaccine could be prevented by distributing a vaccine among countries proportional to their populationsby contrast allocating the first two billion doses of vaccine to the highest bidders

nuclear weapons had either country not been forced into surrender in time before these were fully developed it seems very likely that both countries would have attacked allied countries with themit

battles for japans home islandsso instead of just preaching against the use of atomic weapons clearly justified in the context of the situation at the time japanese leaders should be laying wreaths of
